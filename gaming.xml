			<p>GSC Game World has <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1854993555745362400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-long-awaited-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> has officially gone gold. This means the game is done, and a master copy has been sent for mass production (the game will be released on physical discs for Xbox, in addition to digital).</p>
<p>In theory, this means no more delays are in order, although there's a famous precedent: CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-officially-gold-night-city-opens-november-19th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to have gone gold on October 5, 2020, ahead of its planned November 19, 2020 launch date. However, on October 27, the Polish developer was forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-to-december-10th-cdpr-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> a short delay to December 10. The reasons would later become obvious, as even the delay was not enough to prevent a rough launch, especially on consoles.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 fans certainly hope this won't be the case, both regarding the delay and the rough debut. After all, this game already had to suffer through a long and tough road to get here. It's been over fifteen years since the last franchise entry, 2009's S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat. The first attempt at a proper STALKER 2 project was immediately started by GSC Game World, which <a href="http://wccftech.com/stalker-2-set-release-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the game in August 2010 for a tentative 2012 release window.</p>
<p>However, the Ukrainian studio was dissolved in December 2011, inevitably leading to the cancellation of that project. Luckily, that wasn't the end of the story. Evgeniy Grygorovych, brother of GSC Game World's original founder Sergiy Grygorovych, successfully resurrected the studio in late 2014. After making the real-time strategy game Cossacks 3, GSC Game World returned to what it really wanted to do: make STALKER 2. The new announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-in-development-targeting-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came</a> in May 2018 with a targeted release window of 2021.</p>
<p>As time passed, the release was <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-debut-gameplay-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved</a> to April 2022 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-delayed-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again</a> to December 2022. But the disruption caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine forced work on the game to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-development-sidelined-ukranian-russia-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop</a> altogether for some time. GSC Game World subsequently went silent for a long while, and fans couldn't help but wonder whether their long-awaited sequel would ever materialize.</p>
<p>Finally, a playable demo was brought to Gamescom 2023, and the developers used it to gather feedback and further improve STALKER 2. In early 2024, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-delay-final-release-date-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the game would launch on September 9, though we later discovered one final delay to the current date: November 20, when the game will be available on PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

There are plenty of criticisms to levy at the fourth entry to BioWare’s fantasy RPG series, such as its lack of choice continuity from previous games and Whedon-esque quips sprinkled through its dialogue. And if you’re a CRPG diehard, you’re probably not too thrilled by it pivoting hard into an action RPG. But most of the time, these criticisms are buried under (or wielded by) people who are being pretty blatant that their real issue is that <em>The Veilguard </em>features queer characters who are actively presenting as such. To which, I have to ask, have you played a <em>Dragon Age</em> game?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-at-war-with-itself<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a line in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a> that has stuck with me throughout my own playthrough: “It’s hilarious that no one ever says the word ‘Veilguard’ out loud across the 100 hours I played of this dialogue-packed campaign, exposing a last-minute marketing pivot for what it was.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’m nowhere near the 100-hour mark myself, that line is so far proving true – not a single character has mentioned The Veilguard. My team of D&amp;D archetype oddballs may collectively be known as such in all the marketing, online articles, and the physical box itself, but within the world of Thedas they’re none the wiser. Imagine Tony Stark and Steve Rogers having no idea the world called them Avengers… that’s how odd it is.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A name that Rook, Varric, Harding, and the rest of the gang definitely do know, though, is Dread Wolf – the mythical moniker of former Dragon Age companion, Solas, as well as the original subtitle for this fourth entry in BioWare’s fantasy series. While ultimately it really doesn’t matter what this game is called, the more I play The Veilguard, the more it feels like it’s awkwardly in conflict with itself, torn into pieces that reflect two very different intentions – one a sequel to a decade-old RPG, the other a fresh beginning with no ties to what came before.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/dragon-age-the-veilguard-solas-1731076298077.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Dread Wolf is less dreadful than Inquisition's DLC promised.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Many aspects of The Veilguard point to it being something of a soft reset or even spin-off from the main Dragon Age series. Set in the northern Tevinter region, it leaves behind the saga’s original southern home of Ferelden, along with all its characters and politics. Dragon Age has always started afresh with each new game as, unlike Mass Effect, there’s no persistent protagonist across the series as each instalment tells a brand new story. The shift to Tevinter is perfectly in keeping with Dragon Age’s history, then, but The Veilguard isn’t a typical Dragon Age game. It is its first direct sequel – a continuation of Dragon Age: Inquisition, which dedicated its post-credits and Trespasser DLC to setting up Solas as the villainous Dread Wolf. And this is where it all starts to feel a little messy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of The Veilguard is dedicated to Solas. Its opening sees him performing a dangerous god-unleashing ritual, and the world is littered with quests that explore his history and relationship with those dark deities. There may be no mention of the word “Veilguard” anywhere, but everyone is talking about the Dread Wolf. Why isn’t that the name of the game again? </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rather than take his place as the villain Trespasser promised, Solas is usurped by a much more newcomer-friendly option</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Solas may take up considerable space, the Dread Wolf has weirdly been relegated to the position of fantasy Hannibal Lecter, trapped in dreams where he appears only to offer advice. Rather than take his place as the villain Trespasser promised, he’s usurped by other dark elven gods who don’t demand any significant prior knowledge – a much more newcomer-friendly option. I’m left with the impression of an antagonist who was robbed of his big bad status somewhere along The Veilguard’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">infamously rocky development journey</a>. As our review says, you can “practically smell the rewrites.” But despite his shift from villain to condescending informant, the story is still dedicated to him in a manner that never feels like a true fit for a game that elsewhere is so clearly attempting to be a fresh start rather than a direct sequel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’d rather we got a more clear-cut successor to Inquisition, I think the game we’ve ended up with would be better for cutting Solas loose entirely. Sure, the lack of answers to one of the greatest twists in RPG history would be frustrating, but Solas’ fate feels divorced from the story that established him. That’s because none of the world-altering choices you made across the Dragon Age series are reflected in The Veilguard. Unlike its predecessors, there’s no way to import or recreate your save games and world state aside from three basic and largely interchangeable decisions made in Inquisition’s Trespasser DLC. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/dragon-age-the-veilguard-rook-davrin-1731076322739.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Veilguard are unaffected by the many decisions you made across the Dragon Age series.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it">Speaking to IGN earlier this year</a>, creative director John Epler told us “among many reasons why we moved to Northern Thedas is it becomes a little bit more of a clean slate for us. There's not as many decisions you have made up to this point that have an impact on what's happening in Northern Thedas. And we don't have to speak directly to things like who is the Divine? Because again, that's happening in the South.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the South is where we made our home and our ties to this world, and so this move means that the Thedas that we helped influence and shape across dozens of hours is not the same Thedas that’s currently at stake. With The Veilguard’s elven gods representing not just the greatest apocalyptic threat Thedas has ever faced, but also the culmination of the Inquisition storyline, then surely it's more important than ever that the stakes are our own, personal version of this world? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do sympathise with BioWare – Dragon Age wasn’t developed as a trilogy in the same way as Mass Effect, and so the choices have been on very different scales that must be incredibly difficult to implement into successive games. But those choices being wiped entirely results in something that feels like an opening trying to be a finale. It’s a situation only further strained by the fact that The Veilguard’s version of Thedas is so tonally different from the one established in the previous Dragon Age games. Its grand Necropolis and floating Minrathous fortress feel divorced from the earthier lands of Inquisition and a far cry from the darker regions in which this saga began. Veilguard is a whole new world untouched by players and that clashes with its insistence on continuing Solas’ story in a roundabout way. If BioWare really needed to leave our choices behind, or if it really needed to start afresh for a new era, then going the Mass Effect: Andromeda route of an entirely new story, characters, and setting would have been the cleaner choice. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Veilguard crew all appear to be likeable people, but it feels as if I’m being blocked from forging true bonds with them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And so we come back to that history-avoiding title. When Dragon Age: Dreadwolf became Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare’s general manager Gary McKay explained <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">the new name was chosen to reflect the “really deep and compelling group of companions.”</a> It’s an unsurprising shift, moving away from Solas’ decade-old story that perhaps too few players will actually care about in favour of a direction clearly inspired by the phenomenon that is Baldur’s Gate 3’s beloved party. But, frustratingly, I don’t think The Veilguard does the intention of its new title justice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the first 15 or so hours, during which you put together a god-killing team Mass Effect 2-style, there’s rarely the option to have a proper back-and-forth conversation. There’s a tendency to favour cutscenes or pre-scripted chat over traditional RPG dialogue choices, resulting in the feeling that characters are talking <em>at</em> you rather than <em>with </em>you. Very few party members can be spoken to at length following their initial recruitment, and this lack of introductory getting-to-know-you feels antithetical to a design that expects you to quickly forge bonds and trust with your team. As time goes by there are more opportunities to direct the flow of conversation yourself, but they frequently lack the multi-tier dialogue trees that really allow you to delve deep. It was only after unlocking the dragon-hunting Taash that I was presented with a conversation in which I was able to cycle through multiple tiers of responses at every stage of the dialogue. It was the first satisfying conversation I’d had in 17 hours of play, and I’m baffled as to why I hadn’t had the same experience with every other character I’d met. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Veilguard crew all appear to be likeable people, but it feels as if I’m being blocked from forging true bonds with them. That especially goes for Varric. What is arguably Dragon Age’s best-ever character has been imprisoned in his bedroom, consigned to spouting incidental dialogue that you can’t engage with. His sidelining is yet another example of The Veilguard’s uneasy relationship with its predecessor, but unfortunately the frustrating treatment of its new cast means it’s also difficult to fully embrace the story’s fresh faces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I enter The Veilguard’s second half I have begun to appreciate its unique approaches. The knotty, secrets-filled Crossroads region is fun to explore. The action combat is really robust, particularly when enhanced by the well-considered skill tree. But at every turn you can feel the toll of that long, rocky development timeline. There’s a solid God of War-style action game in here, but its sharp battles, linear-ish level design, and explosive cutscenes clash with the more traditional RPG that’s also fighting for air. Those level layouts throttle the quest design, action always takes precedence over conversation, stealth, or diplomacy, and the companions are more like NPCs than party members – Atreus over Astarion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The overall result is that Dragon Age: The Veilguard isn’t <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-doesnt-need-to-be-baldurs-gate-3-it-needs-to-be-golden-era-bioware">the golden era BioWare game that I had hoped it would be</a>. Torn between continuing its traditional role-playing legacy and starting afresh as a modern action RPG, the end result is an awkward sequel trapped in a cage made of reboot ideas. After years and years of faltered steps I understand why BioWare landed on this particular, very mainstream AAA formula, but I wish it had been inspired by the undying mass popularity of The Witcher 3 – a full-on nerdy RPG – rather than veer closer to Sony’s palatable RPG-ish approach for modern God of War. But that ill-defined shape is often what uneasy development cycles get you. Thankfully The Veilguard’s launch has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-beats-jedi-survivor-to-makes-it-eas-biggest-ever-single-player-game-on-steam">seemingly gone well for EA and BioWare</a>, which hopefully means Dragon Age will continue. Let’s just hope next time it’s not just the name that’s got a bit of Baldur’s Gate in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

As Moon Knight, he doles out righteous vengeance, locked in a never-ending battle with both the criminals on the streets and the voices in his head. In Marvel Rivals, Moon Knight wields supernatural powers bestowed by Khonshu to vanquish his foes. </p><p>When crafting Moon Knight’s in-game persona, the development team incorporated a color scheme of white and black, drawing from the rich tapestry of ancient Egyptian mythology linked with Khonshu, and added “Egyptian Faience” material to his costume design, infusing Moon Knight’s appearance with a mystical and exotic allure. Departing from the traditional form-fitting suit seen in the comics, the team integrated technological components and rugged armor motifs into the character’s design. This enhances the visual impact while aligning with the game’s aesthetic, allowing Moon Knight’s aggressive combat style to seamlessly intertwine with the gameplay. Moon Knight can summon a portal above the battlefield, connecting him to the cosmos and summoning the formidable and enigmatic arms of Khonshu, rendering his enemies defenseless.</p></blockquote><p>NetEase also officially announced Shota Nakama as the music producer and arranger for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and Masahiro Aoki as the music composer.

<p>More often than not, the management and simulation genre proves massive and complex. On PC, there are countless hotkeys to consider, and to the everyday player, it can feel overwhelming to remember every key combination necessary to quick-build or remove pathing sections. Hopefully, we can help. Here are a few of the most important hotkeys in Planet Coaster 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-important-planet-coaster-2-hotkeys-to-remember">Important Planet Coaster 2 Hotkeys To Remember</h2>



<p>I spent too long ignoring hotkeys and shortcuts in games in favor of simply clicking, and the day I started using hotkeys, I never returned. They make life easier. You can access nearly any menu or mechanic in the game without moving your hand from the keyboard. Of course, remembering every hotkey and shortcut command is initially challenging, but there’s no shame in keeping a guide like this one up on your phone or a second screen. </p>



<p>Here are a few Planet Coaster 2 hotkeys worth remembering:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>CTRL + Z</strong> — Undo</li>



<li><strong>CTRL + Y</strong> — Redo</li>



<li><strong>L</strong> — Light</li>



<li><strong>ALT</strong> — Radial Menu</li>



<li><strong>Right CTRL + Right SHIFT + G</strong> — Hide UI</li>



<li><strong>Z</strong> — Rotate 90 Degrees</li>



<li><strong>Hold Z</strong> — Rotate</li>



<li><strong>X</strong> — Advanced Move</li>



<li><strong>M</strong> — Move</li>



<li><strong>F</strong> — Snap Object to Wall Center</li>



<li><strong>P</strong> — Toggle Angle Snap</li>



<li><strong>CTRL + D</strong> — Duplicate Object</li>



<li><strong>R</strong> — Edit Building</li>



<li><strong>I</strong> — Multi Select</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there are many more hotkeys and shortcuts in Planet Coaster 2, and you can find all of them within the settings menu, but I find you’ll use these more frequently than any other. It’s worth keeping this guide open for quick reference.</p>

            <p>Sony says that despite the "different comments" on the PS5 Pro's chunky price point, the "pricing [...] has not had a negative impact" on sales.</p>

Sony says the growth in its game and network services division can be attributed to rising sales of its third-party games, DLC, and PlayStation Plus subscriptions.</p>
<p>131.3m games shipped in the first half of the financial year, of which 11.3m were first-party games. 1.5m of those alone come from Astro Bot, which only debuted in September.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has filed a new lawsuit against a streamer who broadcast 10 pirated games ahead of their release, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/789755286/Nintendo-vs-Keighin"> papers filed</a> on Wednesday and reported by<a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/476472/nintendo-lawsuit-pirated-games-streamed"> Polygon</a>, Nintendo has taken legal action against streamer Jesse Keighin - streaming as Every Game Guru - who allegedly played 10 unreleased Nintendo games over the last decade.</p>

<p>Nintendo further alleges that as well as broadcasting unreleased games, he also instructed others on how to obtain pirated games via "circumvention devices" Nintendo calls "trafficking".</p>
<p>When Nintendo moved to shutdown Keighin's streams via copyright notices on YouTube, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and other streaming platforms, he reportedly told them he "could do this all day" and had "a thousand burner accounts".</p>
<p>The Japanese megacorp says Keighin's conduct has cost it "millions of dollars" in "lost video game sales". It's seeking £11,600 ($15,000) for each alleged violation of its Copyright Act, £1900 ($2.5K) for each contravention of its anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking provisions in the Copyright Act, and further "actual damages" for the revenue it says it has lost, the amount of which Nintendo says it will "prove at trial".</p><p>"Streaming leaked games prior to their publication normalises and encourages prerelease piracy - Defendant is signalling to viewers that they too should acquire a pirated copy and play the game now, without waiting for its release and without paying for it," Nintendo's lawyers wrote in the filing.</p>
<p>"Prerelease piracy harms law-abiding Nintendo customers who may have been waiting for a particular game release for months or years, and then may see gameplay and spoilers online that ruin their own surprise and delight when experiencing the game."</p>
<p>"We can confirm that we filed a lawsuit against an individual who has engaged and continues to engage in clear infringement of Nintendo’s IP rights, as well as violations of our Game Content Guidelines," Nintendo told Polygon in a subsequent statement.</p>
<p>"Nintendo is passionate about protecting the creative works of game developers and publishers who expend significant time and effort to create experiences that bring smiles to all."</p>
<p>Keighin did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Nintendo is also suing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair. The monster battling and catching game had frequently been compared with Pokémon since its launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S in January,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents"> Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's lawsuit was filed</a> just weeks before<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation"> Palworld's PlayStation 5 version launched at the end of September</a>.</p><p>Yesterday,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says"> Pocketpair revealed that the lawsuit relates to three patents filed between February and July this year</a> - after Palworld's launch. However, they relate to a pre-existing "parent" patent filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in December 2021, preceding Palworld's launch, meaning they could indeed still apply to Palworld now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-polaris-first-character/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first character to be featured in The Witcher 4 Polaris, the highly anticipated next entry in the series by CD Projekt Red, has been revealed via an online actor's resume.</p>
<p>According to information discovered on Spotlight by Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KekanKok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KekanKok</a>, British actor <a href="https://app.spotlight.com/4850-0168-8030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Lampert</a> will play a character called Branko in the next entry in the series. Interestingly enough, the role is dated 2025, indicating that voiceover recording and motion capture for the character will begin next year and that the game is still pretty far from release.</p>
<p>Last we heard, The Witcher 4 Polaris was still in the preproduction phase but <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-pre-production-is-almost-over-says-cd-projekt/">close to a major milestone</a> that would mark the end of this phase and the beginning of the actual production phase. No update on the project has been provided since August, but if the game's development proceeded as intended, it must have entered the actual production phase by now, as that was the plan earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Witcher 4 Polaris will be CD Projekt Red's first game developed using Unreal Engine 5. While this was met with skepticism from the vast majority of fans, it could actually be a great thing for the gaming industry as a whole. If there's one developer that could help Epic address the stuttering issues that continue to plague all games powered by the engine, it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-issues-improvements/">CD Projekt Red.</a></p>
<p>The Witcher 4 Polaris will be released on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/09/amplitude-studios-goes-independent-and-splits-off-from-sega/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Amplitude Studios, the developer behind the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/30/endless-dungeon-review/">Endless</a> series and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/16/humankind-review-a-different-breed/">Humankind</a>, has gone independent once more, with Sega selling the studio back to members of its internal team.</p>
<p>Sega says that this “concludes the structural reforms that have been taking place in Sega’s European business”.</p>


<p>Amplitude Studios founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis <a href="https://twitter.com/Amplitude/status/1854796059119136979">made the announcement</a>:</p>
<p><em>We’re thrilled to announce that our studio is officially returning to independence!</em></p>
<p><em>Amplitude is now owned by members of the internal team, meaning that the future of our studio and games is staying in the hands of those who know them best.</em></p>

<p><em>Being part of the SEGA family and working with their team for the past eight years has been an incredible journey. We’ve learned so much, have grown in ways we never could have imagined and have made great friends along the way. As our paths now head in different directions, we’re parting ways on the best of terms and we’ll continue to cheer them on as they take on new and exciting things in the future!</em></p>
<p><em>By returning to our indie roots we’re getting back to the heart of what drives us: creativity, innovation, and close-knit collaboration with our community. These values have shaped who we are from the beginning, and will lead the way forward in this exciting next chapter.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for being with us every step of the way! Here’s to a new beginning, and to all the amazing things we’ll create together.</em></p>
<p>Sega acquired Amplitude back in 2016, the French studio having made a name for themselves within the 4X strategy realms with Endless Space and Endless Legend, and has long been a proponent of developing in tandem with its community. At the time, Sega was looking to expand its reach into PC gaming, alongside the Total War franchise at Creative Assembly and RTS gaming at Relic.</p>
<p>The last year has seen great upheaval at Sega’s European arm, though, with some disappointing game launches including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/14/ca-make-pledges-on-total-wars-future-issue-total-war-pharaoh-partial-refunds-and-lower-price/">Total War: Pharaoh</a> and Company of Heroes 3, the cancelled extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/28/sega-cancels-hyenas-and-other-unannounced-titles/">Hyenas</a>, and over the last few months, the extended development that is going to be needed for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/football-manager-25-has-now-been-delayed-to-march-2025/">Football Manager 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">Sega announced 240 job cuts</a>, hitting Creative Assembly hard as game projects were cancelled, and spinning off Relic to let them go independent. Now Amplitude is following in Relic’s footsteps.</p>
<p>This is the right way to handle things, compared to some notable studio closures that we’ve seen elsewhere in the industry. Obviously we’re not privy to the discussions and options being explored by other publishers, seeing studios like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/sony-permanently-shuts-down-concord-and-developer-firewalk-studios/">Firewalk</a> simply be shut down, or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Tango Gameworks be shut down</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">then rescued months later</a> is much worse as teams are completely dismantled and not given another chance.</p>

              <section>

                <p>Stalagmites are a somewhat new item in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft </a>that many players are still confused by. In-game, they're known as Pointed Dripstone, which comes in two different varieties. Stalagmites are Pointed Dripstone that point up, and they're a hazard in caves where they most commonly spawn. To learn more about stalagmites and what they can do in Minecraft, keep reading the guide below.</p><h2>What is Pointed Dripstone in Minecraft?</h2><p>Pointed dripstone is the name for both stalagmites and stalactites in Minecraft. Stalagmites point up from the ground while stalactites point down from the ceiling. Both spawn in dripstone caves, where they form naturally when connected to dripstone blocks. Dripstone blocks have the ability to grow pointed dripstone beneath them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374256-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.42.36.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4374256" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374256-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.42.36.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4374256"></a><figcaption>How to make a dripstone block in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374256-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.42.36.02.png"></figure><p>You can mine both pointed dripstone and dripstone blocks in the caves where they spawn. Any tool can be used to mine dripstone, but a pickaxe is the quickest way. You're also able to craft a dripstone block by combining four pointed dripstones at a crafting table. This allows you to choose where you place pointed dripstone and grow more of it.</p><h2>How to get Pointed Dripstone in Minecraft</h2><p>Now that you understand what pointed dripstone is, how can you go about finding it? Dripstone caves are located in overworld cave biomes and can be generated at any height. However, they most commonly occur away from water, so you want to mine as far inland as possible to find the caves. Essentially, you can find dripstone caves like any other cave.</p><p>Dripstone caves feature a plethora of stalagmites and stalactites, so you'll immediately know when you've found one. Pointed dripstone occurs nowhere else naturally, which means if you see a block of it, you're near or in a dripstone cave.</p><h2>What can Stalagmites do in Minecraft?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374257-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.41.17.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4374257" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374257-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.41.17.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4374257"></a><figcaption>Stalagmites point up from the ground</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374257-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.41.17.67.png"></figure><p>Regarding stalagmites specifically, they don't have a ton of use in Minecraft. However, stalagmites are one of the most dangerous blocks you can encounter. If you fall on top of one, your fall damage is doubled, which can mean death from certain distances. This also applies to mobs, so you can set up some nifty traps around your base using stalagmites if they're placed properly. This doesn't apply to mobs that are immune to fall damage.</p><p>Aside from dealing damage, stalagmites are mainly used for decoration in players' bases. When paired with a stalactite, they can look quite nice in the corner of a room or as a focal point in a basement lair.</p><h2>What can Stalactites do in Minecraft?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374258-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.41.52.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4374258" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374258-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.41.52.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4374258"></a><figcaption>Stalactites point down from a block</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4374258-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.26-14.41.52.77.png"></figure><p>If you're curious about stalactites as well, they have an additional use in Minecraft. By placing a stalactite connected to a water source over a cauldron, you have a small chance to drip water into the cauldron. This also works with lava, but the chances are much smaller. If water or lava is dripped into the cauldron, it raises the liquid level by one every time until the cauldron is full.</p><p>The water or lava source connected to the stalactite cannot be moving for this to work. The source needs to be still, but a waterlogged block works as well.</p><p>Stalactites can deal damage to you or mobs if they fall. However, this only occurs if the block connected to the stalactite breaks, so it's not as useful as dealing damage with a stalagmite. </p>

<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Treyarch’s Miles Leslie took a deep dive into the success of Black Ops 6. He was talking about the power of Game Pass and how it has allowed many ‘on-the-fence’ players to find their way into Call of Duty but mentioned that the difficulty will now rest in <strong>keeping those players </strong>on board.</p>



<p>He also mentioned that on PlayStation and Steam, sales of this year’s Call of Duty title beat last year’s by at least 60%.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 is a phenomenal success – Activision confirmed it was the biggest release in Call of Duty history just days after the game hit the market. It’s proving to be holding firm as time goes on, too – the energy in anticipation of the game’s first season is electric and palpable, and this year, the roadmap has some real potential.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of Black Ops 6</a>, I said it was the best we’ve had in years.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with the BBC</a>, Miles Leslie, a sixteen-year veteran of Treyarch, mentioned that Steam and PlayStation-based sales of Black Ops 6 have beaten those for Modern Warfare 3 by 60%. We already knew it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-biggest-launch-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a roaring success on Game Pass</a>, as it caused the most new subscriber adds ever for a new game, but it’s encouraging to see it won big figures across the board.</p>



<p>In the run-up to Black Ops 6 being released, Activision’s teams pushed out a marketing campaign like no other, which some believed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rivalled that of a major blockbuster</a>. It seemed that no matter where you turned, the Black Ops 6 branding was visible. </p>



<p>Leslie also said about the title launching on Game Pass:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we’ve seen is it’s allowed people that might have been on the fence, might have had some of that friction, might have been like, ‘I haven’t played in a while’ to actually come back and try the game. </p>



<p>Obviously there’s things that we can improve and we’ve got our finger on the pulse of the community so that we can hear those things and analyse them and really attack and fix them in the right ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GSC Game World has announced that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has finally gone gold after many years of development. The open-world survival shooter, which is one of this year’s most highly anticipated games, has been in development on and off for more than a decade, but on November 20, it’ll finally be released to the world.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>I played Stalker 2 at Gamescom and can attest to how incredible of an experience GSC has compiled for long-awaiting fans. It was an entirely different world when the last major Stalker game was released, and what we’ll be getting our hands on when November 20 comes around is leagues beyond what already exists in the series.</p>



<p>From sumptuous visuals to a remarkable combat engine, and intense survival mechanics to an open world bursting with side activities, Stalker 2 has stacks of meat on the post-apocalyptic bones.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will drop on the Game Pass subscription service the day it launches, which is a huge win for gamers everywhere. If you’d rather go above and beyond, the game has a <strong>ridiculous </strong>collector’s edition that’s probably one of the most expansive versions of a game I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p>Recently, the team also revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s PC requirements</a>, unveiling a specification that’s not all that demanding, considering it’s a top-shelf open-world game being released in late 2024.</p>



<p>Are you going to be playing Stalker 2? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re most looking forward to about the game.</p>

<p>Tony Todd, the voice of Venom in Spider-Man 2, has sadly passed away at the age of 69. The late actor’s representatives first revealed the news to Deadline, stating that he died of natural causes. It was confirmed that he passed away in his home in Los Angeles on November 6, one month before his 70th birthday.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-legendary-presence">Legendary Presence</h2>



<p>Tony Todd enjoyed a lengthy, star-studded career that included 40 years of television, film, and video games. Best known for his role in the Candyman movies, this enigmatic and versatile performer contributed to hundreds of productions over the years.</p>



<p>His spree through video games started in 1998 with a Star Trek title, and a few years later, he was voicing aliens in Half-Life 2. He’d come to play characters in Call of Duty: Black Ops II, Dota 2, and Back 4 Blood, but his most recent and impactful role was as Venom in Spider-Man 2.</p>



<p>While playing Venom, Todd revealed that he spent more time in the voiceover booth than in any previous role in his entire career. He also played fast and loose with some of the game’s juicier tidbits before launch, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-september-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teasing the release date</a> and content drops on social media, much to the amusement of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Tony Todd was a talented and spirited individual known by many as a gentle giant, and he’ll be greatly missed. Our thoughts are with those who survive him.</p>

The show infused each of its characters with a depth and complexity that felt unlike anything Riot had done <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22567914/league-of-legends-riot-games-sentinels-of-light-novel">elsewhere in the longrunning franchise</a>. And its commitment to telling its own story made it remarkably easy for new fans to dive in.</p><p>There’s a density to <em>Arcane</em>’s second season that feels reflective of the show’s creative team working to bring this juggernaut of a story to a satisfying end in just nine short episodes. Especially since it has been three years since season 1, you might need a refresher on how things became so dire for the citizens of Piltover and Zaun. But while the new season drops you right back into the chaos in a somewhat disorienting way, it does an excellent job of weaving together the many different threads of <em>Arcane</em>’s powerful legend.</p><p><em>Arcane</em>’s first season ended with a literal bang — an explosive attack from Jinx (Ella Purnell) on the elite council members of Piltover just as they were about to sign a peace treaty that would have brought an end to their war on the impoverished people of Zaun. Though Jinx’s attack was rooted in years of personal psychological torment and her growing up as part of Zaun’s abused, disenfranchised underclass, it was a moment that made her sister Vi (Hailee Steinfeld) see truly her as a terroristic monster. It wasn’t clear who might emerge from the smoking rubble in the end, but there was no question about how much harder Piltover would retaliate with its dangerous Hextech weapons.</p><p><em>Arcane</em>’s second season picks up in the immediate aftermath of the attack to emphasize the sheer amount of destruction Jinx caused in her crusade to make Piltover pay for its history of injustices. With so many of Piltover’s political leaders dead, the city’s priorities and its balance of power have to shift in ways that feel necessary to Vi and other survivors like enforcer Caitlyn Kiramman (Katie Leung). But while the new season takes some time to make you appreciate the magnitude of Piltover’s loss, it pushes this act of <em>Arcane</em>’s story into motion by exploring how oppressive societies create the monsters they ultimately come to hate and fear.</p><p>Everyone suffers as <em>Arcane </em>moves its characters into a new phase of conflict, but the show uses Vi and Jinx in particular to highlight how profoundly war can unmoor people from their senses of self. It’s easier for the sisters to let one another go than it is for either of them to see themselves in the other’s face. And when presented with chances to channel their feelings into action, it seldom occurs to them how fighting just to hurt the other side is guaranteed to cause self-inflicted wounds.</p><p><em>Arcane </em>repeatedly echoes that idea as it briskly shifts focus to the rest of its cast and brings the devastating danger of Hextech into sharp focus. Inventor Jayce Talis (Kevin Alejandro) and politician Mel Medarda (Toks Olagundoye) can understand the gravity of the escalation her warhawk mother Ambessa (Ellen Thomas) is hungry for. But that foresight can only do so much to keep the calls for a full-on invasion of Zaun at bay.</p><p><em>Arcane</em>’s second season uses the rising tension and Jayce’s fears about what he has helped create to delve deeper into the magical mysteries of Hextech with a subplot that zooms far out into new realms of the <em>League of Legends </em>universe. It’s another way the show reinforces its ideas about actions coming with consequences that aren’t immediately obvious up close. And in some of <em>Arcane</em>’s characters, it crystalizes how heavy a price the planet can pay as humanity wages war.</p><p>Hextech also features largely in most of this season’s more visually stunning set pieces, which are once again truly the show’s greatest strength. Though the show as a whole is still utterly gorgeous, the action feels even more brutal this time around. On occasion, the “cool” needle drops feel a bit tone deaf because of how frank <em>Arcane</em> is trying to be in its depiction of a society tearing itself apart. But that has always kinda been <em>Arcane</em>’s vibe, and the season really leaning into it will likely appeal to hardcore fans.</p><p>Because the stakes are even higher and all of <em>Arcane</em>’s players are now fully locked into the war, this season’s first three episodes often feel more narratively dense and like they’re moving at a much faster pace. That might be more exhausting if the season was dropping all at once, but Netflix has smartly chosen to split it up into three separate acts set to debut through the end of the month. We won’t know until the end of November just how <em>Arcane</em>’s creators intend to bring this story to a close and whether it might set the stage for whatever’s coming next for the franchise. But this first act is a strong opener for <em>Arcane</em>’s final chapter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Todd's career in horror, which included a title role in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/candyman">1992's Candyman</a>, earned him a Lifetime Achieveement Award at the New York City Horror Film Festival.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, Todd had a starring role in Insomniac's Spider-Man 2, and we spoke to him about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/spider-man-2-tony-todd-on-embodying-the-essence-of-venom">embodying the essence of Venom</a> ahead of last year's release. Todd also hinted that Insomniac had only used 10 percent of his character's dialogue, setting off speculation of a DLC that ultimately never materialized.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac wrote in a statement released shortly after Todd's death, "Insomniac Games is heartbroken by the passing of our friend Tony Todd. He brought so much joy to our studio during the production of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and to many fans around the world with his inimitable voice and presence. We are Venom... forever."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/jJ4zIyBERE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/jJ4zIyBERE</a></p>— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1855085273035530368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Other fans also paid tribute to Todd, calling him a "horror legend" as well as a terrific character actor. Bloody Disgusting Editor in Chief John Squires wrote, "The loss of Tony Todd is a monumental loss for the horror world. One of the all-time greats. We say it a lot. Horror icon. Horror legend. He embodied all of that. Made every movie he was in better. A staple of the convention scene. A true member of this horror family. Deeply sad."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?
