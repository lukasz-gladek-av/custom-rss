                <p>Actor Ned Luke, who played Michael in GTA 5 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-trio-want-fans-to-petition-for-one-last-dlc-story-together/1100-6532595/" data-ref-id="1100-6532595">wants to come back in a new DLC for GTA Online</a>, has revealed the one mission in the game that was "hands down" the worst to perform.</p><p>Responding to someone online who posted a clip of the yoga mission from GTA 5's campaign, Luke said he <a href="https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1935524554127945819" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">agreed</a> with the commenter and that it was "hands down the worst to shoot." Luke added that he "sweated my ass off for eight hours" during the filming process.</p><p>The <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Did_Somebody_Say_Yoga%3F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Did Somebody Say Yoga?"</a> mission in GTA 5 has Michael joining his wife Amanda and yoga instructor Fabien for a yoga session at their home. The player must match button presses in time and order to complete the objective; failing triggers a fail screen telling you that "Michael failed to achieve enlightenment."</p><p>While Luke might not have enjoyed this one scene, he's previously spoken positively about his experience making the game overall. He's asking fans to petition Rockstar to bring him and his co-stars Steven Ogg (Trevor) and Shawn Fonteno (Franklin) back for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-trio-want-fans-to-petition-for-one-last-dlc-story-together/1100-6532595/" data-ref-id="1100-6532595">another heist mission in GTA Online</a> featuring all three of them.</p><p>Many have theorized that Michael may appear in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-actor-from-gta-5-also-be-in-the-new-game-ned-luke-weighs-in/1100-6520046/" data-ref-id="1100-6520046">Luke himself dodged the question</a>. "I'm not in... we don't... GTA 6 is unknown things right now. Just to make that clear," he said when a host introduced him as "Michael from GTA 5 and GTA 6."</p><p>Luke has also told fans that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-will-be-worth-the-wait-so-just-be-patient-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6529201/" data-ref-id="1100-6529201">GTA 6 will be worth the wait</a> and that fans can trust that Rockstar Games will deliver something impressive when the game finally launches in May 2026.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-3-delayed-beyond-this-week-no-new-date-revealed.1225728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has announced that the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>Update 2.3 will be postponed, and no new release date for the update has been announced.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyberpunk.net/post/3lsbnqkiohc2h" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Bluesky, the studio says that while the update was intended to be released on June 26th (that's this Thursday at time of writing), more time will be needed for the developer to "make sure we're happy with [the update]".</p>

<p>The extra time will be used to implement features that will bring Update 2.3 closer in scope to Update 2.2, the studio says. More information will be provided as soon as it's available, according to CDPR.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-update-2.3-delayed-smoking.jpg?itok=OseBe83H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-update-2.3-delayed-smoking.jpg?itok=-sKiDTGW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s next update has been delayed indefinitely.</figcaption></figure><p>While we know what kind of level CDPR is aiming for when it comes to Update 2.3, we don't yet know exactly what will be in it. The patch was only announced <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1930657862054707704" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earlier this month</a>, and since then, speculation has been rife, but concrete information from CDPR hasn't been forthcoming.</p>

<p>CD Projekt Red community director&nbsp;Marcin Momot said at the time of the patch's release that the team would "start spilling the beans closer to the release of patch 2.3", so it sounds like we'll have a little longer to wait for more info.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>news, CDPR revealed back in May that a sequel to the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production" rel="nofollow">has entered pre-production</a>, although that might be a little less exciting than you'd think; it essentially means the studio is currently prototyping the game's skeleton and creating its foundations.</p>

<p>Additionally, in November last year, the studio announced that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">surpass 30 million sales</a> around the world, so if you're wondering why CDPR is so eager to get a sequel underway, now you know.</p>




<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>is also one of the third-party games chosen to launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2, and while <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report" rel="nofollow">reports claim</a> that third-party launch numbers for Switch 2 games aren't looking so great, those reports also point to&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>as the Switch 2's best-selling third-party title.</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/cyberpunk-2077/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

        <ul><li><strong>Welcome to the Midnight Murder Club</strong> – You’ve been invited to the Midnight Murder Club, an elite group that gives you nothing but a gun and a flashlight before sending you into the darkened halls of a mansion. Conceal your identity behind a mask and join your friends in a game of perception, deception, and sharpshooting. In the darkness, every decision counts.</li><li><strong>Six Guests. One Deadly Game.</strong> – The difference between light and dark is important as the Midnight Murder Club’s members are forced to choose between the safety of darkness and the risk of clicking on a flashlight. Spotting someone else gives crucial information, but if you can see them, that means they can see you, too. Rely on your other senses to navigate the mansion and find your opponents.</li><li><strong>Whispers in the Dark</strong> – Full proximity chat leads to tense and hysterical moments as you feel your way through the mansion’s dark corridors. Hear muffled footsteps as someone runs down the hallway above you, then creep toward gunshots bleeding through the door to the next room. Hear your rivals’ laughter echo through the tall ceilings after you emerge victorious from a gunfight.</li><li><strong>The Devil’s Toys</strong> – Hidden around the mansion are traps, weapons, and other equipment to help you survive the night. Take night vision pills to see in the dark. Don a bulletproof vest to defend against your foes. Immobilize your enemies in a bear trap or light them ablaze with a molotov cocktail. The variety of items makes every match unique.</li><li><strong>A Game of Choice</strong> – What game does the Club have in store for your group tonight? <em>Midnight Murder Club</em> has multiple ways to play ranging from classics to objective-based modes that require more thought and strategy as you explore the secrets hiding inside Wormwood Manor.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Midnight Murder Club - Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOPh52i_vgA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/midnight-murder-club-launches-august-14]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Seoul-based game development studio Shift Up has finally released Stellar Blade for PC earlier this month. The game, originally codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-eve-looks-stunning-in-first-playstation-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project EVE</a>, was actually supposed to launch on PC right away alongside PlayStation 4 and even Xbox One.</p>
<p>However, when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-new-name-project-eve-visually-stunning-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resurfaced</a> in September 2022's State of Play stream as Stellar Blade, it did so as a PlayStation 5 exclusive with Sony Interactive Entertainment set to publish. Back then, the developers still hoped for a 2023 launch, but the launch had to be delayed until April 2024, when it became <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> for the PS5.&nbsp;<span>Shift Up&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a PC port and a sequel only a month later</span>, although this version of the action game took over a year to be released.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, quality is all that matters, especially given the current state of the games industry. Therefore, I'm happy to say that Stellar Blade on PC is a very solid port on all accounts. It doesn't even seem like Shift Up got any help from Sony's dedicated PC porting team, Nixxes Software, which makes the port's quality all the more impressive.</p>
<p>First things first. This PC version includes most of the technical bells and whistles we expect from a 2025 triple-A launch, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full support for Ultra-wide and Super Ultra-wide display (21:9 and 32:9), cutscenes included</li>
<li>Support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution (with the latest transformer model), AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation, AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation, NVIDIA DLAA and FSR Native AA</li>
<li>Support for the DualSense controller's haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and controller speaker features</li>
<li>Support for High Dynamic Range displays</li>
<li>Six predefined frame rate limiter options (30 FPS, 45 FPS, 60 FPS, 120 FPS, 144 FPS, 240 FPS, and of course, unlimited frame rate)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, a few things are missing, like Intel XeSS, a 165 FPS frame rate limiter option, better HDR calibration options (they're the same for SDR: brightness, contrast, and UI brightness), and possibly a field of view slider, although the latter isn't really standard for third-person games.</p>
<p>Overall, though, there's more than enough here to be satisfied, especially since the game itself runs very smoothly. Powered by the Unreal Engine 4, Stellar Blade can run <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-gets-added-to-marvels-spider-man-2-mecha-break-rematch-and-dragonkin-the-banished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at an average of 540 frames per second</a> on a GeForce RTX 5090 with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade PC 4K Gameplay Max Settings, NVIDIA DLAA" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T3gCmP8DXyI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this case, however, there's little reason to use Performance Mode when the frame rate is already so high. In our testing, we used NVIDIA DLAA while also maxing all the graphics settings and still registered a maximum frame rate of 423 FPS, an average frame rate of 377 FPS, and a minimum frame rate of 313 FPS, in a custom benchmark run of the Wasteland level seen in the video above.</p>
<p>Being an Unreal Engine 4, Stellar Blade on PC is not entirely devoid of the all-too-familiar stuttering we've unfortunately come to expect from the technology. When analyzing the data captured with FrameView, nearly 12% is labeled as stuttering. On the other hand, the rest of the gameplay is buttery smooth, delivering a great action experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Stellar-Blade-PC-Benchmark-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Sure, the game isn't the most visually demanding in 2025. It doesn't have path tracing, or even just ray tracing, or UE5's Lumen global illumination. Even so, the art style goes a long way toward delivering an aesthetically appealing experience.</p>
<p>The upside of launching one year later is that the game has been improved through several updates. Furthermore, there are two expansion packs (one themed around NieR: Automata and another around Shift Up's first big hit, the gacha Goddess of Victory: Nikke) that can be purchased separately or as part of the Complete Edition.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm having a lot of fun playing Stellar Blade. While it is a fairly straightforward experience could certainly have used more complexity (and more narrative, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> recently by Shift Up's CEO), it understands the core of what's entertaining about an action videogame, and that's why it has reached so many players.</p>

        <p>With a focus on ultra-realistic simulation, deep emotional connections, and limitless interaction, <em>Starsand Island</em> aims to become a “The Sims of the farming genre”, breaking new ground in how players build relationships with NPCs in a rural life sim.</p><p><span><strong>I. Intertwined interactions</strong></span></p><p><strong>1. Lively, Authentic NPCs</strong></p><p>We’ve infused our NPCs with lifelike memory, perception, emotions, and independent decision-making; every character on Starsand Island even has long-term personal goals.</p><p>Players can help them achieve these dreams, growing together along the way. NPCs will give you context-sensitive requests based on their progress, and they actively respond to what’s happening around them. For example: snap a photo and they’ll strike a pose; pass by, and they’ll greet you; animal lovers will go out of their way to pet any stray cat or dog they spot. The islanders feel truly alive and are proactive.</p><p><strong>2. Unique, Rich Interactions</strong></p><p>Most farming sims offer NPC chats and gift-giving, but <em>Starsand Island</em> goes further: every key character has signature interactions reflecting their personality. Maybe you’ve started a friendship with an islander who <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a>lights as a fortune teller? You can join them for a reading, complete with a touch of mysticism—sometimes with real-life advice!</p><p>Plus, the island is packed with interactive objects, so you can ride bikes together, swing side by side, have sleepovers, even binge-watch TV.</p><p><strong>3. Realistic, Gradual Relationship Growth</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Organic, Repeatable Bonding</strong> – Build rapport through daily chats, gifts, invites, and teamwork—not just scripted story beats. Relationships feel genuine and continuous, rather than “checklist” moments.</li><li><strong>Responsive Dialogue</strong> – As bonds deepen, NPC conversations and reactions evolve, showing off unique quirks and gestures. No more cardboard cutouts—your new friends feel real.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Deep Immersion in Daily Life</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a title="Genres > Action [2,829 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>-Driven Events and QTEs</strong> – Key moments blend quick-time events and animation, with realistic details and true-to-life NPC responses, so you feel right in the heart of the story.</li><li><strong>Dynamic <a title="Series > Persona [89 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>l Events</strong> – Get surprise gifts, receive heartfelt letters, accept special requests, and unlock unique storylines for each NPC. Every friendship grows like a “life tree,” branching in new directions.</li></ul><p><strong>5. Customization and Growing Together</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Relationship-Driven Gameplay</strong> – Your bond impacts everything, from how well NPCs help you collect resources to the rewards they give for completing jobs. The closer you are, the more they’ll pitch in and the better your rewards.</li><li><strong>Personalized Nicknames</strong> – Customize how you and your friends address each other. Unique relationship labels and emotional replies from NPCs help you feel truly connected.</li></ul><p><strong>6. Integrated Social and Homebuilding Systems</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Islanders, Not Tools</strong> – NPCs aren’t just quest-givers, they’re genuine friends with dreams, moods, and personalities.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer Gearbox Software has released the first story trailer for its upcoming looter-shooter, Borderlands 4, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/19/borderlands-4-is-coming-to-game-informers-cover">which is also the game gracing the next issue of <em>Game Informer </em>magazine</a>, and it highlights the new setting of Kairos, the four new Vault Hunters, the villainous Timekeeper, and more. Plus, it ends with details about the bonuses you'll get for preordering Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</p><p>"Get a glimpse of the Timekeeper's cruel reign, including the disturbing process of being implanted with a Bolt – a spine-grafted cybernetic device used to dominate the populace," the trailer's description reads. "Soon after crash-landing, the Vault Hunters are arrested and forcibly affixed with the device, trapping them on Kairos."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Borderlands 4 story trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onY6y4NZ-t4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onY6y4NZ-t4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Timekeeper and his Order rule over Kairos from the impenetrable fortress location of Dominion City. When Elpis arrived in Kairos' orbit and unleashed cataclysmic destruction, the Timekeeper locked Dominion City down and sent in his commanders to handle the fallout. Today, the Timekeeper watches over Kairos from the safety of his tower, letting these Commanders maintain his Order, Gearbox says.&nbsp;</p><p>"From humble beginnings, you'll need to travel across Kairos and ignite the revolution against the Timekeeper," Gearbox says. "People all across Kairos have begun to rise up, and this powderkeg is set to explode. Enter Claptrap, self-proclaimed mastermind behind the Crimson Resistance, who's set on making the Vault Hunters his newest recruits."&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer ends with a look at the preorder bonuses for Borderlands 4, which you can view in the image below:&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.pl/games/peak">Peak</a> has sold one million copies in six days, following a steady day-by-day launch on Steam.</p>
<p>Developed by Landcrab (a collaboration between Landfall and Aggro Crab), the title initially launched to just over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3527290/charts/">11,000 concurrent players on 17th June according to SteamDB</a>. This grew daily, eventually breaching the 100,000 concurrent milestone on Sunday.</p>
<p>As of writing, the game is at the top of Steam's Top Sellers list, following the well-trodden path last walked by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> earlier this month. By all accounts a great success, especially considering this is Landcrab's first release.</p>

<p>In response to Peak passing the million-sales mark, Aggro Crab posted a very snarky and on-brand reaction <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1936733984635179247">on social media</a>: "why did this stupid jam game sell more copies than another crabs treasure im gonna crash out".</p>
<p>The positive reception comes at a good time for the Aggro Crab team, who collaborated with Landfall after funding for Going Under 2 was pulled from beneath the developer. As for Landfall, that team has a rich history of releasing smaller games that make a massive impact. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/content-warning-tops-one-million-sales">Content Warning topped one million sales</a> fairly quickly, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/extremely-silly-battle-royale-game-totally-accurate-battlegrounds-is-an-unexpected-steam-smash">Totally Accurate Battlegrounds</a> was an April Fools Joke that morphed into a surprise hit.</p>
<p>If you were curious as to Aggro Crab's previous work, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-crabs-treasure-feels-a-natural-evolution-for-an-underwater-soulslike">Another Crab's Treasure is <em>fantastic</em></a>. It's well worth your time, and it's going cheap these days too! Get your pincers round it, if you can.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/charming-co-op-climbing-game-peak-takes-steam-by-storm-selling-one-million-copies-in-six-days-and-mounting-the-top-sellers-page]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The officially licensed EXG Pro Astro Bot Cable Guy will soon be available for pre-order, and it looks like a must-have for fans of Sony’s super-cute mascot.&nbsp; Designed to hold controllers, including the PS5 DualSense, Xbox Series X|S controllers, and pretty much any mobile phone, Astro Bot can sit on your desk and be, well,&nbsp; super cute.</p>
<p>It’s also rather reasonably priced, considering the detail on the model and will cost you £29.99 plus postage.&nbsp; You can read more and get ready to pre-order over at <a href="https://exgpro.com/products/playstation-astro-bot-cable-guys-controller-holder-and-phone-stand?_pos=1&amp;_sid=3caf0d721&amp;_ss=r">EGXPro</a>.</p>




<p>Astro Bot will be getting a fresh update in July with free content.</p>

<p>“5 brand new levels will make their way into the game as part of the Vicious Void Galaxy, bringing the total number of levels in Astro Bot to a whopping 90+! As with our last update, these 5 levels will require you to pull every bit of skill together to complete so hang on to your DualSense Controller and dive in!” <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/astro-bot-five-new-vicious-void-galaxy-levels-special-bots-launch-this-july/">commented</a> Nicolas Doucet, Studio Head at Team Asobi.</p>
<p>“The 5 levels available will be:Twin-Frog Trouble, Suck It Up, Handhold Havoc, High Inflation and… well. You’ll have to play and see. And who knows? Maybe completing all Vicious Void might lead to something really cool?”</p>
<p>The levels will come with new collectable Special Bots including one that is a “revengeful newcomer”. Also, an updated version of the Astro Bot Limited Edition DualSense wireless controller is launching later this year with a new twist on the touch pad.</p>
<p>Astro Bot cleaned up at this years<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/09/astro-bot-wins-five-baftas-still-wakes-the-deep-claims-three/"> BAFTA awards</a> winning five of the seventeen awards that were available.&nbsp; We gave the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">10/10 in our review,</a></p>
<p>“Astro Bot is a game that absolutely celebrates all things PlayStation, aimed at anyone and everyone who loves this console and the games that have made it what it is. Whether you’re an old timer or a young kid with their first console — or better yet, a combination of the two — there are dozens of hours of fun to be mined here. It’s a fun, easy-going romp through PlayStation history, and absolutely impossible to play without a smile plastered to your face.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Co-op Climbing Game Peak Hits 1m Sales in Less Than a Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-1m-sales-first-week</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/co-op-climbing-game-peak-hits-1m-sales-in-less-than-a-week.1225662/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Peak</em>, a physics-based climbing sim created by Aggro Crab and&nbsp;<em>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator&nbsp;</em>developer Landfall, has reached a major sales milestone within just a week of its release.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1936734056089100646" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Landfall X account,&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>managed to sell a million copies within its first six days, which is particularly impressive given that the game isn't currently available anywhere outside of Steam.</p>

<p>On that note, in the replies to the post, a user asks Landfall whether&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>is coming to consoles as well. The studio says it's "too early to say", but that the game will "hopefully" be released on consoles. I'd imagine sales numbers like this won't hurt on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/peak-sales-1m-climbing.jpg?itok=z8JP2tqJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/peak-sales-1m-climbing.jpg?itok=EKqsPnsy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Peak&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell a million copies in its first week.</figcaption></figure><p>As for the reason behind&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>'s success, it's likely tapping into the same streaming-friendly approach espoused by the likes of horror game&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company&nbsp;</em>or fellow climbing sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-together-steam-surprise-hit" rel="nofollow"><em>Chained Together</em></a>.</p>

<p>Per&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>'s Steam page, the game is one in which "the slightest mistake can spell your doom", and it should be fairly obvious how that translates to streaming appeal; watching streamers gleefully fail to climb a mountain time and time again is exactly the kind of entertainment many stream viewers are looking for.</p>

<p><em>Peak</em>'s map also rotates every day, which means that even if you manage to conquer today's mountain, you'll have another one waiting for you and your friends tomorrow, adding replay value.</p>

<p>All told, it looks like Landfall and Aggro Crab have a hit on their hands. It just remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>can remain at the top of its particular mountain, or whether it'll be shunted off by another flavor of the month soon.</p>




<p>If you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>for yourself, you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here on PC via Steam</a>. Hopefully, the game will come to consoles soon as well. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The code for the packaged <em>Mario Kart World</em> had been scratched off already, so Walmart knocked another $50 off the price, and it all seemed like a good deal. Until they got home.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Finally after work I get a chance to set it up.

FML.</p></blockquote><p>Because they’d bought it from Walmart, it wasn’t a problem to return the console and get their money back. But of course this meant they were still without the desired Switch 2.

It’s pretty fundamental.</p><p>This, of course, comes with the added complexity that there are completely legitimate uses of a MiG cart, such as running homebrew games that aren’t copyrighted in the first place. I expect this means there will <em>have</em> to be a court case over this feature at some point soon.</p><p>However, the more immediate issue is for those looking to pick up a Switch 2 from a reseller or previous owner, given their current scarcity at first-party sellers. There’s really no way of knowing at all if a console has been bricked when buying the device online, and this could make the resale market a complete shambles for the whole life cycle of the console. And, grimly, that’s not exactly a priority for Nintendo, given that reselling, either in store or online, gains the company nothing, and some would argue actually costs the company a sale—it’s not like it’ll be in a rush to address the problem.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-owned-online-error-walmart-1851784892]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review.1225647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Platypus semen. A giant, oily killer skull. A talking crash test dummy. A puppet soaking in a hot spring. Norman Reedus' nips. No, these aren't straightjacket blabberings due to another vicious bout of temporary madness; instead, they are just 10% of the bizarre things I've seen in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. But it would be far too easy to dismiss Hideo Kojima's work as acts of weirdness alone. I think we should encourage such wild creativity, and be excited that someone is willing to show us things we'd never even thought of seeing. When viewed this way, Death Stranding 2 stands as an almighty achievement – a triumphant combination of complex sci-fi storytelling and thrillingly evolved stealth-action that impressively builds upon the experimental foundation of its predecessor. It's beautiful, horrific, nuanced, and crucially, a lot of fun. Simply put, it's everything I wanted Death Stranding to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I found the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-reviewing-death-stranding-2-heres-what-i-thought-of-the-original"><u>original Death Stranding alluring but uneven</u></a> – an intriguing safe full of possibilities that I couldn't quite crack the code to. So with On the Beach, I couldn’t have been happier to find a sequel that triumphs in what it sets out to achieve, and a blockbuster fulfilment of what Death Stranding can (and should) be. It's more confident in both its storytelling and much-improved gameplay, removing a lot of the friction that previously existed in its systems. It also tells a more focused, affecting story that builds out the mythos of its post-apocalypse setting. If you weren't a fan of the first one, then I'm not sure it rewrites the book to an extent that would make you become one here (even though I’d urge you to give it a go). But if you found yourself, much like me, somewhat teetering on the fence, then you may well find yourself falling in love this time around.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2: Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The rhythm will be familiar to those who played the original. Reedus is back as Sam Porter Bridges, once again on a mission to make deliveries across treacherous terrain, often facing human and otherworldly threats along the path. It requires you to be prepared for what faces you on each mission by studying your map and packing accordingly. See a river too deep to walk through in your way? Bring along a ladder or two to cross it with. Spot a warning that BTs (the ghostly threats that stalk certain rainy spots) lurk in the area? Pack a few blood grenades to lob at them. It's this loop of preparation, overcoming both geographical and human/former-human hurdles, and reaching your goal that makes up much of Death Stranding 2's roughly 35-hour runtime when mainlining its story missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a brief tutorial chapter in Mexico, Sam is given the goal of connecting Australia to the Chiral Network (the online system knitting civilization together after a near-world-ending event), much like he did with the USA in the original. Why is he doing that, and who is he doing it for? You'll have to find out yourself. This new continent offers a far greater variety of locations, as it shifts in its appearance and the challenge it presents with regularity. Sandstorms buffet Sam, making keeping balance all the more difficult while also decreasing visibility. Quakes can shift the floor beneath you and send cargo tumbling. And rivers can rise and grow in size if rain comes down with enough force. It further adds to the feeling of combating nature with this future tech, as the Earth itself seems to be fighting back against its increasingly digital future. Should we have connected? It's a resounding "no," it seems, from Mother Nature. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Should we have connected? It's a resounding "no," it seems, from Mother Nature.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no doubting film’s influence on this world either, and as a fan of “cinematic games”, I frankly can’t get enough of the artistry on show throughout, even when it may veer into overly referential territory. And those references are keenly on display: The stark landscapes and pioneering strides against the turmoil of nature in Nolan’s Interstellar. The tension-laced delivery of Friedkin’s Sorcerer. The unnerving energy of not knowing what digital ghosts lurk in the dark frames of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Pulse. Screen-projected flickers of all of these bounce around my brain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is too different from the apparent cinematic influences of the original, but this time, the lens shifts focus more to action. The dangerous desert expanses of The Road Warrior are no doubt an inspiration, and the guest appearance of Mad Max’s creator, George Miller, is more than a mere coincidence. These are not just cinematic influences for the sake of it, as they inform and instruct Kojima’s approach to gameplay, too, and are reflected in an altogether more action-heavy evolution of the original Death Stranding’s template.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Snakes and Ladders</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What initially presents itself as a pretty rudimentary style of stealth gameplay, mainly consisting of crouching in tall grass and performing silent takedowns, rapidly reveals its layers as your arsenal grows. For example, there’s the introduction of a game-changing tranquiliser sniper rifle, which is something I found super satisfying to pick bandits off with. It may never truly become the stealth-action playground of creativity that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review"><u>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</u></a> is. But it frequently evokes that same feeling in brief moments, delighting me each time it does. Death Stranding 2 offers a lot more flexibility in your approach compared to the original Death Stranding, making its combat much more engaging as a result. And you’ll need to become accustomed to a variety of approaches as well, because there’s no avoiding confrontation and the many forms it takes this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I never tired of launching my little drone friend Dollman into the air and using him as a portable eye in the sky as I scoped out enemy outposts, marking and identifying my prey. They never notice the small puppet floating above them, which might be a little unbelievable, but also makes me feel like I’m getting away with murder. Enemies develop as you progress, and knowing which are armoured, which have higher mobility, and what ammo type they’re vulnerable to adds variables to encounters, meaning you can't always rely on the same rinse-and-repeat tactics. That being said, if you're a decent enough shot with a sniper rifle, you can clear out most bases before enemies have time to reach you. Crucially, it's just as fun when it goes wrong as when it goes right, though.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a playfulness in Death Standing 2’s approach to combat that just wasn't present in the original.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a satisfaction in a perfectly planned attack going smoothly as you pick off each guard with a tranq dart, but a thrill when one shot goes awry and you're made to scramble, juggling your arsenal as enemies descend upon your position. Shooting the driver of an on-rushing vehicle before stealing it to run over his friend is always fun, as is dancing around them in a machine gun-turreted off-roader of your own design. Overall, there's a playfulness in Death Standing 2’s approach to combat that just wasn't present in the original’s simpler, less imaginative system. It brings a dash of power fantasy to the mix, adding to the fun and making it a wholly more enjoyable game to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemy AI may still not be the sharpest, but it does enable some of that "playing with your food" energy that's always welcome. I played on the normal difficulty and never really found any fight a challenge until things cranked up a little towards the end. This lack of friction is deliberate, though, with the increased toolset, including many different gun and grenade types of varying loudness, allowing you to get through its story at a good pace. This isn't Sam's first rodeo, so when he’s setting out on a continent-spanning trek this time, Death Stranding 2 reflects that by making you feel like a more powerful Porter Bridges. This is a journey, not something that asks you to replay sections if you do something wrong or walk into “mission failed” screens unless you really, really mess up. In fact, even boss battles can be skipped entirely if that particular challenge isn't what you're here for. This isn’t something I'd recommend, though, as they offer some of the most striking spectacles Death Stranding 2 has to offer – a giant tentacle mech is an early favourite, but there are many more monstrosities following later that I'll keep hidden here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your action chops are also firmly put to the test in the sections that have you face off against newcomer Neil, played with a subtle intensity by Italian actor Luca Marinelli. Scrambling around gorgeous architecture to find new weapons in a series of tense shootouts and adding your own flashes and bangs to the fireworks display backdropping these showdowns is a thrill. They're particularly stunning stages full of flame and beauty that made me feel I was briefly being taken away to a different game. But those lashings of cinematic style are painted across each encounter, and the many, many cutscenes that bookend them. Having time slow down after dispatching an enemy is not only very helpful when faced with multiple threats, but adds a slick layer of style to each gunfight. No aspect of Death Stranding 2 is left untouched by its blockbuster aspirations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as both elements and entities fight against you with more vigor this time around, you're in turn given new abilities to combat them with. Unlike the first game’s relatively barebones character progression, now skill points can be used to unlock fresh tools and boost your stats sheet. Death Stranding 2 is by no means an RPG, but it does offer greater and much-appreciated variety when it comes to building out how you want your Sam to play. Want to be a sneaky Sam? Invest in the ability to cover your tracks by scrubbing out your footprints. Want to be shooty Sam? Augment his arsenal so it packs a heavier punch. Or perhaps you fancy yourself a budding meteorologist and just want to accurately analyse the weather and know what BT-infested spots to steer clear of. You'll ultimately be treading the same set of missions as every other player, but the ways you can choose to approach each one are far more varied this time around.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>From coffin hoverboards to homing missile mechanical dogs, there really is no shortage of creativity on show.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These perks can also be freely plugged in and out (reminiscent of how Nier Automata's fantastic chip system functions) and offer great flexibility, further enhancing your freedom when preparing for specific types of missions. Upgrades get unlocked in accordance with how you’ve been playing; if you take a combat-heavy approach, you’ll be rewarded with new skills like a semi-automated lock-on ability for your guns. Find yourself dishing out likes to other players' items you see, such as a helpful cargo catapult? You’ll unlock a perk that increases the number of other people’s online constructions, like bridges and generators, that appear in your world. It’s a nice touch that further makes Death Stranding 2 feel like an experience that is in step with you, and another indication of its formerly rough edges being sanded down for a much more enjoyable time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of perks, there is also no shortage of new gadgetry and weaponry available to Sam. Completing side missions and increasing your star ranking with each of the outposts dotted around the map unlocks these options at a consistently good rhythm, as well as some that open up when you complete certain story events. The blood boomerang is particularly effective against BTs, for example, but comes at the cost of draining your lifeforce with every hurl of it. And the tools get weirder and wilder from there, coming at such a regularity that you'll be moving on from one shiny toy of destruction or subterfuge to the next with each mission. From coffin hoverboards to homing missile mechanical dogs, there really is no shortage of creativity on show.</p><div id="hideo-kojima-games-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hideo Kojima Games Tier List</h3><h3>Hideo Kojima Games Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But it isn’t just in combat that these accessories have their uses either, because no matter how much Death Stranding 2 has cranked up the action this time around, it is still fundamentally about porting cargo from one location to another across Australia. That vast expanse naturally leads to new delivery systems. Yes, turns out there really is nothing on Earth like a genuine, bona fide, electrified six-car monorail. This new structure is a godsend when it comes to a handful of missions that require shipping hundreds of kilos of chemical materials over a rocky coastline, but it does call on quite the combined construction job between you and the online community. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, I did settle on travelling on foot as little as possible quite quickly. On the Beach is very kind in that it gives you a vehicle very early on this time around, especially when compared to the many hours it took to fire up an engine in the original. I therefore made many of my long-haul treks via a custom off-roader equipped with a handy auto-pick-up tool for loose cargo that I nursed for much of my playthrough. It served me incredibly well, and I had a fantastic time treating most of my playtime like a post-apocalyptic rally racer, albeit at slower speeds.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It just feels like some of the original Death Stranding’s friction has been removed</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, it just feels like some of the original Death Stranding’s friction has been removed, and for the better, with the decision to introduce this helpful equipment early as opposed to it being held hostage for many, many hours. I do still think that managing the cargo on these trips is a bit of a pain, though. Inventory systems and menus have been streamlined a bit but are still fiddly, and I spent a little more time than I'd have liked scrolling through them over my few dozen hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The missions themselves are incredibly moreish, though, with that “just one more job” itch that I always had to scratch. There’s a great sense of forward momentum which aids this sensation hugely, with backtracking, thankfully, a rarity in the sequel. Whether it's recovering a lost kangaroo for some Scottish popstars or delivering a pizza to a VTuber, you never quite know what’s around the corner. Varied mission conditions also keep things fresh; these range from having to complete orders within a set time limit or being extra careful with fragile cargo. Again, these parameters force you to adjust how you prepare for each mission and ensure that you can’t just use the same toolset and methods on every run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's this consistent drive alongside a drip-feed of new equipment that makes the whole experience more rewarding. The overall structure of Death Stranding 2’s campaign is leaps and bounds above what came before, and whether it's unleashing bullets into a teleporting mech or gently navigating a river, it all feels intertwined beautifully and serves the complex sci-fi story it aims to tell to fantastic effect.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2 Cast</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Life's a Beach</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Set 11 months after the events of the original, On the Beach’s twisting tale begins with Sam attempting to settle into a quiet life off the grid with baby Lou but, inevitably, that dream is swiftly ended. Where it goes from there, I won’t even dare to spoil, but I guarantee that you won’t see even half of its reveals coming. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can say, though, that there’s an ongoing trend of viscosity throughout. Tar, sludge, oil, blood – you’ll wade through it all. But it's also thick with intrigue, as the secrets continue to be uncovered in a flurry of ideas so dense I’d struggle to point to its like elsewhere. The themes it tackles are multifold. Some focus on a more personal level, and others are global. The latter is a treatise on modern life and how technology infests every part of it. It’s a strong story of how increased existence in the digital world eats away at our souls as humans, as physical interactions – especially in a post-COVID environment – became all the more precious. I can’t help but feel that Kojima is bristling with thoughts about how art and individual expression can never be replaced by artificial intelligence, no matter how it's forced upon us. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>These are themes Kojima has been writing about for decades now, but still remain frustratingly topical.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s commentary on gun culture and our world's obsession with building bigger and better weapons. These are, of course, themes Kojima has been writing about for decades now – all the way back to the original Metal Gear Solid in 1998 – but still remain frustratingly topical and worthy of continued commentary on in a modern context. It's a credit to the storytelling that all of these concepts shine through, without getting too bogged down or obscured by the sci-fi trappings they could so easily sink into.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Death Stranding 2 doesn’t only look outwards. It’s as introspective as any of Kojima's work to date. Metal Gear Solid always looked at geopolitical and nuclear issues on a wide scale, and the original Death Stranding challenged our ability to truly connect as humans in a digital age – a stark reality when faced with the pandemic it pre-empted by mere months. But On the Beach asks questions about the issues posed in that original text. It's self-analytical, but rarely gazes at its navel, delivering a knockout story that works on many levels.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The theme of connectivity, fittingly, weaves each disparate part together by exploring not only how we connect to each other, but with our own pasts as well. What we choose to hold onto, and what we choose to let go. I don't think it's any coincidence that Neil resembles Solid Snake, a character whom Kojima has had to make peace with cutting ties with ever since his departure from Konami a decade ago. Death Stranding 2 almost feels like a funeral for his beloved bandana operative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the cast of characters may be as subtly named as referring to me as Simon Reviewman, they do all possess nuanced personalities that reveal themselves at frequent junctures in the story. Small idiosyncrasies, such as face twitches upon revelations being heard or the faintest of tear drops falling down a cheek, really bring a level of depth to these people that their stunningly realised faces deserve. The motion and performance-capture technology is simply astounding, allowing for every pore and reflex of the actors to make their way onto the screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Norman Reedus continues his stoic portrayal of Sam Porter Bridges and anchors the story with a calm, centered approach. I do still find Sam a fairly impenetrable character to connect with on an emotional level, though, as he again serves as a vehicle for the story rather than the personal heart of it. He's given more range to work in this time around, but his not-too-high, not-too-low performance again allows for the supporting cast to shine. Lea Seydoux beguiles as Fragile, a layered character that the French actress elevates even further. Elle Fanning is fantastic as the enigmatic Tomorrow, and the mysterious Red Samurai is dripping with cool. It’s the kind of sleek style we've come to expect from artist Yoji Shinkawa ever since Psyborg Ninja first dashed onto the screen in 1998. He’s a master character designer on top of his game, and Death Stranding 2 really gives him the opportunity to cook again and again.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Troy Baker returns as Higgs, who pretty much steals every scene he enters.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also have a soft spot for the aforementioned Dollman, who makes the journey a little less lonely by accompanying you at all times on your utility belt. He’s effectively a version of God of War’s Mimir, but instead of funny retellings of myths and legend, we're treated to high school-level interpretations of the themes of Moby Dick and occasionally telling you that you stink. The standout performer this time around, though, has to be Troy Baker's return as Higgs, who pretty much steals every scene he enters. He’s been given license to bring an even more operatic edge to the character this time around, complete with a chilling mask and crimson electric guitar to match. A Reddie Van Halen, if you will.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a big role in every way, and matches the grandeur of the story being told, but in truth, there’s not a single poor performance to be found within the cast, each being given moments to shine in both loud and quiet pockets. For as much cargo as there is being lugged around this world, it's the emotional baggage of the characters that weighs the heaviest, and that pressure builds and builds until its jaw-dropping final few hours, of which I can safely say I’ve never seen anything quite like before.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While I love how it ends, I do wish it started a little thicker and faster. It's so full of mystery that going a couple of hours of deliveries before finding out the next big nugget of the main plot can feel a little agonising. Multiple hours can go by without seeing key characters, and there are a handful of instances when your home base ship is grounded and you need to complete some deliveries before it can get on the move again. These do hinder momentum at times, but never bring things completely to a halt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those parts are quickly forgotten, though, because On the Beach does go to some legitimately batshit places, as well as some classic Kojima fourth-wall-breaking antics – and I frankly couldn’t get enough of that. Its willingness to show us things we simply haven't seen before is something I appreciate so much, because when big creative swings are taken with a budget of equal magnitude behind them, there's nothing else that hits quite the same when they land.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A word of warning that this very much is a sequel, though, and while On the Beach does provide a short story recap, I’d recommend hunting down a more fully fleshed out one if you’re in need of a catch-up or jumping in fresh here. And if it does all ever get a little too confusing, the introduction of Death Stranding 2’s Corpus acts as a handy tool to catch you up on terminology or the story so far. It's effectively a sexy-sounding glossary that works in a similar way to how Final Fantasy 16's Active Time Lore did, and a quick method of reminding yourself what a Stillmother or Extinction Event is when someone casually drops it into conversation like it isn’t from some alien language.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Few blockbuster-scale games allow for moments of reflection like this.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You could be mistaken for thinking that this version of Australia is another planet, though. Whether it be the ludicrously oversized moon seemingly about to engulf you or the red desert conjuring images of Mars, there’s something transcendental about the whole experience. It’s just fundamentally therapeutic driving across the outback as the sun comes up. Few blockbuster-scale games allow for moments of reflection like this, and they really do add up to a journey that begs to be savoured. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those visual treats are supported by music that is once again arranged to sensational effect throughout – whether it be Woodkid’s haunting vocals hanging over a lonely mountain or Ludvig Forssell’s beautiful BBs Theme playing at precisely the moments it should. One slice of Low Roar particularly moved me near the story's conclusion as it accompanied a long drive towards fate, and is further proof that Death Stranding 2 feels like a delicately curated vision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course, no game of anywhere near this scale is all one man's doing, and credit should go to all of the Kojima Productions team for pulling off such a feat, whether it be in art direction, sound design, or the vastly improved combat mechanics. It also ran flawlessly in performance mode on my PS5 Pro, and Guerrilla Games deserves praise for the Decima Engine that Death Stranding 2 runs on. It’s a technical feat that allows for the artistry to shine through as intended.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>One of the big draws for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> was its cast of voice actors, as the turn-based RPG featured the talents of Charlie Cox, Ben Starr, Jennifer English, and Andy Serkis. For Cox, the critical success of the game has not gone unnoticed by him, as he remarked that he'd only heard good things about it. Jokingly, the Daredevil actor said that he felt like a "total fraud" for having only been in a studio for several hours to record his lines as Gustave, who quickly became a fan-favorite character with players.</p><p>"I don't mean to minimize it in any way, and apparently, the game is awesome. I'm not a gamer, I haven't played it," Cox said at Washington State Summer Con (via <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1937090360645390366" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Culture Crave</a>). "My agent asked me if I wanted to go and do a voiceover--I was in the studio for 4 hours. People keep saying 'congratulations' and I feel like a total fraud. But I'm so thrilled for the company, I'm so thrilled it did really well."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>While Cox's work for Expedition 33 was done in a day, his character still had a massive impact on the game, especially in its early hours and at the end of its first act. The performances of Cox and the rest of the cast have been widely hailed for their nuanced and emotional performances, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-is-no-longer-the-best-rated-game-of-2025/1100-6532565/">which helped make Expedition 33 the best-reviewed game for several months</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-exploring-more-localization-options-new-content/1100-6532452/">Developer Sandfall Interactive has also been talking about what's next for Expedition 33</a>. The studio is looking at adding "a wide range of future improvements" including expanded localization and accessibility features. Sandfall is also preparing to start working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-another-game-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-is-coming/1100-6531816/">on its next game</a>, and while it is ready to say what exactly its next title might be, the studio did mention that it has some "great ideas" to work with on it.</p>

<figure><a title="switch 2 indie dev kits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/751a6dce7f060/switch-2-indie-dev-kits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure><p>As we all know by now, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource#switch-2-overview-tldr">Switch 2</a> has been off to a rocket of a start in terms of its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-has-already-overtaken-the-combined-lifetime-sales-of-the-entire-xbox-series-family-and-ps5-pro-in-japan">hardware sales</a>, however, with regards to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">its current games lineup</a> — and with a particular eye on its indie offerings — there's certainly been quite a bit of heavy-lifting done by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> in these early days and weeks.</p>
<p>If you'd been expecting a few more Switch 2 indie offerings at this point, though, you aren't alone, and there's at least a reason for the relatively slow-going in these early days. Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/where-are-the-switch-2-indie-games">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, a bunch of indie devs have been explaining the pre-launch dev kit access situation, with some getting their hands on the necessary tech ages ago, whilst others are still waiting.</p>
<p>Tony Gowland, from Ant Workshop — the team behind the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/into_the_restless_ruins">Into the Restless Ruins</a> — says slow access to dev kits isn't a new thing, and that on Switch 2 Nintendo seems to be prioritising games that need the extra grunt. This tracks when we consider the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> (with Hello Games saying they'd been working on the Switch 2 port for a year when they <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/no-mans-sky-is-landing-a-free-nintendo-switch-2-edition-update-on-launch-day">announced the S2 version</a>), as it's a showy example of just how much better a game can be on the new console.</p>

<p>"In terms of dev kit availability, there has been a similar situation to the OG Switch, which was also like hen’s teeth for a good 6-7 months after launch" said Gowland, "The indie folks I know who have been successful in getting kits are working on games that are in need of the Switch 2’s extra oomph."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2</a>, which has gone down a treat on Switch 1 (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">we gave it a big old 9/10</a>), is one game that <em>was</em> aiming for a Switch 2 launch, but according to its creator, Gareth Damien Martin, it wasn't possible. Chris Wright, founder and managing director of Fellow Traveller, publisher of Citizen Sleeper 2, stated that they still don't have dev kits but that this is fairly normal, even if it can be irksome for an indie dev's plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s understandable that dev kits are heavily restricted before a console launch and they usually remain restricted for a while afterwards … The Switch 2 has been very normal in this regard and we didn’t expect to have access to kits ahead of launch...We're really keen to use things like the mouse controls in particular...Games like Citizen Sleeper will benefit from having mouse controls on the console."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the likes of Citizen Sleeper 2 at least, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/11-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">as with a whole bunch of other games from the previous console</a>, there is good news in that the game, when booted up on Switch 2, has ended up running with super-smooth frame rates, but in terms of honing, adding to, or improving your game for a new console launch, the access to dev tools is still far from ideal.</p>
<p>Wright's message is clear, "What we would like to see in the short-term is communication and clarity to indies on what we can expect...We’re very keen to support the platform and knowing a timeline would allow us to plan for that.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, both Unity and Unreal, two of the leading game engines, have Switch 2 compatibility, so things should be easier once the ball gets rolling properly. GameMaker, the 2D-focused engine used to create <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, is also fully Switch 2 compatible. Although Russell Kay, GameMaker's senior product manager, had to deal with some tight security around the dev kits ("We had to have a locked room, things like that, and only certain people had access to the kit"), he also seems relaxed and confident about the coming year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wouldn't be too worried, because all Switch games effectively work on [Switch 2]...There's a large catalogue of games already coming to Switch 1. Nintendo have done probably the best thing that they can...This time next year, it won't be a worry at all for anybody."<em><br></em></p>
</blockquote>

			<p>Where we’re going, we don’t need roads. Oh, how I wish that notable quotable from Doc Emmett Brown held true in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. Truth be told, in my sixty-some hours of playing, I perhaps spent most of those hours lugging massive quantities of metal and ceramics halfway across Australia, just to build out another mile-long section of tarmac to make my trip on Pickup Off-Roader. Sure, it’s a vehicle that should be used off roads, given the name, but the reward for fabricating a new stretch of highway is a smooth cruise past any pesky BTs or MULEs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DEATH-STRANDING-2_-ON-THE-BEACH_20250612213722-scaled.png"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> opens in a way that many Hollywood sequels do, years after the original: the protagonist, having settled down with the comforts of daily life and a family, is pulled out of retirement for one last job. In Sam Porter Bridges’ case, that’s to head south into the Mexican frontier to bring them into the chiral network, a post-internet-connection that permits the transfer of knowledge and resources across vast distances. It’s here that the player is onboarded back into the role of being a porter and bringing goods from one distant point to the next. It isn’t long before Sam’s daily life is upended by a new antagonist, forcing him out of early retirement for good and venturing out into an even further frontier: Australia.</p>
<p>Kojima Productions has leaned more into science fiction and the implausible with the concept of harnessing the power of The Beach, a metaphysical realm where the dead wait before proceeding into the afterlife. Despite a brief story recap before getting back into Sam’s boots, there’s still much to The Beach and how it connects worlds that would need an hour-long video essay to unpack truly. The narrative to <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> weaves together impossible concepts and strange interpretations on known supernatural forces so effortlessly into the story that it almost feels insane watching actors chat back and forth about bridge babies (BB’s, for short), stillborn mothers, timefall rain, and many other such examples as if these were commonplace in the world.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DEATH-STRANDING-2_-ON-THE-BEACH_20250621165148-1456x819.png"></a></figure>

<p>Some time during my time with Death Stranding 2 for review, after most of my articles from Summer Game Fest 2025 were put to paper and published, the online servers were intentionally shut down ahead of release. For that last week or two, I braved the Australian landscape all on my own with only a few remnants of players I had connected with prior still littering the paths. Each time I’d pass that introductory stretch of highway leading to the Western Environmental Observatory, I’d pass by a generator dedicated by YongYea or some other internet celebrity with early access to Death Stranding 2.</p>
<p>Over time, I would see all of the likes and Legend of Legends grades dedicated to one of these monuments and make it my personal goal to surpass them. After all, these were my only connections outside of the world that I was helping to rebuild solo on hours 25-50 of what I’ve played thus far. Perhaps if I spent less time hauling cargo to build out a highway all on my own, I would’ve gone on to finish Death Stranding 2 in time to fill out a complete review. As it stands, I’ve only seen enough of the story to reach the cutoff point that Kojima Productions requested to keep any spoilers down to a minimum. Going by a chapter count in the trophy list, I’m roughly halfway through the story (which isn’t saying much, as Death Stranding 2 features a similar chapter progression to the first game, with some chapters being played out in just a couple of story missions).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DEATH-STRANDING-2_-ON-THE-BEACH_20250622214655-1456x819.png"></a></figure>

<p>Combat remains a sore spot for me in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, much as it did in the first game. While the actual gunplay has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-could-last-nearly-twice-as-much-as-the-original-has-more-combat-because-people-ask-kojima-for-mgs/">massively improved</a>, with a much wider selection of less-than-lethal weaponry (and explosive ordinance/live ammunition when needed) at Sam’s disposal, the act of using it still feels cumbersome in the end. When it came time to clear a MULE base out to take back a mine they had hijacked, I felt much better playing it stealthily at long range with a silenced sniper rifle than I did trying to hit boots on the ground and take these enemy rogues out in CQC combat or with rubber pellet shotguns. The big, bombastic set-piece boss fights are also a bit of a chore and drawn out to where I’d much prefer to see the action played out in a well-directed cutscene versus actually taking part in it myself. I know that I’m in the minority here, especially with how well the combat feels, but I much prefer the laid-back aspects of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach to some of Hideo Kojima’s contemporaries.</p>

<p>Trying to sum up what makes Death Stranding 2: On the Beach such an interesting title is a gargantuan undertaking. What starts as a simple porter job, carrying parcels with love by foot from one point to the next slowly evolves into an adventure of building out infrastructure and automated networks, mining out resources in one corner of the map while traveling about to find a new hot spring fount or Australian wildlife to rescue for the local animal conservation in the next. Each time you feel like you’re getting a grasp on the porter loop, Kojima Productions throws in another system to contend with.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a world of both the familiar and the alien, of trails well-worn yet frontiers to be explored. So much of what made Kojima Productions’ first title such a unique experience is here, with something brand new to explore. Those looking for a comfortable walking simulator to transport goods by food and explore nature have exactly what they’re looking for, while those who come to Hideo Kojima’s works for the off-the-wall narrative and memorable fight scenes will also walk away satisfied with plenty to chat about online. This is one title that I’ve been taking my time with and enjoying at my own pace, even if that experience has been hauntingly lonely the past couple of weeks.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-reportedly-to-lay-off-over-100-employees.1225617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>developer Build a Rocket Boy is about to be hit by a wave of layoffs that could see around a third of employees at the studio lose their jobs.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a> (which cites "studio sources"), Build a Rocket Boy has begun the "standard 45-day consultation process" for layoffs. Under UK law, that process is triggered when employers propose to lay off 100 or more employees within 90 days, and according to IGN, that constitutes around a third of the studio's total headcount.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Build a Rocket Boy hasn't confirmed these layoffs itself yet, and the studio hasn't provided any official comment on the IGN report either, so we don't know for certain that they're happening.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report-shooting.jpg?itok=2Ytq0Xms 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report-shooting.jpg?itok=frLwVMSV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>developer Build a Rocket Boy appears to be laying off many of its employees.</figcaption></figure><p>While it's true Build a Rocket Boy hasn't officially confirmed the layoffs, they wouldn't come as too much of a surprise.</p>

<p><em>MindsEye</em>, which is the studio's first game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">suffered a disastrous launch</a> earlier this month, which reportedly saw even PlayStation offering refunds to players over the broken and glitchy state of the game at release.</p>

<p>Steam reviews for the game are currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at Mostly Negative</a> at time of writing, with players decrying not only abundant glitches and bugs, but also repetitive gameplay and a poorly-executed story. One player describes&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>as "absolute garbage with extremely high and unwarranted production value". Ouch.</p>

<p>Shortly after the game's launch, Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265250/view/520842118898385842" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">promised fixes</a> for some of its most egregious issues, including tech optimizations, reduced minigame difficulty, and other improvements.</p>




<p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>was originally intended to serve as the launch for an ambitious project spanning not only the single-player campaign, but also user-generated content and a stream of creations from the game's community. Given the state of its launch, though, it's very hard to see that happening.</p>

<p>If you really want to, you can check out&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/mindseye/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mindseye/9pj9wxk3v9fn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-2-is-much-more-approachable-if-you%E2%80%99re-prepared.1225614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It took me a long time to appreciate <em>Death Stranding</em>. I’m not even sure I fully got it after my initial playthrough, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima">which was equal parts mesmerizing and dull</a>. The game, in which you play as a postapocalyptic delivery man in a world ravaged by a breach with the afterlife, demands a lot from players. The gameplay is fiddly and frustrating, and the storyline is often inscrutable, at times seeming to make no sense. While it borrows elements from walking sims and stealth games, there’s nothing like <em>Death Stranding</em>, and so it’s hard to calibrate your expectations accordingly.</p><p>It really wasn’t until the end of the game that I felt I finally understood what director Hideo Kojima and his team were going for. And with all of that out of the way, playing the sequel was a more rewarding experience.</p><p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> is a direct follow-up. You once again control Sam (played by Norman Reedus), who now is living in hiding with his adopted child, Lou, after previously connecting all of America to an internet-like network by walking across the entire country. But it’s not long before his life of domestic bliss is interrupted. At the request of Fragile (Léa Seydoux), Sam agrees to connect Mexico as well, and, after strange gates begin appearing, he eventually heads to Australia to connect them too. Along the way, he continues to gain a deeper understanding of the event known as the death stranding, and does a lot of digging into where Lou actually came from.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kojima Productions</cite></p></div><p>Structurally, <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is very similar to the original. It’s all about taking on jobs. As Sam trudges across the continent, he makes lots of deliveries and completes other tasks, in the hopes of getting people on board with this new connected world. The future of <em>Death Stranding</em> is one of isolation; the landscape is bleak and empty, cities exist almost entirely independent of each other, and Sam mostly only encounters other humans through their holograms. Oh, and deadly ghost-like creatures haunt the landscape, which is what makes Sam — who has the rare ability to be able to return from the dead — the one person who can link everyone back up.</p><p>Practically, this means that the game is built around walking. Sam must prep for each trek carefully, loading up with weapons, traversal gear, healing items, and precious cargo. Then he walks the long distance from point A to point B, navigating rivers, mountains, and angry ghosts, all while staying balanced to keep the cargo safe. The big change in the sequel is that there is a great variety of missions, and it opens up much more quickly. You rapidly get more weapons (including guns with special bullets for fighting those ghosts, known as BTs) and tools to make things faster and easier, like 3D-printed trucks and trailers for transporting big orders.</p><p>The missions are generally more interesting. Sometimes you have to worry about keeping the cargo above a certain temperature; other times you’re tasked with rescuing a hostage. One of my favorite quests involved finding a kangaroo in the middle of a raging brushfire and returning it to a sanctuary. The Australian landscape is much harsher and more diverse, forcing you to also deal with strange creatures that sap your gear’s battery and epic-scale sandstorms. For the most part, the variety is very welcome, and helps break up the monotony that occasionally plagued the original. But some of the missions are a little too much like a typical action game, which <em>Death Stranding</em> does not excel at. Any time things devolve into combat, which is slow and clunky, the game loses a lot of its momentum and unique flavor.</p><p>There are other quality-of-life tweaks. Fragile and her crew — which includes a navigator named Tarman who has a pet demon cat and is modeled to look like <em>Mad Max</em> director George Miller — operate aboard a flying craft that can be used for fast travel. There’s also a robust codex for reading up on terms like “timefall” or “stillmother” that you might not understand, as well as a very helpful “story so far” section that I consulted every time I booted up the game.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kojima Productions</cite></p></div><p>The biggest change, though, is actually me — and the fact that I have some idea of what’s going on. That’s not to say that <em>Death Stranding 2</em> is any less weird. In fact, it might be even stranger than the original. Now you’re accompanied by a talking marionette called Dollman, and the new cast includes Shioli Kutsuna playing a woman who creates a healing rain (she’s named Rainy, naturally) and Elle Fanning as someone with mysterious powers that are somehow connected to her hatred of wearing shoes.</p><p>But with much of the narrative heavy lifting out of the way, I was ready for this, and able to lose myself in <em>Death Stranding 2</em> more easily. I still don’t understand everything, at least not fully. Even after dozens of hours with the original, I had to regularly refresh my memory on terms, while also trying to grasp new ones (there’s so much to learn about tar). But the basics that kept me in a state of confusion initially — who Sam is, why he carries a baby in a jar, what the heck a Beach is — are now part of my lexicon, letting me immerse myself a lot deeper into this world, and letting Kojima’s team get even weirder.</p><p>That might make <em>Death Stranding</em> a tough series to recommend for some. It’s possible it won’t fully click until you play one long and confusing game, and then jump into its similarly demanding, if more accessible, sequel. But for me, that struggle was worth the effort, because, again, there just isn’t anything like <em>Death Stranding</em>. It’s haunting, beautiful, and forced me to focus all of my attention on it, something that’s becoming increasingly rare in modern games. It can just take some time to get past that barrier.</p><p><sub>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach<em> launches on the PS5 on June 26th.</em></sub></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developers Build A Rocket Boy have reportedly initiated a redundancy process that could result in cuts affecting over 100 people.</p>
<p>This would follow the game's dire launch, which was plagued by bugs and performance issues, contributing to a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">largely negative</a> critical and player reception.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">IGN</a>, staff have been notified the 45 day consultation period <a href="https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights/consultation">required by UK law</a> when companies plan to enact 100 or more redundancies has begun today, June 23.</p>
<p>There's no concrete word as of yet as to exactly how many of Build A Rocket Boy's around 300 person UK workforce may be affected by the cuts, or whether any of the around 200 staff it has based abroad could also be at risk of being let go. IGN cites BARB co-CEO Mark Gerhard as insisting in an email to staff that the studio is still committed to working on MindsEye, and alluding to the switch in intensity between pre and post-launch development.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Build A Rocket Boy for comment.</p>
<p>If redundancies come to pass, this would be the second time the studio behind MindsEye has cut jobs this year. That February <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/build-a-rocket-boy-confirms-layoffs-weeks-after-raising-110-million">round of layoffs</a>, affecting a still unspecified number of staff, came not long after BARB <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-rockstar-north-boss-nets-110m-to-launch-what-sounds-a-lot-like-a-metaverse">secured $110 million</a> in private investment towards creating MindsEye, the metaversey platform called Everywhere that the game was initially supposed to launch as part of, and the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-future-of-gta-producers-everywhere-is-in-doubt-as-mindseye-adopts-its-creation-suite/">Arcadia UGC tools</a> that ended up becoming MindsEye's mission building/sharing bits.
</p>
<p>MindsEye launched on June 10, and Build A Rocket Boy have been quick to start releasing emergency patches to try and take care of its various bugs and issues, as well as attempting to improve how it runs on PC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseyes-dire-launch-has-reportedly-already-lead-build-a-rocket-boy-to-warn-staff-layoffs-could-be-incoming]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Witcher 3 director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and his fellow CDPR veterans at Rebel Wolves have shared an extended gameplay demo from the studio's first game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-blood-of-dawnwalker/" data-ref-id="5000-647970">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>. As revealed earlier this year, Dawnwalker's protagonist is Coen, a young man in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-look-at-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-reveals-a-medieval-world-ruled-by-vampires/1100-6528789/" data-ref-id="1100-6528789">a medieval European country that has been taken over by vampires</a>. But as seen in the video below, Coen has different ways of opposing the new regime, both as a vampire and as a human.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro8psdfcxJE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ro8psdfcxJE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to design director Daniel Sadowski, the side mission showcased in this demo takes place near the middle of the game. Coen only has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-3-directors-vampire-game-might-be-a-literal-time-suck/1100-6529556/" data-ref-id="1100-6529556">30 days and 30 nights</a> to save his family, and Sadowski notes that he could storm the vampire's castle and rescue them at any time. But without allies or enough power to stand against the game's most powerful vampires, that attempt probably wouldn't end well for Coen.</p><p>Coen isn't helpless during the day, as the demo shows he can draw upon some magic when fighting his foes. But none of his vampire abilities can be used while the sun is up. This allows for some advantages, as he can walk through the front door of the cathedral uncontested and ask questions inside. But waiting until nightfall gives Coen the ability to climb the walls and sneak inside just as an elder vampire, Xanthe, is conducting some kind of ritual.</p><p>Sadowski added that there's not much difference between the side quests and the main story, as players are given the chance to shape their own narratives within the 30 day timeframe. He also added that it may be possible to reason with Xanthe or even to defeat her. But she proves to be more than Coen can handle on this playthrough.</p><p>Bandai Namco will release The Blood of Dawnwalker on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <p>Actor Charlie Cox may be known to many in these parts for voicing Gustave in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, but even though the game has been met with critical acclaim, he personally feels "like a total fraud".</p>
<p>Why? Because it turns out that the actor recorded most of his lines in only about four hours as part of a voice over gig set up by his agent.</p>

<p>In a clip which has been circulated around social media, Cox revealed he is "not a gamer", and while he doesn't want to minimise Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in any way, he hasn't actually played it himself.</p>
<p>"Apparenly the game is awesome," Cox said in the clip, which was filmed during Washington State Summer Con 2025. The actor, who currently portrays Matt Murdoch/Daredevil in the Marvel universe, added he is "thrilled" for developer Sandfall Interactive, and the success its game has had.</p>
<p>"People keep saying how amazing it is," Cox said. All in all, it's a pretty wholesome little video. You can check out Cox's full comment via the embed below (I am afraid it is an X post).</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach unfolds with deliberate, slow grace. The opening moments depict Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) and his adoptive daughter, Lou, embarking on a reflective journey home, navigating a breathtakingly photorealistic landscape bathed in the golden hues of a setting sun. A gentle, melancholic song by Woodkid drifts across the scenery, perfectly underscoring the serenity of the moment as Sam engages in endearing conversation with Lou, her delighted giggles echoing across the landscape.</p>
<p>As the pair advances, the weather takes a turn for the worse, the scorching sunlight giving way to a deluge of rain that lashes down. Rivulets of water weave through jagged rock formations, and slick mud clings to Sam’s legs. The meticulous environmental detail is so exquisitely rendered that I half expected David Attenborough to start narrating, extolling the majesty of this digital wilderness. The cinematography in this game is superb – so good that I’ve taken hundreds of pictures during my playthrough, and I don’t usually use an in-game photo mode.</p>

<p>The introduction leads into a visit by the enigmatic Fragile (Léa Seydoux), who chain-smokes Gauloises with theatrical fervour to remind us she’s<em> really, really</em>, French. Their exchange sets in motion Sam’s next objective: a mission to Mexico, the border of which is conveniently located a short stroll away. Once again, Sam must undertake the Herculean task of reconnecting isolated Mexican settlements to the Chiral Network (WiFi that uses the land of the dead rather than cables – just go with it), mirroring the sprawling odyssey across the continental United States that defined the first instalment.</p>
<p>Mexico functions primarily as a four-hour introduction, essentially a prologue that doubles as a tutorial for those unfamiliar with the mechanics of the original game. It meticulously walks players through the fundamentals of arranging cargo, constructing roads, and evaluating terrain — every single aspect that returning players already mastered in the first instalment is re-explained through methodical missions. While there are nominal additions, the most conspicuous change is that Sam now carries a child, thereby losing his ability to detect Beached Things (BTs) at a distance. In addition – prepare yourselves for this groundbreaking revelation — an experience points system has been added, offering marginal enhancements.</p>

<p>At this point, I began to grow concerned for what was to come. While there are a few moments of Kojima’s typical absurdity, there is also an awful lot of repetition from the first game, and while that is not a bad thing – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review-ps4-pro/">I did give that game 10/10</a>, after all – it did leave me feeling disappointed.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460873">The Plate Gate that allows travel between Mexico and Australia.</p>
<p>The repetition is most obvious in the graphics and audio, which remain largely indistinguishable from its predecessor. The models and animations have undergone little to no evolution, the sound effects are recycled, and Mexico and every other region you traverse bears a striking uniformity. Deserts, forests, grasslands, and snowy peaks are all represented, yet they are so generically rendered that, without a label on a map, it would be impossible to say if you are walking to Mexico City, Melbourne, or Manchester. A core appeal of post-apocalyptic settings lies in the thrill of uncovering iconic landmarks in ruin – tangible remnants of a once-familiar world. As some pre-Death Stranding architecture remains intact within the game it would have helped to include the decimated husk of the Sydney Opera House in a distant corner of the map, simply to provide a geographic anchor.</p>
<p data-start="80" data-end="864">The majority of its innovations are, in essence, minor refinements of mechanics already present in the original game. Take, for instance, the Cargo Cannons. They return from the original, but can now fire grenades so you can use them as improvised weaponry. While mildly amusing, this is hardly the kind of inventive thinking one has come to expect from a Kojima production.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460874">Tar Man meets the utterly adorable Tar Kitty.</p>
<p>Even mission design suffers from repetition. The ridiculous timed pizza delivery returns, complete with identical constraints: keep the box perfectly level and arrive within a strict time limit. Was there truly no time over five years to reimagine this task with something more novel? A precariously stacked tower of gourmet burgers, perhaps, or a box of delicately fragranced chicken wings susceptible to jostling? Instead, we are given a recycled objective that reinforces the feeling that this sequel is struggling to forge a distinct identity beyond that of its predecessor.</p>
<p>What I’m playing is a retread of the same surreal Kojima flourishes: infants sealed in artificial wombs, viscous tar-like apparitions, spectral entities lurking in the mist. All were new and exciting in the first game, but now they barely register a reaction. From a world-building perspective, the stagnation is at least narratively justified—the sequel unfolds a mere nine months after the events of Death Stranding<i>—</i>but from a creative standpoint the experience feels, and I can scarcely believe I’m applying this word to a Kojima production, indolent.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460875">The team discuss their next move.</p>
<p>The entire Mexico segment is narratively dispensable, save for a fleeting appearance by Higgs (Troy Baker), and once a pivotal moment takes Sam toward Australia, the game reverts to the precise framework of Death Stranding. Once again, Sam is equipped with a Bridge Baby (BB) contained in a pod and once again, the player is tasked with methodical traversal, network reconnection, and infrastructural expansion. It’s not until ten hours in that the actual narrative begins to emerge with the introduction of Tomorrow (Elle Fanning) and Neil (Luca Marinelli), the latter assuming a role strikingly similar to that of Mads Mikkelsen in the first game: a morally ambiguous figure trapped in a Chiral purgatory, this time resembling a nightmare version of Mexico, who pursues Sam with a battalion of spectral soldiers. Soon after, we meet Rainy (Shioli Kutsuna), and if you fail to deduce her abilities just before embarking on a mission involving a forest fire, congratulations, the ensuing reveal may still surprise you. The rest of us are unlikely to be so fortunate.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460871">Sam goes surfing on a coffin.</p>
<p>While there’s so much familiarity, your gradual expansion of the Chiral Network and infrastructure is still strangely satisfying,&nbsp;and before long I found myself engaging in side missions and obsessively completing every stretch of road. Alongside all the returning tools from DS1 is the DHV Magellan, a tar-based craft that appears near settlements once they are brought online. This mobile base allows for instantaneous transport between regions, including all stored cargo and even vehicles. Instead of laboriously driving across terrain, I could load up a truck with materials, drive it into the DHV Magellan, and teleport across the map in moments, although the game does disable this mode of transport at key points so you do have to do some of the hard work. Another substantial addition is the monorail system: construct the full line, and you and an impressive amount of cargo can go soaring above hostile landscapes with ease.</p>
<p>Your progress is still bound to the same upgrades as found in DS1, even if that makes little sense when Australia is meant to exist within the same Chiral Network as the US – surely Sam should be able to fabricate everything already? A few additions stand out though, such as the introduction of teleportation devices and, most delightfully, a high-velocity Coffin Surfboard. Yes, a coffin that doubles as a surfboard, capable of gliding at great speed across any terrain including water, snow and tar. During combat, you can even leap inside and momentarily escape into the realm of the dead.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460876">Neil, his soldiers, and an awful lot of fireworks. You have to see this in motion it is spectacular!</p>
<p>The asynchronous multiplayer connectivity found in Death Stranding returns in its sequel, allowing players to once again encounter structures, signs, and vehicles left behind by others as they traverse the world. This seems to be have been significantly amplified with overly generous results. Strategic mission planning becomes redundant when ladders, ropes, and other structures appear with uncanny precision wherever you might require them. I quickly abandoned the effort of carefully equipping myself, knowing that, inevitably, another player would have placed the precise tool or building I needed at the optimal location. There is an option to limit the amount of help you receive, so I suggest you turn that on from the start.</p>
<p>Combat encounters remain a highlight and raiding human encampments provide thrills and spectacle. The gunplay feels substantial and tactile—evocative of Killzone in its weight—and the enemy AI behaves with satisfying realism. Higgs’ robotic legions are deployed sparingly, but when they do appear the mix of humanoid and bestial adversaries brings a welcome unpredictability to encounters. These animalistic foes pounce from afar or dart past you with sudden ferocity making them a very different enemies from the humanoids.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460877">Is this Mexico, the USA, Australia, or Croydon? Who can tell.</p>
<p>There are hints at new gameplay mechanics, though they often falter in execution. One mission tasked me with recapturing an escaped kangaroo for Chvrches , the real-world pop group who make a suitably surreal cameo. I had high hopes: perhaps a mini-game involving stealth or pursuit but I instead walked up to the animal,&nbsp; wrangled it into a container, and completed the objective. Likewise there are now Gate Quakes which shudder the land and can trigger an avalanche or rockfall. However. most of the time the screen shakes and not a single pebble moves, a random boulder plummeting down a hill would have added some excitement, even if it was off in the distance.</p>
<p>BTs, the tar-drenched phantoms that were a constant presence in DS1 are less of a threat as vast swaths of the map are devoid of of them. I found myself missing the tension of barrelling down a highway only to be abruptly confronted by squid-like terror erupting from the earth. When they do appear, there are some new variants, the most compelling of which is a colossal winged entity that soars overhead, deploying explosive payloads and countermeasures with the sophistication of a modern aircraft. Their seemingly erratic design belies a deeper narrative significance which is revealed in an epic battle near the game’s conclusion.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460879">More deliveries than Amazon.</p>
<p>Given just how deeply reminiscent so much of this game is to its predecessor, I feared the experience might conclude without anything exceptional. It’s a sequel, so there’s bound to be common ground, but it feels like the second episode of a TV series rather than a blockbuster movie sequel. That is until Hideo Kojima metaphorically bursts onto the stage after 30 hours and the game descended into glorious, unhinged chaos. The story, which had until that point been a personal tale with subtlety and emotional restraint, suddenly swerves into a realm of outrageous, genre-defying spectacle. A late-game revelation left me so stupefied I had to pause for half an hour and process exactly what I had been told. Somehow, it makes sense within Kojima’s meticulously crafted mythology, but it is unquestionably batshit insane. Even if you had a hundred years, you would never guess what had been going on.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 ends on a high – a deliriously absurd, emotionally resonant, and breathtakingly bold high. I whooped. I laughed. I cursed. I even shed a tear. It was, without question, the most fun I’ve had in a game this year. Troy Baker absolutely steals the show in these final hours, delivering a performance that channels the anarchic menace of Heath Ledger’s Joker, amplified to eleventy-stupid. Norman Reedus, largely reserved throughout the journey and communicating in terse grunts, also steps into the spotlight with a moment of genuine pathos and gravitas to deliver at just the right time.</p>

<h2>How Do You Play&nbsp;the<em>&nbsp;HeroScape Age of Annihilation </em>Master Set?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-attack-example.jpg?itok=UX75SaM1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-attack-example.jpg?itok=y5CdWzSR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In this example, the player on the left rolled two skulls to attack while the defending only rolled 1 shield, so defender takes one damage - simple as that!</figcaption></figure><p><em>HeroScape: Age of Annihilation</em>&nbsp;is a very straightforward skirmish wargame, which sees players assigning Order Markers to their units and activating them to move and attack if in range. The game focuses a lot on movement, with easy-to-build hex-based terrain. Some characters can fly, but for most of them, you'll be carefully examining the height and distance of your opponent's characters.</p>

<p>Combat is simple as can be, with attackers rolling a number of dice equal to their attack value, and defenders rolling dice equal to their defense. It's all extremely accessible, and that accessibility is only increased by inclusion of "simple" and "master" sides to every character card. This allows younger players, or people less familiar with more complicated wargaming rulesets, to get into the fight.</p>

<p>The "master" side of each character or squad's card is where we get a bit more into the weeds, but nothing on these cards is so complicated as to bring this game into the realm of a crunchier skirmish wargame. This is a system I'm quickly growing to love, and it all comes from this incredible assortment of quirky and clever characters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-activation-example.jpg?itok=s7SL-wsO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-activation-example.jpg?itok=2qy_ORZd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even tracking who attacks when is easy, with players assigning these tokens (and one fake-out token) to their character cards. You can even double up on a card to have it activate multiple times!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Characters of the&nbsp;<em>HeroScape Age of Annihilation</em> Master Set</h2>

<p>From undead warriors to four-armed robot admirals, giant dragons to cybernetically augmented polar bears, the characters in this game are absolutely the heart and soul of&nbsp;<em>HeroScape</em>, and the twenty different figures included in the Master Set are iconic. I'll speak briefly here about each character and squad. Without getting too in-the-weeds about their specific stats, we can still get the flavor of each.</p>

<h3>Admiral EJ-1M</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-admiral-ej-1m.jpg?itok=fv4Mcigw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-admiral-ej-1m.jpg?itok=hKGsHrZ2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Admiral EJ-1M is, first and foremost, one of the most striking looking figures in the box! His ability to move order tokens you place on him onto other pirate or captain models makes him incredibly tricky, as does his special ability that lets him move your other pirates around.</p>

<h3>Dorim The Bulkhead Brawler</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-dorim-dwarf.jpg?itok=qfOzFplJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-dorim-dwarf.jpg?itok=ku8Zv4GE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Next up is this hearty Dwarf, Dorim! While his charge ability only works with other creatures who can bond with him and jump in line before their order token is revealed, his static ability to re-roll one of his four attack dice is pretty huge! And even though I'm not a huge fan of steampunk aesthetics, I have to say I like his swashbuckling look.</p>

<h3>Loviatäk The Kyrie Warrior + Exiles of the Sundered Seas</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-kyrie.jpg?itok=9Ob8qI1g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-kyrie.jpg?itok=b0dzihvu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Loviatäk The Kyrie Warrior, with her fiery red skin and leathery black wings, wields a battle-axe and exudes a Brutality Aura that allows another squad figure in her range to re-roll their attacks. And if you build around her, adding 1 to the move value of your entire army is pretty huge!</p>

<p>And as for the squad also pictured in this image, these pirates are as slippery as a space-eel! You can upgrade their range by 4 spaces with a special ability, attempt to roll your way out of ranged damage, and can slide out of a fight without getting hit (the game has a similar mechanic to attacks of opportunity ala&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D</em>, or disengagement attacks you see in most wargames).</p>

<h3>Misaerx The Kyrie Warrior</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-misarex.jpg?itok=KIZGGiQE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-misarex.jpg?itok=R9NoOoHJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Misaerx The Kyrie Warrior really showcases what I love about this game - they're willing to let a character be, for lack of a better term, a "one trick pony."</p>

<p>She life-drains your opponents, and when she dies, you place her on another Unique hero you control and now&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;life-drain. In another game system, this would be cluttered with other abilities, over-complicated, but here - Renegade just lets the design breathe a bit!</p>

<h3>Knaves of the Silver Scimitar</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-pirates.jpg?itok=l4r8taUu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-pirates.jpg?itok=Mk3fw_HQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Knaves of the Silver Scimitar - yes,&nbsp;<em>more&nbsp;</em>pirates - really care about having a captain. Like any good crew, they allow you to sneak in a turn with their captain first, and gain an additional defense die when they can see their cap'n. They also gain extra attack dice when they run in to fight, and can slip away like other pirates we've seen.</p>

<p>What I think most draws me to these figures is the way they each have a very different look, but clearly belong to the same crew. If you look carefully, you wouldn't need to tell from the character card that these four belong together - though they're different species and have different dress - that's just good design!</p>

<h3>Knight Irene and the Frostclaw Paladins</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-polar-bears.jpg?itok=dA1XqoqO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-polar-bears.jpg?itok=BCdt_Xly 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Knight Irene is an absolutely hulking figure with a lot of mobility on her card thanks to her "Run 3" special ability, which lets her trade attack dice for running speed. So cover the distance with her, and then next turn you can overwhelm with an attack dealing extra dice!</p>

<p>Pair her with her Frostclaw Paladins, and you've got a very nasty combo here - they also have Run 3, but are also bonded with a Jandar Champion (which Knight Irene is). This will allow you to take an extra turn with Knight Irene (regardless of whether she's activated or even has an order token on her)!</p>

<h3>Raakchott, Steward Of Death</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-raakchott.jpg?itok=dqxlVio1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-raakchott.jpg?itok=V2JffFBu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a name like Raakchott, Steward of Death it's got to be good! And while you can't make use of her Command Familiar ability out of the box (there are no small or medium beasts), her Soul Fury special attack is one of the only Area of Effect attacks in the box, letting you dish out a massive blast of soul energy to everyone adjacent to you!</p>

<p>But let's be real, the best part about this character is the absolutely unhinged and awesome design of the miniature itself. A malevolent (is it malevolent, I honestly don't know) force of death crafted from twisting vines, branches, and dead animal bones? Sign me up!</p>

<h3>Raelin The Kyrie Warrior</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-raelin.jpg?itok=EoxqLn4g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-raelin.jpg?itok=qfq75guV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Raelin the Kyrie Warrior is one of the two figures in the box that take up more space on the board, and she's absolutely fantastic looking! And this is another big, important model with very clean and uncomplicated design. If your enemies are within 4 spaces of her, she scares them and they roll 1 less Defense die.</p>

<p>And if she inflicts at least 1 wound in a normal attack, she's auto-dealing another wound. In short: She's scary and she hits hard! What's not to love?</p>

<h3>Xenithrax The Vineweaver</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-xenithrax.jpg?itok=aZIL5s0X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-xenithrax.jpg?itok=EE5cAFEi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, let's talk about the biggest model in the box, the majestic Xenithrax The Vineweaver! Clocking in at 200 points, Xenithrax can lay vines down on the board which lower the attack and defense value of anyone on them, and their Erupting Earth Special Attack allows you to chain attacks, hitting adjacent enemy after adjacent enemy if they're all lined up next to each other.</p>

<p>Hitting hard, flying around the board, making it harder for non-flying characters to get around - Xenithrax is truly a setpiece character, and one of my favorites to play around with on the board.</p>

<h2>Do I Need To Build Around Army Factions?</h2>

<p>No! You don't need to build around various Army Factions, creatures types, or any other restrictions when building your battle forces in the&nbsp;<em>HeroScape Age of Annihilation</em>&nbsp;Master Set (or the game at large) - which makes army building so unique. If I want my polar bear Paladins to partner up with a bunch of pirates, that's fine! It may not be the most synergistic, but if I'm having fun - or can think of other cool ways different units interact, that's all that matters.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-feature-shot.jpg?itok=9L1NwdJe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-feature-shot.jpg?itok=4_id2BFn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>HeroScape Age of Annihilation Master Set - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>What can I say, I'm completely blown away by this new iteration of&nbsp;<em>HeroScape</em>&nbsp;- I never played it when it first came around, so I really didn't know what to expect coming into Renegade's new take on the game. Though, to be fair, it's not really a new take, since all old figures ever produced for <em>HeroScape </em>are compatible with the new version of the game - which we love to see!</p>

<p>With crystal clear rules, great miniature design, and approachability for all levels of gameplay, this is both an entry-level game&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;a can be delved for more strategic depths by simply flipping your cards over to the Master side. I can't recommend this game enough if you're a fan of skirmish gaming.</p>
