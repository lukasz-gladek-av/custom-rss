            <p>Good news, ghost-hunting fans - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s genre-defining voice recognition feature is coming to consoles.</p>
<p>Although PC players have long been able to experience the horror game with the added stress of voice recognition, the October console release shipped initially without the feature.</p>

<p>Now, however, Kinetic said the feature is ready to go on both PS5 and Xbox consoles, enabling console players to try out the voice prompts for equipment like the Spirit Box and Ouija Board, as well as Monkey Paw.</p>
<p>The delay of some of Phasmo's fan-favourite equipment and tools hasn't put console players off, however - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-marks-22m-total-sales-with-its-2025-roadmap-and-changes-to-maps-kit-and-our-humble-journal">the ghost-hunting sim has sold two million copies on console</a> since it came out of early access last October, bringing the total sales across all platforms to 22 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-marks-22m-total-sales-with-its-2025-roadmap-and-changes-to-maps-kit-and-our-humble-journal">Phasmophobia outlined the road ahead for the spooky sim in 2025</a>, confirming map reworks, new ghost-hunting equipment, "thrilling seasonal events", and a brand-new location, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, you could roll a new character and grind to max level a second time…or you could swap games for a bit while you wait for the next <em>Diablo 4 </em>season start date.

The 2021 RPG released to favorable reviews but didn't break into the mainstream. But now we live in a post-<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> world, which rocked the gaming industry (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/" data-ref-id="1100-6519739">GameSpot named it our Game of the Year in 2023</a>), and dice-based games are getting a spotlight they previously didn't have. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solasta-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-654962">Solasta II</a> is launching into a far more favorable position than its predecessor, and feels like it could be a great game for folks who enjoyed Baldur's Gate 3 but now want a game that more closely aligns with the experience of playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p dir="ltr">I played about an hour of Solasta II and the most striking part of the demo was how closely the game more strictly sticks to the parameters of D&amp;D 5e in comparison to a game like Baldur's Gate 3. You can't, for example, drink a health potion and melee attack on the same turn. Baldur's Gate 3 adopts the commonly homebrewed rule (and now official rule in the latest edition of D&amp;D) that considers drinking a health potion to be a bonus action and not an action, so you could reserve your action to attack and then use your bonus action to heal on the same turn. That's not how it works in the rules for D&amp;D 5e, so that's not how it works in Solasta II. This parallel seems to extend across Solasta II and although I appreciate the accuracy, it does highlight some of the problems with D&amp;D 5e that games like Baldur's Gate 3 have already circumnavigated by outright changing how they work.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448454-ss_a2f5cc428942714e8b9c11bfd4bd30c225755257.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448454" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448454-ss_a2f5cc428942714e8b9c11bfd4bd30c225755257.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448454"></a><figcaption>Different members of the party will want to solve problems differently and sometimes have unique skill checks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448454-ss_a2f5cc428942714e8b9c11bfd4bd30c225755257.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Ignoring the comparisons to Baldur's Gate 3, the combat otherwise feels great. Figuring out when to use my Rogue's unique cunning action ability to bonus action dash so I can save her main action to attack an enemy being flanked by the Fighter (a scenario that lets me add sneak attack damage!) felt awesome. I was repeatedly rewarded for thinking things through before engaging a target. Knowing when and how to use resources is paramount as Solasta II tracks ammunition (so I had to keep count of how many arrows my short bow-wielding sorcerer had on him, for example), and there even seems to be a risk-versus-reward consideration tied to the rest mechanic, as the first time I tried to camp to regain health and recharge the party's abilities, one of the members of the party cryptically warned that doing so might cause enough time to pass, meaning I'd potentially miss out on future storylines. That added a sense of urgency to what seemed to be an optional quest in the demo, but I'm curious to see if this same feeling is applied to portions of the main storyline as well and how often resting might cause a player to miss out on a quest.</p><p dir="ltr">The critical path sees you take control of four adventurers--a dwarf, elf, human, and gnome--who are adoptive siblings. These brothers and sisters are traveling together as part of some sort of quest connected to their adopted family name and the legacy they've all inherited, which brings them into conflict with an ancient threat. It all seems like your traditional fantasy affair, but I only saw a snippet of this plot play out in the demo. The voice acting sounds great, and though face models sometimes descend into the uncanny valley, they're more often expressive and help bring added emotion to the scene that you, as a player, can pick up even if the four protagonists all failed their Insight checks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448456-ss_ab26a62f7b0b78fd46dfe698474191e75b2191f8.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448456" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448456-ss_ab26a62f7b0b78fd46dfe698474191e75b2191f8.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448456"></a><figcaption>Combat in Solasta II follows D&amp;D 5's rules.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448456-ss_ab26a62f7b0b78fd46dfe698474191e75b2191f8.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm most curious to see how the full game will handle the roleplaying side of things. Unlike other RPGs in which you build a party of characters with different strengths and weaknesses, but only one member of the team talks during conversations, all four members of the adventuring party in Solasta II are fully voiced and contribute to every conversation. The game lists all the available dialogue options for each party member and which bonuses each one adds to the dice roll--you can see how the dwarf Paladin's high Persuasion makes him more adept at convincing someone to help you while the human Fighter's high Insight lets her be the better choice to tell whether the person you're talking to is lying.</p><p dir="ltr">That's really cool and feels like it has the potential to replicate the essence of being a group, as opposed to a talented spokesperson at the head of a squad, like Mass Effect's Shepard or Baldur's Gate 3's Tav. The demo didn't offer an opportunity to see how the effects of conversations could steamroll into consequences, stopping me from definitively proclaiming that this is the type of squad-focused, choice-driven dialogue I've wanted in my fantasy RPGs. But I see the potential vision and I'm excited to see how it pans out in the full game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448457-ss_1877caf6cd5a36481af522878835d1418fd12204.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448457" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448457-ss_1877caf6cd5a36481af522878835d1418fd12204.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448457"></a><figcaption>The facial animations in Solasta II look pretty good!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448457-ss_1877caf6cd5a36481af522878835d1418fd12204.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each of the four characters can also be controlled as a group or independently with the keyboard instead of mouse clicks outside of battle, making it easier to guide them in comparison to similar RPGs. This makes stealth and thievery a viable strategy, which is rare in games like this, as the more precise movements ensure getting around enemy vision cones isn't a frustrating ordeal.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm still undecided on Solasta II. On one hand, it follows D&amp;D 5e's original rules to the letter, a 2014 tabletop system that has been iterated, expanded, and improved upon in the past 10 years. And keeping to rules without taking steps to change it might make for a game that is ultimately frustrating for players who have appreciated the efforts made by other developers in recent years. But the game takes strides in areas outside of combat that feel like vast improvements, like giving the player more precise control over how the protagonists move and bringing the full party into each conversation instead of having only one hero be the go-to voice. This is certainly a game I want to play more of, but I'll need more time with it before deciding where I land on it.</p><p dir="ltr">Solasta II is set to launch for PC. No release window has been announced but there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975950/Solasta_II/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free demo on Steam</a> if you want to try it out for yourself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/617336/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The fuzz of the cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitor, alongside static grains and flickering scanlines, is a touchstone for ’90s-era nostalgia. It’s shorthand for those halcyon days when technology was predominantly analog and millennial kids spent their summers shoving bulky tapes into VHS players, recording favorite bits of their after-school television shows, and making their own home videos with camcorders. It’s this vignette that developer Don’t Nod Montréal leans heavily into in <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage. </em>The game follows a blossoming friendship — and apparent falling-out — of four teenagers over an unforgettable summer. And it all starts with a good dose of that nostalgia: the ubiquitously blue anti-drug message that precedes the title screen, complete with the telltale flicker of a CRT monitor.</p><p>Such adolescent longing is all par for the course for Don’t Nod. Alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17934166/telltale-games-studio-closed-layoffs-end-the-walking-dead">Telltale</a>, the studio popularized the choose-your-own-adventure style of narrative games with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up">Life is Strange</a></em>, while foregrounding the outsized pain and tribulations of teenhood. But more than just coating teenage drama in a layer of dreamy nostalgia, <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is also an opportunity for Don’t Nod to write a story based in familiar settings. The era already has its own vocabulary and culture; it’s the era of riot grrrl, Bikini Kill, <em>The</em> <em>Blair Witch Project</em>, and video rental stores. Doing so helps <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> avoid the criticism of penning teenage slang and using outdated references that sound like they’re written by much older adults. This means a lot less “hella cool” and more “let’s bounce,” which is <em>definitely </em>a phrase I remember using as a teenager.</p><p>At first glance, <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> looks like another <em>Life is Strange</em>. Every moment is infused with the same emotional weight the series is known for, be it standing up to a bully or excitedly gushing about your new best friend to your cat. Then there’s the tinge of the supernatural. But while promising, it’s a tad early to see if <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> can surpass the juggernaut that was the original <em>Life is Strange</em>. That’s because <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> is a two-part adventure game — a nod to the episodic roots of its forebears — with the second half of the game expected to release in mid-April this year.</p><p>Set in the small town of Velvet Cove, you’ll play as Swann, one of the four central teenagers. The story is depicted across two time periods: the present-day Swann as an adult meeting her long-lost friends decades later, and her earlier days as an awkward teenager during the summer of ’95.</p><p>The first few minutes of <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> neatly set the stage. At first, the adult Swann is struggling with a tedious, mostly one-sided conversation with her mother over the phone, and she can choose to respond meekly, with indifference, or mere silence. Meanwhile, lots of objects in the vicinity are available for her to fiddle with: a receipt, some brochures, and even a bottle of maple syrup. While examining these will cause Swann’s mother to chide her for being distracted, this also demonstrates how Don’t Nod is expanding the ways in which dialogue can play out. You can look at specific objects and this will, at times, open up new dialogue choices that can influence your current and future conversations with other characters. It’s a small addition, but it helps make conversations feel more authentic, rather than simply choosing between binary choices of playing nice or being rude.</p><p>Flashbacks to Swann’s younger days make up the bulk of <em>Bloom &amp; Rage’</em>s first half, with the teenager navigating the thorny passage of adolescent friendships. In the beginning, Swann is a loner, largely reluctant to socialize and too awkward to belong anywhere — the familiar plight of every millennial teenager. Spending her days memorializing almost every waking moment with a camcorder, Swann will meticulously record clips of anything that catches her eye, before putting them together to make short films. Aside from the conversations, documenting Swann’s everyday life is the game’s central conceit, a bold gamble given how this can feel like busywork at first.</p><p>From fulfilling objectives that move the storyline along, such as filming the local video store (it’s one of Swann’s favorite haunts), to discovering collectibles in the form of crude graffiti and exotic birds, this almost reduces the game to an object-hunting adventure. Eventually, you may develop the tendency to just whip out the camcorder the moment cutscenes conclude. But there’s a lingering charm to this approach, highlighting how Swann tends to instinctively interact with the people around her through her camcorder. Making films is the one thing that empowers her. This is all the more poignant as she eventually comes out of her shell and hides less behind her lens.</p><p>And then there are Swann’s newfound friends — Nora, Autumn, and Kat — who similarly are more than just one-dimensional caricatures. There’s Nora who, for all her bravado and punk rock sensibilities, is one of the most conflict-averse individuals in the group and the quickest to suggest giving up when they get into trouble. Then there are seemingly villainous folks who are more multifaceted than what their initial hostility suggests, which isn’t revealed until you examine their behavior and personal artifacts.</p><p>These point toward complexities that a young Swann may not fully comprehend, evident in some of her childlike responses, but that the older Swann — and by extension, the player — can probably recognize. This is what Don’t Nod has always been adept at: crafting believable and deeply human characters and the abundant world that they inhabit.</p><p>Experiencing the idyllic memories of Swann’s days with her friends can be deeply emotional, as if chancing upon a time capsule you’ve forgotten about. These are long-buried moments about engaging in hours-long phone calls with close friends, partaking in rambunctious activities on the fly, and waxing lyrical about larger-than-life ambitions, like playing in famous bands or living in a secret getaway, hidden from the prying eyes of untrustworthy adults.</p><p>Seeing Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat trade lifelong promises and form intense bonds — ones so characteristic of deep female friendships — will hit close to home for many. It’s this juxtaposition between these idyllic scenes and the constant, foreboding reminder of the group’s inevitable fallout that feels so ominous, unnerving, and perhaps a little painful. And the vague, supernatural happenings only serve to heighten the anxieties of teenhood. Whether it serves a deeper, more metaphorical purpose still remains to be seen. </p><p>The first half of <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em> ends in a dramatic cliffhanger, of course, but it’s one that’s not quite as audacious as it seems. Some hints have been hiding in plain sight. But a small concern lingers. Stories like these often introduce so many twists that could derail the game, before the story goes off the rails so quickly that it inevitably plummets. This was partly why the recently released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289524/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-pc-ps5-xbox"><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em></a> faltered in its concluding chapters. For now, there’s plenty of time to wonder; we still have to wait two more months or so for <em>Bloom &amp; Rage</em>’s melodramatic conclusion.</p><p><sub>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage <em>is available now on PC, PS5, and Xbox.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>NetEase is reportedly pulling back on its international game investments.</p>
<p>The Chinese megacorp's backtrack commenced at the end of last year when it cut jobs and/or "paused" productions at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Jar of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Sword</a>, but now <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts">Game File</a> reports the company is "actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios" in the hope of divestiture.</p>

<p>Sources talking to Game File under the promise of anonymity claim NetEase plans to divest itself of the majority of its overseas teams. If they can't secure a buyer, studios like Quantic Dream and Grasshopper Manufacture could face closure.</p>
<p>Other studios at risk include Anchor Point, GPTRACK50, Jackalyptic Games, Nagoshi, Pincool, Rebel Wolves, Skybox Labs, Studio Flare, T-Minus Zero Entertainment, and more.</p>
<p>NetEase declined to comment formally but told Game File: "All studios and projects are in constant review and evaluation, and NetEase will determine changes needed to be made throughout that process".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Matt reported that Marvel Rivals - which has been a huge success for publisher NetEase since its launch last year - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-was-reportedly-almost-cancelled-at-one-point-because-netease-objected-to-paying-disney">reportedly almost didn't make it to release</a> as its CEO objected to paying Disney for the use of its characters.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was poised to show Valve isn’t the only one that can build an affordable, portable, potent handheld gaming PC — you just need the right design and the right OS. </p><p>I was intrigued <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">when Valve’s own Steam Deck designers told me</a> this Windows handheld would double as the first authorized third-party SteamOS handheld this May. When I heard Lenovo had procured an exclusive AMD chip that would help that SteamOS version hit $499, I got excited for a true Steam Deck competitor. </p><p>But I’m afraid that chip ain’t it. </p><p>I’ve spent weeks living with a Legion Go S powered by AMD’s Z2 Go, the same chip slated to appear in that $499 handheld. I’ve used it with both Windows and Bazzite, a SteamOS-like Linux distro <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">that eliminates many of Windows’ most annoying quirks</a>. I tested both directly against <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">a Steam Deck OLED</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">original Legion Go</a>, expecting to find it between the two in terms of performance and battery life. But that’s not what I found.</p><p>Watt for watt, its Z2 Go chip simply can’t compete with the Steam Deck, and it’s far weaker than the Z1 Extreme in last year’s handhelds. That’s inexcusable at the $730 price you’ll currently pay for the Windows version, and I won’t be the first reviewer to say so. But with this less efficient chip and a mere 55 watt-hour battery, I worry the Legion Go S isn’t a good choice at all.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->730</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Good ergonomics</li><li>Great variable refresh rate screen</li><li>Powerful cooling</li><li>Fast 100W charging</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Performance is too low</li><li>Windows is bloated and can’t be trusted to sleep</li><li>Somewhat slippery texture</li><li>Nearly useless touchpad</li></ul></div></div></div><p>I <em>want</em> to say that the Legion Go S “makes a great first impression,” but Windows 11 still features a terrible out-of-box experience. I spent nearly 45 minutes waiting for mandatory updates to install and dismissing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196408/dark-patterns-are-everywhere">dark-patterned</a> offers for Microsoft products that have no business being on my handheld gaming machine. </p><p>Still, the Go S is built far better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">the original Legion Go</a>, whose flat-faced controllers felt awkward in my hands. The new portable has some of the best-sculpted grips I’ve felt on a handheld, though their smooth texture can feel a little slippery. I’d have gone with more aggressive stippling to help me hold its 1.61-pound weight.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But its buttons all feel precise and secure, if the triggers are longer than I’d like, and its concave-topped, drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks feel comfy and wonderfully smooth to spin. The only weak control is the touchpad, which is so tiny I flick repeatedly to move the cursor an inch at a time.</p><p>Audio is much improved from front-facing speakers, and a larger fan moves more air while staying quieter than before. And it’s one of the fastest-charging handhelds yet — I clocked each of its top-mounted USB 4 ports drawing a full 100 watts of USB-C PD power during actual use. The cooling and charging are so good, Lenovo lets you crank the chip up to 40-watt TDP while it’s plugged in or 33 watts on battery alone.</p><p>But as you’ll see in my benchmark charts, the Z2 Go simply isn’t in the same ballpark as the Steam Deck OLED’s “Sephiroth” chip. In some games, it can’t beat the Steam Deck at all, even if you plug it in and crank it all the way up. </p><div><h2>Legion Go S 720p benchmarks</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Z2 Go)</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go (Z1 Extreme)</h3></th><th><h3>Z1E vs. Z2 Go</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>52</td><td>49</td><td>11.36%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>N/A</td><td>63</td><td>14.55%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>N/A</td><td>69</td><td>15.00%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>62</td><td>N/A</td><td>71</td><td>14.52%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>52</td><td>73</td><td>12.31%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>52</td><td>42</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>41</td><td>N/A</td><td>54</td><td>31.71%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>45</td><td>N/A</td><td>59</td><td>31.11%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>46</td><td>N/A</td><td>61</td><td>32.61%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>49</td><td>52</td><td>62</td><td>26.53%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>70</td><td>61</td><td>8.93%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>N/A</td><td>84</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>N/A</td><td>89</td><td>34.85%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>N/A</td><td>91</td><td>35.82%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>92</td><td>31.43%</td></tr><tr><td>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>18</td><td>34</td><td>25</td><td>38.89%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>N/A</td><td>28</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>20</td><td>N/A</td><td>28</td><td>40.00%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>N/A</td><td>28</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>24</td><td>34</td><td>33</td><td>37.50%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>32</td><td>33.33%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>N/A</td><td>38</td><td>46.15%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>N/A</td><td>40</td><td>37.93%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td><td>41</td><td>36.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>32</td><td>26</td><td>38</td><td>18.75%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>61</td><td>50</td><td>-5.66%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>N/A</td><td>69</td><td>30.19%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>N/A</td><td>75</td><td>36.36%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>64</td><td>N/A</td><td>73</td><td>14.06%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>61</td><td>75</td><td>15.38%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates.

With the Steam Deck, which runs at 15-watt TDP, I can average 52 frames per second at an upscaled 720p resolution and low settings on battery power alone. But even if I feed the Legion Go S with 40 watts and plug it into a wall, the open-world game runs <em>slower</em> at 49fps. And that’s <em>after</em> a new set of drivers; the shipping ones were much worse.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>In other games, cranking up Lenovo’s TDP by five, 10, or 15 watts can give it a comfortable lead over the Deck. But that significantly impacts battery. In Lenovo’s default 25W “Performance” mode, I saw some games run just as smoothly as on the Deck — but with total system power consumption of around 36 watts, draining the handheld’s 55 watt-hour battery in about an hour and a half. The Steam Deck, which drains at around 22 to 24 watts at full bore, lasts two hours at the same smoothness.</p><p>I have possible good news about SteamOS: when I installed Bazzite, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck#:~:text=In%20a%20lot%20of%20ways%20Bazzite%20is%20a%20good%20way%20to%20kind%20of%20get%20the%20latest%20and%20greatest%20of%20what%20we%E2%80%99ve%20been%20working%20on%2C%20and%20test%20it.%E2%80%9D">which can serve as a decent preview</a> of what SteamOS might look and feel like, I saw frame rates improve by an average of 16 percent in early tests (minus <em>Returnal</em>, which seems to hate Linux for some reason), and Bazzite is <em>such</em> a breath of fresh air after attempting to use Windows. But it still didn’t reach Steam Deck performance unless I sacrificed more battery to get it. That works with a handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">like the Asus ROG Ally X</a> with a big 80 watt-hour battery, but not so much here.</p><div><h2>Legion Go S Windows vs. Bazzite</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Windows)</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Bazzite)</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Bazzite vs. Windows</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>42</td><td>52</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>41</td><td>53</td><td>N/A</td><td>29.27%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>45</td><td>59</td><td>N/A</td><td>31.11%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>46</td><td>60</td><td>N/A</td><td>30.43%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>49</td><td>60</td><td>52</td><td>22.45%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>62</td><td>70</td><td>10.71%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>74</td><td>N/A</td><td>17.46%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>80</td><td>N/A</td><td>21.21%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>84</td><td>N/A</td><td>25.37%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>70</td><td>82</td><td>70</td><td>17.14%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>17</td><td>26</td><td>-29.17%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>22</td><td>N/A</td><td>-15.38%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>24</td><td>N/A</td><td>-17.24%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>25</td><td>N/A</td><td>-16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>32</td><td>25</td><td>26</td><td>-21.88%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>51</td><td>61</td><td>-3.77%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>59</td><td>N/A</td><td>11.32%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>62</td><td>N/A</td><td>12.73%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>64</td><td>63</td><td>N/A</td><td>-1.56%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>65</td><td>61</td><td>0.00%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates.

In my tests, the original Legion Go with Z1E runs anywhere from 15 percent to 40 percent faster comparing Windows to Windows — a lot for a handheld, where modern games struggle to reach smooth frame rates at all. </p><p>The Legion Go S does have an ace up its sleeve: its crisp, colorful 1920 x 1200 IPS screen looks better at lower resolutions than its predecessor’s 2560 x 1600 panel, and it runs more smoothly at lower frame rates now that it has VRR to adjust its refresh rate anywhere between 48Hz and 120Hz on the fly. I would not buy a Legion Go over a Legion Go S for this reason alone. </p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>And if you primarily play games that don’t require performance, the Legion Go S is a bit more efficient at lower wattage: by setting TDP, brightness, and refresh rate low, I was able to achieve a total of just 7.5W battery drain in Windows and 7W in Bazzite while playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">magic math poker game <em>Balatro</em></a>. That should net me seven to eight hours of battery life, and you should be able to hit the four-hour mark without those tricks just by setting the Legion Go S to its 8-watt TDP “Quiet” mode. When I played the similarly easy to run <em>Slay the Spire</em> on the original Legion Go, pulling out all the stops, I couldn’t even reach five hours.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But again, the Steam Deck does efficiency better. Simply limiting frame rate to 25fps and brightness to 40 percent can yield over eight hours of <em>Balatro </em>on the Deck, and I’ve gotten four hours, 42 minutes in <em>Dave the Diver</em> there. With the Legion Go S, my Dave only got 2.5 hours to hunt those sushi ingredients and blow up fake environmentalists!</p><p>I am comfortable saying <em>no one</em> should buy the Windows version of the Lenovo Legion Go S, which costs $730 at Best Buy. Even if the performance, battery life, and price weren’t disqualifiers, Windows is a stain on this machine. And like other recent Windows handhelds I’ve tested, it does not reliably go to sleep and wake up again: I woke several mornings to find the system hot with fans spinning, even though I’d pressed the power button the previous evening. I found it uncomfortably warm pulling it out of my bag the other day. </p><p>Even if you prefer Windows to SteamOS, you can get notably better performance and far better battery life from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the $800 Asus ROG Ally X</a>, which is worth every extra penny, particularly since it doubles as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">the best Bazzite machine you can buy</a>. </p><p>But even if you add Bazzite to the Legion Go S, it’s no Steam Deck, and I’m not sure that’ll change by May. If you’re waiting for a $499 Legion Go S with SteamOS, here’s my advice: just buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">a $530 Steam Deck OLED</a> instead. </p><div><div><p id="agree-to-continue-legion-go-s"><h2>Agree to Continue: Legion Go S</h2></p></div><p><em>Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them, since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate.</em></p><p>To start using the Legion Go S, you’ll need to agree to the following:</p><div><ul><li><span>Microsoft Software License Terms: Windows Operating System and Terms of Use</span></li><li><span>Lenovo Limited Warranty and “Software license agreements”</span></li></ul></div><p>You can also say “yes” or “no” to the following:</p><div><ul><li><span>Privacy settings (location, Find My Device, sharing diagnostic data, inking and typing, tailored experience, advertising ID)</span></li></ul></div><p>That’s two mandatory agreements and six optional agreements.

		<p>2019’s Stygian: Reign of the Old Gods was a promising CRPG that featured some neat madness mechanics and a tone and atmosphere that perfectly suited its Lovecraftian influences. It did, however, suffer from some difficulty spikes and a few terrible bugs that have never been fixed. I was therefore surprised to see another game in the series appear, especially given that it comes from a completely different developer and takes on an entirely new gameplay style and perspective. The old-school top down approach has been replaced in Stygian: Outer Gods by a first-person view that provides a more immersive and, dare I say, modern experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stygian: Outer Gods | Demo Coming to Steam Next Fest" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5ex7hUEPK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>My time with the demo – which will be available as part of Steam Next Fest from Monday 24th February – began with a mysterious vision in a strange otherworldly environment before reverting to the familiar setting of an office stacked with esoteric items. This is textbook Lovecraft and reminded me of the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/31/call-of-cthulhu-review-maddening/">Call of Cthulhu</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/27/the-sinking-city-review/">The Sinking City</a>. Similar to those titles you soon find yourself stranded in a coastal town with a mystery to solve and dangers to overcome.</p>


<p>Before you set out on your investigation, however, you can customise your character by interacting with the mirror in your bathroom. A series of questions are posed and your answers affect various character stats, from your occult knowledge to your lockpicking skills. The latter proved a little unhelpful in my playthrough as every attempt to pick a lock failed, despite that being my chosen skill. Hopefully these aspects will be refined for the final build although I quite liked how the effects of the dialogue choices weren’t spelled out for you.</p>


<p>The atmosphere of Stygian: Outer Gods is on point with derelict buildings and a stark coastline setting the scene and items that are clearly visible for the most part. There wasn’t a lot of variety in enemy design in this, but this isn’t surprising for what amounts to the game’s prologue. Audio design is also good and the otherworldly noises disturb and unsettle you.</p>
<p>The section contained in this build featured a mixture of stealth and combat, but it is clear that the final game is not going to be all-out action. Even single enemies will quickly kill you if you try and take them on toe to toe. Sneaking around them or using thrown bottles to distract them is far more effective, whilst manipulating the scenery is important to survive any unavoidable fights. Fortunately the AI is pretty easy to abuse, with knee high fences coming in clutch to protect you from damage. The demo features a few different melee weapons, with firearms being seen in preview footage of later areas.</p>

<p>Exploring the town is made necessary as you must find three panels for a locked gate in order to gain access a large mansion which seems to be the source of the mystery. This is a standard survival horror puzzle but feel somewhat out of place here given the game’s adoption of some immersive sim elements. Whilst exploring the town you’ll be blocked by a series of fences, but stacking boxes against them can create steps that allow you to bypass them. I was never entirely sure how intentional these moments were, although more traditional area blocking is achieved through boards that you can only break once you find an axe. The question remains, why couldn’t I just prop some boxes up against the gate and climb over it?</p>
<p>That kind of interior logic breaking aside, Stygian: Outer Gods is a promising stealth horror title that showed enough in the demo to both pique my interest and leave me wondering what other gameplay elements it’ll introduce. If Lovecraftian horrors are your bag of tentacles then make sure to wishlist this particular cosmic horror ready for its release – first with PC early access this year, and a full release in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/616163/die-in-the-dungeon-will-keep-you-busy-until-slay-the-spire-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Die in the Dungeon</em> is a new roguelike deckbuilder that pulls some ideas from <em>Slay the Spire</em>, one of my favorite games, but adds some dice-based twists that have me hooked.</p><p>In <em>Dungeon</em>, your goal is to survive through progressively harder maps of enemies by building a deck — but instead of collecting cards, you’re collecting dice. During every hand, you have a certain amount of energy you can use to play your dice. And since you can see every move your enemies will make on the next turn, the game is mostly about strategizing how to attack the baddies while defending yourself.</p><p>If you’ve played <em>Slay</em>, this setup should feel pretty familiar.</p><p>But <em>Dungeon</em>’s clever twist is in <em>how</em> you play. At the beginning of each turn, the game will roll dice from your deck into your hand, and you’ll need to decide how to play them on a board. Each die has a value, so the higher the value, the more damage you’ll deal or block you’ll set up to defend yourself.</p><p>There are multiple types of dice, including attack dice, block dice, healing dice, and dice that can boost the value of other dice on the board. Each one costs a certain amount of energy to play, which puts limits on how many you can use in one turn. And sometimes, enemies will add modifiers to spots on the board.</p><div><p><cite>Image: HypeTrain Digital, INSTINCT3</cite></p></div><p>That all means you’ll have to think a lot about how and where you play your dice on the board. Do you go all in with attack dice to take a big chunk of an enemy’s health, but leave yourself vulnerable to attacks? Do you spend some energy on a boost block to give yourself more defense at the cost of being able to use a health dice? Just about every turn in <em>Dungeon</em> requires some strategic thinking.</p><p>The intensity of the strategy makes the <em>Slay</em>-esque trappings something of a comfort. I find <em>Dungeon</em> to be very hard; the enemies can really pack a punch if you’re caught off guard, and I haven’t been able to get past the bosses of the game’s first two worlds unless I have a clear idea of what my build is.</p><p>But I already understand how to think about building a deck from many hours of <em>Slay</em>. I’ve called on a lot of those skills to make things easier over the 10-plus hours I’ve put into <em>Dungeon</em> so far — and to accomplish my one and only cleared run.</p><p>While <em>Slay</em> is good at keeping things snappy with battles that are just long enough — I could often finish a run in around 45 minutes — runs in <em>Dungeon</em> can drag. Individual battles can take minutes on their own because of how much you might just sit and think. Loading screens that take five or more seconds add up over the course of a run. The dungeon maps also have a few too many spaces. My longer runs, where I’ve gotten to the third and final world, have taken nearly two hours.</p><p><em>Dungeon</em> is launching in early access, though, so I’m hoping the rougher edges will get smoothed out over time. Even over the couple weeks I’ve been playing the game, there have been some welcome updates, like one that gives you coins if you choose to skip an end-of-battle reward. The game’s developers have posted <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2026820%2Fview%2F497187441695785129" rel="sponsored">a promising roadmap, too</a>. That all makes me optimistic for <em>Dungeon</em>’s long-term future.</p><p>And its foundation is really strong. I’ve had a blast with <em>Dungeon</em>, despite its faults and me only having beaten the game with one of the three available characters so far. After I lose a run, I often mull over how I could have done things differently, and I’m usually eager to hop back in to roll the dice again.</p><p>I’ve been really looking forward to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/12/12/24320075/move-over-balatro"><em>Slay the Spire 2</em></a>, which is supposed to come out in early access this year. But I might have already scratched the deckbuilding itch with <em>Die in the Dungeon</em>.</p><p><sub>Die in the Dungeon<em> is now available in early access on Steam. You can try a version of it for free on </em><a href="http://itch.io/"><em>itch.io</em></a><em>.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Even though it’s the shortest month, it’s been a little surprising just how quickly it feels like February has raced by. We’re just a few short days away from the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and I know that’s one that series fans have been salivating over for a long time – and not just for the in-game chef’s creations!</p>
<p>But MHW is still in the future, what about in the here and now? Well, the week’s two biggest releases (full releases, not pre-order shenanigans releases) are the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/">Avowed</a> and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.

<p>What have you been playing this week? Well…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww</strong> has been playing a bunch of backlog games and titles that were soon to leave the PS Plus catalogue. That included The Outer Worlds, though this was too old fashioned, and he started Life Is Strange 2.

</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Avowed Could Have Been ‘Multiplayer Skyrim’ Before a Reboot Happened]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-multiplayer-skyrim-before-reboot/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-could-have-been-%E2%80%98multiplayer-skyrim%E2%80%99-before-a-reboot-happened.1116135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-multiplayer-skyrim-before-reboot/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Avowed hit the market just a few days ago, and players worldwide have been getting to grips with Obsidian’s latest ambitious RPG. This semi-open-world title boasts sumptuous visuals and an innovative story, plus all the trappings of a fantasy RPG that we’ve come to expect over the years.</p>



<p>The single-player marvel could have been something entirely different, though. In a recent report published by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, it was revealed by Carrie Patel, the game’s director, that Avowed started life as an MMO that was dubbed ‘multiplayer Skyrim’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>Given that the industry’s MMO category is well and truly oversaturated these days, I’m rather thankful that Avowed took on a fresh form following a dramatic reboot.</p>



<p>In a recent report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-21/new-xbox-game-avowed-took-six-years-two-reboots?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Bloomberg</a>, Obsidian’s Carrie Patel explained that a 2021 pivot led to a total reboot of Avowed, which had until then been designed as a multiplayer title. The game was preparing to enter production in earnest, but Microsoft’s acquisition of Obsidian took a drastic turn, and a relatively large team was ordered to shake things up.</p>



<p>Patel expanded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Normally if you’re stepping back and reevaluating your creative direction, putting together a new vertical slice and revised production plans, you would do that with a very small team. </p>



<p>We did not have a very small team at that point.</p>



<p>A lot of lessons we learned as we were building this game, ideally we would’ve learned on a small scale with a true preproduction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a further twist, Avowed’s open-world model was switched out for a ‘zone-based’ structure akin to 2019’s The Outer Worlds. This has since been reviewed by Avowed’s development team, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-not-open-world-because-zones-tough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been pretty public on the reasons</a> for that creative and logistical decision.</p>



<p>Patel wrapped the interview with Schreier by signing off with a nod to the future of the Avowed label:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now that we’ve built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I’d love to see us do more with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Are you happy that Avowed is a single-player RPG, or would you have preferred an MMO? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netease-could-cause-the-closure-of-%E2%80%98more-than-a-dozen-studios%E2%80%99-report-claims.1116132/</guid>

<p>Earlier this week, we reported on the layoffs that had hit the Marvel Rivals team at NetEase. In one sweep, an entire department in North America was laid off, despite the rampant and ongoing success of Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Now, a fresh report published by Game File’s Stephen Totilo has expanded on NetEase’s current situation. The gaming titan has been in a sticky spot of late, and studios it has opened or invested in have started to experience layoffs and closures, such as Liquid Swords, which this week also announced redundancies.</p>



<p>Per Totilo’s report, the devastation is yet to unfold in full, and ‘more than a dozen studios’ could be facing closure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-constant-review-and-evaluation">‘Constant Review and Evaluation’</h2>



<p>In Game File’s most recent report, it was stressed that NetEase’s cuts aren’t ending with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/liquid-swords-the-next-studio-to-hold-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liquid Swords</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-ceo-debated-having-marvel-rivals-canceled-and-removing-heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Marvel Rivals team</a>.</p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was stressed by Stephen Totilo</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>NetEase is actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios—many of the very same ones it announced over the last three years—two people familiar with the company’s efforts tell Game File. Neither individual was authorized to speak about NetEase’s plans publicly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Those sources have claimed that NetEase wants to divest ‘overseas teams’, an action that could lead to the closure of more than a dozen game studios around the world. The situation would be exacerbated if these studios can’t secure funding once ‘dropped’ by NetEase.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, NetEase neglected to comment on these insider reports, but it was mentioned that the company and its studios are ‘in constant review and evaluation, and NetEase will determine changes needed to be made.’</p>



<p>In a one-year window, Embracer Group laid off more than 4,500 employees and brought about the closure of 80 projects, as well as shutting down some prolific studios. This NetEase situation could mirror that to some extent. </p>



<p>The Chinese company is the fifth largest game firm by revenue, sitting just behind Nintendo and a step ahead of Electronic Arts. It collectively employs around 30,000 people, which represents a concerning amount of ‘fodder’.</p>



<p>I’m most concerned about Rebel Wolves, which NetEase invested in back in 2022. Recently, the Polish studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-first-trailer-rebel-wolves/">revealed Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, an intriguing title pieced together by former Witcher developers. That could be one of the studios impacted by these changes.</p>



<p>For now, everything remains up in the air.</p>

<p>In a recent leak published on social media by eXtas1s, fresh references to the ‘new Xbox controller’ were uncovered. These details gel nicely with what we already know about the ‘Sebile’ controller that was leaked in the FTC vs. Microsoft documents almost two years ago. If nothing else, this new update is a testament to the controller <strong>still existing</strong>.</p>



<p>Per the update posted by eXtas1s, dataminers have uncovered references to the ‘Sebile’ controller in new XCloud files. It was originally thought that the upgraded, next-generation controller would be released alongside whatever console comes next, but these latest details suggest it could arrive sooner.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-sebile">What is Sebile?</h2>



<p>In September 2023, the FTC vs. Microsoft court case led to many documents being publicly revealed, with some outlining the future of Xbox hardware and peripherals. One such peripheral that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-leak-new-xbox-controller/">was fully unveiled was ‘Sebile’</a>, otherwise dubbed ‘the new Xbox controller’ by Microsoft.</p>



<p>Back then, the documents suggested it would have a ‘lift to wake’ feature, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-be-bringing-haptic-motors-to-xbox-controllers/">precision haptic feedback</a>, better ergonomics, and a rechargeable battery as standard. It was also stressed it would have seamless connectivity mechanics, better accessibility for repair and disassembly, and an accelerometer.</p>



<p>In a recent post published on <a href="https://xcancel.com/extas1stv/status/1893094238549590287?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media by eXtas1s</a>, those very same features are discussed again. In recent XCloud files uncovered by dataminers, references to the following were found:</p>



<ul>
<li>Codenames: Sebile_Delgado, Sebile_EV1B, Actium_Duet, Actium_EVO</li>
</ul>



<p>EXtas1s expands on the codenames by reiterating the proposed technical specification:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Modular with improved haptics, similar to the DualSense. Goodbye to batteries, now with a rechargeable battery. Gesture to ‘wake up’ the controller. Part of the console renewal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the tech specs seem to be nothing more than a look back at what we already know, the modern references to the codenames in the XCloud files are new and are more or less confirmation that Microsoft is still working on Sebile.</p>

                <p>Pokemon fans are known to be passionate, especially as Pokemania nears its 30th anniversary in 2026. Sometimes, fans are even willing to pay shockingly high prices for unofficial Pokemon items, including--of all things--a Flamin' Hot Cheeto that bears more than a little resemblance to Charizard. "Cheetozard" recently went up for auction, and the highest bid has already cleared four figures.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/526839/cheeto-charizard-auction-pokemon-collectibles" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, this Charizard-shaped Cheeto is currently available to anyone with a large amount of expendable income <a href="https://goldin.co/item/cheetozard-pokemon-charizard-shaped-cheeto-370g3p?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiOTEzN2RlNjJiOWFiM2Y0ZmFjNzQxODkyYzFkZmI1ZWMiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjd9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Goldin auctions</a>. At press time, the highest bid is $2,100, and there are still eight more days before the auction comes to a close.</p><p>According to the auction description, Cheetozard was "discovered and preserved sometime between 2018-2022 by 1st &amp; Goal Collectibles." It comes with a custom-made Cheetozard card inside of a clear storage box. It's a very amusing novelty item, but probably not for everyone.</p><p>Next week, The Pokemon Company will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-february-27/1100-6529609/" data-ref-id="1100-6529609">be hosting a Pokemon Presents Livestream</a>, and fans have already speculated that the franchise's next Switch title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>, will be featured.

                <p dir="ltr">I've long appreciated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay/" data-ref-id="5000-151353">State of Decay</a> as the exciting middle ground between an approachable zombie game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-rising/" data-ref-id="5000-24405">Dead Rising</a>, and unforgiving survival sims like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dayz/" data-ref-id="5000-146913">DayZ</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-zomboid/" data-ref-id="5000-115308">Project Zomboid</a>. No series or game that I know of has found that same middle ground--<em>harsh</em>, but <em>digestible</em>. But maybe that's no longer true. While I impatiently await more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay-3/" data-ref-id="5000-516152">news for State of Decay 3</a> from Undead Labs and Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days/" data-ref-id="5000-578185">Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days</a> is giving me a similar experience with some welcome twists on the formula.</p><p dir="ltr">Into The Dead might be a name-brand undead devotees already know. Previous to now, it's been the name of a first-person auto-runner series on mobile. They're neat games, but they really aren't trying to do too much other than being a gritty, scary, first-person take on something like a Jetpack Joyride--a fun, albeit one-note, time-filler for bus rides or lunch breaks. Our Darkest Days is far from that and more in line with what a console or PC player might expect of a zombie game.</p><p dir="ltr">Presented in a 2.5D art style, Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days is essentially a side-scrolling State of Decay, and if that series isn't already unforgiving enough, it seems like Our Darkest Days also looked to This War of Mine for inspiration. I recently checked out a demo for the upcoming game on PC--<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239710/Into_the_Dead_Our_Darkest_Days/" rel="nofollow ">a demo you can now play yourself</a>, by the way--and the best thing I can say about it is that I was so impressed that I actually stopped playing at a point when I could've gone further, because I want to preserve as much of the experience as I can for when the game is out and my save data will carry over. But I saw enough to know this game is worth that deeper look.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448326"></a><figcaption>Stealth is key because just a zombie or two could be your undoing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each game starts with you picking a pair of characters chosen as a duo. There's a white-haired high school coach and one of his student-athletes looking for his family, an unexpected couple--an animal rights activist and the rodeo man she once meant to protest--with an even more unexpected baby on the way, a therapist and her anger-managing patient, and more. This surely sounds a lot like State of Decay if you know that series. It, too, gives you a few groups of characters to choose as your starters, albeit a trio in that case.</p><p dir="ltr">The comparison goes beyond that. Like in Undead Labs' excellent series, each character has stats--in Our Darkest Days, they get two passive buffs and a debuff--for you to consider before starting a new game. Also like State of Decay, permadeath is an everpresent threat, and more than just a single zombie or two can spell certain doom for a novice player or a character who may be overtired, injured, or starving.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to keep your earliest characters alive, you'll need to manage your time and their wellbeing. For example, the day-night cycle dictates that you'll assign characters to tasks, then advance time to have them unfold. If you have a very tired character, you should send them to bed while the other may be called upon to head out into levels that seem to be procedurally generated to a degree, as loot drops and zombie density tend to vary. It only took me a few nights before both my characters weren't at their best. Darrel, the coach, was a lousy cook, but Leo was too tired to do the cooking himself, so I chose to send Leo to bed while Darrel went on a scavenging run at less than 100%. That was my first mistake.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448327"></a><figcaption>Set in the eighties in the U.S., the environments reject the drab look of The Walking Dead in favor of some style and flair.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In a level, the goal is to explore as much as you want within its horizontal limitations and then get home safely. You could spend a while filling your pockets to their maximum capacity, or you could ditch the deathtrap in a hurry after you've found that one particular healing, cooking, or crafting item you hoped to find. But whatever you choose to do with your time in the danger zone, it's much easier said than done, especially when your character isn't at their best. Weapons degrade quickly, and if you don't pull off a stealth kill, combat is loud enough to probably stir any other undead lingering nearby.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find other survivors in your travels too, though you don't necessarily have to help them. Like the games that clearly inspired this one, another unlucky survivor is another mouth to feed. Each stranded person becomes a cold cost-benefit analysis. Can you spare the resources needed to maintain another member of your community? Then again, having an extra pair of hands to cook, build, or stab a few squishy zombie skulls might be exactly what you need when folks back home are hanging by a thread as it is.</p><p dir="ltr">In the pre-alpha demo I played anyway, it seems that discovered (and explicitly invited) survivors make it back home even if you don't. I know this because, after Darrel found a new lost soul, Rahul, he later died before getting back to base himself. Though I didn't know Darrel long, I felt the effects of his death back at the base, as those who mourned him, Leo and Rahul, suffered a grief debuff for having experienced the loss. Things were only going to get harder in the days to come for my wounded stragglers in a land the dead had taken like a horrific coup of throat bites and flesh tears.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328"></a><figcaption>Splitting the game into both home and away sections gives every decision weight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My initial reaction when I first saw Our Darkest Days was one of wishing it were more expansive, but after trying the demo, I've found there's a ton of hidden depth for me to explore in what is shaping up to be a familiar--and yet still fresh--zombie saga. Though I generally favor a 3D open-world setting to the more restrictive 2.5D perspective seen here, I also find that, in a world that is already expected to get State of Decay 3 <em>eventually</em>, this different take on many similar ideas is a welcome alternative in the meantime.</p><p dir="ltr">Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days feels like it may have all the pieces in place to be a strong emergent story generator, and in my zombie-obsessed opinion, that's the connective thread that brings all of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-zombie-games-of-all-time/2900-4873/">best zombie games </a>together. Whether it's State of Decay, DayZ, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead/" data-ref-id="5000-29417">Left 4 Dead</a>, the all-time greats tend to offer systems that give me the latitude to tell stories of despair or heroism, community or chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">The full game is due out later this year. As of now, only a PC launch has been confirmed, but I suspect that may change in the future.</p>
