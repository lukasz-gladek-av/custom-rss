The X5 Alteron features similar functionality to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24187539/gamesir-g8-bluetooth-mobile-controller-ios-android-nintendo-switch-pc">GameSir’s GameSir G8 Plus</a> that debuted in 2024 with an expanding telescopic mechanism that can clamp onto smartphones, tablets, and several versions of the Nintendo Switch, replacing the Joy-Cons. What sets the X5 Alteron apart is a modular design allowing most of the controls on the front to be swapped out with alternate layouts, buttons, and joysticks.</p><p>Neither company has announced when the X5 Alteron will be available, how much it will cost, or how the alternate control modules will be sold. But there’s already quite a few of them to cater to various gaming preferences. You can configure the controller with symmetrical or asymmetrical thumbsticks, change the location, number, and layout of the action buttons, and even customize the look and feel of the D-pad to your preference. There are also modules that recreate the N64 and GameCube’s controllers for a more authentic experience when playing older titles on Nintendo Switch Online, and a module with a track pad for replicating a mouse.</p><p>The X5 Alteron connects to various devices over Bluetooth which means you can also use it as a standalone controller with consoles and PCs. But you’ll also have to remember to regularly charge it over USB-C, and batteries do add some weight. On the back of the controller you’ll find Hall effect analog triggers that can be switched to a shorter travel to improve reaction time, and there’s rumble motors providing force feedback effects.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/857428/hyperkin-gamesir-x5-alteron-clamp-bluetooth-wireless-controller]]></content:encoded>

I found the opening 15 minutes of EvoCreo’s demo to be a laugh riot, mostly because I accidentally named my character “Help”, not “Helen”. This lent a certain urgency to all the routine scene-setting and tutorial dialogue. Help, Farmer Whatshisname is looking for you! Help, I’m adding a map feature to your tablet! Help, there are over 170 Creos to discover! Given that RPGs can be sluggish at first, I think I’m going to adopt this as standard practice going forward. Nothing gets you over the opening hump like the impression that everybody you speak to has just escaped from a burning house.

Already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-pathologic-3-a-fresh-pokemon-rival-a-mind-bending-fps-and-some-crablike-base-building">fed to the Maw</a>, and available on Steam today, EvoCreo is a PC port of a popular creature collecting mobile game from 10 years ago. Based on the little time I’ve spent as a budding <del>Pokémon Trainer</del> Creo Evoker it feels like derivative but entertaining genre fare, transplanted to desktops with minimal ceremony.

According to developer rioneye, posting on the Steam forums, the new PC version won’t feature an in-game shop, and will include some of the mobile version’s separately sold DLC and premium items, though I’m not clear on final pricing. The demo’s 2D anime visuals and big-buttoned interface feel like a straight lift from the mobile game, but the presentation and controls have apparently been improved for the full Steam release. I think if you’re really into this kind of thing, the sense of playing an emulated version won’t bother you much, but this isn't exactly a posh remaster project.
</p><p>
It hits many of the beats you’re likely expecting. Taming monsters during open exploration. Arena fights. Evolutionary paths. Scraps with elite tamers. The devs seem especially proud of the combat system, which they say is about “more than matching types”, in a gentle jab at older instalments of Nintendo’s monster-taming series. “Manage move cooldowns, status effects, and powerful passive traits in deep, turn-based battles that reward smart team building and tactical thinking,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3791450/EvoCreo/">the Steam page explains</a>. There's a longer primordial account of the differences on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1727119297/evocreotm-a-monster-collection-rpg/description">the original 2013 Kickstarter</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can expect online PvP at some point after release. Maybe give the demo a shot, while it’s live? And let me know if you think of any amusing character names. I guess “Argh” or “Achoo!” would kindle a similar mood.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marshall-slashes-its-on-ear-wireless-headphones-to-nearly-50-off-rivaling-sony-deals-2000657681</link>
            <guid>1399504</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Marshall makes some of the best audio gear on the market. If you want to hear bold, rich sound with deeper bass on the go, we recommend checking the Marshall Major V on-ear headphones out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/">These typically sit at $170, but you can grab a pair for just $90 at Amazon today, after the retailer took 47% off the usual price</a>. This offer applies to the black color option. Other models are discounted, too. For instance, the brown and cream versions are sitting at $87. The blue option, on the other hand, is going for $100.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Durable Design, Bold Sound</h2>
<p>Major V headphones feature a rugged design that’s durable and made to handle everyday wear and tear quite well. The pair folds down for compact storage, making it easy to carry these around with you. When not in use, fold the headphones down, toss them into a bag, and get going!</p>
<p>You’ll enjoy the classic Marshall sound for all your favorite tracks. Expect thunderous bass, smooth mids, and crisp treble that bring music to life. Whether you’re listening to a podcast, streaming a show, or just vibing to an energy-filled song, audio comes through with exceptional clarity, with tunes felt deep into your bones. Even better, the audio doesn’t distort when you pump the volume all the way up, which is great for when you really want to immerse yourself in a track.</p>



<p>Getting started couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is push and hold the control knob on the headphone until the LED turns to a slow blue pulse. Enable Bluetooth on your phone and select Major V from the list of available Bluetooth devices. Once the devices have been paired, download the Marshall Bluetooth app and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup. There’s a customizable M-button on one of the earcups, which can be used to access custom actions. By default, the button action is Spotify Tap, but you can tweak it to something else using the Marshall app. For instance, you can use it to launch EQ settings on the app or enable a voice assistant for hands-free management.</p>
<p>Battery life is exceptional and better than most other options in the same range. A single charge gets you up to 100 hours of playback, which is more than enough to go an entire week without running low! When it comes to recharging, the headphones support wired and wireless options. For wireless charging, you can place the right ear cup flat down on a compatible charging pad. When the LED light turns on, it indicates that the headphones are successfully being charged. It takes around 3 hours to fully recharge the pair.</p>
<p>Just note that Major V headphones aren’t water resistant, so we won’t recommend taking them to the pool or in the shower. If this isn’t a dealbreaker for you, now is a great time to pick the pair up without paying the full price. These deliver superior sound that helps you enjoy your favorite music to the fullest. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/">Act fast, though, as we’re expecting the discount to wrap up soon. Multiple color options are discounted, so you can pick the version that fits your aesthetics the best.</a></p>

<p>A report about the next Xbox has surfaced online, and it seems that it will heavily lean into the Windows experience. </p>



<p>We were informed late last year that Windows 11 would receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/windows-11-xbox-full-screen-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-screen support</a> for the Xbox App, allowing players to easily switch between desktop and Xbox’s “full-screen experience” when playing games. It seems that Microsoft will be leveraging the same technology for its next Xbox console. </p>







<h2 id="h-next-xbox-console-s-only-difference-from-a-traditional-pc-is-the-ability-to-run-xbox-one-and-series-x-s-games">Next Xbox Console’s Only Difference from a Traditional PC is the Ability to Run Xbox One and Series X/S Games</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central</a> provides a lot of details on what to expect from Xbox in 2026, revealing exciting details about the upcoming console. The report shows that the plan to run “full bore Windows” on the next Xbox console has remained the same. Thanks to their partnership with AMD, this console’s interface will be delivered through the “Full Screen Experience” in the Xbox PC app, and Microsoft is hard at work to make the app capable of executing it. </p>



<p>The report says that the main difference between the next Xbox console and a traditional PC is the ability to run Xbox One and Series X/S, allowing players to bring forward their existing libraries to the next-gen console. The Xbox President has also confirmed that the next console will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-consoles-backwards-compatible-ai-enhance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backwards compatible</a> and will be enhanced with AI. The report also discusses “credible rumors” about an OEM “Xbox” PC in 2026; however, players are asked to treat this information with caution until it is properly verified.</p>







<p>Earlier last year, Corden had already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-not-a-console-at-all-insider/">stated</a> that the next Xbox console would lean more towards a PC experience, stating “a PC in essence but with a TV-friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind.’ Xbox President Sarah Bond has also stated that they are hard at work developing their next-generation hardware and that it will be a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-double-down-powerful-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powerful experience</a>“. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Closes Halifax Studio Just After Employees Unionized]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The layoffs across the video game industry are getting started early in 2026. Ubisoft has announced the closure of Ubisoft Halifax.</p>



<p>The closure will see 71 people lose their jobs.</p>







<p>The news of the studio’s shutdown comes just days after it was announced that 61 of the studio’s employees joined the Game &amp; Media Workers Guild of Canada, Local 30111. The certification for the union came on December 18, 2025, and was branded as the Ubisoft Workers of Canada, Halifax.</p>



<p>In a statement, Ubisoft says that decision comes after two years of “company-wide actions to streamline operations”.</p>



<p><strong>“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs,” </strong>the company said. <strong>“As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. </strong></p>



<p>“<strong>We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”</strong></p>







<p>The decision, Ubisoft claims, was made “well before” the staff unionized. Ubisoft added that it respected its employees right to join a union. Insider Gaming has reached out for a statement from members of the Union. Should that be received, it will be added to this story. </p>



<p>Prior to its closure, Ubisoft Halifax was working on mobile games for Rainbow Six and Assassin’s Creed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What If I Don't Fantasize About Having A Friend In A Jar]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/razer-project-ava-ces/</link>
            <guid>1399489</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Of course AI was going to be big at this year’s CES, but somehow I was still surprised by the latest developments in Razer’s Projet Ava. In 2025 it was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K46-vHL4Ouo&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>disembodied voice</u></a> that promised to be “the ultimate AI gamer copilot,” dispensing emotionless advice about MOBAs and shooters. In 2026, it’s rebranded itself as “your AI desk companion” and morphed into a sycophantic human hologram in a jar that’s currently–steel yourself–running off Grok.</p><p>On the Ava <a href="https://www.razer.com/concepts/project-ava?ref=aftermath.site"><u>site</u></a>, Razer writes, “Building on the 2025 esports AI coach concept, Project AVA has evolved into a fully integrated AI desk companion designed to support every facet of modern life. Razer aims to bridge the gap between virtual assistance and physical companionship by providing a 24/7 digital partner that lives right alongside the user.”</p><p>In a trailer, Ava–first in the form of an anime girl named Kira who Razer describes as “always ready to level up with you,” and then as a muscular man named Zane–wakes users up, gives them vague fashion and work advice, and shouts gamer nonsense while the users play. According to Razer, Ava will be able to offer self-care and meal-planning advice, analyze your work spreadsheets, and cheer you on in video games–or, as it awkwardly told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854705/razer-ai-anime-waifu-hologram-desk?ref=aftermath.site"><u>The Verge</u></a> in a hands-on demo, “I look forward to partnering up with you and sharing the laughter and rage in gaming.”&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_QDthx_WjwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Razer Project AVA: Your AI Desk Companion"></iframe></figure><p>The Verge noted how frequently their experience with the Kira character got flirty, and maybe that’s no surprise–Razer writes on the Ava site that it “currently utilizes xAI’s Grok engine to demonstrate its sophisticated reasoning and dynamic personality.” You know, the thing that’s making <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x?ref=aftermath.site"><u>thousands</u></a> of nude images, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/02/elon-musk-grok-ai-children-photos?ref=aftermath.site"><u>CSAM</u></a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/05/elon-musk-ashley-st-clair-grok-fake-sexualised-images?ref=aftermath.site"><u>revenge porn</u></a>, for Twitter users lately, not even for the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-grok-ai-is-as-gross-as-you-might-expect-2000599098?ref=aftermath.site"><u>first time</u></a>. At least Razer seems to be leaving the door open to other AI platforms, including developing its own. </p><p>Razer apparently believes this thing is launching this year, taking $20 <a href="https://www.razer.com/concepts/project-ava/reservation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pre-orders</u></a> for people in the US. I’d certainly believe they could do it, in that Ava could plausibly be an object that could be put in a box and sent to people to place on their desks. Less believable is any of its purported functions besides the one Razer is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/razer-project-ava-ai-companion-hologram-2026-1?ref=aftermath.site"><u>trying to not just come out and say</u></a>: Here is the fantasy of a pretty girl (or handsome man, though even Razer defaults to using “she” at one point on its site), what Razer calls a “Friend for Life” in a bit of wordplay that probably sounded clever in a marketing meeting but really just belies the fact that this is a person-shaped facsimile that can witness your life and be witnessed by you, all the time, with no priorities beyond hyping you up and being “prettiest for you.”&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="113" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E2Y0dmwJd8A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Razer Holographic AI Voice Assistant Kira (Project Ava) CES 2026 Demo #razer #ces2026 #technology"></iframe></figure><p>The whole thing has the same pathetic vibes as Amazon’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/no-amount-of-money-can-buy-being-goated-with-the-sauce/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>recent Alexa ads</u></a>, with an added dash of being gross as hell. You’d think in 2026 both the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/31/podcasts/the-daily/chatgpt-ai-relationship.html?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">failures</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">dangers</a> of personifying AI would be clear, and you’d think we’d be over the lonely gamer stereotype as a marketing tool, but, well, here we are on both counts. No one needs to buy the line Razer and other companies going all-in on AI are selling, that human relationships can be approximated and that their peak form is availability and attention. You, as a person who plays video games, does not need to fall for the con that you have whatever need Project Ava purports to meet, or that it embodies the form you want your relationships to take. There's plenty of online gaming advice out there, including from the people you're playing online games with. And you don't need an imaginary friend to tell you you'll feel good in your favorite shirt.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/moxie-robot-ai-dying-llm-embodied/"><div><p>AI Company That Made Robots For Kids Goes Under, Robots Die - Aftermath</p><p>Embodied, maker of the AI robot called Moxie, is shuttering.

Hopefully the upcoming patch will iron things about.</p>

<p>Ubisoft Halifax's best-known export is probably the mobile game <em>Assassin's Creed Rebellion</em>, and Ubisoft will apparently be halting live operations for <em>Assassin's Creed Rebellion </em>following "a steady decline in the game's revenues", <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-studio-71-jobs-affected" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">according to Gamesindustry.biz</a>.</p><p>As such, while the timing of Halifax's shutdown might seem a little suspicious, I'd be inclined to believe Ubisoft when it says the decision has been made for cost-cutting reasons, as callous as that might sound.

<p>In gameplay terms, Influsion says it's going back to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/what-makes-survival-horror-game" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bac7feef-be60-4457-85f4-9b44e7d6dac3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">"classic survival horror design"</a> for <em>Senara: The Sacrament</em>, which means you can expect a "massive escape room" in which you'll need to solve puzzles and manage your resources carefully.</p><p>The game will very much feature combat, too, if its new trailer is anything to go by; you can expect to come across monsters wandering the Senara's corridors, and you'll need to choose whether to put them down or sneak past them to conserve ammo.</p><p>Narrative-wise, meanwhile, Influsion is promising a tale that's "open to interpretation", with "snippets of truth scattered across documents, objects, and conversations between characters" to discover. You'll need to piece the story together yourself based on what you find.</p><p>You can check out the new trailer for <em>Senara: The Sacrament</em>, which features a few tantalizing glimpses of gameplay, right here.</p>
<p>Influsion says it's used technology like LiDAR and photogrammetry to create a "scan of a real-life documentary-accuracy 6,000-ton ship" for <em>Senara: The Sacrament</em>, too, although I'm not sure the monsters can claim the same honor.</p><p><em>Senara: The Sacrament </em>doesn't have a release date yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3915120/SENARA_The_Sacrament/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">wishlist it right here on Steam</a>, and a demo is on its way in February as well.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/against-mac-mini-deal-this-mini-gaming-pc-drops-below-black-friday-pricing-intel-core-i9-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-2000657686</link>
            <guid>1399450</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not a fan of big, bulky PCs taking over your workstation? You might want to consider investing in a mini PC. These options pack significant power in a compact frame and are easy to carry around on the go.</p>
<p>The market is filled with options, but if you’re after something muscular that can handle both regular work and some resource-intensive projects with ease, the mini gaming PC by Acemagician is worth a look, especially at its current price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6688/">Amazon has now dropped the model by 30%, offering it for just $599, down from $856.</a> You’re saving a whopping $257 on a powerful option that comes with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. Delivery is free, too, which sweetens the offer even more!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6688/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredible Performance, Spacious Storage</h2>
<p>This PC runs on the efficient Intel Core i9 13900HK processor, which features 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) with 20 threads, and turbo boosts up to 5.4GHz. It’s built on Intel 7 process technology with 24MB Smart Cache and 54W TDP to deliver speedy, reliable performance for all your tasks, whether you’re working on an office project or trying to get creative with a personal assignment. The processor outperforms options like i9 12900HK, 7840HS, and 6800H in overall performance, too. You can rely on it for content creation, 4K editing, business workloads, studies, and even gaming.</p>
<p>There’s a massive 32GB DDR4 RAM to keep things snappy as you push through productive days. It’s more than enough to help you multitask like a pro with ease. Think juggling multiple applications at the same time, hopping through a ton of tabs on a couple of different browsers, taking back-to-back video calls, and streaming while gaming – all this without experiencing noticeable slowdowns. Storage capacity is just as impressive, thanks to a 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD. It’s roomy enough to house all your multimedia files (photos, videos, movies), work documents, research papers, important programs, and more. Best of all, both the memory and storage are expandable up to 64GB RAM and 4TB, respectively. This means you can always upgrade the system as your needs grow, without relying on external solutions.</p>



<p>All these specs also make this mini PC great for playing your favorite games. While it won’t offer the performance of a full-fledged gaming PC, it’s more than capable of running titles like Fortnite, League of Legends, and Valorant on medium settings. Those who prefer a larger, more productive work/play setup will appreciate how it can support up to three displays at the same time. Other connectivity options include WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, and a 2.5GbE LAN port. Additionally, USB4 ports take the performance even further by offering up to 40Gbps transfer speeds. For reference, it can easily move a 3GB 4K video in just 1 second – quite literally.</p>
<p>Despite all this power, the mini PC stays fairly quiet while working. It comes with an advanced dual fan that ensures quiet and efficient operation, regardless of the task at hand. The PC itself is quite compact and can even be mounted at the back of a monitor for a cleaner setup. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, too, so you can get started with using the device right away.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to give your desktop setup a refresh, now is a great time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6688/">This efficient PC is now available for less than $600, and is sure to make both work and play a lot more enjoyable.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long-rumored StarCraft shooter looks set to be revealed this year. </p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a>, the StarCraft third-person shooter is “likely” to be revealed at BlizzCon 2026 in September.</p>







<p>“The headline for BlizzCon 2026 is most likely going to be&nbsp;StarCraft,” Corden writes. “It was&nbsp;previously reported that StarCraft is getting the third-person shooter treatment, and I confirmed these rumors true via my own sources a while back.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, rumors of this new game are nothing new. As far back as September 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-starcraft-shooter-in-development-at-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported</a> on this new title, which first came from Jason Schreier. It was mentioned as being in development in his latest book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725429/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future Of Blizzard Entertainment</a>, and former Far Cry head Dan Hay was leading the team.</p>



<p>No other details about this game are known at this point, but to hear it’s still moving forward has to be excited for fans of the franchise. Of course, this isn’t the first time Blizzard is attempting a shooter based on the StarCraft franchise. </p>







<p>Back in 2002, Blizzard announced StarCraft: Ghost, a stealth-action shooter. Eventually, the game was put on an “indefinite hold” in March 2006 before being canceled. </p>



<p>Overall, there hasn’t been a new release in the StarCraft universe since StarCraft: Remastered in 2017. The last new original release was StarCraft 2 in 2010.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mysterious Fallout Countdown Isn’t Related to Fallout 3 Remake, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-3-remake-not-linked-to-mysterious-countdown/</link>
            <guid>1399441</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re at all invested in the Fallout space, you’ll have heard about the ‘mysterious countdown’ that’s running on the Amazon Prime platform. It’s set to expire when the last episode of the Fallout TV show’s second season drops on February 4. From the moment the countdown popped up, fans have believed it to be counting down to a reveal of the Fallout 3 remake.</p>



<p>However, a new report from a notable source has suggested this <strong>is not the case</strong>. It’s not counting down to a shadow drop or announcement of the Fallout 3 remake, <strong>but </strong>the project <strong>is </strong>on the way.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-3-remake-is-coming-but-nobody-knows-when">Fallout 3 Remake is Coming, But Nobody Knows When</h2>



<p>In a new and extensive report from Windows Central, the future of Xbox and the many studios under the gaming titan’s banner was explored. It’s a huge year for ‘Team Green’, and several high-profile anniversaries promise some sizeable announcements should be lined up.</p>



<p>Fans of the post-apocalyptic series from Bethesda Game Studios have been expecting a reveal of the Fallout 3 remake for quite some time. However, despite references to the project being found in documents some years ago, <strong>nothing concrete </strong>has been announced by the studio.</p>



<p>That might be about to change soon, but what’s suspected to be the biggest indicator of an impending announcement has been <strong>debunked</strong>.</p>



<p>In Jez Corden’s <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent supersized breakdown</a> of what’s coming in the Xbox space, the insider stressed that the Fallout countdown running on the Amazon Prime site is <strong>not </strong>related to a Fallout 3 remake announcement.</p>



<p>He wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m told this is not the case. However, we are&nbsp;<em>eventually&nbsp;</em>getting a Fallout 3 remake in the vein of&nbsp;Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not clear when Bethesda Game Studios plans to announce the Fallout 3 remake, but at this point, it’s almost guaranteed that it’ll be unveiled soon. In the last couple of years, the Fallout TV show, updates to Fallout 4, and the ongoing expansion of Fallout 76 have all combined to push franchise sentiments sky-high.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Nintendo Won The Console War</p>
      </div>
<p>Disney confirmed last year that the <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/hulu-app-phased-out-disney-plus-fully-integrating-1236480450/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu app will be fully integrated into Disney+</a>, unifying both of the company's streaming services. Standalone subscriptions for both services will still be available once the platform merger occurs sometime this year, but anyone wishing to watch Hulu offerings at that point will have to do so on the Disney+ app.</p><p>That proves troublesome for Switch owners, as Disney+ has never been available on Nintendo consoles, skipping support for the Switch and lacking any support for Switch 2. Disney+ isn't alone, as the likes of Netflix, Prime Video (both of which supported Wii U), and HBO Max are also no-shows on Switch platforms.</p><p>It's a frustrating development for Switch users who would prefer to watch their streaming media on their hybrid consoles. The only noteworthy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-apps/1100-6495947/" data-ref-id="1100-6495947">streaming apps on Switch 1 are YouTube</a> and Crunchyroll, though neither functions on Switch 2. A Twitch app was also available on Switch, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-losing-twitch-app-soon/1100-6518803/" data-ref-id="1100-6518803">it was discontinued in 2023</a>.</p><p>Of course, Nintendo fans can continue to stream their favorite media on smart TVs--or other consoles they own.</p>

            <p>If you haven't been watching, Fallout Season 2 is pretty great and has been enjoying a good deal of success. So much so that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">Season 3 is already well into the writing stage</a>. New games are sadly still a ways off, however, which is why both veteran and new players are flocking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> and other entries to go post-apocalyptic.</p>
<p>That’s what <a href="https://steamdb.info/">SteamDB</a> has been saying, at least. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-season-2-has-doubled-the-number-of-people-playing-the-fallout-games-on-steam/">PC Gamer</a> took a look at the data before and after Season 2 premiered back in December 2025. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>, which recently received an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-announces-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-confirms-nintendo-switch-2-version-for-2026">Anniversary Edition</a>, seems to be the biggest winner, with its concurrent players count going from 20,000 on average to 40,000 as of last Sunday. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and 2010's New Vegas also saw similar bumps, with the latter being the most relevant to Season 2's plot and setting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> has also doubled its concurrent players from a hundred-ish to around 200. For a single-player game released on 2008 that’s also available elsewhere and doesn’t have as many direct ties to the TV show as the other three we’ve mentioned, that’s not bad. Even free-to-play, mobile-oriented <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a> saw an increase in activity.</p>
<p>The New Vegas-oriented second season of Fallout, which is currently airing new episodes each week via Amazon’s Prime Video, takes Lucy, The Ghoul, Maximus, and many other characters to very familiar places, yet the key creatives behind the show have been smart enough to avoid the usual interconnected universe, franchise-building issues.</p><p>Needless to say, Microsoft-owned and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>-led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> has done a great job of shepherding the show alongside the creative team led by Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy, Graham Wagner, and Geneva Robertson-Dworet, making it not just the perfect gateway into the video game franchise, but also a respectable companion piece that’s defining the post-Fallout 4 timeline <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-5-will-exist-in-a-world-where-the-stories-and-events-of-the-show-happened-or-are-happening-says-todd-howard">the fifth game will be acknowledging when it finally arrives</a>. For now, we have more Fallout 76 content updates and the Switch 2 port of Fallout 4 to look forward to.</p>

            <p>Kazutaka Kodaka is one of the most recognizable names in the games industry for those who really enjoy anime-inspired visual novels. Recently, he led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a>'s development, and the his name may be familiar to anyone au fait with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/danganronpa-and-the-surprising-joys-of-clumsy-queer-representation">Danganronpa</a> series. But the creator's journey to get back into the world of game development wasn’t exactly a straight line.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/danganronpa-creator-became-a-game-dev-because-of-an-argument-he-had-while-working-part-time-that-made-him-think-what-am-i-doing-with-my-life/">Automaton</a> (who also translated the original comments), we’ve learned that, during last year’s Computer Entertainment Developers Conference (CEDEC+KYUSHU 2025), the director explained  how he landed the position his Spike Chunsoft, which led to the creation of the original Danganronpa. The main twist? He decided to focus on games after having a heated exchange with a co-worker while working part-time at a game shop.</p>
<p>After a few games-related gigs, Kodaka spent quite some time in his twenties making indie films and working part-time jobs. One day, at the aforementioned game shop, he scolded a fellow university student working alongside him for a mistake she made, saying she wouldn’t make it in society. Her answer was pointing out that he "hadn't been out in society" for a while, which made him stop, ask himself "What am I even doing", and rethink his life choices and how he interacted with others (as revealed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1zJH-dl-kw">another interview</a>) going forward.</p>
<p>This exchange ended his game development hiatus after working in minor roles on projects like Clock Tower 3 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil 2</a>, as he started a job hunt which landed him a position at Spike. The rest is history. Danganronpa became a hit praised for its mix of dark comedy, heavy themes, and engaging mystery before spawning a larger series of well-recieved titles. By the late 2010s, he departed Spike and founded the studio Too Kyo Games alongside other veterans.</p><p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-hundred-line-and-danganronpa-creator-says-there-would-be-more-uniquely-japanese-games-if-development-was-more-creator-oriented-and-focused-on-individuality/">Kodaka has been vocal in the past</a> about the huge impact anime, manga, and “borrowed” video games had on his personal storytelling style and the visual aspect of Danganronpa and The Hundred Line. It’s nice to hear about his life before becoming a massive name in the Japanese games industry though. Yet another reminder you never know what might be around the corner.</p>

			<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">on December 17, 2025</a>, Splitgate developer <strong>1047 Games</strong> relaunched Splitgate 2 as <strong>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</strong>. The new title is meant to signify a fusion of the best of the first game and its maligned sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-back-to-beta-re-launch-2026-og-splitgate-servers-shutdown-1047-games-layoffs/">after Splitgate 2's initial launch went terribly</a>, and 1047 Games co-founder <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">promised to "<em>make FPS great again</em>."</a></p>



<p>If you didn't know that Splitgate 2 had relaunched under its new moniker, or that it had relaunched at all, then don't worry; you're not alone. Arena Reloaded doesn't seem to have fared any better than Splitgate 2, at least according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#max">its concurrent player numbers on SteamDB</a>. The game <strong>currently struggles to hit 1k concurrent players,</strong> and two days after some publications reported on those poor numbers, 1047 Games has taken it upon itself to respond.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982">In a statement posted to its official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, the caption reads, "<em>1047 Games Responds to Recent Steam Charts Conversations</em>," almost like it was trying to write a headline for publications to use. The statement goes on to begin with, "<em>Steam Charts don't measure fun</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>They show one number, on one platform, at one given moment. They don't show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible. To our amazing community: thank you. Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day. And to everyone who hasn't</em> <em>played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay's the best it's ever been, and we'd love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The thing is, 1047 Games is absolutely right. It's not the best thing to get stuck in the weeds of SteamDB numbers when it comes to multi-platform games. Those numbers are only showing one platform, and we can't even take it as a proper read of PC players because Arena Reloaded is also available on the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>Console platforms like PlayStation and Xbox don't share concurrent player numbers, so we can't really know how popular the game is outside of Steam. And SteamDB charts are only ever worth keeping an eye on when it comes to multiplayer games; they absolutely do not matter for single-player titles. </p>



<p>With all that said, if 1047 Games felt the need to make a statement like this, that can't be a sign that things are actually going fine internally when the team looks at its player numbers. If its numbers on Steam were low, but on consoles, it has thousands or even hundreds of thousands of players each day, then why care about chatter surrounding a platform that isn't the one your community is on? Some games are more popular on PC, while others are more popular on consoles.</p>



<p>So yes, SteamDB charts are never the full picture and anyone claiming that Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is dead in the water based solely on those numbers doesn't have all of the facts. But making a statement like this two days after initial reports of the low numbers seems more like an attempt to keep Splitgate in the news as much as possible, hoping more people will remember that it exists and give it a chance.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, of course, but if Splitgate: Arena Reloaded's concurrent player numbers on Steam are an accurate representation of how unpopular the game currently is, and the dire straits it is in, then that also feels like the exact kind of thing you would do if you were desperate for anyone to play your game.</p>



<p>Let us know below if we've got the situation completely wrong, and you're playing Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on your console or PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Japanese company Hitachi has announced a new voice command software protocol for the Switch 2, and I, for one, am daring to hope it could be used to finally bring old DS games to the system.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hitachi-launches-multilingual-intuitive-voice-command-recognition-software-for-nintendo-switch-2-game-devs/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, the Ruby Spotter software allows developers to incorporate voice command features beyond simply using the microphone for communication. It's actually already available in a number of other places, including "car navigation systems" and "industrial equipment", according to Automaton.</p><p>Hitachi's decision to bring the software to the Switch 2 is driven by a desire to create an environment for developers to include "highly flexible operations" for the microphone in their games, including menu selections and issuing in-game commands.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>New voice command options will soon be available to Nintendo Switch 2 developers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The possibilities are endless; developers could use Hitachi's Ruby Spotter software to allow you to issue commands to troops in a strategy game, for instance, or to communicate with an in-game character, <em>Nintendogs</em>-style.</p><p>That might as well bring us onto what I really hope this software can be used for: porting DS games to the Switch 2. Since there's already a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-klonoa-mr-driller" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="201c59bf-eb51-4121-bbf8-ae2b52eff44c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">robust library</a> of Game Boy Advance <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40d7514b-1ab5-4518-bcb1-2874c7dd70bf" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">games</a> on the Switch Online service, I think the debut of DS titles is way past due.</p><p>Games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass </em>and the aforementioned <em>Nintendogs </em>used the Nintendo DS' microphone as part of their gameplay, and Hitachi's Ruby Spotter could allow Nintendo to bring those games (which are otherwise unavailable) to the Switch 2.</p><p>As it stands, there are tons of DS games, including the ones I've mentioned, that you'll need to turn to the second-hand market to enjoy, and so this would seem like the perfect opportunity to port them to modern systems. Come on, Nintendo. You know it makes sense.</p><figure role="group">

            <p>Right, get ready for some chatter about where the contents of our collective wallets have gone over the past year. Valve's list of the highest-grossing games on Steam in 2025 has emerged from the great mists, and in a nice revelation, features a larger number of fresh releases than last year's ranking. That's alongside all of the moderately to quite old stuff which more folks keep hopping on the train of with every passing 12 month period. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025?tab=2">data</a>'s been dissected, shared, and otherwise <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18eg0P-P-swZ8v6kWyA4XkJpIEhr7UZospSWqJMEmDK4/edit?gid=0#gid=0">spreadsheeted</a> by <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/who-won-steams-best-of-2025-revenue">GameDiscoverCo</a> in their latest newsletter. The big news is that of the top 100 highest grossers, 31 were new games - that meaning games released in 2025 or 2024 in this case. Fresh games made up 24 of the 100 spots in last year's version of this ranking, so things have trended marginally newer.</p>
<p>"It’s possible that 2025 was just a super-strong year for new games," GameDiscoverCo boffin Simon Carless wrote of potential explanations for this shift. "It’s also possible that with more and more ‘catalog games’ being sold cheaply on discount, sorting by revenue will favour $60 newcomers &amp; viral hits (vs. games at 25-50% of the price that still do good ‘long tail’.) It’s probably...a combo of these things?"</p>
<p>As for the new games which made the cut, Valve split these rankings into four tiers of moneyness - platinum, gold, silver, and bronze. Platinum's the top ranking, with seven of its 12 this year meeting the new game requirements. Those were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>, plus viral hits Schedule 1 and REPO. There's also Call of Duty, which technically counts as new thanks to Activision's switch to dishing out its latest shootering via an app. The remaining four platinumers are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, all of which have shot their way to defending the honour of the non-brand new games.</p><p>Moving down to gold tier, you find newbies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a>. They're hanging out with a number of other well-established big hitters - your Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur's Gate 3. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a> are also in that club, proving their staying power. The tier below that, silver is home to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, while Hades 2's nestled in bronze. Taking a glance at the list of most played Steam Deck games, both Silksong and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> have vaulted straight into the platinum section this year.</p>
<p>As Carless eludes to, pinning down exactly what's caused this year's shifts is complicated, but the wider trend at least appears to suggest the continued strangulation of folks' ability to spend on new games without worrying they might suddenly need that money because they've been laid off isn't pushing things even more starkly away from newer games which're usually more pricey than their older brethren.</p>
<p>Then again, the fact Steam's free of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a> - two perennial stalwarts of lists like these for other platforms - is probably helping make that sunny assessment easier to reach.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon’s Promo Card For Its Natural History Museum Collab Could Scare Off Scalpers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-natural-history-museum-pikachu-card-scalper-2000657713</link>
            <guid>1399387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After the destructive shitstorm that happened when </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131"><span>collaborated with Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum</span></a><span> in 2023, I’m surprised any esteemed establishment wants to partner with Pikachu and friends. Videos of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers pulling a Black Friday-level raid</span></a><span> on the museum’s store are still lodged in my brain, and when I heard the Natural History Museum in London was going to have a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>exhibit later this month, I started bracing myself for a repeat. It may still happen, but now that The Pokémon Company and the museum have </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/pokemon-natural-history-presents-pokecology"><span>announced the card</span></a><span> they’ll be giving out at the event, some fans are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1q6bqwn/new_natural_history_museum_promo_for_the/"><span>letting out a sigh of optimistic relief</span></a><span> that scalpers might leave the whole thing alone.</span></p> <p><span>The “Pikachu at the Museum” promo card is super cute, and shows the little yellow guy excitedly walking through a museum adorned with what look like fossils of Aerodactyl and Tyrantrum. At a glance, it doesn’t look like a great card for competitive play, with reasonably low stats and good but not great damage output for the amount of energy cards you’ll have to feed into it, but none of that actually matters because this card won’t be used in a deck. It’s a jumbo card, not suitable for use in a playable deck or, perhaps more notably, for placement into a collector’s binder.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657715" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657715"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657715">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This is significant because jumbo cards tend to go under scalpers’ radars, specifically because they’re often harder to sell. Though its rarity may still bring in vultures, fans are hopeful this choice will take the wind out of resellers’ sails. On top of this, the card will be available at select UK retailers on January 30, so if scalpers want it that badly, they might have better luck bothering a store than a museum.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I love how their scalping prevention is ‘let’s make it a jumbo, nobody cares about jumbos,’” ZVAARI wrote on Reddit. “Hope someone makes a nice normal sized reproduction of it, the art is cool and I’d like to have it in my binder.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Its both a shame it’s oversized (won’t fit in my collection nicely), but also will hopefully prevent too much hype,” PlopTheOwl wrote in the same thread. “Love the art. Would have liked it to be a full art, but honestly so pleased to see some Pokémon bones like in-game Pokémon museums.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657714"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657714">© The Pok<span>émon Company</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>After this announcement, I’m more concerned the collab’s exclusive merchandise might be targeted by scalpers, rather than the card itself. The museum will also be selling an exclusive collection of art, stationery, clothes, collectibles, and a Pikachu plush showing him hugging a miniature museum. These will also be sold online at the UK Pokémon Center shop and the museum’s online store. If nothing else, it seems the museum and Pokémon Company are trying to avoid a second Van Gogh debacle, but we’ll see if these safeguards actually amount to anything, as scalpers still find a way to ruin anything with Pikachu’s face on it. If nothing else, I hope the fans who show up to see the exhibit are able to have a good time without being trampled by someone looking to flip the merchandise.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>x Natural History Museum event will last from January 26 to April 19.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-zenscreen-15-6-portable-monitor-quietly-drops-to-a-record-low-with-a-3-year-warranty-included-2000657284</link>
            <guid>1399384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tired of running out of screen real estate when working on your laptop? The ASUS ZenScreen 16″ (viewable 15.6″) is a mobile monitor that can give your laptop or tablet the feel of a complete desktop wherever you go. It adds extra screen space for work, school and play, without having to carry a large additional display. And best of all, it can make working with multiple windows much more comfortable at home, at the office, or on the go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6687/">You can find the ASUS ZenScreen 16″ (viewable 15.6″) at Amazon for the low price of $119, which is a $30 savings off of the original price of $149</a>. This is an excellent opportunity to save money on this product, since it’s been discounted 20%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6687/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An additional portable monitor to give you more space</h2>
<p>This 15.6-inch viewable display is large enough to be used as a true secondary monitor. That means you can keep email, chat, or reference documentation open on one window while you are working on the primary window. For example, this would be ideal for students researching papers, professionals managing spreadsheets and taking phone calls, or anyone that likes to keep streaming video and/or social media feeds open while they work. The text appears clear, and the widescreen format works well for having multiple windows side-by-side.</p>
<p>The ASUS ZenScreen 16″ is also extremely portable. The monitor is very thin and lightweight, making it easy to fit into a backpack or laptop case without being too bulky. Whether you’re traveling a lot or you just want to give yourself more room to work, game, or browse online, ou can’t do much better than this.</p>



<p>Setting up the ASUS ZenScreen 16″ is also easy. Just connect it with a single USB-C cable that provides both power and video in minutes. That means you don’t actually need any additional power bricks and cables. And who wants to figure out a place to put all of those, anyway? This results in a clean workspace and allows for easy movement between locations. Mostly, that means you might actually use it instead of tossing it in the closet.</p>
<p>Tech can be prohibitively expensive in some categories these days, and it can be hard to find deals on things you want to add to your stack. An extra monitor can be expensive, but this deal makes it relatively painless to spend.</p>
<p>This portable monitor might just change the way you get things done online. It can help, first and foremost, make your digital life seem less cluttered. Whether you’re creating graphics and placing tool palettes to the sides, keeping notes open during online classes, or monitoring chat windows while gaming, the additional screen will make a difference. All you have to do is make sure to grab it while it’s discounted.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is an online multiplayer extraction shooter that features PvE as well as PvP systems. You can run in and shoot NPC enemies or, if you're feeling particularly violent, you can blast player-controlled characters. But for developer Embark Studios, the latter isn't really the point of the game, so don't expect more PvP systems in the future.</p><p>In <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an interview</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video playthrough</a> with GamesBeat on December 30 (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-mechanics-like-leaderboards" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund explained that the team isn't planning on adding anything like PvP leaderboards because the PvP environment merely creates tension in the game. It isn't the bedrock on which the rest of the game was built.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Arc Raiders Solo Experience Changed My Brain</p>
      </div>
<p>"We've had several discussions about Nemesis systems and all types of things," he said. "I don't know where the team [is] on them right now. I think one of the beauties of this game is the fact that we don't have those leaderboards, and it's not competitive. We don't want to necessarily foster that type of gameplay. The game isn't about shooting other players. You can do that if you want to, but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players. It's a part that we use to craft tension."</p><p>There's a risk-reward system at play when you embark in Arc Raiders, as you make calculated assessments on the situations around you. Söderlund said that, in one iteration of the game, other players weren't visible, but bringing them in and making the game an online multiplayer environment further enhanced that tension as you determined the risks you're willing to take.</p><p>"The game was without other players for a long time," Söderlund said. "And yes, there were instances where the game was fun, and there were areas where it worked quite well. But also, the minute you added other players and then use subtle ways of signaling--you don't know how many players are on the server, you don't know how many players have died, you don't know how many players are around you--but we signal to you that there are other players. You hear them shooting. That's why audio is a very important part of this game. You hear them encountering Arc and other players. You see the raider flares as they go down. At one point--it was funny--I came back into a playtest, and the raider flares were gone. I'm like, 'Why did you remove those?' And they're like, 'Well, well…' So I just said, 'Just bring them back.' They're such an iconic part of this game."</p><p>This tension, as well as the myriad players you could encounter as you shot your way through Arc Raiders, made the game feel alive and populated in a way that was missing during developmental playtests. Söderlund once again emphasized that tension, but said that other players were only one part of the equation. The sound, the enemies, the world--these make up the rest of it.</p><p>Speaking of tension, Arc Raiders is fielding some intense pressure lately. The game has come under fire for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">using AI for things like voice lines</a>, with Embark Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">defending the technology</a>, saying it's beneficial for developers and players. Still, the game continues to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">a huge success for the Swedish studio</a>, so much so that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-received-movie-and-tv-offers/1100-6537191/" data-ref-id="1100-6537191">Embark Studios has received movie and TV offers</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[January Kicks Off 2026 With Some Big Free Games]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/epic-store-free-games-jan-2026-amazon-prime-2000657707</link>
            <guid>1399354</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Epic Games Store’s holiday giveaways are over but it’s getting 2026 started with another batch of very good freebies. That’s on top of a bunch of free games Amazon is giving away for paid Prime subscribers.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/total-war-three-kingdoms-the-kotaku-review-1834993637"><em>Total War: Three</em> Kingdoms</a>, normally $60, is the Epic Games Store’s first big free game of the year, which anyone can go and claim just by logging into the PC <em>Fortnite</em> launcher. The sprawling strategy game is one of the <em>Total War</em> franchise’s best and will cover you for the rest of the month and beyond if you’ve never played it before. It also won’t break your PC in terms of specs, with only a GTX 650 equivalent needed to get the game running.</p> <p>The other freebie right now is <em>Wildgate</em>, the sci-fi PvPvE multiplayer shooter from ex-Blizzard developers. The idea of <em>Sea of Thieves</em> in space with Moba elements is neat, but the execution leaves something to be desired. The player counts have gotten low on Steam, so if you want to check out what this one’s all about before it’s potentially put on ice, now’s the time. Both<em> Wildgate</em> and <em>Three Kingdoms</em> are free through January 8.</p>

 <h2>Prime Gaming free games for January 2026</h2> <p>Amazon also revealed the games that Prime subscribers can claim for free this month, starting with <em>Civilization 6</em>. Here are the rest:</p> <blockquote> <p id="available-now"><strong>Available Now</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Reflections of Life: Dark Architect Collector’s Edition</em></li> </ul> <p id="january-15"><strong>January</strong> <strong>15</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Deathkeep</em></li> <li><em>Brigador: Up-Armored Deluxe</em></li> <li><em>Gunslugs: Rogue Tactics</em></li> </ul> <p id="january-22"><strong>January 22</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Harold Halibut</em></li> <li><em>D&amp;D Stronghold: Kingdom Simulator</em></li> </ul> <p id="january-29"><strong>January 29</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Elderborn</em></li> <li><em>Technotopia</em></li> <li><em>Al-Qadim: The Genie’s Curse</em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>Given<em> Civilization 7</em> still isn’t quite where fans want it to be following its launch last year, <em>Civ 6</em> is a great place to start for anyone who’s been away from the 4X series. <em>Brigador: Up-Armored Edition</em> is also an oldie but a goodie. The top-down, twin-stick shooter is like the old J<em>ungle Strike</em> games but for mechs.</p>

              <p>Smartwatches do a lot more than just track your steps and monitor your heart rate. The best options out there are made to help you stay connected, plus on top of your health and fitness levels, right from your wrist.</p>
<p>Google makes some of the best Android smartwatches out there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/">Now is a great time to pick up its latest Pixel Watch 4, as Amazon has dropped it by 22%. This brings the price of this $450 watch down to just $350</a>. The offer applies to all color options, including the black case with obsidian band, the champagne case with lemongrass band, and the silver case with iris band, so there are options to choose from. Those looking for something basic yet classy should consider the black model. And if you want your watch to pop, the lemongrass band is sure to turn some heads!</p>

<h2>Plethora of Health and Fitness Features</h2>
<p>The smartwatch flaunts a stunning Actua 360 domed display that’s 10% larger and 50% brighter than the Pixel Watch 3. You will be able to comfortably use it in both a sunny day and a dimly lit room without squinting. The scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass, paired with aerospace-grade aluminum housing, makes Pixel 4 more durable than ever, meaning you won’t have to constantly stress about those accidental scratches and everyday wear that’s almost inevitable. Speaking of durability, the watch is also IP68-rated, which means it can withstand most weather conditions well. Wearing it while walking in the rain or during sweaty workouts won’t affect its functionality one bit.</p>
<p>Fitness-wise, the watch offers over 40 exercise modes to let you track a range of workouts, from early morning stretches to midday cardio and late-night runs. It features custom run plans and even offers real-time guidance with advanced form tracking to help you train better. When it comes to health, Pixel 4 monitors your heart rate, plus tracks your sleep. The latter helps you understand how well you rest at night, and you can then use those insights to improve your sleep quality.</p>



<p>When connected to your phone, the watch helps you view important notifications, take calls, reply to texts, and manage music – all from your wrist. Additionally, the Satellite SOS feature lets you update your loved ones on your whereabouts, even when you’re off the grid. Gemini comes built in, so you will have a smart AI assistant to help you with stuff throughout the day. You can use it to quickly search stuff, brainstorm ideas, get reply suggestions, create schedules, and more; without picking your phone up.</p>
<p>A single charge gets you up to 30 hours of battery life. You can extend it up to 48 hours in Battery Saver mode. That’s more than enough to go a couple of days without worrying about plugging the watch in. Even better, when you’re running low, a quick 15-minute top-up can get you an additional 15 hours of usage. This is great for when you’re in a hurry and don’t have the time to recharge the watch fully.</p>
<p>Note that while the basic health and fitness features are available for free, advanced metrics can be accessed using Fitbit Premium. This membership offers AI-run recommendations based on your goals, deeper insights, and even access to energizing workouts by Peloton instructors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/">There’s plenty more to like about the Google Pixel Watch 4. You can now grab a $100 discount, which applies to all color options</a>. It won’t last long, though, so it’s best to place your orders without wasting time.</p>
