            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> studio Hazelight has invited two players to Sweden to see its next game after they completed a secret level so challenging, "there are barely people on our team that can make it."
</p>
<p>
Laser Hell, as the level is known, can found toward the end of Split Fiction's Isolation chapter, specifically during the Maximum Security level. In order to access it, players are required to enter the binary code found on a bit of Skotos signage using the elevator floor buttons nearby. With that done and both players in place, the elevator begins its descent into Laser Hell.
</p>
<p>
This rock-hard secret area is essentially a five-stage laser gauntlet, requiring players to navigate its perils and get to the end unscathed. Success, if it ever comes, is rewarded with a video message from Split Fiction director Josef Fares, congratulating the victors on crossing the finishing line. "Wow, amazing," he says. "This challenge, there are barely people on our team that can make it... It took us a lot of time to finish it... This is a crazy, crazy achievement."

<p>
And how do we know about Fares' secret message? That's thanks to the skills of two Chinese content creators, E1uM4y and Sharkov, who <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ExXuYaE7E/">both recorded their journey through Laser Hell</a> for all to see. But it doesn't end there. Fares continued by promising the first pair to complete the secret area would be invited to visit Hazelight for an early look at its next game - and he's now <a href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068">confirmed he'll be sticking to his work in a post on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Congrats to 'sharkOvO' and 'E1uM4y' for finishing the secret challenge Laser Hell in Split Fiction," he wrote. "VERY impressive! I will keep my promise and invite you both to Sweden for an early look of our next game. We'll be in touch!"
</p>
<p>
As to what that new game is, it's currently being kept firmly under wraps - in large part because it's still very early days. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9-_n3vqsAQ">recent conversation with the Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Fares said he was "fully-focused and excited on the next thing that we already have started", confirming it had only been in development for around a month.
</p>
<p>
Whatever it is, it'll be one to keep an eye on. Split Fiction, the follow-up to Hazelight's much-loved <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>, launched to massive critical acclaim earlier this month, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">five star review from Eurogamer</a>, where we called it "one of most inventive and joyful co-op games to date". And it's resonated with players too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">shifting over 2m copies since its release</a>.

Their three-minute video showcases not only what a successful run looks like but also the hellish tasks that await inside it. Split Ficition’s Laser Hell level is a gauntlet of demanding platforming challenges that see players dodging up and around a series of laser rooms, but it is doable — and there’s a special video for those who see it through to the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As demonstrated in E1uM4y and Sharkov’s video, reaching the end of Split Fiction’s hardest level rewards Mio and Zoe with a clip recorded by Hazelight’s own Josef Fares. After opening the video with applause, he says he’s “super amazed” by anyone who was able to beat the level while joking that his praise isn’t for “you guys who are looking (at) this on YouTube.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Wow. Amazing. You have to understand, this challenge, there are barely people on our team that can make it,” Fares says in the video. “It took us a lot of time to finish it. I’m telling you; this is a crazy, crazy achievement you have done.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a feat worth celebrating indeed, but wait, there’s more! Fares promises that the first pair of players who manage to beat Split Fiction’s Laser Hell level and confirm their success will be flown out to Hazelight in Sweden for an early look at the studio’s next game along with a few “other surprises.” It’s a promise that the director personally followed up on and confirmed in <a href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X/Twitter</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Congrats to ”sharkOvO” and ”E1uM4y” for finishing the secret challenge ”Laser Hell” in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/splitficton?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#splitficton</a>.

All you need to do is input a binary code listed under a Skotos label at the location shown, have your partner stand beside you, and you’ll be taken down to a room where you’ll surely spend countless attempts trying to see Fares’ video in person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what exactly Hazelight will be showing E1uM4y and Sharkov, those details remain a mystery. Fares recently shared that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-dev-calls-ea-a-good-partner-as-hazelight-begins-work-on-next-game"><u>the studio has been working on its next project for around a month</u></a> but declined to spill much in terms of its story, name, or release plans. We do know, at least, that the Hazelight team is “very excited” about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction launched earlier this month for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S and quickly became yet another co-op success for the studio. After securing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-sells-one-million-copies-in-48-hours"><u>1 million sales in just 48 hours</u></a>, Mio and Zoe’s story pulled a total of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-hits-2-million-sales-after-just-1-week"><u>2 million in just one week</u></a>. We’ve yet to hear any more information about sales stats, but it sounds like Hazelight is very happy with how Split Fiction has performed so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-scratch-coding-and-discipline-at-the-heart-of-animal-well<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year, Chicago-based, solo independent developer Shared Memory, headed up by Billy Basso, released its first game: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Offering a combat-free approach to the exploration platformer genre (also known as a Metroidvania), Animal Well garnered a wealth of acclaim and praise for its highly stylized design ethos. Once the project was complete, its file size clocked in at a microscopic 33MB. Even compared to other independent games at this scale, shipping a game that takes up less than one-tenth of a gigabyte on a hard drive signifies a feat of technical wizardry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Appropriately, Basso hosted a talk titled, “Developing at 5MB per Year: The Making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">,” at the Game Developers Conference this week. Focused on both the scratch coding he used to code the game and the discipline required to stick with a seven-year project, Basso spilled some of his secrets to making such an impressive—and small—game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, he broke down the tools he used for various parts of the game, saying, “I used Visual Studio for code. That actually covers a lot of development because you don’t really get a level editor when you’re not using Unity or Unreal, so there’s a lot of good data in the game that’s hard-coded in C++ files. I did make my own custom level editor that’s kinda built into the game that can be toggled on and off.” For the sprite and pixel art, he used the program Aseprite for the pixel art, mentioning that he modified the program itself on GitHub after coming up with a bespoke animation format. And for audio production, Basso used Reaper, another common choice for smaller developers.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-s-ceo-cto-promise-stability-after-runtime-fee-debacle" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity's CEO, CTO promise 'stability' after runtime fee debacle</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But here is where Basso began to deviate from his peers. Addressing the discipline and workflow side of managing a solo project like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for nearly a decade, he said, “For design and sort of task-tracking production stuff, I would just open up text files in Notepad on my desktop.” The crowd chuckled a little before he followed up, “I wouldn’t even name them or save them. I’d just type things in them and then when all the tasks were complete, I would close and then Windows would warn me ‘You might wanna save.’” This got even more shocked laughs from the packed convention hall.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Returning to the development tools he used, Basso demonstrated the various modes of his homebrewed level editor. Using a tool that resembles Super Mario Maker’s level editor, he showed the palette of every sprite and tile in the game, adding “I could just pick one and sort of paint them around. [Designing levels] was just a matter of drawing these sprites and making the screens with all the basic kind of Photoshop-y tools.” Basso described a handful of Photoshop-inspired tools like the eye dropper and paint bucket. He even went into the Photoshop install files and extolled the application’s paint bucket icon because he liked that tool so much.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-technical-magic-behind-doctor-strange-s-portals-in-marvel-rivals" target="_self" data-discover="true">The technical magic behind Doctor Strange's portals in Marvel Rivals</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Exactly 256 rooms in ">Exactly 256 rooms in <span>Animal Well</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He used these tools to fit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s world into a 16-by-16-room grid, making exactly 256 separate rooms. Basso said, “I couldn’t create any more because every room had a one-byte ID to it, so it only had 256 possible values.” That was a deliberate choice on his part to avoid any kind of scope creep where possible. Instead, he says he focused on getting the absolute most out of each of the rooms, adding, “I just focused on making every room as dense as possible. It was kind of a fun constraint.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> received glowing praise thanks in no small part to its dense, efficient use of its detailed world map. Cramming the entire map into a one-byte system feels appropriate for a game that was hailed by players for its Swiss watch-like complexity and attention to detail.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Charlie's a Milwaukee-based games, food, travel, and tech reporter with work also featured in the likes of IGN, CNN, NPR, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-lays-off-90-of-project-sigil-staff<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The future is uncertain for Wizards of the Coast's dedicated virtual tabletop platform. It has recently been announced that the tabletop company has laid off 90% of employees working on Project Sigil, their Unreal-powered VTT dedicated to playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The Project Sigil Lay-Offs</h2>

<p>Andy Collins made the Project Sigil layoffs public via a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andy-collins-912a953_today-approximately-30-talented-developers-activity-7307907059092443137-SFhR/" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn post</a>. The post stated that more than 30 employees, himself included, were laid off from the team. Those employees made up 90% of the team dedicated to Project Sigil. Collins expressed his disappointment but reiterated that there are still people working on the project.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/project-sigil-town-map.jpg?itok=sR497zHd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/project-sigil-town-map.jpg?itok=UF3Ui36F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A recent report from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons/542716/wizards-sigil-vtt-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Polygon</a> corroborated these layoffs. The post includes an email from Dan Rawson, Senior Vice President of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and Hasbro Direct.</p>

<p>The email states that they are scaling back their plans for Project Sigil. It was originally imagined as a large, standalone game with "a distinct monetization path." But since that was deemed untenable, they have scaled back the development team accordingly. Rawson also confirms that the laid off employees will be receiving severance packages, career placement services, and internal opportunities.</p>

<p>The silver lining for consumers is that Sigil will be sticking around as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a> feature. All materials developed for the project will be available at no additional cost to users. This means if you want to make a virtual miniature or your own battlemap using Sigil's software, it is just another tool in your virtual toolbelt. Assuming you have a premium subscription to the platform, of course.</p>

<p>Collins is a long-time employee of Wizards of the Coast. He joined the company in 1996 as an editor and designer in their R&amp;D division. His accolades include the sci-fi setting of Alternity, the d20 <em>Star Wars</em> TTRPG, a <em>Sage Advice</em> author on <em>Dragon Magazine</em>, and the revision team on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 3.5 Edition.</p>

It's a wise choice: rather than trying the awkward task of fitting a digital, real-time experience into the tabletop world, upping the scale lets Gangs of Night City play to the strengths of a board game, with well considered tactical and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic</a> options at your disposal.

Once used, your each action type needs to be refreshed before you can take it again, presenting players with difficult desicions around order and timing.

Each unit type spearheads an overall approach you can specialize in, or you can mix and match to try and gain an edge. The game is interactive and dynamic and you'll need to read the situation and tailor your tactics accordingly in the tussle for area control. To top it off, there are fine production values to enjoy, with detailed miniatures and a suitably neon-spangled board depicting Night City.

"We are not yet the Netflix of Games, but that's exactly where we're heading."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To get there, Tascan feels the company must ruffle feathers. The former Epic exec, who replaced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-games-generative-ai-proponent-mike-verdu-has-departed">outbound Netflix exec Mike Verdu</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in July 2024, suggests the game industry has entered an era of stagnation and is crying out for change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I've been in the industry for a long time and we know there have been headwinds, unfortunately. Some of them are of course associated with cost [...] but what I see is also, over the last 10 years, we haven't seen a lot of disruption in terms of format and gameplay," he says.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-prioritizing-ai-workflows-enhanced-performance-and-expanded-platform-support-in-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity prioritizing AI workflows, enhanced performance, and expanded platform support in 2025</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While nothing is guaranteed. If we continue doing the same stuff, there is a big chance we'll get the same result. With Netflix and games [we] have an opportunity to drive real disruption and real innovation with regards to how games are distributed, on what platforms, how we interact with them, and how we engage with the community."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To that end, Tascan says the company wants to forge deep connections with players by creating "Only on Netflix" moments. The hope is that a few of those experiences will have debuted by the end of 2025, providing subscribers—all of whom can access the company's game roster at no extra cost—with a taste of what's to come.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[We want to give people] new ways to play and new ways to experience stories, by trying to blur the lines between linear and interactive. We've been saying that for 30 years [in the game industry] for the old people in the room, but I feel that we are at that point.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I say sometimes to the team we have a golden ticket, so what are we going to do with it? I feel like this is a place where we can experiment and do things that hopefully will make history."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tascan believes success for Netflix would benefit the wider industry, helping to create a "blue sky in a place where there are dark clouds."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-m-worried-about-the-death-of-art-what-will-generative-ai-cost-us-in-the-end-" target="_self" data-discover="true">'I'm worried about the death of art:' What will generative AI cost us in the end?</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Netflix Games must prove its worth or risk being viewed as a &quot;distraction&quot;">Netflix Games must prove its worth or risk being viewed as a "distraction"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elaborating on how Netflix intends to execute on that vision, Shroff explains the company is taking some cues from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains the wildly popular battle royale title is something of paradox, surrounding players with the familiar trappings of shooting mechanics and multiplayer action while simultaneously offering something distinctly 'new' by incorporating metaverse elements in the form of celebrity skins and evolving seasons.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That juxtaposition is something Netflix Games hopes to replicate in its own way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You'll see us doing a lot of things that are perhaps a little bit familiar and recognizable, and then there is this idea of then pushing them into the unexpected and getting a little bit uncomfortable. We like to say we're uncomfortably excited," says Shroff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The familiar might be a title that leans on a big recognizable properties like Squid Game or a deal that brings a huge franchise like Grand Theft Auto to Netflix Games. Both of those things have, of course, already materialized.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those safer bets might then allow the company to take bigger swings in the form of new IP—such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spirit Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the cooperative life sim </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/spry-foxs-spirit-crossing-comes-to-netflix-later-this-year">unveiled by internal studio Spry Fox earlier today</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/game-workers-in-the-us-and-canada-launch-industry-wide-union-to-fight-for-dignity-and-respect-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Game workers in the U.S. and Canada launch industry-wide union to fight for 'dignity and respect'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We just want to be really intentional about where we choose to [use IP] and how we do that, and then with the unexpected I think the focus is going to be on innovation," continues Shroff. "We're here to really push the boundaries of what's possible. [...] We want to challenge what you think a game can be."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shroff feels Netflix Games must display that sort of "bullishness" in order to move forward. Part of that drive will also see the company prioritize titles that can be played on the big screen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The other focus area is what we're calling party games. We really want to reimagine what social engaging experiences can unfold in the living room," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company wants to explore that market by doubling down on the idea of smartphones as versatile and outlandish conduits of play—enabling Netflix's party game experiences to "spill out into the living room."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"With [smartphones] you have a second screen, you have a gyroscope, you have a speaker. You have so many ways to interact—along with the fact that you have information that perhaps is only available to you—so as people are playing there's all this amazing social gameplay that can unfold," adds Shroff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're really looking at pushing the boundaries of what party games—or couch play, as we call it—feels like."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The size and scale of the family market evidently isn't lost on Netflix. Tascan explains Netflix Games is also committed to becoming a "destination for kids," and believes that providing parents with a safe place filled with high-quality games will be a huge boon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains 15 percent of the Netflix subscriber base is already engaging with children's programming, and believes it would be foolish of the company not to think about how its game experiences might serve that audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's evident that Netflix doesn't intend to discount a single portion of its userbase. Tascan explains he wants Netflix Games to reach "hundreds of millions of people," and that means matching the wider ambition of Netflix.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says anything less could run the risk of turning Netflix Games into an unwelcome "distraction."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

If the deal goes through, <em>Deadline </em>says the movie could land in theaters next year.</p><p> WB and Ketchup declined to provide a comment to<em> Deadline. </em></p><p>Ketchup Entertainment recently released the 2D animated film <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Earth_Blew_Up:_A_Looney_Tunes_Movie&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Earth_Blew_Up:_A_Looney_Tunes_Movie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Looney Tunes: The Day the Earth Blew Up</em></a></span> in theaters. That film was also canned by WB in August 2022 before it was saved by Ketchup who stepped in and purchased it. The movie has since earned over $5.5 million in theaters with no virtually no marketing. </p><p>Hopefully, assuming this deal is completed, <em>Coyote Vs. Acme</em> will find an even bigger audience in theaters than Ketchup’s last <em>Looney Tunes</em> film thanks to the presence of stars John Cena and Will Forte. For now, we wait. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/niantic-says-pokemon-go-location-data-wont-be-given-to-saudi-arabia-government/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Pokémon Go , along with the rest of Niantic’s games business, is soon to be under new ownership after it was sold to Scopely for $3.5 Billion. Now, in a new interview, Niantic—soon to be Scopely—senior product directory Michael Steranka has addressed a number of concerns some players have about the game’s acquisition, including Pokémon Go player location data and who has access to it.</p>



<p>Steranka sat down for an hour-long interview with Pokémon Go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS3HawhQy78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTuber TrainerTips</a> to talk about why the game was sold, what will change, the idea of in-game pop-up adds, and, yes, player location data being shared with the Saudi Arabian government.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Scopely is owned by Savvy Games Group. Savvy is a video game investment company and developer that is backed by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund. With the game being sold, some have posted to various social media channels worried about data getting back to the foreign government. Steranka says that players don’t have to worry about it.</p>



<p>“That all stays in the US,” Sternaka said regarding player location data and scanned locations. “It never leaves the country. And it’s not something that ever gets shared up with Savvy or otherwise. In fact, Scopely itself is sort of wholly owned and operated independently as well. So, there’s enough layers of separation there that you can trust all of your data stays within the servers in the United States and also, like I mentioned, we actually scrub all that data and get rid of it after its no longer needed to run the game.”</p>



<p>The scrubbing of the data comes from a revelation earlier in the same interview. Steranka says that “contrary to popular belief”, the company doesn’t store any player data “beyond what’s needed to actually operate the game.”</p>



<p>He added that all of the data will remain “fully encrypted and protected” in the same ways it has since the game first launched in 2016.</p>



<p>The rest of the interview is highly recommended as Steranka talks about how the game will grow after the sale, the level of involvement of The Pokémon Company, Remote Raids, and more.</p>

            <p>
Cult classic 90s point-and-click horror adventure I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is - in a slightly unexpected turn of events - making the jump from PC to PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch next Thursday, 27th March, courtesy of Nightdive Studios.
</p>
<p>
As well-read sorts will no doubt immediately recognise, I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is based on author Harlan Ellison's influential post-apocalyptic short story of the same name. Its point-and-click adaptation - developed by Cyberdreams and The Dreamers Guild - released in 1996, building on the original narrative using an extensive outline penned by Ellison himself.
</p>
<p>
As in the short story, I Have No Mouth's game adaptation focuses on the last five human survivors of an apocalypse orchestrated by a sadistic AI - all kept alive and tortured by that same artificial intelligence (here voiced by Ellison) for over a century. It follows each character's final trial and the personalised psychological torments inflicted upon them by the computer, each unfolding over its own chapter and playable in any order.

<p>
With freedom perhaps now finally in reach for each captive if they can satisfy the murderous AI's whims, players must confront story shaping moral dilemmas as the trials unfolds. That's alongside the kind of disturbing, provocative horror themes that helped set the game apart from its point-and-click contemporaries back in 1996 - themes that saw I Have No Mouth garner strong critical acclaim on release, despite it ultimately proving to be a commercial flop. 
</p>
<p>
I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream's console release is built on remaster specialist Nightdive Studios' earlier PC version, itself well over a decade old at this point. "Over the last couple of years," the studio explains in its announcement, "we've seen a lot of love for the original game and Harlan Ellison's short story across social media platforms... It only felt right that we helped make this title more accessible and further preserve its legacy."
</p>
<p>
And if that appeals, I Have No Mouth will be available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch when it launches next Thursday, 27th March.

Spirit Crossing represents a first for Netflix, becoming the service’s first MMO offering. It was developed by Spry Fox, one of Netflix’s in-house game studios, and will launch sometime later this year.</p><p><em>Spirit Crossing</em> is described in the press release as a “cozy MMO.” Its launch trailer certainly gives off typical “cozy” game vibes with cute creatures, pastel colors, and chill music that wouldn’t be out of place in a Lo-fi Girl stream. The game will feature customizable housing and neighborhoods for players, open-world exploration, and lots of crafting. Spry Fox is known for several cozy-style games including <em>Cozy Grove </em>and its Netflix-exclusive sequel <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163281/cozy-grove-camp-spirit-release-date-netflix-gaming">Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</a></em>. Netflix acquired the studio in 2022 as a part of its gaming initiative.</p><p>While the streaming platform has proven it’s serious about its games offering by continuing to bring third-party titles to the service in addition to its own first-party games, it is not immune to the same forces wrecking the games industry at large. Last year, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">shut down one of its studios</a> which was reportedly working on what would have been the first in-house developed AAA title.</p><p>Players interested in <em>Spirit Crossing</em> can sign up for the closed alpha playtest <a href="https://projectfriendship.spryfox.com/">here</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
