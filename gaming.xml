		<p>Activision and Xbox have confirmed the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, the direct sequel to last year’s Black Ops 6, and Activision’s contender in this year’s FPS battle with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>. Black Ops 7 is coming out on 14th November.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9txkGBj_trg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With its reveal back at Summer Game Fest, one of the surprises from Black Ops 7 was that it will star Milo Ventimiglia, who’s still best known as Peter Petrelli from Heroes. Of course he doesn’t have super powers, he’s playing David Mason, the closest thing that this Black Ops team has to a nepo baby, and he’s leading the Black Ops team against a manipulative enemy, the returning Raul Menendez, who’s weaponising fear above all else in the year 2035. The story is continuing the narrative threads set up within Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6, and looks like it could be bridging the divide to some of the ultra-futuristic themes of Black Ops 3 as well.&nbsp;There’s also The Guild, a new high tech military force that doesn’t necessarily mesh with classic morality and the scale of good vs. evil.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7 can be played solo, or with up to four players – the Black Ops 3 connection returns! – and there’s plenty of twisted dream-like versions of locations found within the trailer, such as Nicaragua with giant knives, LA with motorways twisting up into the sky, and so much more. These locations will be tied together with Avalon.</p>
<p>There’s also the return of Dead Ops Arcade for some top-down action, and an endgame PvE social experience where you fight overwhelming odds and play through a roguelike structure in Avalon.</p>

<p>Multiplayer and Zombies will not be revealed until Call of Duty Next on 30th September.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s been just a year since the last game in the Black Ops sub-series, a tactic that didn’t work out so well for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/15/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review/">Modern Warfare 3</a>. We had an absolutely fantastic time with Black Ops 6 last year, and hopefully this game keeps that momentum going. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">our review we said</a>, “Modern Warfare had a great run, but Black Ops is now back on top in their ongoing sibling rivalry. Fluid character movement, high-tempo multiplayer, evolved Zombies co-op, and an incredible campaign come together in 2024’s most irresistible first person shooter.”</p>

		<p>During the gamescom Opening Night Live pre-show, One More Level and Lyrical Games announced Valor Mortis, a new first person Soulslike set during the Napoleonic Wars. In Valor Mortis you play as William, a soldier in Napoleon’s army who dies and is resurrected to continue to fight. However, the world has changed and a plague has consumed Europe, whose power is something you control.</p>
<p><iframe title="Valor Mortis - Reveal Trailer | First-Person Soulslike" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIF7cL0KRDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Valor Mortis will see you die over and over, but each time you do you can grow more powerful by learning new skills and attacks for your weapons to deal with the corrupted forces that are now your enemies. Valor Mortis will take historical figures from Napoleon’s time and see them twisted into horrors within this macabre new world. A release date for Valor Mortis is yet to be confirmed, but the game will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. If you are interested in experiencing Valor Mortis, you can sign up for playtests on the official <a href="https://valormortis.firstlook.gg/">Valor Mortis</a> website.</p>

<p>Eat your heart out, Red Dead</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During today's Opening Night Live showcase for Gamescom, Nightdive Studios confirmed its latest release: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/outlaws_plus_handful_of_missions_remaster">Outlaws + A Handful of Missions: Remaster</a>.</p>
<p>Originally launched in 1997 and built with LucasArts' Jedi engine, Outlaws received positive acclaim for its soundtrack and gameplay, though gained some criticism for its somewhat lacklustre visuals. Nightdive's remaster, much like its previous efforts, looks to revitalise the game for the modern era, with twin-stick gameplay and gyro support included as standard.</p>
<p>Again, like the recently released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a>, there's no native Switch 2 version, so the 4K/120fps performance touted for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S won't apply to the Switch release. That said, Nightdive is remarkably adept at optimising its games, so you can probably expect a rock-solid 60fps for Outlaws on Nintendo's previous-gen console.</p>
<p>For now, let's check out the key features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Engaging first-person ground combat featuring five weapon types</p>
<p>- Up to 4K 120FPS visuals on PC, PlayStation 4|5, and Xbox One and Series X|S</p>
<p>- Modern gamepad support adds a new weapon wheel, rumble, and motion/gyro controls</p>
<p>- Trophies and Achievements on Windows PC via Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles</p>
<p>- A Vault filled with golden behind-the-scenes nuggets that fans will enjoy</p>
<p>- Four Multiplayer game modes with crossplay across platforms — Deathmatch, Team Play, Capture the Flag, and Kill The Fool With The Chicken!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster is scheduled to launch later this year. We'll keep you informed of any latest developments, including the final release date, as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>Hades II, Silksong, and Pokémon all playable, too</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59ec8a9063c29/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Nintendo has confirmed its line-up for PAX West in Seattle, Washington — which kicks off in 10 days time. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, which just got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">an extensive Nintendo Direct</a>, is getting its first public demo.</p>
<p>Outside of the upcoming racing game, the line-up is relatively similar to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/metroid-prime-4-elden-ring-silksong-all-playable-at-nintendos-gamescom-booth">Gamescom</a> one, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> , <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> among the games attendees will be able to check out.</p>
<p>However, for Kirby and Pokémon — you'll need to get a Warp Pipe Pass reservation. You'll be able to register for this on <strong>21st August 2025 at 9am PDT</strong> (that's 12pm EDT for those on the east coast).</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2vlyquw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf32irwF2Do" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The rest of the games, however, will be available to play to all. Here's the full line-up, then:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii"><strong>Hades II</strong></a></li>
<li><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></li>
<li><strong>Kirby Air Riders</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also swing by the My Nintendo check-in area if you're there and get yourself 100 Platinum Points if you check-in with your Nintendo Account, plus enter a giveaway.</p>
<p>So that's a pretty healthy list of games — and all games that are coming to Switch 2, too. Kirby Air Riders now has a release date, but by the time PAX rolls around, perhaps Hades aII and Silksong will, as well?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gears-of-war-reloaded-persona-4-golden-and-more-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august.1274193/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/19/xbox-game-pass-august-2025-wave-2/">announced</a> the games coming to Xbox Game Pass in the back half of August, with BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the remastered Gears of War: Reloaded, Persona 4 Golden, and more, headlining the rest of the month's entries.</p>



<p>The top of the month was headlined by titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-adds-assassins-creed-mirage-rain-world/">Assassin's Creed Mirage and Citizen Sleeper 2</a>, and the seven titles confirmed today, along with previously announced games like the shadow-drop of <a href="https://wccftech.com/heretic-hexen-remaster-nightdive-studios-id-software-quakecon-2025/">Heretic + Hexen</a>, round out the month as a strong showing of Game Pass additions for August 2025.</p>



<p>Other notable entries for this month are the rougelite FPS Void/Breaker, Goat Simulator Remastered, and Herdling.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to Xbox Game Pass for the rest of August 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Blacksmith Master (Game Preview) - available Aug. 19 on PC</li>



<li>Void/Breaker - available Aug. 19 on PC</li>



<li>Goat Simulator Remastered - available Aug. 20 on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Cloud</li>



<li>Persona 4 Golden - available Aug. 20 on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Cloud</li>



<li>Herdling - available Aug. 21 on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Cloud</li>



<li>Gears of War: Reloaded - available Aug. 26 on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Cloud</li>



<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - available Aug. 28 on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Cloud</li>
</ul>



<p>And as is always the case, with games coming into Xbox Game Pass, there are games leaving. At the end of this month on August 31, five games will be exiting the subscription service and will no longer be playable through a Game Pass subscription on <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-vp-hints-at-more-affordable-xbox-cloud-gaming/">Xbox's Cloud Gaming service</a>, Xbox consoles, and PC. Here are the five games leaving on August 31:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ben 10 Power Trip</li>



<li>Borderlands 3</li>



<li>Paw Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay</li>



<li>Sea of Stars</li>



<li>This War of Mine: Final Cut</li>
</ul>



<p>Even with those departures, there's still plenty of great games to spend your time with through Game Pass, and there's potentially even more to come, as we're still waiting to see what Xbox has to announce during <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/gamescom-onl-2025-where-when-to-watch/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a> and the rest of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Gamescom 2025 week.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-features-gorgeous-story-and-flashy-combat-to-keep-you-coming-back-over-and</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/absolum-features-a-gorgeous-story-and-flashy-combat-to-keep-you-coming-back-over-and-over-again.1274190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Absolum </em>is a new roguelite that merges upgrading characters, beat-em-up combos, and working through the world from left to right with your friends, with split pathways, quests, and the ultimate desire to make your way through the world of Talamh to protect the mages of the land.</p>

<p>The story of <em>Absolum </em>is set in a world that has been destroyed by a magical cataclysm. This has made not only your party of characters rebels against the law of the land, but has also led to the demonization, enslavement, and killing of magic users.</p>

<p>Armed with the power to be able to revive themselves, the rebels that you play as head out from the relative safety of their base to try to overthrow the Sun King and put an end to the needless bloodshed. The interesting part is that there are a number of ways to make your way to the Sun King.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/absolum-preview-mini-boss.jpg?itok=6V0zHZmE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/absolum-preview-mini-boss.jpg?itok=iKKf6erX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Choose Your Adventuring Path</h2>

<p>How this plays out in terms of gameplay is that every run, you'll start at the home base. Along the way, you'll come to a variety of different split paths. Do you head across the bridge, or underneath the bridge? Do you continue through the forest or climb up the castle battlements?</p>

<p>Each path you take will diverge and converge, giving you a chance to experience a different adventure, new locations, and different enemy types. Depending on what character you're playing, the path may favor you, or put you against enemies that are going to put you in a bind.</p>

<p>Playing as Karl, the dwarf armed with his fists and a magical blunderbuss, I found I had a lot of issues taking a stroll through the castle due to the number of soldiers with lances that had greater reach than I did. If I took a lower path through the forest, fighting goblins, I was able to combo them into oblivion.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/absolum-preview-world-map.jpg?itok=QTlw8YOm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/absolum-preview-world-map.jpg?itok=_fxyRb5e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You'll also get different quests during gameplay that offer you upgrades, but you've got to reach certain parts of the map. This is a fun and refreshing way to give a roguelite a goal that isn't just "beat the game" but to follow a specific path to get stronger for the next run.</p>

<p>The gameplay itself is exactly the level of quality you'd expect from Dotemu, with games such as <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0b74f821-d082-44f0-8fb4-8d2242bba669" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review" rel="nofollow">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</a> </em>and the upcoming <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8287e179-34f9-4b1c-b734-6d70d4c3a4be" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-co-op-buddies-assemble" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> under their belt. Dash in, perform a combo, watch out for stage hazards, enemy projectiles, and telegraphed attacks to stay alive.</p>

<p>Expect to be playing this for a bit to make considerable progress, but while you're not progressing in the story, you'll be able to explore more of the world.</p>

<h2>I Suck At Dodging In <em>Absolum</em>…</h2>

<p>One aspect that I found challenging in combat, especially on some of the larger bosses, was getting out of the way. It might have just been that Karl is that mix of strong but slow, but there were a number of times that I felt I was stuck in a situation that I needed to take a hit in order to have the time to get close enough. This isn't even including some of the AoE or sweeping attacks that would get sent my way that I couldn't do anything about, regardless.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/absolum-preview-big-boss.jpg?itok=Pfhd08Mw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/absolum-preview-big-boss.jpg?itok=Kpbfi1C6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One of the most impressive aspects of <em>Absolum </em>is just how good it looks. The art style invoked to me the idea of classic Saturday morning cartoons like <em>He-Man</em> or <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, but with the high-quality polish of 2025.</p>

<p>Background elements tell a story of each of the regions you pass through, and the unique monster designs immediately let you know what you might be able to expect out of a foe before they even start trying to kill you.</p>

<p>For fans of side-scroller beat-em-ups there's no better company to be following nowadays than Dotemu, and <em>Absolum </em>is no different. While other big releases of theirs might pull you in with the strong IP that they're attached to, I recommend even further coming into <em>Absolum </em>just because of how unique the world and gameplay mechanics are. Better yet if you're able to bring a friend along to play with you.</p>

<p>Better yet, there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/" rel="nofollow">demo currently available on Steam</a> so you can check it out for yourself.</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>Absolum </em>was reviewed on PC via Steam with a copy provided by the Publisher over the course of 4 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</strong></p>

            <p>Valor Mortis, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> set during Napoleon's 19th century conquest of Eastern Europe, has been revealed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> devs One More Level during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>'s preshow. It's set for release in 2026.</p>
<p>Yep, if you're a fan of games that drip with Frenchness and also revolve around beating up gaudily-health barred baddies before they do the same to you, this one might have you reaching for your musket and bicorne. That's assuming the setting offers enough of a unique feel that Valor Mortis doesn't resemble being trapped on a Fromsoft-imitation Elba.</p>

<p>"“With Valor Mortis, we wanted to try something new and original - a darker experience, while still offering players a true challenge,” One More Level CEO Szymon Bryla said. “After Ghostrunner, we knew we had the foundation to create a [first-person] title, but this time in a soulslike genre. At the same time, we wanted to stay true to what we do best - making demanding games for hardcore players, set in an engaging, expansive world, while showing that the studio has grown since our previous projects.”</p><p>The game'll see you play as William, a Grande Armée soldier ressurected and given supernatural powers by the Nephtoglobin, a mysterious goop. Sadly, because video game, this goop has turned the world around him and his former comrades in arms into a plague-ridden hellscape prowled by mutants with extra limbs and bloated bodies.</p>
<p>The combat looks to add a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a>-esque twist to the usual soulslike parry and dodge swordplay. You can dual-wield with guns like a flintlock pistol and abilities dubbed transmutations. The latter are William's magic powers, and remind me a lot of plasmids. This time, it looks like you'll be gaining the ability to shoot the likes of fire from your mitt by interacting with not quite dead bodies on the battlefield.</p>
<p>If there's one thing the trailer emphasises, it's that this game will not lack for battlefields full of dead bodies, with an entire montage dedicated to different locations in which the corpses are piled high. You'll be able to get a look at those corpse piles if you sign up for a closed Valor Mortis playtest that's set to kick off following Gamescom. Head to ValorMortis.com if you're keen.</p>
<p>Or, wait until the full release, which maths tells me is sadly more than a hundred days away.</p>

Brome travels by levitation, using his staff for melee combos, ranged and AoE spellcasting, and, of course, hoverboard-style gliding. Marred by witnessing the devastation and enslavement of his people, Brome is torn between his species’ spiritual education and succumbing to rage from the injustice he’s witnessed—but he now leaves a life of fear and hiding behind, joining <em>Absolum</em>‘s playable cast in all-new gameplay.</p><p>With branching pathways to explore, quests to discover, intriguing characters to encounter and a deep variety of challenging bosses in store, <em>Absolum</em>‘s gripping fantasy tale unravels a compelling <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,473 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> channeling the spirit of classic brawlers like <em>Golden Axe</em> and <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Chronicles of <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>ara</em>.

In the world of Talamh, a cataclysmic event caused by magic prompts the Sun King Azra to conquer all lands and sources of magic through brutal warfare, slaughtering any wizard unwilling to serve him. Talamh’s hope now lies with a defiant band of rebels aided by a mysterious, mythical mentor known as Uchawi and the similarly powerful Root Sisters, who together oppose Azra’s pursuit of total power by wielding an ancient, forbidden magic. These mythical forces empower our rebels with astonishing magic as they stoke a resistance, fight Azra’s iron grip on Talamh and discover the secret behind Azra’s ever-growing dominion.</p><p><em>Absolum</em> introduces an engrossing universe and cast co-created with the masterful talent of animation studio Supamonks (Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars). <em>Absolum</em> blends arcade-like melee combat with spells, counters, upgradable abilities and uniquely powerful playable fighters, hosting a grand, high-stakes quest across an array of hand-crafted stages.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>If there's one thing we all love in fantasy games, it's wizards who are also animals. It's the one universal, very specific truth about gamers. So when the Gamescom Opening Night Live pre-show debuted a new trailer featuring a wizard who is also a frog, our hearts were all a-flutter. Oh and it also revealed the game is releasing on October 9, but <em>focus</em>, people.</p><p>In the story trailer we saw one of the outcasts, the recently revealed Cider, rescuing an adorable frog baby, before starting to get overwhelmed by imperial forces. Then the frog mage intervened, and boy, was he pissed that these armies are threatening a frog baby. Mess them up, frog man!</p><p>The trailer ended with the October release date, and included the key art update with the new playable character. That brings the total revealed roster so far up to four, and new characters keep getting added to the key art as they're revealed.</p><p>Absolum is from Dotemu, the studio behind Streets of Rage 4. It takes place in a new fantasy world, and it fuses beat-'em-up action with roguelike elements to let you grow stronger after each run, making your fighters that much more capable every time. It's coming to PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valor-mortis-is-a-first-person-soulslike-from-the-ghostrunner-devs-and-it-rules.1274151/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Publisher Lyrical Games and Ghostrunner series developer One More Level have revealed Valor Mortis, a first-person Soulslike with Metroidvania elements. I’ve played it, and even though it was a pre-alpha demo, it’s already a game I can’t wait for more of.&nbsp;</p><p>Revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase, Valor Mortis is set during Napoleon’s 19th-century conquest across a war-torn Eastern Europe. Players control a resurrected French soldier corrupted by the power of a mysterious, plague-like substance that runs through their veins. Unfortunately, that substance is key to saving “humanity from the very horrors of war it creates,” according to a press release.&nbsp;</p><h2>Watch 27 Minutes of Valor Mortis Gameplay:&nbsp;</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4xQ-u2PyiU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4xQ-u2PyiU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“With Valor Mortis, we wanted to try something new and original – a darker experience, while still offering players a true challenge,” One More Level CEO Szymon Bryla writes in a press release. “After Ghostrunner, we knew we had the foundation to create a [first-person perspective] title, but this time in a Soulslike genre. At the same time, we wanted to stay true to what we do best –&nbsp;making demanding games for hardcore players, set in an engaging expansive world, while showing that the studio has grown since our previous projects.”&nbsp;</p><p>I played a pre-alpha demo of Valor Mortis and, after roughly an hour with what appears to be its opening level and first boss, I’m thoroughly impressed, even with its current rough edges. It’s clear it’s a pre-alpha dose of the game, as it isn’t the most optimized, but it still runs and looks well enough to understand what One More Level, a 60-person studio based in Poland, is cooking up here.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s One More Level’s description of the game to set the table: “In Valor Mortis, players will embody William, a soldier in the Grande Armée brought back to life from his battlefield grave. William awakens from his death to a plague-ridden Europe, only to find his former allies corrupted into abominations by the Nephtoglobin, an unknown substance that grants him supernatural powers but has taken over his comrades. Navigating this world of scorn, William must master combat and channel his newfound ability in a 19th-century history where war has corrupted the landscape, Napoleon’s Eternal Guard lurks around every corner, and unforgettable boss-fight encounters await players.”&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIF7cL0KRDU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIF7cL0KRDU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Immediately, it’s clear Valor Mortis is a One More Level game – it isn’t Ghostrunner, but it feels right at home in this team’s lineage. It’s much slower, naturally, but dodging and parrying feels similar to Ghostrunner II, and though it’s set in a fantastical take on a wartorn 19th-century Eastern Europe, I can see it’s the same visual team behind One More Level’s cyberpunk series. In fact, game director Radosław Ratusznik tells me in an interview that the visuals of this new IP are heavily influenced by the Soulslike nature of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>He says the Ghostrunner games feature gorgeous visuals by One More Level’s art team, but due to the game's nature, players speed right past its vistas and sights. With Valor Mortis’ slowed-down pace, he’s excited for players to see what these artists can cook up. It’s another reason Valor Mortis is a first-person game, besides the fact that first-person is where One More Level feels most comfortable.&nbsp;</p><p>All the typical Soulslike facets are there – challenging enemies to defeat, grueling and monstrous bosses, a stagger bar, parries, blocks, and dodges, lanterns (this game’s bonfires), and a tree of stats to adjust with a currency earned from defeating enemies. But where Valor Mortis really stands out is its first-person perspective. Truthfully, I don’t think I’ve played a first-person Soulslike before, and it’s such a simple but drastic change to the formula that I’m shocked I haven’t played one on novelty alone. It’s more immersive and adds a level of urgency (well, even more urgency) to every fight – I can’t scan what’s around me to ensure safety for a dodge or a place to heal. All I have is what’s right in front of me, and Valor Mortis feels all the more dangerous as a result.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, every action I take feels riskier; if I slash now, the enemy literally right in front of my face can follow up with a counter, and I need to be ready. Sure, the same rules apply in the typical third-person perspective of the genre, but, to use a cliché, it feels more immersive here.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside my cutlass, I have a pistol that I can use to aim-down-sights and shoot weak points on enemies, adding a fun FPS feel to the Soulslike combat. It’s a smart move – first-person perspectives are typically associated with first-person shooters, so why not borrow an element of that?&nbsp;</p><p>That said, Ratusznik warns that bullets are highly limited (they are) and players shouldn’t treat any aspect of Valor Mortis like an FPS. The pistol is best used for targeting weak points, and I found switching from my pistol, after shooting a weak point, to my BioShock-like left hand that spews flames prevented me from relying on my pistol for more than that. Plus, the fire adds a burn status to enemies after I scorch them enough, inflicting constant damage and opening them up for easy finisher attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>The final element of Valor Mortis that stands out to me is its setting. Fighting undead French soldiers and more while the ghost/phantom/voice of Napoleon whispers in my ear, harkening me to inflict damage to all around me in his name, is a unique twist on the fantasy of Soulslike. I’m reminded of Lies of P, which excellently used an odd but ultimately standout setting to tell its story – I look forward to seeing if Valor Mortis can reach similar heights.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s more at play in Valor Mortis, including abilities gained that allow you to traverse to prior levels in Metroidvania fashion, optional bosses, and more, and you can get a taste of that in&nbsp;Game Informer’s&nbsp;hands-on gameplay at the top of this story.&nbsp;</p><p>Valor Mortis is due out sometime in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, and I can’t wait.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/hands-on-preview/2025/08/19/valor-mortis-is-a-first-person-soulslike-from-the-ghostrunner-devs-and]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We might have a new king of esports gaming monitors — one with fewer compromises than usual. Asus has just announced <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frog.asus.com%2Fus%2Farticles%2Fproduct-news%2Fmonitors-motherboards-and-more-everything-rog-announced-at-gamescom-2025%2F" rel="sponsored">the ROG Swift OLED PG27AQWP-W</a> at Gamescom 2025. Not only does it offer a 26.5-inch 2560 x 1440 QHD OLED screen at a blazing-fast 540Hz, it’s also a dual-mode panel that can switch to a practically unheard-of 720Hz refresh rate when you kick the graphics down to 1080p* resolution.</p><p>Asus may not technically have the fastest monitor ever made, as <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/monitors/gaming-monitors/koorui-to-demo-the-worlds-first-750-hz-gaming-monitor-at-ces-tn-panel-device-gets-welcome-color-boost-with-the-latest-qd-film">both Koorui</a> and <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/hkc-launches-worlds-first-750hz-gaming-monitor">HKC have announced</a> 750Hz 1080p monitors, but both of those have TN panels that won’t even begin to compete on color, brightness, and viewing angles. They’re from brands we don’t typically see in western countries, and neither lets you switch to higher resolution when you don’t need <em>all the speed</em>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Asus isn’t just OLED — it’s a <em>tandem OLED</em> panel that should dramatically boost HDR brightness and allegedly improve lifespan. It’s also got a glossy coating that could make its colors even more vibrant and its blacks even blacker than OLED tech can already afford, assuming you’re not playing in a room with glare (though Asus claims the coating minimizes glare “even in bright rooms.”)</p><div><p>Here’s the part where I’d normally say “who needs 540Hz let alone 720Hz? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911067/boe-500-hz-gaming-monitor-high-refresh-rate#:~:text=To%20put%20500Hz%20in%20context%2C">Have you done the math and seen the diminishing returns?</a>” Instead, I’m too busy gaping at Asus’ stunning new silver and translucent plastic design. Clear gadgets are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23774468/clear-transparent-tech-gadgets-news-announcements-products">near and dear to my heart, after all</a>, and the skeletal silver really makes it stand out in a sea of black-framed panels.</p></div><p>Unfortunately, we don’t have pricing or a release date yet, and I suspect it’ll cost a pretty penny because Asus chose that groundbreaking panel and did all that work to set it apart. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623428/dell-alienware-oled-monitor-aw2725d-price-release-date">Seeing more OLED monitor prices come down to earth</a> would excite me even more than a new flagship like this.</p><p>Also, I would prefer a smaller stand to the huge three-blade propeller, but unfortunately, Asus does make you compromise to get that. The company’s also introducing a new ROG Strix OLED XG27AQWMG today with the same tandem OLED tech, but as you can see in the one-pager below, it’s a 280Hz panel that still relies on either HDMI 2.1 or DisplayPort 1.4’s DSC compression, rather than the flagship’s new DisplayPort 2.1a which boasts 80Gbps of bandwidth.</p><p>Both have Asus’ “Neo Proximity Sensor,” a relatively new feature it’s been adding to OLED panels, “to accurately measure the user’s distance to the monitor and automatically switch to a black screen when the user is away,” as an extra protection against burn-in. Asus also tends to offer a three-year warranty against OLED burn-in these days, and both LG Display and Samsung Display’s newer panels have many protections against it; as long as those protections aren’t over-aggressive, burn-in is no longer a reason I’d personally steer away.</p><p>Just know that other monitor makers will probably use the same 4th-gen WOLED tandem panel from LG Display, too. <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/105695/sdc-teases-first-oled-gaming-monitor-with-gpu-busting-720hz-refresh-rate/index.html">SDC has already announced one</a>, and other brands might follow suit.</p><p><em>*If you’ve heard of 720Hz before, it’s probably because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/753686/lg-display-540hz-oled-panel-720hz-mode">LG Display already announced the dual-mode 720Hz panel</a> that appears in this monitor.</em> <em>And if you’re wondering why we say 1080p rather than 720p <a href="https://x.com/tftcentral/status/1957848581760528587?s=46">as others are reporting</a>, it’s because we fact-checked with both Asus’ JJ Guerrero and LG Display that the panel is 1080p at 720Hz</em>. <em>We’ll let you know if we hear different.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/761481/asus-720hz-gaming-monitor-rog-swift-oled-pg27aqwp-w]]></content:encoded>

It’s a collaboration with Microsoft that arrives ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-published-helldivers-2-gets-shock-release-date-on-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S August 26, 2025</u></a>, with the new Warbond tier and all of its ODST goodies set to drop that same day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O_9hwQ8jLw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>trailer for the Helldivers 2 Halo content</u></a> shows what some of the new content looks like in-game, but Microsoft made sure to offer more information in a new Xbox Wire <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-halo-odst-crossover-warbond-xbox-launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a>. Players who pick up the Legendary Warbond will be treated to four weapons (three primary, one sidearm), four vehicle patterns, an armor passive, two player banners, two capes, one player title, and, of course, two armor sets that look like they were ripped straight out of Halo 3: ODST.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see everything included in the Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond in the image below. As for that mysterious Feet First armor passive, players can expect a buff that allows them to make less noise when moving, become immune to leg injuries, and increase their discovery range by 30%.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-halo-odst-warbond-1755617979176.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond. Image courtesy of Arrowhead Game Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Earth veterans will note that the Arrowhead is using the Halo crossover to introduce Legendary Warbonds as a completely new tier for its content packs. That means it’ll be more expensive, too, running players about 1,500 Super Credits (about $15). That’s up from the usual 1,000 Super Credits (about $10) players have come to expect with non-crossover packs, but Arrowhead says it will be worth the price of admission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Legendary Warbond marks a brand-new tier in the Warbond lineup, and we’ve gone all-in to make sure it lives up to the name,” the studio said in a statement. “This one’s a tribute to a long-requested crossover, packed with details that fans will love to discover.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead also clarifies that the new Premium Warbond Tokens, which also launch August 26, cannot be used to unlock the Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond. Despite this, players seem to be taking the price announcement well.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This isnt egregious. A lil pricey, but ultimately acceptable.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fine.

Fergusson <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rod-fergusson-departs-blizzard-diablo-franchise">departed Blizzard earlier this month</a> with no word on why he left, or who would replace him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was gleaned from an email sent by 2K president David Ismailer to staff and subsequently shared with IGN. It reads, in part:</p><blockquote>Work on the next BioShock game has been underway for several years. While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development. </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Employees impacted are being informed today. 2K did not share how many were impacted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I recognize that today is a day of mixed emotions," the email concludes. "We’re excited to have Rod joining us, and are equally grateful to everyone at Cloud Chamber who has helped us get this far. These changes are rooted in 2K’s firm confidence in BioShock as one of the most beloved franchises, and our commitment to deliver the best game in franchise history."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioShock 4 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/13/2k-studio-reportedly-developing-new-bioshock">first reported on in 2018</a>, and news has been few and far between since. We know it's been in development at Cloud Chamber at least since then, and that former BioShock lead Ken Levine is not working on it. We've yet to see any gameplay or learn much about the game beyond that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-setting-rapture-columbia-job-listings">takes place in a brand new setting</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-bioshock-game-hiring-writer-for-open-world-setting">is open world</a>.

Inscryption is one of those experiences. This game beautifully blends genres in such a unique way that it's hard to really describe. I first went into gameplay thinking it was just a cool roguelike deck-building card game, which would have been interesting enough. But no, it's so much more than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without spoiling anything important, I'll just say that Inscryption has a lot more depth than you'd expect and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/inscryption/Ending_Explained">pretty wild ending</a>.

Its unsettling story is the perfect vehicle for its ever-evolving mechanics, which constantly keep the simple but entertaining card game at its heart fresh. It’s a wonderfully strange game, but Inscryption is truly excellent because it’s also a genuinely fun one – and like Pony Island before it, you should probably go in knowing as little as possible."</em> - Tom Marks</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 19, 2025 3:36 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/one-of-my-favorite-pc-games-of-all-time-is-super-cheap-during-the-humble-bundle-summer-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> will have an open beta starting on 2nd October for those who pre-order the game or subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, or Game Pass Console. For those who don't pre-order, the open beta begins on 5th October.
</p>
<p>Pre-orders also include the Reznov Challenge Pack, which provides access to the SOG Reznov Operator Skin in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone (this must be redeemed before 14th November 2026). You'll also get the Stalingrad Reznov and Memory Reznov Operator Skins.</p>
<p>It's worth noting the game is available as a cross-gen bundle, meaning if you buy it you'll gain access to Black Ops 7 on the Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Xbox PC. You might want to make sure you have an active Game Pass subscription going though, especially if you claim the game through Game Pass Ultimate.</p>
