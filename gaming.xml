<figure><a title="Minecraft Super Mario and Animal Crossing: New Horizons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0e0873c6eb70/minecraft-super-mario-and-animal-crossing-new-horizons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new survey conducted by Japanese variety show <strong>Ariyoshiiieeeee! – Oh yeah! Wanna play games at your place now?</strong> has <a href="https://tver.jp/episodes/ep0lxbslkd">revealed Japan's favourite video games</a>, both overall and by age rating, and while the likes of Mario, Splatoon, Pokémon, Zelda, Animal Crossing, and Dragon Quest all make frequent appearances, none of them made the top spot. (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-top-100-ranking-of-japanese-peoples-favorite-games-dominated-by-domestic-classics-like-mario-and-pokemon-except-for-the-number-one-spot/">Automaton Media</a>!)</p>
<p>Nope, Japan's number one game — at least, according to a survey of 3,000 people conducted by the show — is none other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> landed at second overall, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> came in third. Everyone surveyed was asked to give their five favourite games, and then votes were tallied up to bring us the results.</p>
<p>Now, the above shouldn't be too surprising, as Minecraft is absolutely <em>massive</em> worldwide, and the hosts of the show make a very good point — Minecraft is not just a game, but a platform." And nowadays, as the announcer says, "it's become very normal for young people to experience games not just for the gameplay, but as a means of communication."</p>
<p>The top 100 includes <em>many</em> Nintendo, <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>, and <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> games, but here are a few stats that stood out to us. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> takes the overall number 5 spot, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/apex_legends">Apex Legends</a> at 18. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_diamond_and_pearl">Pokémon Diamond &amp; Pearl</a> is the highest-ranked Pokémon game at 14, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> is right behind it. No Final Fantasy game makes the top ten, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> is the closest at 16th (with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_x_x-2_hd_remaster">X</a> right on its tail).</p>
<p>Other interesting games making an appearance include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/yo-kai_watch_2_bony_spirits_and_fleshy_souls">Yo-kai Watch 2</a> at 25, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> at 46, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> at 60, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/xevious">Xevious</a> at 93. Xevious!</p>
<p>Here's the overall top 10 — for the rest of the results, check out <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-top-100-ranking-of-japanese-peoples-favorite-games-dominated-by-domestic-classics-like-mario-and-pokemon-except-for-the-number-one-spot/">Automaton Media</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Minecraft</strong></li>
<li><strong>Super Mario Bros.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fortnite</strong></li>
<li><strong>Splatoon 3</strong></li>
<li><strong>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Splatoon 2</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dragon Quest</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Breaking things down by age group, the show split these into five categories — gamers in their teens (10-19), 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s.</p>
<p>For teens, Minecraft is unequivocally the number one game, with Fortnite and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> rounding out the top three. Mojang's mammoth game also makes it into the top ten games for those in their 20s at number 8, where Diamond &amp; Pearl sits up top ahead of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Ultimate</a> and New Horizons.</p>
<p>For those of us in our 30s (like this author), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red &amp; Green</a> is number one, with Final Fantasy X and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_gold_and_silver">Gold &amp; Silver</a> right behind it. Not surprised at the early-gen Pokémon love here. For the 40s and 50s crowd, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior_iii">Dragon Quest III</a> and Super Mario Bros. are the one-two here (flipped for the older gamers), with another Dragon Quest game right behind them — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/dragon_quest_v_hand_of_the_heavenly_bride">V</a> for the 40-year-olds, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior">the original NES game</a> for the 50s.</p>
<p>We're not massively surprised at any of these results, but it's an interesting look at how trends in video games have shifted over time — and what people value in video games. And while the vast majority of games are from Japan, there are lots of Western titles making a dent in people's hearts — and consoles. You can watch the <a href="https://tver.jp/episodes/ep0lxbslkd">episode right here</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it's only a small sample of people (3,000 isn't many!), but it's still an interesting capsule of consumer interests, and it pairs nicely with Nikkei's own survey, which shows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/gender-split-and-average-ages-of-japanese-nintendo-players-revealed-via-new-survey">gender splits and average ages for fans of particular series</a>.</p>

                <p>What do you make when you combine Scrabble, Wordle, and Balatro? It's Birdigo and it's out now. This single-player word and deckbuilding game combines elements from those games, guiding a flock of birds on a global migration by forming words from a deck of letter cards. Each word propels the flock forward, with longer or more strategic words generating more "flaps," which determine how far the birds travel.</p><p>Gameplay centers around building words using a hand of letter cards drawn from your evolving deck. Some cards come with special abilities and certain letter combinations that can dramatically increase your score. As the game progresses, you collect new cards, upgrades, and modifiers like enchanted feathers or bird songs that change the rules in your favor. The key is to balance word-building with careful deck management to keep your flock moving along.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540945-ss_bf707596f57b75d1b3bf19f77385952cb82ce3de.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540945" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540945-ss_bf707596f57b75d1b3bf19f77385952cb82ce3de.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540945"></a><figcaption>Help birds migrate using big words.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540945-ss_bf707596f57b75d1b3bf19f77385952cb82ce3de.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540946-ss_ae5a7ff153497701821ea9332d4d03d02a18ec8d.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540947-ss_fb34bcc3513402c5f410dfd028fca50c54d59c97.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540948-ss_901633dc00954ae3baa47e88ccb75ee1b650d0ec.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540949-ss_bf707596f57b75d1b3bf19f77385952cb82ce3de.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540950-ss_43597894232713328f5cc8912faad5934767560a.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540951-ss_24124968ba3fe08b721c7c19d80e5f9768982824.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540952-ss_ab7b041829f1db1b9ca5b9e81d23ba36d931fe74.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540953-ss_086011c00061d0db39d073095f76812810d15798.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540954-ss_c069226d24aefa2e82b9d66f3ac3caf7c125bf9e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540946,1300-4540947,1300-4540948,1300-4540949,1300-4540950,1300-4540951,1300-4540952,1300-4540953,1300-4540954" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540946-ss_ae5a7ff153497701821ea9332d4d03d02a18ec8d.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540947-ss_fb34bcc3513402c5f410dfd028fca50c54d59c97.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540948-ss_901633dc00954ae3baa47e88ccb75ee1b650d0ec.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540949-ss_bf707596f57b75d1b3bf19f77385952cb82ce3de.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540950-ss_43597894232713328f5cc8912faad5934767560a.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540951-ss_24124968ba3fe08b721c7c19d80e5f9768982824.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540952-ss_ab7b041829f1db1b9ca5b9e81d23ba36d931fe74.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540953-ss_086011c00061d0db39d073095f76812810d15798.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540954-ss_c069226d24aefa2e82b9d66f3ac3caf7c125bf9e.1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540946-ss_ae5a7ff153497701821ea9332d4d03d02a18ec8d.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540947-ss_fb34bcc3513402c5f410dfd028fca50c54d59c97.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540948-ss_901633dc00954ae3baa47e88ccb75ee1b650d0ec.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540949-ss_bf707596f57b75d1b3bf19f77385952cb82ce3de.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540950-ss_43597894232713328f5cc8912faad5934767560a.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540951-ss_24124968ba3fe08b721c7c19d80e5f9768982824.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540952-ss_ab7b041829f1db1b9ca5b9e81d23ba36d931fe74.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540953-ss_086011c00061d0db39d073095f76812810d15798.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540954-ss_c069226d24aefa2e82b9d66f3ac3caf7c125bf9e.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>Birdigo uses roguelike mechanics, so each game is a fresh run with randomized elements, and the challenge increases the further you get.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/716209/pubg-2-0-fortnite-roblox-platform-krafton-earnings</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pubg%E2%80%99s-plan-to-beat-fortnite-roblox-and-every-other-game.1257486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox and <em>Fortnite</em> are two of the biggest games around, and a huge part of why is because they aren’t just one game: instead, they’re vast platforms where you can party up with your friends, dress up in ridiculous digital outfits, and quickly jump from one experience to another. Back in the day, <em>Fortnite</em> copied <em>PUBG</em> by making a battle royale, and now, <em>PUBG</em> is mimicking <em>Fortnite</em> by trying to become more of a platform than a game.</p><p>As part of a roadmap released earlier <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/8308">this year</a>, <em>PUBG</em> developer Krafton said that it would let players create their own modes as part of an alpha, and it revealed more details about the alpha <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/8865">this month</a>. This week, Krafton CFO Dongkeun Bae also discussed the company’s vision for “<em>PUBG</em> 2.0” in <a href="https://youtu.be/lghT4WUpgZQ?feature=shared">an earnings call</a>. “It will not just simply be a battle royale game per se,” he said through a translator.</p><p>The game will also be “a gameplay platform” and Krafton is developing “wide-ranging modes under that objective.” It seems like this approach will be a lot like <em>Fortnite</em>’s, which offers a mix of Epic Games-made modes and user-created experiences. Krafton also isn’t just doing user-generated content (UGC) because it’s “currently the mainstream,” Bae said. With UGC, if it’s opened up to the broader player base, players will be able to “create many different things” with <em>PUBG</em>.</p><p>The shift makes sense. By opening <em>PUBG</em> — which is still one of the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2Fmostplayed" rel="sponsored">most-played titles on Steam</a> — to different kinds of experiences, it could grow beyond just hardcore shooter fans. <em>Fortnite</em>’s battle royale modes are still quite popular, but you can also play lower-stakes modes themed around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316954/lego-fortnite-brick-life-social-roleplay-game">Lego</a><em>,</em> navigating obstacle courses, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/8/23993494/catch-some-air">racing</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340770/fortnite-festival-local-multiplayer">playing music together</a>. Epic has put a lot of effort behind expanding from just being a battle royale experience, even if some of them, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241414/fortnite-party-royale-ltm-mode">a combat-free party island</a>, haven’t been big hits. And Roblox’s user-made <em>Grow a Garden</em>, which is a farming simulator, has been <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/robloxs-grow-a-garden-hits-industry-record-213m-concurrent-users-surpassing-pubg-fortnite-and-more/">breaking concurrent player records</a>.</p><p>In some ways, adding user-generated content is a continuation of <em>PUBG</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> following similar tracks. Like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>PUBG</em> has <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/7408">big crossover events</a>, for example<em>. </em>But <em>PUBG</em>’s creator tools have a long way to go to catch up with what’s possible with <em>Fortnite</em> and Roblox, though. Roblox was first released <em>in 2006</em>, and the company offers the <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313860-Roblox-Studio">Roblox Studio</a> for making games and <a href="https://create.roblox.com/">extensive resources for Roblox developers</a>. And Epic is investing heavily in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/22/23645671/fortnite-unreal-editor-epic-games-state-of-gdc-2023-creative">Unreal Engine-level tools for making <em>Fortnite</em> experiences</a>. But like with Roblox and <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>PUBG</em> players may have already invested time and money that makes switching over to a new game that much more difficult. By letting players make their own experiences, Krafton can keep those players interested in the <em>PUBG</em> universe and potentially pull in new ones.</p><p>One thing Krafton may also learn from <em>Fortnite</em>: this kind of player-driven expansion can take a long time. Epic has been working and iterating for years to build up <em>Fortnite</em>’s ecosystem of user-made experiences, and even then, Epic’s own modes are usually the ones with the most players. It will probably take a while to know if Krafton’s <em>PUBG</em> 2.0 plan is a winner winner chicken dinner.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/716209/pubg-2-0-fortnite-roblox-platform-krafton-earnings]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To me and millions of other people who grew up listening to alternative rock in the early 2000s, Chester Bennington was a generation-defining voice of rock music. This month marks the eighth anniversary of his passing, and I still remember exactly where I was when I heard the news. I had never been truly affected by a celebrity’s death before, but when I saw <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2017/07/20/linkin-park-singer-chester-bennington-dead-commits-suicide/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2017/07/20/linkin-park-singer-chester-bennington-dead-commits-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the original TMZ report</a></span> while lying on my living room couch, it felt like the whole planet tilted on its axis. I was sick to my stomach and knew, at some point, word would get to someone in my family in the other room and they’d come to check on me, and I dreaded having to acknowledge it out loud. I locked myself in my room like I was barricading myself up in anticipation of an incoming attack. The battle I was preparing for was a seven-word exchange from the other side of my door:</p><div><p>“Kenneth, Linkin Park’s singer died,” my mother said through the door.</p><p>“I know,” I responded.</p><p>My mother knew well enough to leave me alone after that, but 17 years of my life were flashing before my eyes, so I wouldn’t have been fit for a conversation anyway. I remembered borrowing my childhood friend’s burned copy of <em>Meteora</em> for weeks and listening to it on loop so many times that even now, 20 years later, I still anticipate the “skip” in the third line of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYiU_JCYtU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYiU_JCYtU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Numb”</a></span> that came every time I listened to the scratched disc. I lamented that I’d only seen Linkin Park live once, during the 2012 Honda Civic Tour, and would never get to hear Bennington’s wailing through the speakers again. And oddly enough, one of the most pronounced memories I had was of all the (sometimes) poorly made AMVs I’d watched on YouTube, which had made use of the band’s songs.</p></div><p>For many kids growing up during the early 2000s, Linkin Park’s radio success with songs like “Numb” and “In The End” meant they were among our first exposures to heavier music. Before I knew who Linkin Park was, I would often only hear these songs in the dead of night on the pop radio station my family listened to. When I got my first personal radio that I kept in my bedroom, I kept it on late into the night in hopes that one of their songs would play. Hearing “In The End” at eight years old, a few times a week at most, was a musical awakening. I had never heard a voice like Chester’s, or considered lyrics like the band’s. I had been raised on a diet of mostly boy bands and country up to that point, and Linkin Park was coming into my life at a pretty formative moment.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Meanwhile, by the time I was midway through elementary school, I was watching more anime like <em>Dragon Ball </em>and playing more angsty, emotionally driven games like <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, and the 2000s-era <em>Sonic </em>games. Superheroes had also entered my field of view, but the <em>X-Men </em>films and <em>Evolution </em>animated series were my touchstones at that point. My media diet had been largely controlled by my parents, but the more time I spent with friends in elementary school, the more I was exposed to the kind of art that altered my younger self’s brain chemistry. I wasn’t quite an emo kid yet, but the seeds were being sown, and Linkin Park was a musical anchor for these changes. Right about this time, I was also getting access to the internet, and my earliest exposures to fandom and internet culture were set to rapper Mike Shinoda’s flow.</p><p>Before the days of Spotify and long before I had enough money to buy CDs or an iPod, one of my primary ways of listening to music I didn’t own yet was through YouTube. If a band hadn’t released a music video for a song, there was certainly a pre-teen with iMovie and a dream who had set hastily-clipped-together snippets of their favorite anime or movie to it. Linkin Park has sold millions of records and sold out stadiums, but one of their most enduring roles in pop culture is as <em>the</em> early 2000s AMV band. Almost anyone who was a fan of anime like <em>Dragon Ball Z </em>probably has core memories of fan videos set to Linkin Park’s music.</p><p>The association is still so strong that if you scroll down to the comment sections of some of these videos, you’ll find that fans flocked to them shortly after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/akira-toriyama-dragon-ball-dies-quest-chrono-trigger-1851318780&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/akira-toriyama-dragon-ball-dies-quest-chrono-trigger-1851318780"><em>Dragon Ball </em>creator Akira Toriyama passed in 2024</a></span>. Some of these edits have more views than the band’s actual music videos, like this <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOAyJPc3Nx4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOAyJPc3Nx4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Spider-Man </em>video</a></span> set to “What I’ve Done,” which has accumulated over 179 million views over the past 16 years, eclipsing quite a few of the band’s official works. Plenty of other outfits from this era, like Evanescence and Breaking Benjamin, share the distinction of being AMV bands, and while it’s partially because their mainstream success had made them each something of a household name, it’s also because each of these bands’ music is built upon intense emotion that blends seamlessly with the bursts of stylized action, angst, and agony so common in the works AMVs tend to celebrate.</p><p>When you’re young, you feel every emotion with a raw intensity you (hopefully) grow out of as you get older. Listening to Linkin Park now, I find that a lot of the band’s early nu metal efforts speak to that unbridled rage and hopelessness you might feel when you’re young but can’t neatly fold up and articulate in something more poetic. Bennington repeatedly screams “shut up when I’m talking to you” in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qlCC1GOwFw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qlCC1GOwFw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“One Step Closer,”</a></span> and yeah, a different band (and even Linkin Park itself on later records) would probably find a more eloquent way of expressing frustration with someone who has repeatedly berated you to the point of making you lose your cool. That’s not to say I view Linkin Park’s old records as “childish” or “immature,” but it does provide a context for why so many of those decade-old music videos of anime and video games we were playing in the early 2000s are set to Linkin Park’s music. They are as much a cultural artifact as the band’s music, emblematic of where the band and their fans were 25 years ago. Linkin Park’s legacy was written in the glow of CRTs playing Toonami and riffed on in early versions of Final Cut Pro.</p><p>These days, AMVs have taken a different form in TikTok edits, and newer bands like Sleep Token, Bring Me the Horizon, and Cafuné have become staples on the app. But Linkin Park’s influence persists, with “What I’ve Done” having <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-it-came-out-in-2007-directed-by-michael-bay&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-it-came-out-in-2007-directed-by-michael-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">become a meme</a></span> referencing its inclusion in the <em>Transformers</em> film. Even after Linkin Park’s heyday has come and gone, we still associate their music with a specific era of self-serious fan edits that still manage to hit. Apps like TikTok have made editing tools so widespread that these references become much more universally understood and recreated, to the point where decades later, younger audiences are extending that cultural footprint.</p><p>I saw Linkin Park for the third time at Barclays Center yesterday. It was my second time seeing them with new frontwoman Emily Armstrong, so I’ve now officially seen the band more times without Bennington than with him. While it was clear that the crowd skewed toward millennials, there were a lot of kids there, young enough that I wondered how cognizant they were of the band before Bennington died in 2017. Whenever they started listening, they were still singing along to songs older than they were. So perhaps even though they’re coming in hearing Armstrong perform everything from the back catalog, the kids are being raised on the old texts, and all that early 2000s angst isn’t being lost to the ether.</p><p>Armstrong has been under a lot of scrutiny since she joined Linkin Park in 2024, both for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/credy50z4j1o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/credy50z4j1o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some very valid reasons</a></span> having to do with her past support of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/arts/television/danny-masterson-rape-trial-sentencing.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/arts/television/danny-masterson-rape-trial-sentencing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Danny Masterson</a></span> and her ties to the Church of Scientology, and as a result of some fans seeing her take on the vocalist role as a betrayal of Bennington’s legacy. You can’t open up a video of her performing the old songs without someone making a comparison to Bennington’s vocals or spamming “karaoke night” as if she’s just covering someone else’s music. One of Bennington’s last songs, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm8LGxTLtQk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm8LGxTLtQk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“One More Light,”</a></span> is about mourning someone who’s gone, and there’s a line that references having “one more chair than you need” at the dinner table when the person who typically sat there isn’t around any longer. When you grieve someone from the outside, like an actor or member of your favorite band, it becomes easy to project your scruples onto the world as it continues to spin. Sometimes, when an artist you deeply admire dies, they can become symbols of your own myopic relationship to them before they’re people, and that means we once again <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-anxiety-touch-controversy-1851787007&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-anxiety-touch-controversy-1851787007">start writing fan fiction in our head</a></span> about whatever comes after. To some, Linkin Park persisting after Bennington’s death has felt like letting someone else sit in that empty chair.</p><p>I understand the knee-jerk emotional reaction, and it certainly feels like the band anticipated the pushback they might receive. Linkin Park’s latest record, <em>From Zero</em>, is the first since Armstrong joined the band, and while it’s middle-of-the-road for them, in my opinion, it feels like a grand tour of each one of the band’s previous eras, but with a new singer. It pivots back and forth between the group’s explosive nu metal roots to its more experimental electronic work, almost as if they were trying to prove to everyone that, despite all the turmoil, Linkin Park can still be everything they once were. That includes a band that captures all the emotions our favorite show, movie, or game makes us feel. The empty chair is still there, and no one else is sitting in it. There are just a few new chairs at the table now, and nevertheless, millions of fans are gathering around it once more. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/linkin-park-edit-amv-chester-bennington-emily-armstrong-1851787368]]></content:encoded>

The lineup is headlined by the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F3QKLDLM,B0F3QDLZKG,B0F3QG16DN,B0FC1R9KRL,B0FC1NMTN5&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlackShark V3 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset</a></strong>. The $250 wireless headset is the only model in the lineup with active noise cancellation. It's available in Xbox, PlayStation, and PC versions, but it's worth noting the Xbox edition of all of the V3 models has universal compatibility. If the V3 Pro is a bit too expensive for your budget, Razer also released two substantially more affordable models--the $150 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDP42BTF,B0FH5T1RD1,B0FH5XX7GP,B0FDPJZQNY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>BlackShark V3</strong></a> and the $100 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDNTH3CV,B0FH5YWH7B,B0FDPM6DWH&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>BlackShark V3 X HyperSpeed</strong></a>. The V3 Pro releases August 4, while the other two models are available now.</p><p dir="ltr">While all three BlackShark V3 models share the same over-ear form factor and core features, there are, of course, some notable differences--one of the biggest being their wireless connection quality. The BlackShark V3 and V3 Pro are the first to use Razer’s HyperSpeed Wireless Gen-2 connectivity, which the company says offers playback latency as low as 10ms. The BlackShark V3 X HyperSpeed uses the previous version of the technology, which is still a solid low-latency 2.4GHz option. All models also support Bluetooth wireless pairing and wired connections via USB or 3.5mm.</p><p dir="ltr">The BlackShark V3 Pro is also the only of the three with ANC, and it uses Razer’s high-end Gen-2 TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm drivers. By contrast, the BlackShark V3 uses the Gen-2 TriForce Titanium 50mm drivers, while the V3 X HyperSpeed is equipped with TriForce 50mm drivers. The V3 Pro also features a detachable HyperClear full-band 12mm mic, while BlackShark V3 has a detachable HyperClear super-wideband 9.9mm mic, and the V3 X HyperSpeed uses a detachable HyperClear 9.9mm cardioid mic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540460-blacksharkv3s.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540460" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540460-blacksharkv3s.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540460"></a><figcaption>Razer's BlackShark V3 Pro PlayStation, PC, and Xbox models</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540460-blacksharkv3s.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One thing you’ll find across all three BlackShark V3 wireless headsets is virtual 7.1 surround sound. However, you’ll need to pay attention to which platforms the model is tuned for. The BlackShark V3, V3 Pro, and V3 X HyperSpeed all come in PC-, PlayStation-, and Xbox-specific models. While you can technically use each model on other platforms--the Xbox version is universal--they have specific surround-sound compatibility. The PC versions use either Windows 7.1 surround sound or THX Spatial Audio, which only works on specific versions of Windows. Meanwhile, the PlayStation models use Sony’s Tempest 3D Audio for PS5, and the Xbox models use Windows Sonic. Make sure you grab the appropriate model for your preferred platform if you plan on using virtual surround sound.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with the differences in platform and spatial audio support, each platform-specific model of the BlackShark V3, V3 Pro, and V3 X HyperSpeed also features unique color schemes. For example, the PC models are all available in black or white, while the PlayStation models feature black with blue padding and accents, and the Xbox models come in black with green padding and accents.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the full rundown on each of the new BlackShark V3 wireless gaming headset models below.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3994" data-template="4"

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals - Blade Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer | The One and Only</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Daywalker isn't the only new addition coming with the game's August 8 patch. As outlined in a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgMriWER-6E" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Vision video</a>, it will also add, remove, and adjust a number of team-up abilities. Guardian Revival, which saw Mantis and Star-Lord take advantage of Adam Warlock's regenerative abilities, is being removed, as is Luna Snow and Iron Fists's Atlas Bond.</p><p dir="ltr">In their place are two new team-ups. Duality Dance will be for Adam Warlock and Luna Snow and looks to power up Luna's attacks based on the damage she received. Another new team-up called Vibrant Vitality sees Mantis serve as the anchor. When partnered with Groot, Groot's walls will heal nearby allies. When she's paired with Loki, his healing fields will also give a damage boost.</p><p dir="ltr">Other team-up changes include Loki being removed from Ragnarok Rebirth, Iron Fist joining Luna Snow's Chilling Assault, Star-Lord joining Rocket Network, and Blade being added to Cloak and Dagger's Lunar Force.</p><p dir="ltr">As for changes to competitive play, the 3.5 update will increase penalties for those leaving competitive matches by enforcing longer bans and implementing larger point deductions for leavers. For those forced to endure the rest of a match after someone on their team leaves, NetEase will offer more point compensation and make it easier to surrender. It also notes that it will be speeding up its appeals process for those banned mistakenly, and will continue to review cases where players are forced to leave games due to "unavoidable system issues."</p><p dir="ltr">While it won't arrive at the same time as Blade and the team-up changes, NetEase also confirmed that new map the Throne of Knull and new mode Resource Rumble will be coming on August 22.

<p>Risk it all in August</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>WayForward has given us a Switch release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution</a>, the once-cancelled GBA sequel to the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/shantae">Shantae</a> game.</p>
<p>Coming to Switch on <strong>19th August 2025</strong> — a few months after some fans got hold of a GBA cartridge with the game on it from Limited Run Games — Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution is also getting a Deluxe Edition, which comes with three extra costumes for the genie to dress up in.</p>
<p>These three exclusive costumes are the Relic Hunter, High Voltage, and Sizzle Armor, each giving Shantae unique powers. If you're getting the physical version of the game, the Deluxe Edition is already included on the cartridge. Pre-orders go live on 8th August 2025 at <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all-games/products/shantae-advance-risky-revolution-standard-edition-switch-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc?_pos=5&amp;_sid=1f19ab402&amp;_ss=r">Limited Run Games</a>, where the game costs $34.99.</p>

<p>Let's get a quick rundown of the game from developer WayForward, then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shantae is back in an adventure 20 years in the making! The nefarious pirate Risky Boots has a “groundbreaking” new plan that will leave Sequin Land spinning — by rotating the continent, she can move any town right to the coast for easy plundering! As Shantae, turn the tectonic tables on Risky by taking control of the land itself: shift, twist, navigate, and explore by swapping between mix-and-match multilayered levels! Hair-whip and belly-dance your way through scrambled lands, misplaced towns, monster-filled crypts, and daunting labyrinths. Six creature transformations, fierce boss battles, and a 4-player versus mode await!</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:<br>
-</strong> Discover the lost chapter of the Shantae saga, fully restored and released after 20 years!<br>
<strong>-</strong> Fight and explore using your hair-whipping ability, magic items, and belly-dance transformations (including monkey, elephant, crab, and more)!<br>
<strong>-</strong> Spin and shift Front Yard and Back Yard playfields to create new routes and solve puzzles!<br>
<strong>-</strong> Visit towns, battle through labyrinths, purchase upgrades, find collectables, and meet with friends like Rottytops, Sky, and Bolo!<br>
<strong>-</strong> For the first time ever in a Shantae game, four players can compete in Battle Mode!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-playtest-material-messes-with-monstrous-transformation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-daggerheart-playtest-material-messes-with-monstrous-transformation.1257462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has released new playtest material for <em>Daggerheart</em>. The latest batch of <em>Daggerheart</em> playtest material of material doesn't introduce a new ancestry or a new class, but a new transformation mechanic, allowing players to become monstrous vampires or werewolves at the table.</p>



<p>The new <em>Daggerheart</em> playtest material was added in an update to <a href="https://www.daggerheart.com/thevoid/" rel="nofollow">The Void</a>, Darrington Press' page for new playtest material. Similar to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons'</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a>, the page provides players with an early look at experimental gameplay mechanics and ideas.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-playtest-material-transformation-image.jpg?itok=Bm16HyTY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-playtest-material-transformation-image.jpg?itok=22bfQkf2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Those players can then provide feedback to Darrington Press. Based on that feedback, the material may be adjusted and released in official supplements down the line.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the new transformation represents changes to a player's character in <em>Daggerheart</em>. These changes can be done for narrative purposes by the GM or can be used as a character creation option. The playtest material contains rules and cards for six transformations: Vampire, Werewolf, Demigod, Ghost, Reanimated, and Shapeshifter.</p>

<p>How the transformation <em>Daggerheart</em> playtest material works in-game is that your character adds the corresponding transformation card to their loadout, ignoring their domain card limit. A character can only have one transformation total. That transformation card then provides an appropriate benefit and drawback.</p>

<p>The playtest material encourages gaming tables to figure out the origin of this transformation alongside the implications of the power going wrong. For example, vampire and werewolf transformations are staples of pop culture; get bitten and be forever changed. But while a werewolf player benefits from a Wolf Form, sacrificing Stress for a damage boost, they can potentially massacre their party with the Frenzy drawback.</p>

<p>The more eclectic forms do encourage some more creativity. Reanimated and Ghost do contain potential for dark fantasy and horror adventures, and the Demigod does invite some intriguing worldbuilding and roleplay potential if done well.</p>

<p>The new transformation Daggerheart playtest material, which includes rules and the transformation cards, are free to download.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>With Fortnite OG existing as its own permanent mode now, we aren't expecting another throwback mini-season in the vein of last year's Chapter 2 Remix or the original OG season the year before. But with the upcoming Chapter 6 Season 4 starting on August 8, we're pretty much guaranteed a new mini-season in November, because Fortnite has never had a four-month season on purpose before. Instead, the hot rumor since the beginning of May is that we'll be getting another collaboration mini-season like Star Wars season in May, this time with <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1920270562812670238" rel="nofollow ">The Simpsons taking center stage</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">When you consider Epic's cozy relationship with Disney, plus its long history of Fox Animation collabs--including three cartoon dads Fortnite dropped for Father's Day this past June--this rumor sounds pretty plausible. Indeed, there's been nearly no skepticism about it at all. November is still a long ways away, though, and a lot can happen between now and then. While we wait, let's see what exactly the rumor mill has said about this one.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When would the Simpsons mini-season start?</h2><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1950226569697362395" rel="nofollow ">next season's update schedule</a>, Chapter 6 Season 4 should end on Saturday, November 1, which indicates it'll have a live finale event to wrap things up during the day. If things work the way they did after the Death Star Sabotage event in June, the new mini-season would begin that same evening after 4-7 hours of maintenance. Otherwise, it would start the next morning, on November 2.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Is the Simpsons mini-season officially confirmed?</h2><p dir="ltr">Not at all. Every bit of info about the purported Simpsons season comes from leakers and dataminers, and it has all just been written descriptions--there's been no leaked art or anything tangible that might serve as some level of confirmation. There is, however, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1932068250143039720" rel="nofollow ">one poster in Utopia City</a> that could be hinting at a Simpsons collab, but that's not confirmation of any sort of takeover.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering the way Epic typically likes to hold back on promoting a new season until the current one is almost over, we've got a while before Epic will say anything about it at all. But prominent leakers have been harping on it so regularly that a lot of folks have taken it as read that a Simpsons season is coming. But until some real teasers start popping up, November's Simpsons mini-season remains an unconfirmed rumor.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What would a Simpsons mini-season entail?</h2><p dir="ltr">The rumors so far are vague and confusing, and so it's a little difficult to sift through it all right now. The full picture is not even remotely clear just yet. Keep that in mind as we lay out the fractured details that we currently have.</p><p dir="ltr">The most surprising detail among the rumors thus far is that the Simpsons will have an entire map modeled after the Simpsons' hometown of Springfield, but the claim is that it will be <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1931473086538531263" rel="nofollow ">the size of a Reload map and support only 40 players</a>. It's not out of the question that the main Battle Royale mode could go small for this since it only lasts a month--let's not forget that Epic made <em>everyone</em> play Zero Build for two weeks after it was introduced in early 2022. But there's also another fairly obvious possibility worth considering: that the Springfield map actually <em>will</em> be for Reload, rather than BR.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering Reload is Fortnite's clear no. 2 mode at this point, and it has no battle pass, it wouldn't be surprising if Epic looked for new ways to encourage folks to play it. Plus, it just got a Squid Game-themed map added to its rotation in June, so there's precedent. On the other hand, this part of the rumor could be completely wrong. Blortzen, the leaker who first spread the rumor about the Simpsons season, suggested in June that the rumor about a small map was <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1934688153606004804" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">actually about Blitz Royale</a>, which was announced a couple weeks after all these Simpsons rumors were spread around.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond that, everything else we've heard makes this rumored Simpsons season sounds like it will include most of the same stuff other mini-seasons have--a small battle pass, accompanying shop skins, and weekly changes to the map. But since we haven't heard any significant new details since the beginning of June, it's still hard to gauge what exactly Simpsons season will look like.</p>

This bonkers dating sim boasted a monster voice cast with portfolios spanning <strong>Final Fantasy</strong>, <strong>Persona</strong>, <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> and more, but it was let down by some heartbreaking performance issues. Fortunately, the latest Switch update — which developer Sassy Chap Games calls a "mega patch" — should clear some of that up.</p>
<p>The latest update bundles three previous hotfixes into one bug break-up package. Those bugs have clearly been the target of this one, with the "mega patch" fixing a lot of issues in the game's multiple endings, and adding an overall performance boost to the Switch version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-closed-beta-august/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-will-host-an-open-beta-for-battlefield-6-in-august-dates-revealed-%E2%80%93-rumor.1257429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA will reportedly host an open beta for Battlefield 6 in August, potentially even two open betas, the first at the beginning of the month and the second one later in the month.</p>



<p>This claim comes from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta/">Insider-Gaming</a>, which claims from its sources that access to a closed beta can be gained through a promotion with several content creators who will be giving away codes on Twitch. Insider-Gaming also claims that following the closed beta on August 7-8, the beta will continue until August 10th in an "<em>open-beta phase</em>," though that is seemingly separate from an open beta later in the month from August 14-17.</p>



<p>Shortly after Insider-Gaming's report, however, in the official Battlefield Discord server, EA's global community manager denied the claim that there was a closed beta at all, confirming that only an open beta is planned. Perhaps Insider-Gaming's wires were crossed, and there are two open betas planned. Either way, we'll likely know for sure tomorrow.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We got our first official look at Battlefield 6 just <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/">last week</a>, with its debut trailer showing what looked more like cutscenes from various points of the game's campaign rather than gameplay. Last week's announcement also confirmed that we'll get a gameplay trailer for multiplayer tomorrow, July 31, 2025, which is likely where we'll find out if Insider-Gaming and its sources are correct about the beta dates. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>While there's definitely a lot riding on the campaign for Battlefield 6, its multiplayer is what will decide if the game lives or dies. It took EA months to undo the mistakes and damage it did to Battlefield 2042's multiplayer, which was unfortunately the only mode 2042 had since it lacked a campaign.</p>



<p>EA has a lot riding on Battlefield 6, with four of its core studios working on it and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">hundreds of millions reportedly invested </a>into its development. We'll see how players respond to tomorrow's gameplay trailer, and if Battlefield 6 will have the legs EA is expecting it to have.</p>

        <p>Claiming otherwise is evidence of a "reasoning gap"</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If the messy situation regarding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> and those ousted studio heads has led you to wonder if publishers Krafton might be mismanaging the development of their games, the company's chief financial officer reckons you're diving in the wrong sea. According to Dongkeun Bae, Subnautica 2's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">delay from 2025 release to 2026</a> is proof that Krafton are doing a good job with that, actually.</p>
<p>The exec said as much via translator during a recent earnings call that, among many other things, featured the publishers' own version of the events surrounding Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis being parachuted in at Unknown Worlds to replace senior executives Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">last month</a>. Whether Subnautica 2 was genuinely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">ready to release in early access</a> this year is a key part of the whole fracas. Krafton say no, the three fired leads say yes, and now the latter are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">suing</a>. The complicating factor is that there was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-will-get-their-bonus-says-krafton-but-its-not-the-250-million-promised">big bonus for the studio's workers</a> tied to the game releasing this year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All of that context brings us to Krafton's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lghT4WUpgZQ">latest quarterly earnings call</a>. During the Q&amp;A section that always follows the great number-filled presentationy bit of these things, CFO Dongkeun Bae was asked by one analyst whether Krafton are struggling to manage all their different game projects, given the disagreement over Subnautica 2's readiness for early access. That analyst also questioned whether the company's "internal standard is appropriate for different games and different initiatives, Subnautica 2 milestone included".</p>
<p>"I do fully understand that from the outside you may think that because there's talk of legal proceedings of Subnautica 2 and it being delayed, that could make you think that maybe within Krafton our milestone process is being mismanaged," Bae responded, continuing as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>There's a bit of I believe a reasoning leap or reasoning gap between those two points. I say that because the actions that we've taken on Subnautica 2 actually represent that things are effectively being managed inside Krafton when it comes to the milestone management. </p>
<p>I say that because...[the] Subnautica IP basically has this big follower base, this fandom base. So, as long as we market it and we release it into the market, people would say that there's [a] certain level of sales from this title [which] will be guaranteed. But what we are seeking to do is to make sure that we satisfy the highest level of satisfaction that the gamers have, their aspiration. And so because we've managed the whole milestone process very rigorously within the company, we were able to make the decision that we made regarding Subnautica 2 and because we felt that the game was not up to par, not up to the level that we had wished it to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's a fairly blunt way of saying that if they weren't managing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> properly, they'd have been cool essentially chucking out any old shite with the Subnautica name on it, because it'd probably make bank regardless.</p>
<p>In response to another question from the same person, Bae also talked a bit about how Krafton sees Subnautica 2 as worth approaching differently to life sim InZoi, despite both going the early access route. Basically, with the latter not being an established name and offering "a great level of freedom" that might leave players feeling a bit lost or overwhelmed, Krafton reckon getting live feedback on it ASAP is the key priority. By contrast, the publishers believe that as an established thing, Subnautica 2's facing "much higher" initial expectations from players, and will need to offer a "greater level of distinctive and differentiating fun factor". </p>
<p>So, there's a bit more of the company giving more of its view and arguably playing a bit of defense even to money types about the Subnautica 2 situation, which continues to rumble on as we wait to see what'll happen with the lawsuit brought by the former studio leads.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-delay-actually-proves-krafton-arent-mismanaging-their-games-says-exec]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Prices for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Scarlet and Violet 151 Pokémon cards</a> have been moving fast this month. As more booster boxes get opened and singles flood the market, some of the set’s Illustration Rares have started to dip in value, especially the middle evolutions of the starter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon</a>. On the flip side, big Special Illustration Rares of fan favourite Kanto starter final evolutions are seeing steady climbs as collectors chase the best‑looking cards from the set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex, Blastoise ex and Venusaur ex are the top of the climbers hill this week with noticeable price jumps, while Zapdos ex and Alakazam ex are also gaining traction with collectors and competitive players. All five of these cards have strong artwork, great playability, or both, which is helping push prices higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same can’t be said for some of the Illustration Rares of Charmander, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and their evolutions. These cards spiked when the set first dropped, but with more supply on the market, prices have started to settle. They’re still popular pulls, just not commanding the same premium they did in June.</p><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/29/pixel-9-94-1753801366630.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Kanto starters’ final evolutions are climbing, their earlier forms have started to dip in value as more Scarlet &amp; Violet 151 product hits the market. Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur were among the hottest Illustration Rares when the set launched, but prices are cooling as supply catches up with demand. Charmander is down 14% to $44.44, Squirtle has dropped 7% to $43.80, and Bulbasaur has fallen 18% to $32.20. These cards are still popular with collectors who want to complete the evolutionary lines, but they no longer command the inflated early prices from the set’s release month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The middle evolutions are following the same trend. Charmeleon has dropped 14% to $30.54, while Wartortle is down 15% to $27.36. Both Illustration Rares have fantastic artwork and remain fun pulls, but they simply don’t hold the same appeal as the Special Illustration Rare ex cards of their final evolutions. As Scarlet &amp; Violet 151 booster boxes continue to be opened, the market has become saturated with these mid‑tier rares, bringing prices back down to more reasonable levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with these price drops, the Illustration Rares of the Kanto starters and their evolutions are still great pickups for collectors who want the full line. Prices are likely to stabilise at these lower points, making now a good time to grab them if you missed out early. The final evolutions will continue to be the big-ticket items, but these cards remain iconic pieces of the set for anyone who grew up with the original Pokémon games.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/29/pixel-9-93-1753801271476.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex has risen to $210.00, up 14% from early July. It remains one of the most in-demand cards in the set thanks to its powerful Explosive Vortex attack, which hits for 330 damage, and the fantastic Special Illustration Rare artwork that collectors continue to chase. Blastoise ex has seen an even sharper jump, climbing 28% to $84.99, driven by both its intimidating art and competitive appeal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solid Shell makes Blastoise surprisingly tanky, and Twin Cannons can unload massive damage by discarding Water Energy from your hand.Venusaur ex is seeing a similar surge, up 27% to $69.99. While Charizard usually grabs the spotlight, Venusaur’s Illustration Rare version has become a favourite for collectors who love its vibrant, personality-filled design. Its ability Tranquil Flower lets you heal 60 damage every turn while in the Active Spot, and Dangerous Toxwhip spreads status conditions alongside 150 damage, making it a tricky card to deal with in grindy matchups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Legendary Pokémon aren’t being left out either. Zapdos ex has climbed 23% to $61.99, buoyed by a dynamic Illustration Rare that shows the Legendary Bird mid-strike. It isn’t just binder candy, though. Voltaic Float removes its retreat cost when it has Lightning Energy attached, and Multishot Lightning can deal big damage to both the Active and a damaged Benched Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the climbers is Alakazam ex, which has risen the fastest of the bunch, up 35% to $44.98. The surreal, psychedelic artwork on its Special Illustration Rare has kept collector interest high, but it’s also a flexible attacker. Mind Jack punishes opponents with full benches, while Dimensional Hand can be used even if Alakazam stays on the Bench, giving it options that most other attackers don’t have.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10 Most Expensive Cards In Black Bolt and White Flare</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-most-popular-cards">Black Bolt</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-white-flare-10-most-popular-cards">White Flare</a> are the final Scarlet and Violet expansions, released together earlier this month. Each half of the set has its own focus, with Black Bolt featuring Pokémon like Zekrom, Kyurem, and Genesect, while White Flare highlights Reshiram, Keldeo, and Hydreigon. What makes these sets unique is the new Black White Rares and the fact that every single Pokémon has at least one Illustration Rare or Special Illustration Rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/most-expensive-black-bolt-white-flare-pokemon-cards-right-now">most expensive cards</a> are the Black White Rare versions of Zekrom ex, Reshiram ex, and Victini, all highly desirable for both their powerful attacks and prestige foil treatments. Special Illustration Rares like Hydreigon ex, Keldeo ex, Genesect ex, and Kyurem ex are my favorites, plus they're cheaper than their Black White Rare versions.</p><p id="latest-stock-updates"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Latest Stock Updates">Pokémon TCG Price Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't believe I was singing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-july-22">Amazon's praises last week</a> for some <em>near </em>MSRP deals on sealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon TCG</a> product, as this week they're back up to ridiculous pricing. You should stay away until they lower their prices and stick to TCGPlayer and eBay right now, which in some cases are a clean $15 below Amazon's current pricing. The benefit of buying from TCGPlayer is the vetted sellers and full transparancy on market values, but if you can save even more on eBay then go for it. All links are above to make your life easier.</p><p id="last-weeks-update"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Last Week's Update">Last Week's Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet base set prices have been volatile lately, with Illustration Rares seeing steady gains while some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-july-14">Special Illustration Rares have cooled off</a>. The Ralts evolutionary line has been one of the biggest surprises this month, with Ralts and Kirlia both climbing around 28% in value. Their popularity seems to be driven more by collectors chasing the full evolution line rather than playability alone. Gardevoir ex has also risen significantly, up to $54.99, thanks to its strong Psychic Embrace ability and frequent appearances in competitive decklists. Miraidon ex and Koraidon ex have seen smaller but consistent gains, reflecting their continued use in Lightning and Fighting decks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, several Illustration Rares have dropped sharply. Dondozo and Starly saw the biggest falls, down 30% and 37% respectively, likely due to their limited competitive relevance. Fidough, Armarouge, and Pachirisu also dipped, correcting from their initial launch hype. Overall, Scarlet and Violet’s market is shifting as collectors focus on full evolution lines and competitively viable cards, while once‑popular lower‑tier Illustration Rares settle into lower price ranges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

As Obsidian plots out its future, players are showing up in droves to see what makes Grounded 2 tick.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly 50,000 players signed on to play Grounded 2 when it reached its Steam player peak yesterday (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2661300/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>). It’s a milestone that already towers above the 32,000-player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/962130/charts/#max" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the original Grounded reached</u></a> during its early access run in July 2021. With a little more than 45,000 players actively playing the sequel at the time of this story’s publication, it seems there’s plenty of room to grow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian is already planting seeds for the next few phases of Grounded 2, too. The team <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2661300/view/534356720697222970" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an early access roadmap</a> to coincide with its launch across PC and consoles, spelling out at least one year of updates with more in the pipeline for the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Highlights in the fall plans include AXL Recipes and AXL’s Arena for Brookhollow Park. Armor, weapons, and a Park Boss creature are also said to show up around this time as Obsidian pads out Grounded 2 with various quality-of-life improvements. Winter will then bring Steam Deck verification and ROG Ally support as well as Cricket and Earwig creatures, variants of other existing insects, a Ladybug Buggy, and more.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/grounded-2-early-access-roadmap-1753889620039.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grounded 2 Early Access Roadmap. Image credit Obsidian Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian doesn’t share exactly how it plans to fill the spring with more content for Grounded 2 but says summer will include ziplines, smoothies, and swimming improvements as well as Watery Creatures and Buggies. It means players can expect plenty of additions to roll out in the months ahead, but there’s so much more set to arrive at an unspecified point in the future, too. Highlights include Passive Mutations and Active Mutations 2.0, more creatures and Park Bosses, more armors, additional building materials, and a few secrets the team isn’t willing to share quite yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to see how Obsidian is planning to build upon Grounded 2’s early access foundation, you can see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grounded-2-exists-because-obsidian-was-running-out-of-room-in-grounded-1"><u>why the studio chose to dig into a sequel in the first place</u></a>.

                <p>Between 2021-2023, a former employee at one of game publisher Bandai Namco's subsidiaries allegedly "misappropriated" around 500 million yen (approximately $3.38 million USD), resulting in the employee's arrest and a temporary pay cut for many of the subsidiary's leadership, the company has announced.</p><p dir="ltr">While the arrest happened in January 2024 and Bandai Namco has since been pursuing civil and criminal charges against the former employee, the company is just now able to disclose the incident, according to a <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/HPE794A8_E_BLPHKE9968BE7A4BA.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> outlining the alleged misconduct and the steps Bandai Namco has taken to remedy the situation.</p><p dir="ltr">The alleged embezzlement occurred at Bandai Namco's Hong Kong subsidiary Bandai Logipal and was discovered via an internal audit. Following the former employee's arrest, Bandai Logipal took disciplinary actions against many of its leadership in the form of a temporary pay deduction. Four officers and three full-time directors saw a 30% pay deduction for three months starting in April 2024, with two other full-time directors seeing a 15% pay deduction for the same period.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our group takes the occurrence of this incident very seriously and we sincerely and deeply apologize to all our stakeholders for their concerns and the inconvenience caused by such incident," Bandai Namco states. "We will continue our full cooperation with the local law enforcement authorities for the investigation, and we as a group shall work together to prevent the recurrence of such incidents."</p><p dir="ltr">In a step to prevent a similar incident in the future, the Japan-based Bandai Namco is forming a new department to supervise the management of overseas subsidiaries. It notes that the impact of the incident on Bandai Namco's fiscal year ending March 31, 2026 is expected to be minimal.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony recently announced it will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-463-million-in-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco-as-part-of-strategic-partnership/1100-6533400/" data-ref-id="1100-6533400">investing $463 million in Bandai Namco</a> as part of a "strategic partnership" that will see it own around 2.5% of the entertainment company. While both company's are well known for video games, in a joint statement, Bandai Namco and Sony said it will "focus on expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field where rapid market growth is anticipated."</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Super Nintendo app already had a CRT filter, but this new version, added alongside the same update that added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/create-your-own-mario-masterpiece-with-mario-paint-now-on-nintendo-classics-online/1100-6533518/" data-ref-id="1100-6533518">Mario Paint to the service</a>, is a noticeable improvement. According to one user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1mccg66/snes_classics_crt_filter_has_been_updated_on_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, it's an "NTSC S-Video" style filter that more accurately displays what playing on an actual CRT is like.</p><p dir="ltr">Users on social media have been posting comparison screenshots between the old and new filter, and the difference is definitely noticeable. One screenshot in particular, posted by a Bluesky user named <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/smashtoons.com/post/3lv4ytp7xgc2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dalton</a>, helps to highlight the difference, as you can clearly see the much more defined lines that help improve the image when compared to the old filter. You can check out some other comparisons below.</p><p dir="ltr">The new CRT filter is available for the SNES app on both the Switch and Switch 2. While the Nintendo Switch Online N64 and GameCube apps also have CRT filters, it doesn't look like they've received this new version just yet.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Nintendo news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-switch-2-update-has-arrived-and-stability-stans-are-going-to-be-happy/1100-6533520/" data-ref-id="1100-6533520">Switch 2 just received a new hardware update</a> that doesn't appear to do much, but does include "general system stability improvements." Nintendo announced it will host a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-confirmed-for-july-31/1100-6533543/" data-ref-id="1100-6533543">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase on July 31</a>, which will include information on upcoming Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 games from third-party publishers and developers.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-%E2%80%93-ineffa-build-weapons-guide.1257369/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Genshin Impact’s latest character is Ineffa, an android who is getting slightly ahead of the 6.0 versions and showing us a glimpse of what we can expect from Nod-Krai mechanically. The final patch of each version is always a big old beach episode, so filler filled with little lore nods here and there, but Ineffa is certainly bringing the hype by literally changing one of the core reactions. To get the most out of her though, you’ll need the best Ineffa build you can put together.</p>
<p><iframe title="Character Trailer - &quot;Ineffa: Essentials for Home and Travel&quot; | Genshin Impact #GenshinImpact #Ineffa" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-n9weZtcN0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Ineffa changes the electro-charged reaction into lunar-charged, which is unique (for now), in that it uses every character involved in the reaction to calculate damage, and it can also crit, which electro-charged couldn’t do. While this isn’t going to be especially well-utilised with just Ineffa, we have a feeling it’ll be more relevant when we get to Nod-Krai properly with the 6.0 patch.</p>


<p>Her elemental skill summons Birgittato to deal off-field electro damage, but also gives a skill based on Ineffa’s ATK. Her burst does a big old burst of damage, and also re-summons Birgitta. If you’ve been playing for any length of time, comparing Ineffa to Fischl is the simplest way to understand things. However, most of Ineffa’s power is in one of her passives, which allows Birgitta to do additional lunar-charged damage if the effect is already in play when Birgitta attacks. With all of this in mind, Ineffa is a sub-DPS with some shielding capabilities, and she could be a nice little boost to hydro and electro teams.</p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Ineffa Best Weapon</h3>
<p>Ineffa’s signature weapon is Fractured Halo, a polearm that boosts ATK after using the elemental skill or elemental burst, and boosts lunar-charged damage if the equipping character creates a shield during that effect. However, if you’re not using this, any of the five-star weapons can do an alright job of things, but you might be better off going with a four-star weapon if you’re not using her signature.</p>

<p>Kitain Cross Spear is an excellent option because it not only gives elemental mastery and boosts elemental skill damage, but it also gives Ineffa some more energy. Ineffa does need to be able to use her burst, so this weapon ticks all of the boxes you need it to, at least for a four-star option. You can also go for the Ballad of the Fjords, or the trusty Favonius Spear, because it’s good on everyone.</p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Ineffa Best Artifacts</h3>
<p>As of Ineffa’s release, there really isn’t a great artifact set for her. We’re expecting one to come along in the 6.0 patch, but for now, you’ve got a few options that’ll do the job. The frontrunner for us is to use a set that just fits well enough for now, which is going to often just be two two-piece sets of ATK boost, like Gladiator’s Finale.</p>
<p>You can also run her with Tenacity of the Millileth if you want more shield strength and more buffs, or with Gilded Dreams for boosting her damage. For stats, you basically want an ATK sands, an ATK goblet, and a Crit circlet, most likely Crit DMG as Ineffa ascends with Crit Rate. You can go for EM if you’re interested in messing around with a hyperbloom team too.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA and Respawn </a>have just debuted a new gameplay trailer for the latest season for Apex Legends, which is up to its 26th season now since the free-to-play movement-focused battle royale launched in 2019. Season 26: Showdown will arrive on all platforms on August 5, 2025, bringing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/showdown-game-updates">some significant changes</a> to the gameplay, including a new permanent mode, Wildcard.</p>



<p>Wildcard is a new mode that really lets players break the tried-and-true systems of Apex Legends. Gone are any cares towards tactical synergies between Legends. You can stack your whole team with the same legend if you want in Wildcard, as you zip and fly around the altered version of Kings Canyon which has been tuned with more ziplines, more launch pads, and every player gets a second chance without having to be revived, so long as you die before the final ring. </p>



<p>Looting has also been simplified and streamlined in this mode to make everything as action-packed as possible. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other changes beyond the addition of Wildcard as a new permanent mode include the introduction of Elite weapons, the first of which is the RE-45. Two Legends, Caustic and Bangalore, are getting significant buffs this season. Amps are being introduced as new passive upgrades players can pick up in ranked and unranked matches. Hop-ups will be locked to weapons now instead of being pick-ups on the ground for players to loot. The reign of the Jumpmaster has ended, as ranked matches will now feature pre-assigned drop zones instead, and the E-District map is getting a switch to a daytime setting.</p>



<p>These are also just the highlights regarding the big changes, as the full details will be unveiled with the full patch notes that will arrive a day before Season 26 goes live, on August 4, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Much like the titular monsters who inhabit its dreaded world of darkness, <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>’s development has been a bit of a cursed creature.

The Chinese Room definitely knows how to strike a tone with horror, and based on a recent dive into the game’s development with <em>Game Informer</em>, the team sounds locked in to deliver a <em>VtM</em> experience that isn’t looking to just be <em>GTA</em> with sharp, pointy teeth. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195410" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="195410,195922,196539" data-current="195410"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20876.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sirens-rest-still-wakes-chinese-room-walking-simulator-1851785437&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sirens-rest-still-wakes-chinese-room-walking-simulator-1851785437">This DLC Follow-Up To One Of Last Year’s Hidden Horror Gems Made Me Cry Out In Terror</a></span></p><p>“We’re not making <em>GTA</em>; this isn’t a big open world, sprawling game where the horizon is your limit,” the game’s art director, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/07/29/detail-over-scope-were-not-making-gta-vampire-the-masquerade&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/07/29/detail-over-scope-were-not-making-gta-vampire-the-masquerade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Matthews, told <em>Game Informer</em></a></span>. Instead, the developers are aiming for density packed into a smaller region with clear boundaries, all designed to keep you focused on the central and delicate bloody balance between the “jovial, human world” and the “dark, vampire world.” </p><p>The original <em>Bloodlines</em> was a notoriously messy game. It gained cult status many moons ago as modders took to repairing its loose ends and, given that it offered such a unique experience, many fans were willing to overlook its shortcomings. Where else would you get to roleplay as a fledgling kindred trying to make it on the mean streets of Los Angeles? </p><p>There’ll be a little less freedom in who your character is in the upcoming sequel. Instead of rolling your own character, you’ll be given a choice of clans and genders for a pre-written character, Elder Phyre, a 400-year-old vamp newly awoken in Seattle. </p><p>That may be a bummer for those of us who wanted to play as a vampire of our own creation, but as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/were-not-making-gta-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-channeling-the-best-part-of-deus-ex-mankind-divided-a-dense-hub-instead-of-a-huge-open-world/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/were-not-making-gta-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-channeling-the-best-part-of-deus-ex-mankind-divided-a-dense-hub-instead-of-a-huge-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our comrades over at <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> have highlighted, forgoing a massive open world in exchange for a focused, hub-like space to prowl speaks to a more intimate experience of the kind we’d expect in something like <em>Deus Ex</em>. And if there’s anything that benefits from a more intimate experience, it’s certainly <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em>.</p><p>Having an intimate space to play in sounds like an advantageous way to leverage the very core of what makes <em>Vampire</em> <em>Vampire</em>: Needing to preserve the masquerade. The source material isn’t just about playing as bloody monsters; it’s about staying hidden, to preserve power, to protect the vulnerable. It’s a double-edged metaphor that can make for exciting choices and high-stakes situations. And were <em>Bloodlines 2</em> to be set in a massive world, it could be all too easy to get out of Dodge to avoid the deadly consequences of breaking the masquerade by feeding on humans in public or showing off your monstrous powers. </p><p>Vampires are also very restricted creatures. Sure, they live forever, but they must earn it: They have to feed, they must avoid sunlight, and it’s wise for them to ask permission before entering someone’s home. Limiting the scope of the playable space sounds like a perfect way to create the kind of contained, forced situations that lead vampires to become such dangerous cornered animals in the lore, and often at the table with dice.</p><p>The curse of Cain has clearly run through <em>Vampire</em>’s existence in video game form, all the way up to its present tumultuous development. But maybe this undead beast will grab us by the throat when it (hopefully) arrives later this year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-vtm-chinese-room-1851787361]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Monomi Park has announced that the v1.0 full release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slime-rancher-2">Slime Rancher 2</a> is coming on 23rd September 2025, the game launching across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on that date.</p>
<p>The full game will bring a big update that adds things like a new twist on Drones – something to do with Quantum – more gadgets and upgrades, new places to explore and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slime Rancher 2 - Release Date and Physical Pre-Order Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JHjvTdgS_p0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Beyond this, Monomi Park is partnering with iam8bit for a physical release, which will come out on 14th January 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Pre-ordering will net you a Slime Rancher 2 soundtrack download, a fold-out poster designed by renowned art director, Yusuke Naora, and pre-orders of the iam8bit Exclusive Edition, you can also get a sticker sheet of the wiggliest slimes and an O-Sleeve featuring Beatrix LeBeau and the rest of the Slime Rancher 2 crew. That Exclusive Edition will only be available for pre-order through 26th August.</p>
<p>The full release of Slime Rancher 2 has been a long time coming. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/13/slime-rancher-2-announced-and-it-is-an-xbox-console-launch-exclusive/">Originally announced in the summer of 2021</a>, the game entered into PC and Xbox early access in 2022, with a slow drip feed of updates and content in the years since then. Heck, it’s even been a full year since the early access game came to PS5 in June 2024!</p>

<p>It’s also been a long time since I checked in with the game. We have to go back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/27/slime-rancher-2-early-access-review-xbox-game-pass/">my initial impressions</a>, where I said, “There’s a reason why the original Slime Rancher was so popular, and it’s clear even from the opening couple hours that Slime Rancher 2 is building on the exact same relaxed farming gameplay. The Early Access release shows a gentle evolution of the formula, giving a few morsels of what’s to come as the game grows, and we hope there’s bigger surprises down the road.”</p>

<figure><a title="NES Cartridges" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59c39a7c0f293/nes-cartridges.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Former Capcom and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter II</a> producer Yoshiki Okamoto has been sharing insights into his time working on games for the NES / Famicom over on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWmUsHUltVQ&amp;ab_channel=%E5%B2%A1%E6%9C%AC%E5%90%89%E8%B5%B7%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0ch">his YouTube channel</a>, and it gives us an interesting glimpse at game development at the time.</p>
<p>Translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-veteran-says-nintendo-was-the-only-one-making-steady-revenue-from-nes-game-carts-capcoms-profits-really-took-off-with-the-ps1/">Automaton Media</a>, Okamoto detailed that it was harder for third-party developers such as Capcom and retailers to actually turn a profit making and selling games for the Famicom. And, from his experience, "only Nintendo had a guaranteed profit."</p>
<p>"Let’s say a Famicom cartridge sold for 10,000 yen at retail. Out of that, 3,000 yen went to the retailer. 4,000 yen went to the software developer, like Capcom, and 3,000 yen went to Nintendo," which sounds okay at first glance, but Okamoto clarifies that "Out of Nintendo’s 3,000 yen share, about 1,500 went to manufacturing contractors."</p>
<p>"Since Nintendo got paid upfront for the exact number of copies, manufactured the cartridges, and delivered them, what happened after that didn’t matter to them." Back in the '80s, Capcom was a relatively new developer, and had to pay around 3,000 yen per unit upfront.</p>
<figure><a title="NES cartridge profits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2fe46539a22f7/nes-cartridge-profits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWmUsHUltVQ&amp;ab_channel=%E5%B2%A1%E6%9C%AC%E5%90%89%E8%B5%B7%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0ch">Yoshiki Okamoto</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This resulted in the company taking out bank loans to ensure it could afford to pay the Big N, but this built up over time, as it apparently took Nintendo up to 3 months to supply cartridges. Then, Capcom had to send those cartridges and invoices to distributors, but it would rarely get paid immediately, instead receiving a promissory notice to say the money would be coming in 3 months.</p>
<p>That meant, often, that any profit would take up to 6 months to reach Capcom, which would likely be spent on clearing those bank loans. Okamoto also talks about unsold cartridge stock, where developers would often have leftovers thanks to having to over-order, as production took around 3 months. That adds another 3,000 yen unit to costs.</p>
<p>Okamoto still stresses that the NES and SNES were worth it for Capcom, despite cartridges "really only" benefitting Nintendo — and you only have to look at Street Fighter II sales figures to see that.</p>
<p>So, while cartridge-based systems, costs were higher — and that's still true today, from what we know — so when the PlayStation was announced, and disc manufacturing costs were cheaper, it was a dream for third-parties.</p>

<p>“Capcom’s profits skyrocketed with the switch from cartridges to discs,” Okamoto tells viewers, stating that not only were manufacturing costs cheaper, but that Sony would also return its share of the pay (1,600 yen of the 1,800 paid, for example) if Capcom returned any unsold CDs.</p>
<p>Faster restocking speeds, allowing devs to respond much quicker to sale spikes and interests, meant that Capcom was able to thrive even more in the disc-based era. But Nintendo was still a huge part of its success because it allowed them to grow their player base <em>and</em> get a foot in the door in the console gaming space.</p>
<p>It's a fascinating look at how video game development worked back in the late '80s and early '90s, and yet another look at why the PS1 did as well as it did. Who knows how different things would be with that Sony disc add-on for the SNES...</p>
