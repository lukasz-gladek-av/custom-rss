<figure><a title="dk rap credits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ebfcd677b20e3/dk-rap-credits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, as we reported on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sounds-like-the-dk-rap-is-in-donkey-kong-bananza">the DK Rap is back</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which as we all know is a very good thing indeed!</p>
<p>However, one (perhaps expected, on past evidence) little wrinkle is that Grant Kirkhope, the illustrious composer of the DK Rap, alongside music for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goldeneye_007">Goldeneye</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/viva_pinata_pocket_paradise">Viva Pinata</a>, and a whole bunch more didn't actually know the rap was going to be used in the game.</p>
<p>As Kirkhope himself explained to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dk-rap-composer-wasnt-aware-the-worst-rap-track-in-the-history-of-rap-tracks-would-be-included-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Eurogamer</a>, he hadn't been made aware of this most recent usage, which didn't come as such a big surprise to him.</p>
<p>Describing the rap itself, which he created for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, as "the worst track in the history of rap tracks" (has he not seen <a href="https://youtu.be/Re4aDJL3heA?si=3AdUhICSOqi6iSC1&amp;t=150">the John Barnes rap</a>?) Kirkhope, who also wasn't credited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-so-far">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, pointed out that's just not how Nintendo do things.</p>
<p>Speaking last month about being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/grant-kirkhope-apparently-got-a-bananas-reason-for-his-missing-mario-movie-credit">left out of the movie credits</a>, he explained to Eurogamer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Nintendo] said we decided that any music that was quoted from the games that we owned, we wouldn't credit the composers - apart from Koji Kondo... Then they decided anything with a vocal would get credited, so the DK Rap scores there. But then they decided if we also own it, we won't credit the composers. And that was the final nail in the coffin."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The composer tried appealing to Nintendo on other levels about being left in the movie credits, but the company won't be budged, it seems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I said I appreciate you've got your policies and all the rest of it, but by the time the credits roll in the movie to show the songs, the theatre's completely empty, everyone's gone, it's only me and my wife and my two kids sat there going 'look daddy's name!'. I said 'for the sake of a couple of lines of text…', but that was that."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that Nintendo are notorious sticklers for the rules they lay down, it's hard to see how we'll get 'Grant Kirkhope' (or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/05/random_childish_gambino_sampled_donkey_kong_country_and_david_wise_definitely_approves">Dave Wise</a>, for that matter) appearing in the credits for Donkey Kong Bananza — and he's gonna have to wait and see like the rest of us, we guess — but at least he's remained humorous about the whole thing. "My tombstone will read, 'Here lies the body of Grant Kirkhope, he wrote the DK Rap and the Goldeneye Pause Music'... Nothing else will matter!!"</p>
<p>Of course, we all know Grant is quite the celebrity in the gaming realm, so we don't think he need worry about being forgotten (this writer will shout his name aloud when the rap starts in Bananza).<em><br></em></p>
<p>Now...should...should we all watch it? You only live once, right?</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Feeling good about having the DK Rap stuck in your head for another 26 years? Let us know!</em></p>

			<p>Following Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of an expanded partnership with AMD to make next-generation devices, AMD CEO Lisa Su also posted her own statement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kprpRvsOua0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a brief video message</a>:</p>
<p><em>AMD and Microsoft are advancing a bold, shared vision for the future of gaming one that enables seamless gameplay across any screen, placing gamers at the center of the experience anywhere. We're so excited to be deepening our relationship with Microsoft and build on the over two decades of partnership, innovation, and trust. From the earliest days of the Xbox 360, to the most advanced consoles, such as the Xbox Series X and S, and the recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> ROG Xbox Ally handhelds.</em></p>
<p><em>Moving forward, AMD will go beyond building custom chips for Xbox consoles to designing a full roadmap of gaming optimized chips. Combining the power of Ryzen and Radeon for consoles, handhelds, PCs, and the cloud. And we're doing it all with backwards compatibility, so gamers can access their favorite titles across platforms, delivering on a promise to both gamers and developers.</em></p>
<p><em>Together, we are building a vibrant, open ecosystem that delivers the next generation of graphics and immersive gameplay, powered by AI that includes new foundational models to accelerate the state of the art in rendering. From console to cloud to handheld, AMD and Microsoft are building the future of immersive gaming. We are so excited to be working with Microsoft to bring all of this tech to gamers everywhere.</em></p>
<p>The first products born from this deeper partnership to hit the market will be the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds, which are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to launch in late October, according to a recent rumor. The next-generation Xbox consoles aren't likely to be released before 2027. Interestingly, both Microsoft president Sarah Bond and AMD's Lisa Su have underlined that the new chips will also power the Xbox cloud offering, which is currently much less attractive than competitors like NVIDIA's GeForce NOW, whose servers are equipped with more powerful hardware. This should make streaming Game Pass titles way more interesting for subscribers.</p>

In short, she explained Microsoft wants to build an Xbox experience that isn't&nbsp; "locked to a single store or tied to one device." Microsoft has already shown willing to bring its major franchises to rival platforms like Nintendo Switch and PlayStation and make Xbox Game Pass accessible beyond the Xbox ecosystem.

<p>Specifically, the DLC can now be accessed from Chapter 5 instead of Chapter 9, as long as you're on your second playthrough.</p>

<p>Further, repeat playthroughs will have reduced monster difficulty, while on a first playthrough certain field monsters will have adjusted stats. I really hope it's those bastard kangaroos that have been nerfed.</p>
<p>This is great news for everybody, except me. It means that if you're on a second playthrough of the game (on NG+), you can now access the DLC earlier. I, however, have already had to do a NG+ speedrun up to the end of Chapter 9 prior to this update just to access the DLC. Sigh.</p>
<p>Still, alongside the DLC, an update for the full game has brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-receive-difficulty-options-in-free-update-alongside-overture-dlc">new easier difficulty options</a>. So even if the DLC's difficulty has put you off (or, like me, you just want to get through the base game quicker), it's easier to do so on a lower setting.</p>
<p>Alongside the balance adjustments, a number of bugs have been fixed, as per the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/519716851054280776">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Lies of P has <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001716.000010988.html">now sold over 3m copies</a>, thanks to the release of the Overture DLC. Previously, publisher Neowiz revealed the game had reached 7 million players, but as it was initially released on Xbox Game Pass, these didn't count towards copies sold.</p>
<p>To celebrate, developer Round8 is (according to <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37284">The Elec</a> - thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-devs-get-bonus-paid-holiday-and-switch-2-consoles-for-hitting-sales-milestone/">VGC</a>) rewarding its employees with a bonus payout, extra holiday, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> console each.

                <p>Earlier this week, Robin "DarkOne" Scott announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nexus-mods-changing-owners-after-two-decades-but-will-remain-community-first-founder-says/1100-6532457/" data-ref-id="1100-6532457">he sold Nexus Mods</a> to a new owner, ending his nearly 24 years as the leader of the site that he founded in 2001. Scott has indicated that he will remain with Nexus Mods in some capacity while guiding the overall direction of the site. The new owner, Chosen, has also spoken out to assure fans that the valuable resource won't be adding "aggressive monetization" or suddenly place mods behind a paywall.</p><p>Referred to by their Nexus Mods names in a statement from Scott, Foledinho (Victor), Rapsak (Marinus), and Taagen (Nikolai) are the three partners in Nexus Mods' ownership under <a href="https://wearechosen.io/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chosen</a>. This led to fears among players that they collectively plan to monetize the site and exploit the user base for short-term gains. In <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a post on Nexus Mods</a>, Foledinho told fans that "mods will always be free."</p><p>For the most part, Foledinho's message was that few things would change. He went on to say that Chosen doesn't claim ownership of any mods, nor will it charge users to download them. Foledinho indicated that Lifetime Premium subscriptions and free accounts will stay as they are, and he expressed admiration for the way Scott monetized the site in 2007.</p><p>"Honestly, we think it was done right," noted Foledinho. "It enabled healthy growth while supporting the community. We have no plans to change the core of how Premium works. It gives users choice based on their needs--and that’s a good thing."</p><p>"Monetization is hard and Nexus Mods is a complex platform," added Foledinho. "What matters most is continuing to support mod authors, delight users, and keep the lights on. We're not changing the core model. No aggressive monetization. No paid mods. If anything, we're aiming for fewer ads, not more. We'll take a community-first, listening approach, and we won't compromise on what's made Nexus Mods special."</p><p>In a follow-up message, Chosen affirmed its commitment to maintaining the diversity and inclusion approach that Scott embraced during his ownership stint.</p><p>For now, Chosen seems to have said all the right things to assure fans that nothing will fundamentally change. However, Foledinho didn't specify how the leadership team plans to reduce ads on the site without losing the income they bring in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-advert-reportedly-spotted-in-london-sparking-hopes-of-imminent-release<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>An advert for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has reportedly been photographed on the London Underground, stating the game is "out now".</p>
<p>Officially, the game is only due for release at some point this year, so the discovery of this advert has sparked hope a release is imminent.</p>
<p>The images, reportedly taken at Oxford Circus, have not been verified. Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for confirmation of Metroid Prime 4's release date.</p>

<p>Still, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1lfnbga/metroid_prime_4_ad_in_london_underground_out_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit post</a> does include multiple images from different angles, so it certainly appears real. So what's going on?</p>
<p>At the very least, Metroid Prime 4 is certainly not "out now". It's not available to purchase on the eShop, and it seems unlikely Nintendo would shadow drop it.</p>
<p>Instead, this is likely a mistake: either the advertising company has mistakenly put the advert up too early, or a "coming soon" sign of some sort is meant to cover the "out now" part for removal later. Either way, we're awaiting official clarification from Nintendo.</p>
<p>As the advert is specifically for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> Edition, it includes: support for mouse controls, up to 4K resolution in docked TV mode, frame rates up to 120fps, and HDR support.</p>
<p>The game is also set for release on the original Switch, presumably at the same time.</p>
<p>After years of waiting, the hugely anticipated sci-fi adventure received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">first gameplay trailer in June last year</a>. A deeper look at the game was provided during the March Nintendo Direct, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-give-samus-psychic-powers">Samus' psychic powers were revealed</a>.</p>
<p>I was able to play Metroid Prime 4 at the Nintendo Switch 2 preview event in London and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-is-the-best-example-of-switch-2s-varied-control-capabilities-but-you-might-want-to-work-on-your-thighs">tested out its variety of control options</a>. Mouse controls certainly work well enough, but I'm not convinced it'll be the most comfortable way to play on your sofa.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nothing is more powerful, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> and its -likes teach us, than a good corner from which to lurk and swing sharp objects at conga lines of investigating idiots, each somehow convinced that although he just watched four mates get blade-battered in that exact spot by some murdercrazed invisible entity, he will personally be the one that overcomes the unassailable instant death corner with all his favourite bits intact.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slaughter-void">Slaughter Void</a> this lethal arcade <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> speaks of, although, hang on: it's got its own creation myth, in which a betrayed deity unleashes her anguish and makes everything at least 60% more violent and shit than it was previously. The claret-spattered cosmic psychedelia was enough to sucker me in alone, but there's some nicely written fiction here too. It's the kind that just pokes its horns through the walls occasionally, giving you enough of a sense of the entire beast to feel like you're entering somewhere with history, without bogging down all that good good corner slaughter.</p>

<p>Where the stated Diablo influences start to creep in is through a few neat combat twists that transform Hotline Miami's crests and lulls of situational disempowerment into a sort of weaving tactical bloodlust. You'll still get squished instantly if you slip up, but you get temporary armour and speed boosts for kill streaks, and you can access both ranged and melee at the same time. There's also a fat area-of-effect super for dealing with groups. Features ahoy:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fast paced, brutal action:</strong> Combat in SLAUGHTER VOID is quick and merciless. A single hit will kill you, but the same goes for (most of) your enemies- agility and aggression are essential.</p>
<p><strong>Be your own harbinger of destruction:</strong> Through a deluge of hand-crafted levels, carve your own bloody path with unique combinations of weapons and relics to achieve maximum slaughter.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Dismemberment:</strong> Quick death is not enough. The faster you kill, the more havoc you wreak upon your foes, severing and splattering them into multiple pieces. The more you slaughter, the more you reap, harvesting valuable loot from their corpses to spend on upgrades, items, and more.</p>
<p><strong>To the Victor the Spoils:</strong> Compete to be the fastest on the leaderboards as you decimate enemies from this gore-soaked void to the next.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can find a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3730700/Slaughter_Void_Demo/">demo on Steam here</a>. More importantly, you can switch out your axe for a very large hammer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following on from his previous PlayStation blog contribution (more on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-director-vows-to-deliver-a-respectful-representation-of-japan-on-par-with-ghost-of-tsushima"><u>here</u></a>), Fox yet again emphasized the team’s commitment to portraying feudal Japan in a respectful way, this time focusing on the efforts they made to represent the culture of the Ainu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ainu are an indigenous people from north Japan, especially Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido, which provides Ghost of Yotei’s setting. Their language, culture, beliefs, and traditions are distinctly different from the Yamato (also known as Wajin), the main ethnic group that makes up the overwhelming majority of Japan’s population today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Yotei is set at a pivotal point in the history — 1603 was the year the Tokugawa Shogunate was formed by Tokugawa Ieyasu, one of Japan’s great unifiers, putting an end to decades of civil war. Edo (now Tokyo) became Japan’s center of power, ushering in the peaceful Edo period in which Japan’s culture and society blossomed. However, at this time, Hokkaido was still a wild, sparsely populated island home to the Ainu, its formidable winter snow and rugged landscape making it a tough place to live.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“When setting a game in Hokkaido we knew a crucial element was doing our best to represent Ainu culture in a respectful way,” Nate Fox explained. “Thankfully we’d connected with an Ainu cultural adviser before setting out on our reference gathering trip.” Not only that, but they were invited by the adviser to meet her family, which led to the Ghost of Yotei team getting to forage for vegetables in the mountains. “It was a lovely way to make new friends and start our journey in learning about Ainu culture. That night we resolved to put foraging into our new game, we wanted players to be able to share (our) experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Fox, the Ghost of Yotei team spent part of their research gathering trip in Oshima Peninsula, the southern part of Hokkaido that is closest to Japan’s main island of Honshu. In the 1600s, this was the domain of Matsumae clan, who would be given exclusive rights by the Tokugawa government to trade with the Ainu living further north. Fox observed that there are signs even today of how the mainland Japanese people of this time rarely lived any further north of Oshima. There is a “proliferation of cherry trees on the peninsula, brought there from Honshu, yet uncommon in the rest of the island. That really told the story of how sparsely settled Hokkaido was in 1603 by the Wajin people,” he noted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve tried to mimic that quality in the game, leaning into areas of wilderness between homesteads.” This rugged wilderness will provide a backdrop for protagonist Atsu’s quest to take revenge on those who killed her family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fox and the team also went to the Nibutani Ainu Museum with their Ainu cultural adviser. Traditional Ainu houses (called <a href="https://daisetsu-kamikawa-ainu.jp/en/story/chise/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>cise</u></a>) differ from traditional Japanese houses. The museum trip “really helped us get a sense for sorts of objects we’d see in the game and how they were used.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We can get a glimpse of the inside of an Ainu house, with its large central hearth, in Ghost of Yotei’s official release date trailer (around the 2-minute mark). The woman protagonist Atsu is talking to in this scene seems to be Ainu, as she has a lip tattoo. This symbol of beauty for the Ainu would later be cracked down on by the Japanese government in the late 1800s, after it had fully annexed Hokkaido (source: <a href="https://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/SeasonCulture/event/2020/202001/16_Daiwa_MeaningofTattoos.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Embassy of Japan in the UK</u></a>). By then, measures to force Ainu to abandon their language and culture and integrate into Japanese society were in full swing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(As a side note, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_33/August_1888/Ainu_Houses_and_their_Furnishing" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>J.K Goodrich’s 1888 account </u></a>of Ainu houses paints a first-hand picture of the contrast, and complicated relations between the Ainu and Japanese at this time.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ghost of Yōtei Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fox also touched on the time that the Ghost of Yotei team spent learning about Edo period Japan, which took them to Nikko Toshogu, one of the shrines in Japan dedicated to the unifying shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, who kickstarted the Edo period. “While there we obtained a blessing for the game from the enshrined deity, Tokugawa Ieyasu,” Fox explained, adding that they proudly display the ema (wooden plaque) and omamori (protective charm) that they obtained from Nikko Toshogu at the studio as reminders of their trip.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on the research trip, Fox explained that “while our version of Hokkaido is fictional, the feeling of authenticity we strive to create has roots in those real world experiences.” It will be interesting to see how Ghost of Yotei portrays the contrast between the Wajin/Edo culture, and that of the Ainu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

                <p>The Switch 2 hasn't even been out for a month yet, but Nintendo is already taking strong measures to make sure pirates can't use the company's new console. Switch 2 owners are sharing stories online that their systems have been banned after using a third-party cartridge that some players have reportedly used for illegal ROMs.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688483/nintendo-switch-2-ban-error-code-mig-flash-cartridge-online" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Nintendo has been targeting systems that have used a MIG Switch cartridge, which can store ROMs that were either illicitly obtained or downloaded from players' personal libraries. Nintendo doesn't appear to have drawn a distinction about how the ROMs ended up in players' hands. If Nintendo detects the MIG Switch, the consoles in question are banned from going online forever.</p><p>The YouTube channel Scattered Brain shared its own report about the issue, and notes that even restoring the Switch 2 to factory settings can't undo the ban. Nintendo considers using the MIG Switch cartridge a violation of the Switch 2 End User License Agreement, and the penalty is a pricey lesson for anyone who doesn't heed the warning.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExgYTA18_vo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ExgYTA18_vo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In retrospect, these measures shouldn't be too surprising considering that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">Nintendo went to great lengths to find an alleged Switch pirate</a> last year who the company accused of selling hardware hacks and offering modified Switch consoles with pirated games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blood-message-is-a-stunning-single-player-action-adventure-game-from-naraka-bladepoint-developers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, 24 Entertainment (the studio behind the successful free-to-play Battle Royale game <a href="https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NARAKA: BLADEPOINT</a>) and NetEase Games announced Blood Message, a single player story-driven action/adventure game, with a stunning trailer. Zhipeng Hu, Lead Producer and NetEase Executive Vice President, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are ushering players into a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message. As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for players around the world.</em></p>
<p>The game is set during the final years of the Tang dynasty. As a mere messenger who joined the Dunhuang uprising, players must traverse a treacherous 1,000-mile journey back to Chang'an, the heart of the Tang empire. They must cross lethal landscapes, including desolate deserts and the vast wilderness of East and Central Asia, to survive brutal sieges, unforgiving terrain and overwhelming odds.</p>
<p>The game invites players to step into the shoes of unsung heroes — not emperors or generals, but ordinary people driven by extraordinary resolve. As part of a righteous uprising in Shazhou, Dunhuang, a father and son must navigate a crumbling world, torn between their duty to their country and their love for their family. 24 Entertainment reckons that the world has heard enough stories of emperors and generals, which is why Blood Message is different. The studio also described the game as linear and narrative-driven, not to mention anchored in cinematic storytelling.</p>
<p>Players can look forward to visceral, realistic combat blending stealth and survival mechanics. It will be, according to the developers, a deeply emotional journey exploring themes of family, honor, sacrifice, and cultural identity. Throughout Blood Message, players will traverse expansive landscapes inspired by the diverse terrains of East and Central Asia, such as Dunhuang.</p>

<p>The game is being developed for PC and consoles, powered by Unreal Engine 5 and enhanced with proprietary technologies crafted by 24 Entertainment. There is no release window yet.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lies-of-p-has-sold-over-3-million-units.1223658/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-has-sold-over-3-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>South Korean developer NEOWIZ has <a href="https://x.com/Liesofp/status/1935850080948699629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the Soulslike game Lies of P has surpassed 3 million copies sold globally.</p>
<p>It had been a while since we got a sales update. The only official one was <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> in October 2023, when NEOWIZ revealed that the game had sold over one million units in less than one month.</p>
<p>Of course, when interpreting Lies of P sales figures, we also have to consider that the game was available on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service from day one. As such, many more gamers will have actually played it. Furthermore, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a rumor</a>, the game might be in development for the Nintendo Switch 2. If that's the case, sales could get even higher.</p>
<p>Lies of P recently launched its Overture DLC, which received the same score (8/10) as the base game in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>. Here's a quote from the article:</p>
<p><em>At the end of the day, Lies of P: Overture is an expansion in the true sense of the word. Opting to deliver more of the same, Round8 Studio plays to the game’s strengths, offering an experience every bit as enjoyable as the base game, even with some unfair difficulty that will likely get toned down in time. As such, the DLC is a worthy purchase for those who loved the original and still want more. Those who feel they’ve had their fill or struggled with the game’s quirks the first time around won’t find much to change their minds here, however. For better or worse, it’s more Lies of P.</em></p>
<p>Looking ahead, a Lies of P sequel is all but inevitable considering these sales. NEOWIZ isn't putting all its eggs in one basket, though; we know they have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for a sci-fi horror game project, and they've also signed publishing deals with several developers, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-studio-will-publish-an-upcoming-noir-western-rpg-from-ex-cdpr-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZAKAZANE</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WolfEye Studios</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-will-publish-the-detective-adventure-game-kill-the-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadowlight</a>.</p>

<p>Before anyone suggests it's a photoshop, the fine folks at VGC have actually seen it with their very own eyes. The same outlet notes how there is a similar "out now" ad for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> alongside it, but the Metroid banner appears to be jumping the gun here.</p>

<p>One theory is this could simply be a template and someone forgot to remove the "out now part" on the Metroid ad. The entire tunnel is also covered in other banners featuring the Switch 2's game library, which further suggests this is <em>probably</em> a slip up.</p><p><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Nintendo did shadow drop <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> on the Switch in 2023, but given the build up to the fourth major outing and the recent Switch 2 confirmation, this type of release seems far less likely in this case.

<p>For now, Metroid Prime 4 is currently locked in for a <strong>2025</strong> launch. The Switch 2 version will include enhanced resolution and frame rate as well as additional features like Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>

<p>As for the GEX Trilogy, Limited Run is currently working on making this game compatible with the Switch 2 and will provide an update</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since we do not have clarity on when GEX Trilogy on Switch 2 will be fixed in firmware, we submitted our own patch last week to correct the issue. Due to the Juneteenth holiday, patch approval this week is delayed, but we expect to be able to issue the patch early next week!</p>
<p>"In the meantime, we have asked Nintendo to remove the game from the Switch 2 eShop. Thank you for your patience as we work with Nintendo to resolve these issues!"</p>

<figure><a title="Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8bbf56f765b4d/super-smash-bros-ultimate.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo yesterday rolled out a new update for the Switch 2 which also included some backwards compatibility fixes for select Switch titles.</p>
<p>One of these happens to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and an issue with the Mii Fighter. Thankfully, in the latest system firmware update, the problem has been fixed (<em>thanks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/Polley001" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Life user 'Polley001'</a> for the heads up</em>).</p>
<p>Nintendo has shared the following information on the game's eShop page about this:</p>
<h3>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Compatibility</h3>
<p>Supported - Game progressions may be affected in portions of the game.</p><p><figure data-videoid="FHjNdrGk2jw" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4052a3lqgwrt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHjNdrGk2jw">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><strong>Updated 06/19/2025</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fixed:</strong> When playing online, when a Nintendo Switch 2 player and Nintendo Switch player were matched and someone was using Mii Fighter, it was possible for the match to end immediately.</p>
<p>When creating or editing and saving a Mii Fighter, the thumbnail image showing the Mii Fighter may not appear correctly. This may be improved by saving it again. This is planned to be fixed in the near future.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, online match issues with Mii Fighters should be resolved. Apart from this, Nintendo says it's also resolved a problem with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a>. As documented in its backwards compatibility PDF, "the frame rate goes to 30 frames per second during football matches in Play Globally (the speed does not change).</p>
<p>According to the title's eShop page, this has now been updated:</p>
<h3>Nintendo Switch Sports - Nintendo Switch 2 Compatibility</h3>
<p>Supported - Game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><strong>Updated: 06/19/2025</strong></p>
<p>Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update.</p>
<hr>
<p>Again, both of these titles were already flagged on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/?srsltid=AfmBOor8Tut3SZbnGbzhkc8DvoSvTHxmahk-PbAEP5aDct6q2TKARuOK">backwards compatibility page</a> and were scheduled to be fixed. Nintendo also released game updates for certain other titles yesterday to resolve some backwards compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Along with these first-party game fixes, multiple third-party experiences have been improved thanks to the latest system update. "Previously identified issues have been resolved" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/IceClimbers" rel="nofollow">IceClimbers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/siavm" rel="nofollow">siavm</a>). We tried out an online match of the second fighting collection and it appears to be working on the new hardware.</p>
<p>Some other issues in games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_n_sane_trilogy">Crash Bandicoot N.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/en-publishings-level-up-pets-sidekicks-ttrpg-supplements-brings-enhanced-companions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EN Publishing has announced a new <em>Level-Up</em> supplement for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. The new supplement, <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em>, brings more complex rules and mechanics to both animal companions and support NPCs. It is coming to Kickstarter later this summer.</p>

<h2>The <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em> expands on the heroic companion rules first introduced in Level-Up Monstrous Menagerie II. The supplement will contain new rules for companions alongside new player options. The supplement's contents are compatible with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-updated-dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-at-end-of-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em></a>, and EN's own <em>Level-Up Advanced Fifth Edition</em> system.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/level-up-pets-sidekicks-girl-and-unicorn.jpg?itok=s7OdthpQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/level-up-pets-sidekicks-girl-and-unicorn.jpg?itok=rYYWC09u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One major selling point of the book is advanced pet options. Has your adventuring party adopted a creature for a pet and been underwhelmed by what it can do? This book includes ways they can track, herd, or guard the party. Additionally, the pet can earn heroic features as it levels up. This can be a tougher hide to help them in fights, or some spellcasting abilities.</p>

<p>As for companion NPCs, <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em> will include new rules for recruiting them. Alternatively, the book includes rules for recurring monsters and villain NPCs. Threats that grow powerful in parallel to your party whenever they pop up. Essentially, it's a villainous take on the rival party idea from the <em>D&amp;D</em> module, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-call-of-netherdeep-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep</em></a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, the player options continue the focus of pets. This includes new player backgrounds, such as Beast Friend, and feats like Bonded Companion and Ringleader. There are new companion-themed equipment like the collar of disguise or the saddle of recall. There are even new rules for evolving wildshapes, giving Druids even more options as they continue their career.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em> will go live this July. Physical copies of the book are expected to ship next January.</p>

        <p><em>Blood Message</em> introduces a forgotten odyssey of loyalty and survival where players join Dunhuang’s uprising, taking control of a nameless messenger and his young son in this immersive third-person action-adventure. Caught in the crossfire of a righteous uprising and driven by loyalty to both family and country, players will embark on a perilous eastward journey to deliver a message that holds the fate of their war-torn homeland. Amidst the shifting sands of history, they will etch a final tale of loyalty.</p><p>Set during the final years of the Tang Dynasty, players will traverse a treacherous 3,000-li (around 1,000 miles) odyssey back to Chang’an, the heart of the Tang Empire. Cross lethal landscapes including desolate deserts and the vast wilderness of East and Central Asia to survive brutal sieges, unforgiving terrain, and overwhelming odds. The game’s setting in the last years of the Tang Dynasty provides a cultural landmark of Chinese history that frames the story with customs, culture, and rich history of the era.</p><p>How can countless ordinary people—smaller than dust—leave a mark on history? The <em>Blood Message</em> development team offers this answer: The remembrance and praise of future generations become their eternal monument.</p><p>The game invites players to step into the shoes of unsung heroes—not emperors or generals—but ordinary people driven by extraordinary resolve. As part of a righteous uprising in Shazhou, Dunhuang, the father and son must navigate a collapsing world, torn between duty to country and love for family. When history forgets, warriors remember. The world has heard too many stories of emperors and generals—<em>Blood Message</em> is an ode to the unsung heroes.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Narrative-driven gameplay anchored in cinematic storytelling.</li><li>Visceral, realistic combat blending <a title="Genres > Stealth [90 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> and survival mechanics.</li><li>A deeply emotional journey exploring themes of family, honor, sacrifice, and cultural identity.</li><li>Expansive landscapes inspired by the diverse terrains of East and Central Asia, such as Dunhuang (敦煌).</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

You can enjoy ten whole minutes of this upcoming release.</p>

<p>Nintendo hasn't said if it will be making this demo, or anything similar, available on the Switch 2 eShop, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if you don't have access to one of these kiosks, there's not long to go now – with the full release of Donkey Kong Bananza scheduled to land next month on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>. Nintendo is also releasing a new DK and Pauline amiibo on the same date.</p>

            <p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - the sequel to developer Level 5's 2012 Nintendo DS life sim and RPG <em>thing</em> - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-studio-announces-free-dlc-as-the-slow-life-rpg-sequel-gets-off-to-a-flying-start">getting a bunch of free DLC</a>, which we already knew. What we weren't previously aware of, however, is that its DLC will include an open-world roguelike mode.
</p>
<p>
It's not entirely clear <em>why</em> a relatively laidback, job-focused life sim RPG would want to get in on the roguelike action, but that's what Level 5 is going for. As <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250619/">detailed in its announcement blog</a>, the update - which is currently "actively underway" - will feature an "evolved version of Ginormosia, including a system blending roguelike and open-world elements".
</p>
<p>
Level 5's announcement stops short of explaining how the new mode will actually work, but it does say the update will include "engaging content for both experienced players and newcomers alike." Additionally, the update promises "powerful new gear", plus "stylish equipment, mounts, and a variety of unusual items." A telephone made of butts immediately springs to mind, but I suspect I'm likely to be disappointed.

<p>
And we're not quite done yet. Fantasy Life i's free DLC update will also include a brand-new character who'll "leave a significant mark on the world", plus new hairstyles and new emotes to "make it even more enjoyable for players to express themselves in-game". As for when all this will show up, Level 5 says "as soon as possible".
</p>
<p>
"Level 5 appreciates everyone's continued support and remains committed to continuously refining Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time," it concludes in its announcement post, "as well as expanding content to provide the best possible gaming experience."
</p>
<p>
Why all this free DLC? That'll be down to Fantasy Life i's impressive sales, with the game having already shifted 1m copies since its release at the end of May. Level 5 is also celebrating the milestone with a "commemorative gift code" that'll unlock an "exclusive piece of equipment", plus a "commemorative Pegasus mount" - although its post profusely apologises for mistakenly giving players on certain platforms a unicorn instead. That error should now be fixed, alas.
</p>
<p>
And if you'd like to bump that sales number up to 1m and one, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, Switch, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>.

            <p>
You would think that being able to take on 14 different jobs would be enough to keep most people busy in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, but to Level-5 it seems like that won't be enough. Last month, the developer announced that because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has done so well, they'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/level-5-are-so-pleased-with-how-fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-is-doing-theyre-giving-away-a-free-bit-of-dlc">releasing a free update/ bit of DLC called Update the World</a>, and they've now offered a couple of details as to what that'll be.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Apparently, it'll be a "roguelike open world" mode, which mostly just sounds like a bit of an awkward translation, but the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250619/">post</a> detailing the mode did explain it a touch at least: "The update will feature an evolved version of Ginormosia, including a system blending roguelike and open-world elements that offers engaging content for both experienced players and newcomers alike." So, kind of what it says on the tin honestly. No details were shared as to how the mode will work, but there will be some new gear, equipment, mounts, hairstyles, emotes, and "unusual items".
</p>
<p>
A bit of character art featuring an evil, wizardy looking big dog creature with a mysterious set of cases attached to their back was also shown off. This new character will arrive with the update, and "plays a pivotal role in the story and is set to leave a significant mark on the world." Kind of love Level-5 just dropping a PNG of some guy almost completely contextlessly.
</p>
<p>
The team is apparently "actively working" on all this new stuff, but there's no release date in sight for it just yet. Considering how big that game is though, I'm sure you've got more than enough to be getting on with in the meantime.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Every Switch 2 Launch Game</p>

<p>Circana executive director Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrxzlxpmlk2t" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on Bluesky</a> that "Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 reached just shy of 40%," which is almost double what third-party games did at the launch of the Switch 1. The Game Business did point out that improvement over the performance of third-party games on the original Switch, but also explains that "it's hard to describe these statistics as positive." That's understandable, considering the Switch 2 has had one of the most successful console launches of all time, yet an anonymous publisher is claiming that even its lowest estimates overestimated how well third-party games would do on Switch 2.</p><p>The release of this information has caused discussions over the negative impact of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">Game-Key Cards</a>, which are physical game cartridges that don't contain a game's full data and still require a download. Kelsey Lewin, owner of Seattle game retailer Pink Gorilla Games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kelslewin.bsky.social/post/3lrxrv3h7h222" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on Bluesky</a> that Game-Key Card sales have flagged. "We had very low expectations carrying these in-store but can anecdotally confirm: no one is buying these," Lewin wrote</p><p>Niko Partners director of research and insights Daniel Ahmad is less bullish on the idea that Game-Key Cards had a negative impact on third-party Switch 2 sales. "I hate to break it to people, but the 'I refuse to buy a game for my Nintendo Switch 2 if the physical version is not on the cart' crowd are both a minority today and will be an even smaller minority in five years," he <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1935721809657127138" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on X</a>.</p><p>While the third-party numbers on Switch 2 aren't very promising thus far, we'll see how these games perform in the coming months and years as more brand-new games come to the platform.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">got off to a flying start</a>, with Nintendo proudly trumpeting the console as its "fastest-selling hardware ever" just days after launch. But while things are looking rosy for Nintendo, a new report suggests third-party titles have so far struggled, with one third-party publisher saying sales have been "below our lowest estimates".
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch">according to TheGameBusiness' Chris Dring</a>, who collated some pertinent sales figures surrounding Switch 2's launch in his latest newsletter. The key numbers are that 48 percent of physical game sales in the UK (and 62 percent of physical game sales in the US) were first-party titles, if Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle is excluded; but if it's <em>not</em>, 86 percent of Switch 2 physical game sales in the UK were for first-party titles. Nintendo, for context, had three titles available physically at launch: Mario Kart World, plus Switch 2 editions of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>; third-parties released a total of 13 physical games.
</p>
<p>
Dring notes Switch 2's figures are an improvement compared to the original Switch's launch, where 89 percent of UK physical sales were from first-party games, but adds that "most third-party Switch 2 games posted very low numbers", despite the availability of some big names, including Civilization 7, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, Street Fighter, and Hogwarts Legacy (the report's source, NielsenIQ, does not publicly release video game sales data).

<p>
Speaking to TheGameBusiness, one unnamed third-party publisher painted a bleak picture of its Switch 2 launch sales, saying they'd been "below our lowest estimates". However, not every third-party release has struggled. Dring says CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 was the "best-selling third-party game during the launch of Switch 2", and did "reasonable numbers".
</p>
<p>
Dring highlights the fact CD Projekt was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">one of the few publishers not to opt for Nintendo's controversial Game Key Cards</a>, which require full downloads to play, and quotes CD Projekt's Jan Rosner as having previously said, "Do not underestimate the physical edition. It's not going anywhere and Nintendo players are very appreciative of physical editions that are done right."
</p>
<p>
As to <em>why</em> most third-parties have got off to a slow start on Switch 2, Dring suggests a number of reasons in his analysis; there's the console's enhanced backward compatibility, for starters, meaning many players (we've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-scarlet-violet-pokemon-love">some of them here</a>) are likely also delving into the original Switch's impressive back catalogue right now. That's alongside a lack of reviews covering third-party games given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtual-boy-switch-2-review">Nintendo's decision not to provide early consoles to press</a>, and it's hard to ignore the fact almost all third-party Switch 2 titles are ports of older games, which many core players have likely already experienced elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Despite all this, Dring says many major publishers have told him Nintendo is "actively trying to push third-party games this time around", so the hope will obviously be that sales pick up once players have had their fill of Mario Kart World. Notable confirmed third-party titles still to release include EA Sports Madden 26 and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, while Nintendo's big hitters include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-musical-twist-revealed-plus-dk-rap-is-included">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and Pokémon Legends: Z-A, plus Switch 2 editions of Super Mario Party Jamboree and Kirby and the Forgotten Land.
