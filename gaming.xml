<p data-characters="342" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Traveling around in <em>Soulmask</em> can be a bit tedious with how big the world is. Thankfully, you have the option of getting around quicker by taming and mounting an Alpaca. This <em>Soulmask</em> Alpaca guide has everything you need to know about the cute creatures including where to find them, how to tame and breed them, and how to mount and ride them.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-alpacas" data-injectable="false">Where to find Alpacas</h2> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">While you can technically find wild Alpacas roaming around throughout most of the game world, there are also a few specific locations where you can find them. The usually guaranteed spawn locations are on the premises of various NPC tribes that have built up around the world. Here are a few locations where you are guaranteed to find an Alpaca in <em>Soulmask</em>:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li>Claw Tribe Barbarian Barrack (center of map)</li> <li>Just north of Flint Tribe Barbarian Barrack (south of Mysterious Portal)</li> <li>Wild Alpacas roaming all over the southeastern continent</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-how-to-tame-an-alpaca" data-injectable="false">How to tame an Alpaca</h2> <p data-characters="578" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true">If you are at one of the Barbarian Barracks, you will find a grown Alpaca and its babies inside a wooden fenced area with straw on the ground. I recommend clearing out the area from enemies, so they don’t end up attacking you when trying to leave with their Alpaca. Melee down one of the sides of the fences and head into the Alpaca Pen and approach one of the babies. Hold the ‘E’ key to pick up the Alpaca, and then quickly escape the area! I know it may seem a bit cruel to separate the baby from its mother, but this is the only way you can tame an Alpaca!</p>
 <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="96" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve picked it up, head back to your camp to begin breeding and growing the Alpaca.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-breed-alpaca" data-injectable="false">How to breed Alpaca</h2> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">Now that you have an Alpaca, safely secure it at your base and you can begin the process of growing the baby up to full size. Alpaca’s in particular have a slow growth time, but it’s worth it for their mount capabilities.</p> <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">You will need to feed the Alpaca one of the following foods in order to get it to start growing:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false"> <li>Alpaca Feed</li> <li>Banana</li> <li>Corn</li> <li>Peanut</li> <li>Pineapple</li> <li>Potato</li> <li>Quinoa</li> <li>Refined Alpaca Feed</li> <li>Thatch</li> </ul> <p data-characters="119" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">As long as the Alpaca is fed, it will slowly continue to grow until it is an Adault and capable of becoming your mount!</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-mount-and-ride-an-alpaca" data-injectable="false">How to mount and ride an Alpaca</h2> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">With a fully grown Alpaca, it’s finally time to make it your mount. In order to mount the Alpaca you will need to craft an Alpaca Saddle. The Alpaca Saddle can be crafted at an Armor Forging Table and requires the following materials to craft:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false"> <li>10x Coarse Cotton</li> <li>15x Leather</li> <li>10x Leather Rope</li> </ul> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="false">Once you begin the craft it will only take 8 seconds to complete. After it crafts, equip it on your adult Alpaca and you’ll now be able to mount it by approaching it and holding the ‘E’ key!</p>

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The life of a modern working artist can be rough. The splintering of social media platforms has made it increasingly hard to gain exposure and find work, and as more greedy companies make use of the tech, AI is coming directly for their jobs.</p><p>Having taken body blow after body blow for the last two years, though, artists are not going to just sit there and take it.<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2024/05/23/artist-and-activist-karla-ortiz-on-the-battle-to-preserve-humanity-in-art/?sh=65d896e74389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> While some of them fight a major lawsuit against the biggest AI platforms and tech companies on the planet</a>, the last week has seen an unprecedented exodus of artists from platforms like Facebook, Instagram and ArtStation--all of which are accepting of, if not actively pushing, machine-generated imagery--as they flock to join Cara, a new site that is promising to do things (slightly) differently.</p><p>When I say the move is unprecedented, I don't just mean in terms of volume (its iOS app outperformed Twitter, Discord and Reddit last week). I also mean in terms of <em>speed</em>:<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> As tech's rot economy sets in</a>, it's taken upstart rivals like BlueSky months to make a dent in Twitter's userbase. In Cara's case, it took less than a week, as the site went from 100,000 users on June 1 to 700,000 on <em>June 6</em>.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone, sorry for the absence—we hit 300k users on Cara!!!!!! 🥹🤯🥳</p><p>We made it to top 5 in App Store for social networks in the US—passing Twitter, Discord, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Messenger! Unfortunately this traffic spike has caused the site to crash like crazy &amp;— 1/ <a href="https://t.co/xsgB9pewwf">pic.twitter.com/xsgB9pewwf</a></p></div>— Jingna Zhang @ cara.app/zemotion (@zemotion) <a href="https://twitter.com/zemotion/status/1797464152690315460?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>While Cara has actually been open for over a year now, and has had some high-profile artists residing there the whole time, things reached a collective boiling point last week when news of a recent change to Meta's privacy policy started circulating among artists. I can't pin down who exactly was the first pebble to start the avalanche, but from Thursday, May 30, through the weekend, nearly every artist I follow on social media--and that's a <em>lot</em>--started posting links to their Cara portfolio, and in many cases following up by saying they were deleting their presence on many of their other sites (especially Facebook and Instagram) as they went.</p><p>Those privacy policy changes implemented by Meta--the parent company of both Facebook and Instagram, sites where most artists maintain some kind of portfolio presence--included refreshed guidelines on how the platforms would be making use of machine-learning. As<a href="https://www.dacs.org.uk/news-events/what-artists-and-their-beneficiaries-need-to-know-about-metas-new-privacy-policy#:~:text=The%20reason%20this%20new%20policy,successfully%20object%20to%20the%20use." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DACS summarised last week</a>:</p><blockquote><p>For many visual artists and creators Instagram is a key social media channel to help people engage with their works. The reason this new policy change is particularly concerning is that any images and creative works shared on Meta's platforms (Instagram or Facebook) can be used by Meta to develop AI models unless you can successfully object to the use. Given the apparent effort involved in doing this, many users may find the content they post to Instagram and Facebook used by Meta to develop AI models without their explicit consent.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>No thanks! It's little wonder that so many have moved so quickly to Cara, a platform that has been established specifically to cater to artists wanting to get away from AI-friendly megacorps.</p><p>"I first opened an account on Friday May 31st, which is around the time most everyone in my art community seemed to catch on to Cara's existence",<a href="https://www.isaacorloff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> artist Isaac Orloff</a> tells me. "I was motivated to create an account because I, like many others, have become increasingly dismayed with the experience of social media when it pertains to being an artist or a creative. The rise of art theft masquerading as artificial intelligence has become unavoidable on all of our social media platforms."</p><p>Even longtime Cara members like Kim Hu (<a href="https://aftermath.site/taskmaster-fan-art-marvel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who we featured a little while back</a>) are blown away by the flood of new users. "I joined up as one of the first members, as at the time I was tired of Artstation’s pivot to allowing AI to flood in with no guardrails", she says. "It was a quiet and cozy community from then on, until it suddenly began to blow up seemingly out of nowhere! It’s still a little wild to have witnessed last week’s growth spurt, but I welcome how active and buzzing it is now."</p><p>Founded by Jingna Zhang--an artist who<a href="https://petapixel.com/2024/05/13/court-rules-in-favor-of-photographer-who-accused-painter-of-ripping-off-her-work/#:~:text=A%20court%20in%20Luxembourg%20has,in%202022%20that%20favored%20Dieschburg." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> not only recently won a very high profile copyright case</a>, but is<a href="https://www.zhangjingna.com/blog/class-action-lawsuit-artists-v-stability-deviantart-midjourney-runway-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> also involved in the big AI lawsuit against Stability AI, Midjourney and Deviantart</a>--Cara bills itself as "a social media and portfolio platform for artists",<a href="https://blog.cara.app/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> saying on its website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>When AI art’s popularity exploded in late 2022, many art platforms turned away from the pleas of their users when it came to moderating AI-generated images, and while generative AI can be a powerful tool, we cannot ignore that AI companies are using datasets trained on copyrighted work and private personal data without our consent.</p><p>We understand that platforms may not have the power to solve the unethical and legal issues surrounding such datasets alone, but we believe that at the very least, they should to show solidarity and respect for artists and their communities in such times.</p><p>We felt that if no platform is interested in doing that, then we should build a platform for ourselves, one where the human factor is respected and prioritized.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It's important to note a few things here. Firstly, Cara isn't explicitly anti-AI as a <em>concept</em>; while the site says "We do not agree with generative AI tools in their current unethical form, and we won’t host AI-generated portfolios unless the rampant ethical and data privacy issues around datasets are resolved via regulation", there is acknowledgement that in some capacity AI tools are likely here to stay, and so the site will allow filtering of such content "In the event that legislation is passed to clearly protect artists".</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Curious about <a href="https://t.co/bIBAmGiZdX">https://t.co/bIBAmGiZdX</a>? We're a platform with portfolio AND social feed. We have an AI detector that filters out AI images, custom home feed you can control, and custom crop tool for image thumbnails! ✨ Here's a thread on how it works:👇🧵 <a href="https://t.co/sTDYTuym5Z">pic.twitter.com/sTDYTuym5Z</a></p>— Cara: Art &amp; Social (@Cara_HQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cara_HQ/status/1646225873585205248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>And secondly, it's not <em>really </em>a social media site. While it's Meta's policy changes that appear to have broken most people, Cara is much closer in design to a platform like ArtStation--a portfolio space where artists can post images, gifs and videos of their work--than a social media network, where algorithms and communication are given higher priority (though it does have a "social feed" system built into it).</p><p>Artbook publisher Spiridon Giannakis says, "I understand the fatigue about investing time into yet another platform that is maybe not going anywhere, but there is an important thing to keep in mind, and take it from someone who has given his everything multiple times to make people come together in one way or another: You don't get to complain about something if you don't try to make a difference in what bothers you, no matter how big of a deal you probably are. I think Cara has real potential and even if I am wrong, at least I will not just write it off because it has become somehow inconvenient to communicate [on yet another platform]."</p><p>While closest in design to a site like ArtStation, it's not quite identical, either; a key feature of Cara is that every image uploaded to it is first run through Glaze,<a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-art-images-theft-midjourney-stable-diffusion-glaze-1850235184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> software first released last year</a> that (as I wrote at the time) helps protect an image from being scraped by AI platforms by:</p><blockquote><p>...adding a second, almost invisible layer on top of a piece of art. What makes the whole thing so interesting is that this isn’t a layer made of noise, or random shapes. It also contains a piece of art, one that’s roughly of the same composition, but in a&nbsp;<em>totally&nbsp;</em>different style. You won’t even notice it’s there, but any machine learning platform trying to lift it will, and when it tries to study the art it’ll get&nbsp;<em>very&nbsp;</em>confused.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Social media site or not, a lot of folks are deleting their Facebook and Instagram accounts regardless (or have at least pledges to stop uploading art there), and having jumped by 600,000 users in five days (<a href="https://cara.app/explore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I should point out that in addition to being an app, Cara is also usable as a regular website</a>, one that is <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/cara.app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently calling for reader support in the wake of rapidly escalating running costs</a>) it's clear a lot of fans are already using it just to keep tabs on their favourite artists.</p><p>"My plan if all goes well, is that I’ll be using Cara and my own personal website as the only places I’ll upload my artwork",<a href="https://www.karlaortizart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Karla Ortiz</a>, another participant in the big anti-AI lawsuit, tells me. "For every other site I’ll either share links or screenshots, properly Glazed of course. I’m not saying goodbye to other social media sites just yet, and will still share my thoughts in those sites too. I’m just becoming more protective of my artwork, and no longer comfortable sharing it on websites that ridiculously claim they 'own' my work and use that claim to train their own AI models.”</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh okay I get it now, Cara is actually the art platform I've been wanting for years. You can treat it like here but it also has a portfolio component(which you can reorder whenever!) This feels kinda huge for our fractured community of artists. <a href="https://t.co/K0i99ny9RE">pic.twitter.com/K0i99ny9RE</a></p>— RJ Palmer (@arvalis) <a href="https://twitter.com/arvalis/status/1798003603636130192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>"If you asked me 10 years ago if I thought I'd ever not use Facebook I wouldn't have believed it, but now I don't use Facebook at all", Orloff says. "It was never a conscious choice to step away but eventually I realized all of the content I was consuming was from people I hardly knew, and it became not worth the time. The rise of political discourse also completely ruined the experience. The goal is to hopefully end up with less websites to have to manage, and have the ones we do frequent provide us with the experience we are looking for, and not what we are forced to endure."</p><p>I don't want to make this all sound like an advertisement for Cara; for me, the story here is how, by showing even a modicum of respect for artist, a platform can explode in a matter of <em>days</em>, as clear an indicator as any of just how bad things are right now on the existing social media behemoths. And it's always foolish, maybe even dangerous, to paint a platform as some kind of "saviour"; remember, ArtStation was once a plucky upstart rising from the ashes of CGHub's demise, and now finds itself living long enough to become a villain.</p><p>But, low bar or not, a website saying that it has "solidarity and respect for artists and their communities" means a lot in 2024, when so many others, from social media juggernauts like Meta to portfolio sites like ArtStation and<a href="https://aftermath.site/deviantart-ai-scam-bots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DeviantArt</a>--can't hide their disdain for the average user, their work and their experience.</p><p>"For me the MOST important thing is that this is a platform that won’t scrape my artwork to train generative AI models against my wishes", Ortiz says. "That security and philosophy is huge for me. But I do hope Cara remains a human-centered platform even in a very far off hypothetical future where AI is ethical and non-exploitative. There is something truly wonderful about knowing what you’re overall looking at isn’t AI, it’s human made. Personally, I think we all desperately need that awe and wonder of actual human creativity back in our lives."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Disney has hinted that the KOTOR era, which takes place thousands of years before the original movie, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-old-republic-james-mangold-movies">could be a major movie setting in the future</a>, but it has otherwise remainly mostly untouched by the broader franchise.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/kotor-ii-03-1717710904368.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kreia is a fan-favorite KOTOR character who represents its more nuanced take on the Force.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Count The Acolyte showrunner Leslye Headland among those intrigued by the possibilities of KOTOR, which was centered around the conflicts between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Speaking with the <a href="https://www.omelete.com.br/star-wars/the-acolyte-knights-of-the-republic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omelete</a> in an interview translated by IGN, Headland said she was particularly interested in Kreia, one of the major characters from KOTOR 2.</p><p>"I've always wanted to explore a live-action version of the Knights of the Old Republic game and Kreia's character," Headland said. "I think it would be a really interesting story to bring to life."</p><p>In KOTOR 2, Kreia is a blind Force-sensitive who forms a bond with the main character through the Force. In the story, Kreia is the protagonist's mentor, but rejects the divide between the light side and dark side. While Headland doesn't elaborate on how exactly she would realize Kreia's story, she is one of the most popular characters in the KOTOR series. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/14/why-knights-of-the-old-republic-2-tells-my-favourite-star-wars-story">In a 2018 KOTOR 2 retrospective</a> we called Kreia one of the best Star Wars characters, period — a high bar for an adaptation.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-the-acolyte">Headland is focused on The Acolyte</a>, a show set at the end of the High Republic and a little more than 130 years before A New Hope. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-acolyte-review-disney-plus">We wrote in our review</a>, "The Acolyte takes us to an earlier era of Star Wars than we’ve seen on screen, with mixed results. Awkward dialogue and a small scope rob it of some of the series’ signature space magic, but these old-school Jedi are a thrill to watch in action."</p><p>While KOTOR has yet to feature in one of Disney's works, the setting remains active thanks to an MMO and other works. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">Saber Interactive's remake also continues to be "alive and well."</a></p><p>As for The Acolyte, its next episode is set to release on Tuesday.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

                <p dir="ltr">Warhammer 40K and Warhammer: Age of Sigmar are some of the coolest fictional settings out there. While both franchises started as tabletop wargames, they've expanded into video games, pen-and-paper RPGs, and more, giving fans of any medium plenty of ways to enjoy these grimdark universes. However, it's the many Warhammer: Age of Sigmar and Warhammer 40K novels where you get the deepest exploration of both settings--but with literal hundreds of official novels out there (of varying degrees of quality and canonicity) finding a way in can be daunting. Luckily, there's a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fstories-from-worlds-warhammer-2024-black-library-books&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-27-warhammer-novels-for-only-18-for-a-limited-time%2F1100-6524007%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Humble Bundle book</a> deal that includes up to 27 Warhammer: Age of Sigmar and Warhammer 40K novels for just $18.</p><p dir="ltr">The Stories From The World of Warhammer 2024 Book Bundle includes new and classic novels from Black Library, the official Warhammer book publisher, and is available in three pricing tiers. The deal starts at $1 for eight books--four set in the 40K universe and four set in the Age of Sigmar fantasy world. The inclusion of notable novels like the fan-favorite Ice Guard by Steve Lyons and Black Legion Book 1: The Talon of Horus by Aaron Dembski-Bowden makes this a great tier for those who want to ease into these universes.</p><p dir="ltr">Pay at least $10 and you unlock the second tier of the bundle, which adds eight more books for a total of 16. But if that's not enough eternal warfare for you, you can get the full 27-book bundle for just $18. That's $277 worth of some of the best Warhammer novels out there. While the $18 option might seem like a lot, one of the included books is Lupercal's War: A Horus Heresy Anthology, which includes over 20 short stories set during one of the most important eras of Warhammer 40K and serves as the perfect introductory point for the millennia-spanning history.

            <p>
Killing Time - the cult classic haunted house FPS originally released for the short-lived 3DO console back in 1995  - is being resurrected and remastered by retro specialists Nightdive Studios, and the developer is teasing that 2002's The Thing is up next.
</p>
<p>
Set in 1930s Maine, Killing Time's spookily comedic action unfolds on the expansive, island-bound estate of a wealthy heiress who disappeared after attempting to use an Ancient Egyptian water clock said to grant eternal life. It's up to players, in the role of an Egyptology student, to fend off the estate's many horrors (ranging from killer clowns to demonic maids and cleaver-wielding chefs), locate the water clock, and end its evil influence.
</p>
<p>
It's a shoot-y, puzzle-y type of journey set across more than 45 seamlessly connected areas incorporating hundreds of rooms - the mansion's ghastly inhabitants often created by turning FMV actors into sprites - and Nightdive's remaster, titled Killing Time: Resurrected, aims to provide a thorough upgrade for the whole ridiculous thing.

<p>
It promises toggleable high-resolution character artwork and sprites, upscaled environmental texturing, smoother gameplay, more responsive controls, plus expanded control and key-bind settings. And, on PC at least, there's support for 4K resolutions and 144 FPS, plus anti-aliasing options, and upgraded 2D screens and menu art.
</p>
<p>
Killing Time: Resurrected doesn't have a release date yet, but it'll be available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch when it eventually shows up. And as for Nightdive's other projects, the studio is currently teasing a remaster of 2002 squad-based survival horror shooter The Thing - based on the classic John Carpenter movie of the same name. That tease <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1798503205028139146">came via social media</a>, along with the promise of a reveal during this Friday's IGN Live.

			<p>Microsoft has revealed the titles they’ll be adding to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> on PC and consoles in early June and it’s a good lineup for fans of retro RPGs and horror games. The Octopath Traveler games, originally only available on PC, PlayStation, and Switch, both arrive on Xbox and Game Pass. Meanwhile, subscribers can also look forward to new-release horror game Still Wakes the Deep and The Callisto Protocol.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFxboxgamepass95.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Here are your <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/06/xbox-game-pass-june-2024-wave-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headliner Game Pass titles for the next couple of weeks</a>:</p>
<p><strong><em>Octopath Traveler II</em></strong><em> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Available today</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Octopath Traveler II plays it safe when it comes to its core gameplay, offering a handful of small positive tweaks that don’t entirely make up for returning problems like clumsy party management and battles that take too long to wrap up. Thankfully, the game also takes a big, confident step forward in terms of writing, offering a cast of well-wrought, interesting characters and a vividly-detailed world you won’t soon forget. Octopath Traveler II may have the same old engine under the hood, but the road trip it takes you on is well worth experiencing.”</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></strong><em> (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – June 18</em></p>
<p><em>“From the award-winning developers at The Chinese Room comes a terrifying tale of isolation. You are trapped on an oil rig in the North Sea, running from an unknowable horror that has come aboard. With no escape and no way to fight back, all you can do is survive.”</em></p>
<p>These games will also be available in early June:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Octopath Traveler</em></strong><em> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Available today</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Depersonalization</em></strong><em> (PC) – June 12</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Isonzo</em></strong><em> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – June 13</em></li>
<li><strong><em>The Callisto Protocol</em></strong><em> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – June 13</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Xbox Game Pass grants players access to more than 100 games for 10 bucks a month, while Xbox Game Pass Ultimate also gets you Xbox Live Gold and EA Play access — you can&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=14.1.5-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fxbox-game-pass-late-march-2020-bleeding-edge%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-CA%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fgames&amp;xguid=01E0WZYEHCXH446AREYQB7E5YF&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=300&amp;xuuid=0fb83aebb5aecf1559f4c6291e20a492&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out a full list of available console and PC games here</a>.&nbsp; You can<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?xr=shellnav#join" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;sign up here</a>.</p>

                <p>Capcom's Monster Hunter games have some of the coolest beasts ever seen, but the tragedy here is that you can't admire them as they tend to get homicidal when you intrude on their domain.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/enshrouded-melodies-of-the-mire-update-travels-the-world-in-band-of-bards/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=enshrouded-melodies-of-the-mire-update-travels-the-world-in-band-of-bards<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="340" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Enshrouded</em> has grown even further this week. Melodies of the Mire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvQNjoc0FkM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is the next update</a> for the open-world multiplayer survival game. And don’t worry: “Melodies” isn’t some meaningless alliteration. The new <em>Enshrouded </em>– Melodies of the Mire update lets you skip through a new biome as a musical bard, if you wish.</p> <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">Obviously, you want to skip through the biome as a musical bard. Who wouldn’t? Thankfully, you won’t even have to do it alone. You can craft instruments, ranging from a lute to a flute, and even a harp. There are multiple instruments, allowing you and a few buddies to traipse through the world as your very own band of bards. Frankly, allowing players to stop and bust out a jingle is something every game should try to implement. You can’t let the pirates of <em>Sea of Thieves</em> have all the fun, right? </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Enshrouded - Melodies of The Mire | Official Update Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CvQNjoc0FkM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-enshrouded-melodies-of-the-mire-update-brings-more-to-explore" data-injectable="false"><em>Enshrouded </em>– Melodies of the Mire update brings more to explore</h2> <p data-characters="576" data-current-count="876" data-injectable="true">Moving away from the melodies, we should cover the “Mire” part of “Melodies of the Mire.” The Blackmire is an expansion of the Revelwoods. This vertical-focused biome lets you bounce high into the trees using jump pads. A new enemy type called the Vukah is already waiting in the branches, however, waiting for a fight. The update comes with new tree and terrain types, along with props and furniture to craft. If you don’t mind having the Vukah as neighbors, the update also lets you <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-is-the-best-place-to-build-your-first-base-in-enshrouded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build a treehouse</a> in the mire. Doesn’t that sound cozy?</p>
 <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false">That’s not all the update brings. You can also check out a new weapon, the Dual-Wielded Daggers, and a vanity system that lets you hide some equipped gear. </p> <figure data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Enshrouded - Melodies of the Mire | Update 2 Highlights" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhLz6WvusZI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
  <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">The <em>Enshrouded </em>community has been clamoring for player-based quest progression, and they finally have it. Melodies of the Mire includes player and world progression, allowing you to complete quests even if someone on the server already did. The change has <a href="https://enshrouded.featureupvote.com/suggestions/525247/allow-for-playerbased-quest-progression-see-dev-comments-in-thread" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 19,000 votes</a> on the <em>Enshrouded </em>feedback page. I’m guessing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/enshrouded-has-sold-a-million-copies-is-just-behind-palworld-on-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of people</a> are going to be happy with the update. </p> <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="false">There are more changes to peruse, so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4176604868930473019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out the update notes</a> before hopping in to start your own band.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/yooka-laylee-returns-with-updated-visuals-as-yooka-replaylee/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=yooka-laylee-returns-with-updated-visuals-as-yooka-replaylee<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="308" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Hey, kids, remember <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-yooka-laylee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yooka-Laylee</a></em>? I can ask that in earnest because Playtonic Games’ 3D collect ’em up platformer is seven years old now, practically a dinosaur in Internet Years. This particular reptile is coming back, bat in tow, with a remastered and enhanced version called <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">The updated version of <em>Yooka-Laylee </em>was revealed during the Guerilla Collective showcase along with a bunch of indie announcements and trailers. The <em>Yooka-Replaylee </em>footage shows some side-by-side looks at the new visual flourishes, which appear to be pretty substantial.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee! | Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrXXbkP5HAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="570" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">Beyond the new look, the team improved some of the games challenges while adding new ones for players to discover. There’s also a new collectible currency thanks to Capital B’s minions dropping their coins all over the place. You can spend this hard-found loot at the sentient vending machine known as Vendi, who hooks Yooka and Laylee up with Tonics in exchange for completing objectives. Other enhancements include a new world map, which helps you track challenges and plan your next moves, and some new tonic flavors for further playstyle customization.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="false">Finally, <em>Yooka-Replaylee </em>sports updates to the controls and camera — making it easier to both position the camera and pull off move combos — as well as a new orchestral arrangement of Grant Kirkhope and David Wise’s original soundtrack. Right now it’s just listed for consoles and PC with no release date in place, but the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448020/YookaReplaylee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> is live with more screens, info, and a brief FAQ.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="300" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s been nearly five years since the launch of <em>Shenmue III</em>. Even though the game’s release after nearly two decades was akin to a miracle, the story isn’t finished. Fans haven’t given up yet, as proven by a <a href="https://x.com/Shenmue_Dojo/status/1798107797244027133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shenmue 4</em> ad</a> that decorated New York’s Times Square this week.</p> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">Die-hard fans from the site <a href="https://shenmuedojo.com/letsgetshenmue4-trending-at-new-yorks-times-square/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shenmue Dojo</a> were behind the short ad, which appeared in Times Square on June 4. The campaign consisted of a 15-second advertisement and getting fans on board with the hashtag #letsgetshenmue4 on X. </p> <figure data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">Do you think Sega noticed? This is admittedly a incredible way to flag the publisher’s attention. Getting one 15-second ad at Times Square starts as low as $40, so it’s not like they had to break the bank. Still, it’s a bold strategy; let’s see if it pays off.</p> <h2 id="h-shenmue-fans-are-still-on-lan-di-s-trail" data-injectable="false"><em>Shenmue </em>fans are still on Lan Di’s trail</h2> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true">The <em>Shenmue </em>saga has been a fascinating one to live through and cover over the years. First released on the Dreamcast in 1999, <em>Shenmue </em>was developer Yu Suzuki’s magnum opus. The <em>Virtua Fighter</em> creator dreamed of an open-world adventure game so personal and unique that he felt it would conceptualize a new genre: FREE, or Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment. </p>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">These days, we’d likely drop <em>Shenmue </em>into the open-world RPG subgenre and call it a day. The game did bring about innovations, though, such as time-based story progression and NPC scheduling — the latter of which some games eventually adopted. </p> <figure data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, <em>Shenmue </em>mostly heralded a headache for Sega. Despite the positive reception, the game was <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/game/2031/shenmue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expensive to make and too niche</a> to meet sales expectations. The series lurched on with <em>Shenmue II</em> in 2001 (2002 on Xbox) but fell off the radar soon after. Suzuki, of course, never gave up. <em>Shenmue III</em> was revealed at the E3 2015 Sony Press Conference, getting a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gDHPIF3N0A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standing ovation</a> and, understandably, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY1p8ZgvqYM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some tears</a>. I was right there with you, Michael.</p>
 <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="false">Five years later, Suzuki and <em>Shenmue </em>fans clearly aren’t giving up on a <em>Shenmue 4</em>. The third game sadly couldn’t shake the ol’ <em>Shenmue </em>curse of being <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shenmue-3-performed-fine-but-isnt-a-mass-market-game-says-publisher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too niche for strong sales</a>, but fan action is what got protagonist Ryo Hazuki moving further in his journey to find those damn sailors. And it probably won’t stop even with a <em>Shenmue 4</em>. Suzuki has said the third game <a href="https://www.vg247.com/yu-suzuki-says-shenmue-3-will-get-us-40-percent-through-ryos-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">represented 40% of the story</a>, so there may be more campaigns ahead. Are we thinking #letsgetshenmue5 someday? </p>

<p data-characters="268" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Hazelight Studios is a developer known for making games that require two players to work together to complete them. Recently, the studio shared a few details about how it created<em> A Way Out</em> on a budget, using the tools and people it had rather than blowing its budget. </p> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-a-way-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Way Out</a></em> is a visually stunning game with incredible scenes similar to those in Naughty Dog’s <em>Uncharted</em> franchise. Surprisingly, the game’s motion capture was done with whatever equipment the studio could find, and all the actors were members of staff who were also working on building the game. This was done because the studio didn’t have the budget for the top-spec motion capture equipment, but it shows just what you can achieve when you work within your means.</p>
 <h2 id="h-a-way-out-s-motion-capture-might-have-been-basic-but-it-shows-how-much-passion-went-into-making-the-game" data-injectable="false"><em>A Way Out</em>‘s motion capture might have been basic, but it shows how much passion went into making the game</h2> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">Hazelight Studios recently posted a behind-the-scenes <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1798387944715108720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video on Twitter</a> detailing how some of the scenes in the game were made using basic motion capture equipment and members of staff from the office. I think it makes the game look even better, considering that we’re used to being shown motion capture warehouses with professional actors playing the roles of every character. </p> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We didn't have the budget to hire actors, so we ended up capturing every single motion in A Way Out ourselves (on whatever mocap system we could get our hands on)… and we had a lot of fun doing it! 🤩</p><p>Stars from the Hazelight team in this short cut:<br>– Josef Fares, Creative… <a href="https://t.co/LkFGze7TBc">pic.twitter.com/LkFGze7TBc</a></p></div>— Hazelight Studios (@HazelightGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/1798387944715108720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">To put this into perspective, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last Of Us</a></em> was released for PS3 in 2013. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH5MgEbBOps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion capture process</a> for that game looks much more sophisticated than what Hazelight Studios is using, but<em> A Way Out</em> looks no worse for the basic setup. </p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">My favorite scenes that the developer has shown in this video include studio founder Joseph Fares leaping into the arms of a co-worker and holding onto them for dear life to capture a parachuting scene with a single parachute between both protagonists and the dog attack where it looks like Fares is about to rip someone’s arm off. </p>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">Seeing a developer wave their arms around in a motion capture suit to replicate someone splashing water in a stream is so playful that it brings me joy, too. In a way, I believe <em>A Way Out</em> must have been even more of a work of passion than many video games because staff not only worked at their desks to bring it to life but got on their feet and literally threw themselves around to bring the ideas in their heads to our screens. </p>
 <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="false"><em>A Way Out </em>is a fairly unique co-op game that can be played online or at home with someone else. Each player controls their own character, but the story sees them interact in interesting ways as they break out of prison and attempt to restart life on the outside. what makes it stand out is the visuals, the set pieces, and the situations these characters find themselves in as they progress, from fighting a group of thugs simultaneously to leaning on each other to climb all the way up a ventilation shaft. </p>

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNzY3MzY3MywiZXhwIjoxNzE4Mjc4NDczLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRU5QQUlEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.yB-HVmx3nZL3rpzfiy_eMucOVRoO4LbwqaSoNNzKNzM">report in Bloomberg</a> describes the development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-everything-we-know">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a> and the issues which may have led to Rocksteady's expensive live service game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-fallen-short-of-expectations-its-publisher-says">flopping at launch</a>. Staff, talking under condition of anonymity, described corporate owners who pushed for a multiplayer game from the studio known for singleplayer experiences, as well as indecisive leadership and a culture of "toxic positivity".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In this instance, "toxic positivity" refers to the seemingly common practice of studio leadership reassuring staff that Suicide Squad "would eventually coalesce at the last minute, just as the Arkham games had." (I suppose they all forgot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/batman-arkham-knight-full-refunds-pc-port">the PC port of Arkham Knight was so bad they had to offer full refunds</a>. Not a lot of coalescing there.)
</p>
<p>Otherwise the story of Suicide Squad's development hits several familiar notes. Warner Bros. executives travelled to London to convince Rocksteady that Suicide Squad should be a live service game, in keeping with prevailing industry trends. Studio co-founder Sefton Hill (who departed the studio in 2022 and declined to comment) seemingly struggled to communicate his changing vision for the game, and allegedly confessed "that he hadn’t spent much time with competing games such as Destiny." Nine months were lost to prototyping "an elaborate system" of customisable vehicles that was ultimately scrapped, because the suppervillain protagonists already had innate methods of travel.
</p>
<p>Although Warner Bros. apparently lost $200 million (around £156 million) in developing Suicide Squad, the silver lining is that there have seemingly been no layoffs at the studio since. Rocksteady are now assisting with the development of a "director's cut" version of Hogwarts Legacy, while "according to people familiar, the studio leaders are looking to pitch a new single-player game, which would return Rocksteady to its roots."
</p>
<p>Hopefully such a singleplayer game comes to pass. Our own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League review</a> called it "a perfectly average open world action game that plops out when a finance department locks a brilliant developer in a room and refuses to let them see sunlight for nine years."</p>

<!-- cache hit 375:single/related:58d5b802ea9f8e7f1cd36c5a3f810512 --><!-- empty -->
<p>A few weeks ago, we called some attention to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/">legal difficulty of passing on your digital Steam game library</a> after you die. While Valve hasn't responded to a request for comment on the matter, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/06/gog-looks-to-out-steam-steam-with-optional-drm-free-galaxy-platform/">PC gaming platform GOG</a> tells Ars that it is ready and willing to help users transfer their accounts in the event of their death.
</p><p>As long as they bring a court order, that is.</p>
<p>"In general, your GOG account and GOG content is not transferable," GOG spokesperson Zuzanna Rybacka tells Ars. "However, if you can obtain a copy of a court order that specifically entitles someone to your GOG personal account, the digital content attached to it, taking into account the EULAs of specific games within it, and that specifically refers to your GOG username or at least email address used to create such an account, we’d do our best to make it happen."</p>
<h2>A legal minefield</h2>
<p>Absent a binding court order, there are a few factors that GOG says make it difficult for them to simply transfer an account at the request of a user (or of that user's last will and testament). At the base is the fact that GOG accounts and content are subject to limited, personal, non-transferable licenses—"This is the standard for digital services and goods," Rybacka points out. In addition, "every game distributed on GOG can be subject to a separate EULA (End User License Agreement) which can separately detail what scope of rights is given to a user of a game," Rybacka said.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there's the matter of even establishing beyond a shadow of a doubt that a certain account belongs to a specific person. "As you may know, GOG does not collect information sufficient to truly identify a particular person (such as name and surname) or their family or marital status," Rybacka said. "For this reason, we are not able to establish that someone is related to a particular user or that a particular user has passed away."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Even a sworn statement from the executor of a user's estate making clear their wishes would not be enough to fully cover the platform legally, GOG said. "As this is a particularly complex and delicate matter, we would need to be provided with a legal basis for the estate executor’s actions that relates specifically to GOG account and that settles that GOG account and possibly content tied to this are part of such estate," GOG said.</p>
<p>GOG told Ars it wants to tread carefully in these situations because it "is a particularly delicate matter with little to no existing legal guidance." Policies surrounding the transfer of digital ownership "[have] not been comprehensively regulated by any specific laws and because of this, we are bound by general law in this regard."</p>
<p>That said, GOG said it is aware of "a few existing court decisions in which some persons were allowed to inherit an online account." That suggests a court order as "a possible option, with our willingness to tackle such situations, in line with our games preservation mission," the platform said.</p>
<p>"We’re willing to handle such a situation and preserve your GOG library—but currently we can only do it with the help of the justice system."</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/goggalaxy.jpg" data-height="720" data-width="1280" alt="All your games, and your next-of-kin's games, too, if you play your cards right..."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/goggalaxy.jpg" data-height="720" data-width="1280">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> All your games, and your next-of-kin's games, too, if you play your cards right...</p><p>GOG</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>While convincing a judge that your dead relative wanted you to have access to their GOG library might not always be the simplest process, a court order at least provides a viable path to getting such an account out of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/">the legal limbo that usually enshrouds&nbsp;your digital goods after death</a>. And it's nice to hear that GOG is proactively interested in helping with this kind of situation, even if it currently needs some strong legal cover to do so.</p>
<p>Separate from handing down the account itself, though, GOG's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/09/first-look-gog-revives-classic-pc-games-for-download-age/">long-standing policy</a> of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/12/drm-free-gaming-distributor-gogcom-trades-convenience-for-safety.ars">offering downloadable games without any DRM protection</a> makes handing down <em>GOG games themselves</em> into a relatively simple matter. "GOG game builds are DRM-free and offline installers are included with each purchase," Rybacka said. "That way, if someone wants to save their offline games on, for example, an external hard drive, they will be preserved regardless of the account ownership."

<p data-characters="207" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Several <em>EA FC 24</em> players claimed that matchmaking isn’t working properly in Ultimate Team Division Rivals, meaning players from the top divisions can match with players who just started the game mode. </p> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false"><em>EA FC 24</em> content creator MattHDGamer <a href="https://x.com/MattHDGamer/status/1798661846461001773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a> other players if they were experiencing “broken” matchmaking. The streamer posted a screenshot from a Division Rivals match with a 22-0 scoreline, indicating that he must have played an opponent ranked several divisions lower. </p> <figure data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false"><em>EA FC 24 News</em> substantiated the claim by <a href="https://x.com/FIFA22_INFO/status/1798664288229302663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posting</a> an image of an opponent using a squad of gold players, with the highest rating being an 89 overall player. Since this title has been out for around eight months, most high-level players in Ultimate Team have an Ultimate Team full of special cards, with some being 95 overall or higher. </p> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="794" data-injectable="true">If you are skilled at <em>EA FC 24</em>, a full gold squad can take down a starting 11 full of special cards. However, for new users just starting in the game mode, getting thrown into the deep end against a Division 1 player could be a rude awakening. For reference, Division Rivals in Ultimate Team divides everyone into 11 different divisions. Earning a higher rank requires winning multiple games in a row, and the competition gets harder each step along the way. </p>
 <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="false">Usually, players face squads in the same division or relatively close to them. With matchmaking potentially broken, this could be an issue as matches could continue to result in unrealistic or unfair outcomes. This could also be a good teaching moment for the community as going up against higher-level opposition forces you to improve. Either way, EA has yet to release an official statement, meaning this could stick around for a while until it gets sorted out.</p>

            <p>
Yooka-Laylee, the Banjo-Kazooie-inspired platform collect-'em-up from developer Playtonic Games, is getting a bit of a spruce-up for PC and unspecified consoles by way of a newly announced (and dubiously named) remaster, Yooka-Replaylee.
</p>
<p>
The original Yooka-Laylee launched back in 2017, garnering modest acclaim - Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yooka-laylee">called it</a> a "gentle, irreverent platformer let down by spotty handling and a slight shortage of genius" - and was followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair-review-a-brilliant-and-better-follow-up">far superior side-scrolling sequel</a>, the Donkey Kong Country-inspired Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, two years later.
</p>
<p>
Yooka-Replaylee, though, revisits the colourful if occasionally cumbersome original with an eye to polishing things up for a new generation of players. To that end, Playtonic is implementing an improved camera, revised controls, a world map, a challenges tracker, and more.
</p>

<p>
There's an expansive art and animation overhaul (behold that thick, luscious grass, for instance), higher resolution support and performance enhancements, plus new and remixed challenges, a new collectible currency, fresh secrets, and new accessibility options. Yooka-Laylee's original soundtrack has also had a major makeover, now presented in arranged orchestral form.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for Yooka-Replaylee yet, and no word on the consoles it's targeting, but Playtonic is holding a Q&amp;A session "soon", so hopefully we can expect more details then.

        <p>A 15-minute trailer arrives next week</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is no more. No, EA haven't once again taken Dragon Age 4 back to the drawing board; instead, they've just changed its name. The next entry in their trad-fantasy RPG series is now called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, and we'll get a "first look at gameplay" next week.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Without wishing to spoil anything, the name "Dreadwolf" refers to one of Dragon Age's antagonists. According to a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/TheVeilguard/">blog post from Gary McKay</a>, Dragon Age's executive producer, the name change is designed to reflect that "you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience." There are apparently seven companions you'll be bringing together over the course of the game to form the titular Veilguard.
</p>
<p>The now-former name Dreadwolf was announced back in 2022, but Dragon Age 4 has been in development since shortly after the release of Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. The blog post makes reference to this long development history, framing it as "an incredible opportunity".
</p>
<p>"We brought everything to the table which, yes, even included a multiplayer concept. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot. This work, and the amazing support from EA, helped us re-focus on creating an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us."
</p>
<p>I suppose that, in an industry that regularly death-marches developers to release a multiplayer game they're ill-prepared to produce, then shuts them down when the game is predictably flawed, it is ultimately to EA's credit that the swung back to letting BioWare make a singleplayer game. In this one instance.
</p>
<p>We'll finally get a proper look at Dragon Age: The Veilguard on June 11th at 8am PT/4pm BST when a fifteen minute trailer is released via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dragonage">Dragon Age YouTube channel</a>.</p>

The patch includes various fixes and improvements, along with details about how the Iron Giant will be nerfed when he returns. </p><p>As noted in a new blog post, the <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/1-01-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MultiVersus 1.01 patch notes</a> first mention that Iron Gaint is still unplayable after the developer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-tournament-player-sees-their-main-character-pulled-from-the-game-mid-bracket-wins-anyway">previously pulled the character from the roster</a>. They also note that a status update will be shared sometime next week.</p><p>The Iron Giant was removed from the MultiVersus character roster after complaints that he was overpowered and was causing an unfair advantage. The patch notes mention that this next update should add changes that will "prevent Iron Giant from chaining certain sets of attack infinitely." Two things getting nerfed in Iron Giant's move set are the Ground Side Attack, which will get a "slightly smaller" hitbox, and his Rage Mode Up Special, which will decrease the final hit damage from 5 to 6. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/multiversusofficialgameplaytrailer-ign-blogroll-1657816935298-1717698402681.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>We now have more details on the specifics of how Iron Giant will be nerfed. (Image courtesy of Player First Games)</figcaption></figure></output><p>Another noteworthy change coming to Patch 1.01 includes fixing an issue that was causing performance problems for the Xbox Series X/S version and addressing an issue where specific keyboard configurations caused phantom inputs during a match. </p><p>MultiVersus was fully released last May, after an early access and beta versions of the game were held from July 2022 until <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-early-access-closing-in-june-full-release-window-confirmed">June 2023</a>. Upon its full release, MultiVersus received <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-relaunch-draws-many-players-and-many-complaints">a ton of compliments,</a> with one player saying the full release felt "more like a beta than the beta." </p><p>Below is the full list of patch notes for MultiVersus patch 1.01. </p><h2><strong>MultiVersus Patch 1.01 Notes</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>General <ul data-cy="list"><li>Lowered Hit Pause on all Hits by 10% in 1v1 modes</li><li>Players can now try all Fighters in Training Mode, including Fighters they do not own</li><li>Battlepass XP will now be granted after each PvP Match in addition to Events and Missions.</li></ul></li><li>Bug Fixes<ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete daily rewards in Rifts Mode</li><li>Fixed an issue that was impacting performance on Xbox Series X|S </li><li>Fixed an issue where beam visual effects were occasionally invisible on PlayStation consoles </li><li>Fixed an issue where certain keyboard configurations would cause phantom inputs in matches </li><li>Fixed an issue with pause input conflicts in Training</li></ul></li><li>Characters<ul data-cy="list"><li>Legend<ul data-cy="list"><li>+ = Buff </li><li>– = Nerf </li><li>~ = Change </li><li>* = Bugfix </li><li>Note: Attacks callouts reference default controls. </li></ul></li><li>Arya<ul data-cy="list"><li><em><strong>Dash Attack</strong></em> <ul data-cy="list"><li>(~) Reduced input buffer window for follow-up attacks</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Banana Guard<ul data-cy="list"><li>The goal of this change is to reduce the extreme kill power on Banana Guard’s side specials and bring it more in line with the damage of the rest of the cast. </li><li><em><strong>Aerial Side Special </strong></em><em> </em><ul data-cy="list"><li>(–) Reduced damage to 10 from 12 </li></ul></li><li><em><strong>Ground Side Special</strong></em><em> </em><ul data-cy="list"><li>(–) Reduced damage to 12 from 14 </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Bug Bunny<ul data-cy="list"><li><em><strong>Neutral Special</strong></em> </li><li>(*) Fixed an issue causing the Safe to hit repeatedly and rapidly in succession</li></ul></li><li>Garnet<ul data-cy="list"><li><em><strong>Down Special</strong></em>  <ul data-cy="list"><li>(*) Fixed an issue where Garnet and an enemy could be frozen at the end of her Star Grab</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Gizmo<ul data-cy="list"><li><em><strong>Up Special</strong></em> <ul data-cy="list"><li>(–) Ally attach cooldown now begins when Gizmo detaches from his ally, instead of beginning when Gizmo attaches to his ally. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Iron Giant<ul data-cy="list"><li>The goal of these changes is to prevent Iron Giant from chaining certain sets of attacks infinitely.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>One of the most highly-requested features from the community since the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/" data-ref-id="5000-519019">Hogwarts Legacy</a> has been a Photo Mode. The ability to capture unique images of characters, locations, or scenes is an invaluable part of the open-world experience in gaming. While many fans thought the idea of a Photo Mode in Hogwarts Legacy was dead, the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/hogwarts-legacy-everything-new-in-the-summer-update/2900-5457/" data-ref-id="2900-5457">summer update</a> changed that.</p><p>The summer update introduced a flurry of content into the game, including the long-awaited Photo Mode. You can now take professional screenshots in-game and share them with the world, but you'll first have to understand how to access and use Photo Mode.</p><h2>Accessing Photo Mode in Hogwarts Legacy</h2><p>Before you can start taking pictures, there's one requirement you need to meet. Photo Mode is only available after you complete the main mission where you unlock the Field Guide. Once that mission is complete, which occurs within the first hour or so of Hogwarts Legacy, you can start using Photo Mode.</p><p>To do that, press "Esc" on keyboard or "Options/Start" on controller. This brings you to the main menu where you can select Gear, Settings, and other menus. However, you don't need to click on any single menu. Instead, look at the bottom-right corner of the screen and find the "Enter Photo Mode" text. Next to that text, there will be a button, which you need to click to enter Photo Mode. For me on keyboard, the default button was "K."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4314218-hogwartslegacyscreenshot2024.06.06-11.28.27.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4314218" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4314218-hogwartslegacyscreenshot2024.06.06-11.28.27.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4314218"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4314218-hogwartslegacyscreenshot2024.06.06-11.28.27.18.png"></figure><p>Once you're in Photo Mode, you have several different options to tinker with. You can adjust the Tilt, Depth of Field, Exposure, Contrast, Saturation, and other image options. You also have the choice to select a specific season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter), add a new filter, and even change the time of day. Changing the time doesn't change the time in-game, though; it only impacts Photo Mode.</p><p>Perhaps the most intriguing Photo Mode option is changing your character's pose. You can choose from several different poses, including Standing, Sitting, Taunting, etc. If you don't want your character in the image at all, you're also able to remove them entirely. There's also the ability to zoom in past your character using either your mouse and keyboard or controller joysticks.</p><p>When you're ready to take a picture, look at the bottom of the screen to find the "Toggle UI" option. Press the button next to Toggle UI to get rid of all the menus and text on the screen. Then, take your pictures(s), press the Toggle UI button, and then hold Esc/Options to return to the main menu of Hogwarts Legacy.</p><p>As time goes on, the developers might add new features to Photo Mode, but it's a solid addition already to Hogwarts Legacy.

<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following the release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-launch-trailer-has-me-asking-a-lot-of-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a></em>, developer Bungie is moving the game to a new model that will ditch seasons in favor of Episodes. These are narrative arcs that last longer than seasons and should pack in a lot more story set after the expansion’s conclusion. </p> <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2</em> has had dozens of seasons, each one slowly moving the story forward between expansions. I’ve had my battles with this model because, at times, it felt to me like I couldn’t play anything else if I wanted to make the most of them. With <em>The Final Shape</em> being the last major expansion for the game, Bungie is moving away from seasons and offering players something new and different on a much less pressured time scale. </p>

I have final timing details on the first Episode, and using the six-week schedule, I’ve worked out roughly when the following Episodes and Acts should be released. I’ve outlined this below, alongside what each Episode should be about. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2 Episode 1: Echoes</em></h3> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2 Episode 1: Echoes</em> is scheduled for release on <strong>June 11, 2024</strong>. This Episode will focus on the Vex, which likely means it’ll entail some sort of world-ending problem they’re causing by going back or forward in time. The Acts release schedule for this Episode is roughly as follows. </p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 1 Echoes</em> Act 1</strong> – June 11, 2024 to July 23, 2024</li> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 1 Echoes</em> Act 2</strong> – July 23, 2024 to September 3, 2024</li> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 1 Echoes</em> Act 3</strong> – September 3, 2024 to October 15, 2024</li> </ul>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2 Episode 2: Revenant</em></h3> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2 Episode 2: Revenant</em> is a Scorn-based Episode. This faction is one of the most annoying to fight in the game but also incredibly interesting because they’re effectively mutated Fallen zombies. It’ll be interesting to see what they’re up to when this Episode rolls around. The rough timings for the Episode are as follows. </p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 2 Revenant</em> Act 1</strong> – October 15, 2024 to November 26, 2024</li> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 2 Revenant</em> Act 2</strong> – November 26, 2024 to January 7, 2025</li> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 2 Revenant</em> Act 3</strong> – January 7, 2025 to February 18, 2025</li> </ul>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2 Episode 3: Heresy</em></h3> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">To end the run of Episodes, we have <em>Destiny 2 Episode 3: Heresy</em>. This one will look at the Hive, though I have no idea which ones in particular. We’ve battled with the Hive pretty consistently since the original <em>Destiny</em> and have killed off or seriously injured most of their leaders. It’s hard to imagine what might pop up next. The rough timings for this Episode are outlined below. </p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 3 Heresy</em> Act 1</strong> – February 18, 2025 to April 1, 2025</li> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 3 Heresy</em> Act 2</strong> – April 1, 2025 to May 13, 2025</li> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 3 Heresy</em> Act 3</strong> – May 13, 2025 to June 24, 2025</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">This would take us up to just over a year after the release of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. However, the original timeline was just shy of a year, so I’d expect a few of these end and launch weeks to coincide or shift back to fall in line with the original plan. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What are Episodes in <em>Destiny 2</em>?</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-eliksni-playing-guitar.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destiny 2 YouTube</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot via Destiny 2 YouTube</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot via Destiny 2 YouTube</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Episodes are massive chunks of new content for <em>Destiny 2</em>. While seasons often added a new story you could play a part of each week, Dungeons, new activities, and new weapons, Episodes go further. They still have all the same content a season would add, but now more is added every six weeks. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">For example, the Echoes Episode begins with Act 1, then it’ll get Act 2 six weeks later, and Act 3 after another six weeks. Each Act adds new activities, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-exotic-armor-is-changing-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Exotics</a>, more story, and even more season pass ranks to climb through. They layer on top of each other until the Episode ends after three months, and the next one starts.</p>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">My hope for this system is that it does away with the frantic need to play through everything in a season as fast as possible as soon as it drops. Instead, each Episode can feel like the smaller expansions of the past, such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2-warmind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warmind</a></em>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-guerrilla-collective-2024-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As we hit the summer video game announcement season, we're kicking June off with a collection of indie devs in the Guerilla Collective event today. This is the fifth year that Guerilla Collective has hosted an event, and it generally showcases interesting games from a wide variety of developers that may not get attention at other showcases. If you want to see what your next favorite indie game may be, this is the spot to be, as we have all the announcements made.</p>

<h3>Wrekless - Free Range Games</h3>
<p>After a few minutes of opening, the Guerrilla Collective kicked off with an announcement of skateboarding mmo, <em>Wrekless</em>. The trailer for it emphasized the ability to build, share, and play together in this arcade skateboarding game. Featuring developers who worked on <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em>, this is another team attempting to bring the skating genre back, and into the multiplayer era of self-expression and shared regions.</p>

<p><em>Wrekless </em>is set for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931930/Wrekless/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wrekless">early access in Q3 2024 on Steam</a>.</p>
<h3>Yooka-Replaylee - Playtonic</h3>
<p><em>Yookla-Laylee</em> was one of the games that helped kick off the whole kickstarter spiritual successor thing, and while the game released to mixed reviews, it got a more acclaimed follow-up, and now the team at Playtonic is going back to their first game to improve it. As the definitive version of the game, <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> will feature improved cameras and controls (including a tweaked move set), which will hopefully help many player's issues with the game, improved visuals, an orchestral soundtrack, and both new and improved challenges. There will also be a new collectible currency, a new world map and challenge tracker, and all new tonics, and mechandise at Vendi.</p>

<h3>Deathbound - Trialforge Studio</h3>
<p>Another studio is trying their hands at the souls-like genre, with Trialforge's <em>Deathbound</em> having a unique party-based mechanic where you switch characters at the tap of a button. It had a passable demo back in Steam Next Fest, but left myself and others wondering how it would turn out. Well, they are releasing a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1277130/Deathbound/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Deathbound">new <em>Deathbound</em> demo</a> so everyone can see what progress has come with the game, and if it interests them before the game releases later this year.</p>

It began as a living card game published by Fantasy Flight Games, then spun off into a TTRPG. It even has a <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> conversion, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adventures-in-rokugan-brings-l5r-to-dd-5e"><em>Adventures in Rokugan</em></a>. Now, players can make their fortune when a new board game, L5R River of Gold, comes to retail.</p>
<h2>The <em>L5R River of Gold</em> retail announcement</h2>
<p>The retail announcement of <em>L5R River of Gold</em> was covered by <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/57068/l5r-river-gold-board-game-heads-retail" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ICV2</a>. In the game, players travel through the East Asian-inspired fantasy world of Rokugan as a merchant on the titular golden river, delivering goods for their clan. In addition, they will invest in trade ports, markets, and shrines, and gain influence with manor houses.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/l5r-river-of-gold-card-artwork.jpg?itok=8Jxepd-k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/l5r-river-of-gold-card-artwork.jpg?itok=mU_r4HDx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Is it wise to trust a contract from the Scorpion Clan?</figcaption></figure><p>The goal is to build wealth and best the merchants from the rival clans. Doing this will require resource management and strategy as opposed to intense duels. This is notable since <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> is a setting driven by warring samurai clans, duels of passion, and supernatural demon attacks.</p>
<p><em>L5R River of Gold</em> was developed by Keith Piggott, the same creator behind <em>Drawn To Adventure</em> and <em>The Great Barrier Reef Card Game</em>. It will be published by Office Dog, a company launched in May 2022 under <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group">Asmodee Group</a>,</p>
<p>This board game will be the first new tabletop experience released in the L5R setting in years. The foundational living card game received its last major expansions in May 2021. The TTRPG, currently on its fifth edition, is being supported by another Asmodee-owned company, Edge Studio.</p>
<p><em>L5R River of Gold</em> is for two to four players ages 14 and up. A single game can be completed in 90 minutes. It will be available at retail stores and hobby shops August 2 and will be sold at an MSRP of $49.99. Each copy will include the Patrons mini-expansion, which will improve replayability.</p>

Octopath Traveler 2 is a first-time addition to the subscription service. Katharine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/octopath-traveler-2-review">reviewed the sequel</a> when it released last year and found it extremely similar, and similarly flawed, to the original:

<blockquote>Despite knowing this moment is almost certainly in my future, and despite the slightly incredulous realisation that I’ll have spent another 80 hours playing almost exactly the same game I did four years ago, I've still had a good time with Octopath Traveler 2. There’s something innately enthralling about it, and while, deep down, there's still lots of things I dislike about it, cor, those battles are just the absolute business. It remains one of the most captivating combat systems in the entire JRPG genre, and it really does feel good to be back in its gorgeous HD-2D world again, reheated story leftovers and all (and I swear I’m not just saying that because we get another stonking Nishiki score to admire in the process, honest).</blockquote>
<p>Among the other new joiners, the most interesting to me is the launch day arrival of Still Wakes The Deep on June 18th. It's the new game from The Chinese Room, thems what made Everybody's Gone To The Rapture, and thems what are making Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. They're a very different studio from their indie days and I'm curious what they'll produce.
</p>
<p>As always, new joiners mean a similarly sized batch of leavers. The games departing Game Pass on June 15th are Bramble: The Mountain King, High On Life, Rune Factory 4 Special, Spacelines From The Far Out, and The Bookwalker.</p>

			<p>Microsoft will be presenting their big <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> this weekend, and there’s plenty of speculation about what might be next for Team Green. Will more games make their way to rival hardware after games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-ps5-april-release-date-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea of Thieves</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hi-fi-rush-ps5-release-march-2024-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a> went multiplatform earlier this year? And what’s going on troubled tentpole franchises like Halo?</p>
<p>Well, reliable Microsoft insider Tom Warren (<a href="https://subs.theverge.com/checkout?plan=108640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up for his newsletter here</a>) has stepped up before the Microsoft’s big show to provide some details about what he’s heard is going on with Team Green. In addition to the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct</a>, Warren is expecting two big first-party reveals – <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-announcement-rumor-xbox-games-showcase-medieval-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-playstation-xbox-core-franchises-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next Gears game</a>. Per Warren, Doom will be full multiplatform and Gears will not.</p>
<p>In his article, Warren runs down some of the games he’s heard are being considered for “Project Latitude” (Microsoft’s initiative to bring first-party games to other platforms) – in addition to Doom: The Dark Ages, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Mythology: Retold</a>, and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield</a> are under consideration. Games that are apparently <em>not </em>under consideration are the next Gears, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/south-of-midnight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>.</p>
<p>Where things get particularly juicy is <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/halo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halo</a>. According to Warren, a remaster of the original Halo: Combat Evolved is in the works and it<em> is</em> being considered for a multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Of course, take all of this with a grain of salt for now, but Warren has proven he has the goods in the past. As you can perhaps tell, it seems like a lot of things are up in the air at Team Green – while games like Fable and Gears aren't being considered for multiplatform releases now, if Halo can jump, anything can I reckon.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase comes your way on Sunday (June 9) at 10am PT. As previously rumored, we might also see some hints about future Xbox hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-might-feature-a-shadow-dropped-1st-party-game-xbox-portable-likely-to-be-teased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including a possible portable</a>, at the show. What are your thoughts on all of this? How do you think the exclusivity question will shake out?</p>

<p id="pJcmZh">These trimmed-down PS5s are equipped with the very same hardware as the older models that will eventually be phased out, but they have a smaller footprint overall and are around two pounds lighter, depending on whether the disc drive is attached. Both consoles are aesthetically similar to the original design, but both feature a small black channel that cuts through both sides.</p>
