			<p>Along with the unveiling of NVIDIA's GeForce <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-429-8-gb-379-20-percent-faster-4060-ti-2x-dlss-4/">RTX 5060Ti</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-8-gb-sweet-spot-gaming-299-over-100-fps-games-1080p/">RTX 5060</a>, we also got the announcement of the next four games that have added support for DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation.</p>
<p>Game Science's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Offworld Industries' <a href="https://wccftech.com/squad-44-is-post-scriptums-new-name-update-adds-greek-faction-new-map-and-weapons/">SQUAD</a>, Misultin Studios and MicroProse Software's EXFIL and Torn Banner Studios' <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-update-in-2025-for-no-more-room-in-hell-2-released-adding-firefighter-zombies/">No More Room In Hell 2</a> join the ranks of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-available-in-warhammer-40k-darktide-enlisted-and-karma-the-dark-world/">games</a> like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/">Control</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> in supporting DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-black-myth-wukong/">blog post</a> from NVIDIA, each game enjoys a performance boost, but the biggest headway seems to be made in Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p>Players pushing 4K, with everything maxed out, while utilizing an RTX 50 series GPU "<em>can multiply performance up to 10X thanks to DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution,</em>" NVIDIA claims.</p>
<p>"<em>At 4K, with full ray tracing enabled and every other setting maxed out, DLSS Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution multiply frame rates by an average of 10X. This massive performance boost enables GeForce RTX 5070 gamers to play at over 110 FPS, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti users to play at over 130 FPS, GeForce RTX 5080 owners to play at over 150 FPS, and GeForce RTX 5090 buyers to play at over 240 FPS, maxing out the capabilities of the latest 4K OLED G-SYNC compatible DisplayPort 2.1 displays.</em>"</p>
<p>Of course, the performance boost you're able to see will always depend on the hardware you have in your system, but even considering that, it's still an impressive bump for what many players find challenging to run.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong was one of the biggest titles in 2024, winning its fair share of awards, including the game of the year for both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-award-winners-2024-announced-black-myth-wukong-is-game-of-the-year/">Steam Awards</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/winners-announced-at-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-black-myth-wukong-wins-ultimate-game-of-the-year/">Golden Joysticks</a>. It's also one of the sleekest-looking games in recent years if you've got the hardware for it. Now that it supports DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation, more players will be able to enjoy its wonderful visuals without losing frames as they would have before.</p>

            <p>
Dear reader, allow me, if you will, a moment of honesty. I truly, wholly did not know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> was still going. Not only is it still going, but yesterday <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> shared a look at the game's impending second year of updates, so I really missed the boat on this one - pun intended, of course. The first season of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pirate-games-on-pc">pirate</a> game's second year has already kicked off, introducing a few new features.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters there's new world tiers, which are basically just optional difficult levels you can choose for certain challenges. Pick a higher tier, get better rewards, simple! There's item ascension now too, which lets you improve your gear with things like randomized buffs and "modifiable slots." Season 1 will be getting a mid-season update too that'll bring in a new PvP feature called Death Tides, essentially a capture and control kind of mode.

<p>
Season 2, which will arrive sometime this summer, will be bringing in playable large ships, but more notably, there'll be factions to choose from each of which have their own boons. Other factions will be hostile to you though, so take that into consideration. After that there's season 3 in the fall, with its biggest addition being land combat. Feels like something you'd think would be there from day one, but we all know how rocky a development period Skull and Bones has had.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, there's season 4, which is quite literally adding in a kraken. It's a pirate game! Of course you have to have a kraken. Outside of that there's the addition of the Hunters Guild, you won't be surprised to hear that it focuses on hunting sea creatures, and there'll be a new large ship to be acquired too.
</p>
<p>
If the fact that Skull and Bones is continuing to receive updates has convinced you to give it a go, perhaps hold off on buying it, as the game is getting a free weekend this week, from April 17th-21st. Can't say I saw this game lasting longer than a year, so kudos to the devs for keeping things ship shape - pun intended, of course.

What’s tricky is that they’re earned from side quests that won’t be available until you unlock High Rank. <strong>You can get the Armorcharm first by completing the “Secure Wounded Hollow” optional quest from Cobb in the Suja location.</strong> He’ll either be at your tent or right next to it with Gemma.</p><p>This quest involves hunting two Hirabami monsters inside the Wounded Hollow area. Bringing a ranged weapon like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wild-heavy-light-bowgun-differences-best-1851773364&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wild-heavy-light-bowgun-differences-best-1851773364">Bowguns</a></span> will serve you well in hitting these typically flying monsters. Having something that can trigger an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743">offset attack</a></span> can also be useful for occasionally knocking it down to the ground. The two most important things I recommend doing are taking advantage of their elemental weaknesses (Fire and Thunder) and using the levers on the sides of the arena to trigger a large fence that divides the area in half. With the right timing, this can separate the monsters for a little bit and let you focus on them one at a time.</p><p>Return to Suja and talk to Cobb once you’re done looting the Hirabami. He’ll give you the Armorcharm, which will go into your item box. If you completed this quest before Title Update 1 and encountered a glitch where you didn’t receive the item, you can properly earn it by finishing any Arena Quest at the Grand Hub.</p><h2 id="h23831"><a id=""></a>How to Get Powercharm</h2><p>Your chance to get the Powercharm will come a little bit later. You’ll need to have completed the quest mentioned above and raised your hunter rank further. <strong>The Powercharm is available as a reward for completing the “As Gatekeeper” quest from Rex in Suja.</strong> He’ll be in the same areas that Cobb patrols.</p><p>This is another hunt involving two monsters in Wounded Hollow. But this time, it’s against two Ajarakan. These things can be super aggressive and might be easier if you team up with another player for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-co-op-lobby-link-party-id-1851771071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-co-op-lobby-link-party-id-1851771071">multiplayer hunt</a></span>. Aside from bringing something that can inflict Water Element damage, separating them with the large fence is still a must. Between their huge attacks and power-up state, taking on both at the same time is a recipe for disaster. Consider bringing a weapon you can guard with to ease up on the constant dodging and potentially trigger a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-power-clash-explained-guarding-1851775741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-power-clash-explained-guarding-1851775741">power clash</a></span>.</p><p>Return to Rex once you’re finished to receive the Powercharm. Just like its armor counterpart, this will go straight into your item box. Another similarity is that on the off chance that a glitch prevented you from unlocking it, finishing any Arena quest will give it to you.</p><h2 id="h23832"><a id=""></a>How to Use the Armorcharm and Powercharm</h2><figure id="" data-id="c6922733690ebf12c6d916319793c30a" data-recommend-id="image://c6922733690ebf12c6d916319793c30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Transfer Items screen, with the Powercharm highlighted in the Item Box.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-nudges-mainstream-gaming-pcs-forward-with-rtx-5060-series-starting-at-299.1164978/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/nvidia-nudges-mainstream-gaming-pcs-forward-with-rtx-5060-series-starting-at-299/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>As with its other 50-series announcements, Nvidia is leaning on its DLSS Multi-Frame Generation technology to make lofty performance claims—the GPUs can insert up to three AI-interpolated frames in between each pair of frames that the GPU actually renders. The 40 series could only generate a single frame, and 30-series and older GPUs don't support DLSS Frame Generation at all. This makes apples-to-apples performance comparisons difficult.</p>
<p>Generally, the company says the 5060 Ti and 5060 offer double the performance of the 4060 Ti and 4060, but all of its benchmarks are made using the "max Frame Gen level supported by each GPU." The small snippets of native performance information we do have<em>—Hogwarts Legacy</em> runs on a 5060 Ti at 61 FPS 1440p, compared to 34 FPS for the 3060 Ti—suggests that it's slightly less than twice as fast as that two-generation-old card. This would still be reasonably impressive, given the underwhelming 4060 Ti refresh. But we'll need to wait for third-party testing before we really have a good idea of how performance will stack up without Frame Generation enabled.</p>


<p>As we and others have observed since the launch of the 40-series a few years ago, Frame Generation gives the best results when your base frame rate is already reasonably high; the technology is best used to make a good frame rate better and is less useful if you're trying to make a bad frame rate good. That's even more relevant for the slower 50-series than for the other GPUs in the lineup, which makes Nvidia's reticence to provide native performance comparisons especially frustrating.</p>
<p>Rumors from earlier this year that correctly reported the specs of the 5060 series also indicated that Nvidia was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/leaked-geforce-rtx-5060-and-5050-specs-suggest-nvidia-will-keep-playing-it-safe/">planning to launch a low-end RTX 5050 GPU</a> at some point, its first new entry-level GPU since launching the RTX 3050 in January 2022. The 5050 could still be coming, but if it is, it wasn't part of Nvidia's announcements today.</p>

Focus Interactive recently announced that a threequel is in development. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-now-in-development/1100-6530114/">Details

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-didnt-need-to-sell-4-million-units-to-be-a-success-but-it-did-anyway/1100-6527262/">Space Marine 2 has sold over four million copies</a> to date, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-will-get-several-substantial-updates-in-2025/1100-6529135/">more-substantial updates</a> are on the way throughout 2025. Elsewhere in the Warhammer 40,000 galaxy, other games are also currently in development based on the popular tabletop wargaming IP. Fans can look forward to a digital collectible card game in the form of Warpforge, a vehicular combat game called Speed Freeks, and more turn-based tactics in a sequel to Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus.</p>

It will also include new weapon upgrades as well as long-unobtainable preorder and territory-specific weapons and pets that will be added back to the game in the form of rare drops from the game's high-level enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4475902-gw20thanniversaryheroimage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475902" data-ratio="0.60052083333333" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4475902-gw20thanniversaryheroimage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475902"></a><figcaption>Guild Wars: The 20th Anniversary Masterpiece Collection includes the game's three campaigns and expansion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4475902-gw20thanniversaryheroimage.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the newly added weapon upgrades, they will sport the "of the Profession" modifier and will also be added to the game's rare-drop loot tables. The upgrades will let players gain access to attributes they normally wouldn't be able to, enabling new builds. The upgrades will also add a cosmetic glowing streak effect to weapons in the color associated with the given profession.</p><p dir="ltr">To sweeten the birthday bash, Guild Wars: The 20th Anniversary Masterpiece Collection will be 80% off and cost just $8 from April 15-29 via the <a href="https://buy.guildwars2.com/en-us/guild-wars-masterpiece-collection" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guild Wars 2 website</a>, with in-game items discounted 60%. Other editions of Guild Wars, including Guild Wars Trilogy, the Eye of the North expansion, and each individual campaign, will also be 80% off on Steam and other storefronts for the duration of the sale.</p><p dir="ltr">Guild Wars made a name for itself 20 years ago as one of the first MMORPGs in the wake of games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> to not require a monthly subscription fee. It received new content in the form of additional, standalone campaigns that added new quests, regions, and classes, with a more traditional expansion, 2007's Eye of the North, setting the stage for its 2012 sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/guild-wars-2/" data-ref-id="5000-30218">Guild Wars 2</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">In November 2022, social deduction indie darling Among Us saw an evolution with Among Us VR, which brought the game's small spacemen from 2D to 3D in a new first-person experience. Among Us VR recently rebranded to Among Us 3D in anticipation of the non-VR version's imminent launch, and today Innersloth and Schell Games have confirmed the new version will drop on Steam May 6 for $10.</p><p dir="ltr">Among Us 3D takes the three-dimensional look of the game formerly known as Among Us VR and removes the need for VR goggles, allowing players to complete tasks and betray their fellow space beans in full 3D. The non-VR version will support cross-play with its VR counterparts on Meta Quest, Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, and PICO, but Among Us 3D will not be compatible with the original Among Us release.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxnw01582Bk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Uxnw01582Bk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The new 3D version of Among Us transforms the chaos of the multiplayer social-deduction game to a first-person perspective, along with all of the task-themed minigames the innocent crewmates must complete to win. It will also introduce native proximity chat--which may or may not give a player's position away to an approaching impostor--as well as a new class, The Infected, which turns a killed Crewmate into another Infected impostor instead of the usual ghost.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate Among Us 3D's impending release, Schell Games has also announced the <a href="https://schellgames.com/blog/powered-by-wishlists-challenge-among-us-3d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Powered by Wishlists Challenge</a>. This will add "exclusive in-game cosmetics" to all Among Us 3D owners based on Steam Wishlist milestones the community can achieve between now and May 6. Rewards will be earned at the following milestones:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">333,333 wishlists - A new hat</li><li dir="ltr">444,444 wishlists - A second new hat</li><li dir="ltr">555,555 wishlists - A "cosmetic surprise"</li><li dir="ltr">777,777 wishlists - "Suspiciously exciting new cosmetic(s)"</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Among Us 3D launches May 6 for PC via Steam.

Canadian <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> pre-orders - which were originally set to go live on 9th April before Nintendo announced a last-minute delay - will reportedly now begin next week.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">slammed on the brakes last Tuesday</a>, just a day before Canadian Switch 2 pre-orders were set to begin, saying it was making the move "in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the US". That followed the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">unprecedented decision to indefinitely delay Switch 2 pre-orders in the US</a> while the company looked to "assess the potential impact" of US president Donald Trump sweeping trade tariffs.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, Billbill-kun - who has a strong track-record when it comes to retail leaks - says Canadian Switch 2 pre-orders will begin soon. "From what I can see through some Canadian retailers," they <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1912167208140108026">wrote on social media</a>, "Nintendo Switch 2 console &amp; bundle pre-orders should start from 23rd April, 2025. Date subject to change. Can't confirm if it's the same for US."

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss Doug Bowser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">previously admitted</a> the US administration's trade tariffs - which had heavily impacted some of the company's key manufacturing locations around the world - were a "challenge" and "something we're going to have to address." And despite a temporary pause on some tariffs since then, the situation has remained uncertain amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-appears-to-backtrack-on-us-electronics-tariff-exceptions-but-no-one-seems-to-know-exactly-whats-going-on">confusing messaging around potential electronics exceptions</a>.
</p>
<p>
One prominent analytics firm has said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-likely-to-stick-with-switch-2s-450-launch-price-despite-trump-tariffs-says-analyst">expects Nintendo to stick with its previously announced $450 launch price</a> for Switch 2 in the US despite the tariffs, but believes their effect could lead to a 20 percent price increase for the console over the next two years. And it's not just Nintendo. Earlier this month, US trade group the Entertainment Software Association <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">said the tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a> as a whole.

<p>The obvious parallel here is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a>, the top-down cosmic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> trawling sim from Black Salt Games. Our previous captain Katharine Castle (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dredge-review">was a big fan</a>. At the risk of yet again sounding like Dr Contrarian S. Hype-Puncturer, I thought it was a bit mid. I loved the concept of reeling tetromino-shaped Cthulhaddock from the abyss while reckoning with a day-night cycle, but in practice, it just felt like a load of fetchquests revolving around a not especially gratifying mystery. </p>
<p>Dreadmoor resembles Dredge so closely in places that I'm tempted to refer to it as Dredgemore. It, too, obliges you to cram asymmetrical bottom-feeders into a grid-based inventory, rotating them to make optimal use of space. It, too, asks you to be careful after sundown. It, too, favours warm, flat colours and cartoon contours, to the point that the giant angler fish that emerge to swallow your boat seem almost pettable. It, too, follows a loop of selling bizarre ocean fauna to swivel-eyed weirdos, then using the proceeds to upgrade your ship and craft new gear.</p>
<p>But Dreadmoor cribs just as much from Rare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, with the ability to roam inside your boat, cast lines and even venture ashore in first-person view. The boat can be steered in third-person, the better to avoid any tentacles grasping at your timbers. I imagine all that's very attractive to people who are hankering for a Dredge 2.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm most enticed by the idea of crafting my own fishing lures, which puts me nicely in mind of China Mieville's The Scar. Remember the hook they used to reel in the Avanc? I'm not sure Dreadmoor's doughty steamship has the buoyancy or ballast for that kind of prey, but I live in hope/terror. There are apparently about 100 species of aquatic organism to yank rudely from the depths. You probably won't want to keep the stranger breeds aboard your vessel for long.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is dropping onto <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> this week, meaning that a whole tranche of new gamers are able to experience one of the best games of last year. And with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> being officially the very best and most powerful games console out there, we had to put this game through its paces on Sony’s platforms.</p>
<p>Even with Bethesda’s pre-2023 history as a major third party publisher, it’s still a strange feeling for what is now a Microsoft-owned company to be releasing its games on Xbox’s biggest rival platform. Even more strange feeling is that these ports to PS5 Pro are going to outshine Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>The question for Indiana Jones and any of these other game, though, is how much better is it going to be? How much more fully featured is this game on PS5 Pro?</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle – PS5 Pro vs. PS5, XSX &amp; PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3JFAhr3T3MA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Well… actually it’s not all <em>that</em> different. if you’re looking for the very best graphics and the most expansive set of ray tracing features to switch on, then you’re still going to need a high-end PC and a very expensive GPU in particular.</p>

<p>MachineGames created an exceptional technical showcase with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Using a heavily customised branch of the idTech engine, this game targeted 60fps on Xbox Series X, while still pushing for a typical 1800p (albeit with dynamic resolution scaling) and incorporating ray traced global illumination throughout. This uses ray tracing to bounce light through environments and realistically transfer colour and shade throughout. It absolutely pulled it off, and looks simply superb a lot of the time, with more naturalistic interior lighting in particular.</p>
<p>However, in order to get that performance, MachineGames made a number of cuts, taking some effects down to below what even Low is on PC, and making compromises for the game in general. Without any graphics options for performance modes or resolution modes, even an equivalently specced PC could get more visual fidelity at a lower resolution than console, regardless of whether you enable more ray traced features or not.</p>
<p>With this PlayStation port, it seems that base PS5 has pretty much identical visual targets to the Xbox Series X, including resolution windows and that pretty locked 60fps. PS5 Pro, however, pushes that up to a full 4K, a native 2160p target, still with 60fps. That might not sound like the biggest jump in resolution, but achieving a native 4K does add roughly half the pixels again, or more, depending on dynamic scaling on the lower consoles.</p>

		</div>

<p>Compared to the original launch last December, Machine Games has been able to turn up the wick for the quality of the global illumination on consoles –&nbsp;the latest update for the game last week also brought RTGI improvements to aid ambient occlusion and contact shadows. If there’s any further push for PS5 Pro, then the different is marginal at best.</p>
<p>And… well that’s about it. The PS5 Pro is a little bit better than Xbox Series X and PS5, but for most people, you’re going to get an equivalent experience, just at lower resolution.</p>
<p>In other words PS5 Pro still has the most noticeable limitations of the game on console. In particular, the rasterised sun shadows are noticeably blocky even at their highest quality when close to the player camera, and there’s a very sharp cascade stepping as you walk through environments where long shadows have been cast, which is in contrast to the much smoother fade that you can get on PC without path traced sun shadowing.</p>
<p>And enabling sun shadows does have a huge impact to the look of the game on PC, giving much more softness as you get further away from window frames and other obstructions.</p>

			</dt>
				<dd id="gallery-2-458912">
				Path traced sun shadows are still PC-only
				</dd></dl><br>
		</div>

<p>That does, however, come at a very steep cost. Enabling just this one additional ray tracing feature on our PC tanked the dynamic resolution to try and keep up. I’ve got a Radeon 6800 currently, which is far short of the minimum recommended GPU for turning on path tracing, the GeForce RTX 4070. Even then, that is only expected to hit 1080p with 60fps.</p>
<p>So perhaps this is beyond what the PS5 Pro can comfortably manage without making further compromises, but it’s still a shame that MachineGames weren’t able to extract more from the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that, even with a handful of significant updates to the game since launch, there are still a handful of relatively minor bugs. Things like tutorial pop ups that don’t quite keep up with what you’re doing, showing irrelevant information, and some visual artifacting at distance, such as with flickering window panes or some odd black boxes in the sky. They’re few and far between, and hopefully noted for further updates to this game.</p>

<p>All in all, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is still a damn fine game</a>, and this relative closeness just means that owners of the base PS5 are missing out on very little compared to the PS5 Pro.</p>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada should start next week, according to a very reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Earlier today, known leaker <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billbil-kun.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billbil-kun</a> revealed that from what they can see through some Canadian retailers, pre-orders for the next-generation Nintendo console and bundles launching this June will start next week, on April 23rd. Unfortunately, the leaker couldn't confirm if pre-orders in the United States will also begin next week.</p>

<p>From what I can see through some Canadian retailers, Nintendo Switch 2 console &amp; bundle pre-orders should start from</p>
<p>📅 April 23rd, 2025 (valid in CA)</p>
<p>⚠️ Date subject to change. Can't confirm if it's the same for US</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in the whole of North America were supposed to start last week, but they were ultimately delayed in the United States first to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">assess the potential impact of tariffs</a>. Pre-orders in Canada were later delayed in order to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">align with the timing of pre-orders in the US</a>, so there's a good chance that those living in the United States may be able to pre-order the console next week if pre-orders in Canada will indeed begin on April 23rd.</p>
<p>If the current situation doesn't change, there's little doubt that the tariffs will impact the Nintendo Switch 2 price, although it is not yet known in which capacity. An internal assessment memo from a major Apple and Nintendo supplier seen by Nikkei Asia suggests that the console is in<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/"> line for a significant price increase</a> as long as game consoles made in China will be subject to a 145% tariff in the United States. The PlayStation 5 could also see a price increase in the United States due to the tariffs, a price increase that would follow the one announced for the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">this week.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-released-full-patch-notes-revealed.1164912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-patch-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's the end of an era. Larian Studios has released the final major&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>update, and there's plenty in it to tide you over until the studio's next release, including crossplay, a photo mode, and more.</p>

<p>Patch 8 follows on from the last major numbered patch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">September's Patch 7</a>. While it'll serve as the final major patch for the hugely popular CRPG, Larian does say it will continue to support&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>with "minor bug fixing".</p>

<p>Larian says that it has "told [its] stories the way [it] needed to tell them" with&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, and that it's "time for the team to go back to our cave and hang the armor on the wall" in order to focus on the next Larian game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-final-update-kuo-toa.jpg?itok=BCMgGak7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-final-update-kuo-toa.jpg?itok=IBxrOwx0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s days of being regularly updated are done.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what's in the update, perhaps the biggest new addition is crossplay, which will allow you to play the game alongside your friends on other platforms. Cross-platform progression has also been added, so you can pick up where you left off on PC or console.</p>

<p>If you're looking to play with mods, then you and your fellow players must have the same version of the mods in question installed. Some mods aren't available across all platforms, so make sure you're using compatible mods.</p>

<p>A photo mode has also been added to&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, allowing you to "position and pose your party, play around with camera settings, and whack a few stickers on there" in order to create your very own bespoke&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>screenshots.</p>

<p>In order to celebrate the release of Patch 8,&nbsp;Larian has created a new animated short in conjunction with Spud Gun Studios, and you can check that short out here. Just make sure to have a tissue handy to dry your tears.</p>




<p>You can check out the full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>Patch 8 right here.

It turns out you won't actually be spicing up your life next month, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> have announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> is getting a delay. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> MMO was originally supposed to be launching this coming May 20th, but a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/503947989263320421">Steam post</a> was shared today sharing that its release date has been pushed to June 10th. Those that have the deluxe or ultimate edition on order will still be able to play it a few days earlier, now June 5th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Funcom explained that they came to this decision through feedback they've received from beta testers. On the flipside of things, there is some good news: a "large-scale weekend" is now planned for next month where "even more of you will get the opportunity to play the game and share your feedback." Though, hopefully this round of feedback won't delay the game further - can only imagine how much the devs will have to crunch with only three extra weeks! There's no further details about this beta just yet, but apparently they'll be coming soon.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening had originally been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-burst-out-of-the-early-access-sands-in-early-2025">scheduled for sometime in "early 2025"</a>, but as with many games these days, plans change. I'm not sure if June counts as early any more, at least it's still technically in the first half of the year.
</p>
<p>
Right around this piece is likely to have gone live Funcom are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0KqiqdiBZ0&amp;ab_channel=Funcom">holding a livestream</a> showing off the game's combat, which seems like a good way to get a better feel for the game ahead of its new June release date.

That might explain why fans digging around remake developer Virtuos’ website have found a ton of screenshots and promo images, including some comparison shots showing the new game and the original 2006 RPG side by side (as seen above.) </p><figure id="" data-id="1b72de82c239790ec0aee1c020995fbb" data-recommend-id="image://1b72de82c239790ec0aee1c020995fbb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Virtuos / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b72de82c239790ec0aee1c020995fbb" data-recommend-id="image://1b72de82c239790ec0aee1c020995fbb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans have started cataloging all of the screenshots and leaked images</a></span> in an online album. Some of the images show what appears to be a special edition of the game featuring new horse armor. If you know anything about <em>Oblivion</em>, then you know how funny it is in 2025 that horse armor might be included in a pricier version of the game.</p><p>It’s believed that this remake is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly, according to a developer’s LinkedIn profile</a></span>, it will feature a reworked stamina system, better sneaking, improved blocking, a new archery system and a spruced-up HUD.</p><p>Now we just have to wait for Bethesda and Microsoft to confirm this remake and release it. And that likely won’t be a very long wait. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-just-caught-discounted-pokmon-tcg-journey-together-etbs-and-booster-bundles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After the mess of a launch, I didn’t expect <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a> to bounce back this quickly. But here we are. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-stock-update-journey-together-lost-origin-ex-big-boxes">Amazon</a> has the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-etb-amazon-in-stock">Elite Trainer Box</a> for $70.31 and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-march-31-2025">Booster Bundle</a> for $37.97, which is basically MSRP. These were the same products people were scalping three weeks ago like they were made of gold-foil Charizards. Now they’re just available. In stock. From Amazon. I’m not used to this kind of peace.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Discounted Pokémon TCG: Journey Together ETBs and Booster Bundles </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It helps that single card prices have completely cratered. That early panic-buy energy is gone, and what’s left is actually kind of nice: a good-looking set, still fun to open, finally accessible. This feels like the most relaxed a Pokémon TCG release has been since Stellar Crown. I think it’s a great time to grab sealed product, especially if you skipped launch week and spent it watching TCGPlayer listings implode in real time like I did.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violetjourne"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journe">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="9935b355-d0a8-480b-882e-2349ca642bd7" id="218696"><div id="218696" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s loaded: nine Journey Together booster packs, a full-art foil N’s Zorua, card sleeves, energy, dice, condition markers, and a code card for Live. You also get the little booklet that tells you all about what you probably won’t pull, which is always a comforting touch. I like this as a shelf piece and a slow-open project. Rip one pack a night like a tiny cardboard advent calendar of hope.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for singles, the ETB exclusive card N’s Zorua isn’t bad, but the bigger chase cards are finally landing where they probably should have started. Lillie’s Clefairy ex SIR is still pricey at $180, though that’s less than half of its pre-order peak. N’s Zoroark ex is now around $13, and even the stamped version is cheaper than a movie ticket. I think if you’re going to open sealed product, now is the time when the math doesn’t feel like a straight-up scam.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violetjourne"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journe">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="9935b355-d0a8-480b-882e-2349ca642bd7" id="218697"><div id="218697" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Six booster packs, no fluff. This is the set I grab when I just want to rip packs and pretend I’m still chasing something spicy. It’s cheaper than the ETB, and you’re not paying extra for sleeves or dividers you already have too many of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The card market around this set has basically been a free fall, which makes this a way more interesting buy now. Salamence ex SIR dropped from $250 to about $106, and I think it’ll settle closer to $100. Iono’s Bellibolt ex, which I was convinced was going to be a banger, is chilling around $8. That’s not great news if you bought in early, but it’s fantastic if you’re just now joining the party with a Booster Bundle in hand.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Jour">Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together Sleeved Booster</h2></p><div catalogid="9935b355-d0a8-480b-882e-2349ca642bd7" id="218698"><div id="218698" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together Sleeved Booster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up one of these mostly because I had $10 of Amazon credit I forgot about, but honestly, it wasn’t a bad gamble. One pack, random blister artwork, ten cards, and either a sense of joy or quiet resignation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up one of these mostly because I had $10 of Amazon credit I forgot about, but honestly, it wasn’t a bad gamble.

Six booster packs, a full-art Bellibolt ex, a foil Tadbulb, and some fun extras like a sticker and a display backdrop. Is any of that necessary? No. Did I want it anyway? Absolutely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bellibolt’s cards are doing what most of this set’s full arts have done: falling like a rock. The standard full-art Bellibolt ex is now $7 to $8, and the Special Illustration Rare is around $80. That’s still expensive, but it’s a far cry from the early days when people were pricing it like it was a lost Iono alt-art. I think this is a fun pick for fans of the character, and I don't mind paying for charm when the market has stopped pretending it's gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
