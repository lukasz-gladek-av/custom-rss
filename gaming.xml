            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s second Prime Day of the year is just around the corner, which means it’s a great time to finally make some computer upgrades happen. If you’re on the hunt for a compact desktop that keeps up with your productive days, the Dell OptiPlex 7020 MFF mini PC is going for $1,000 on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4465/">It typically retails for almost $3,399, so this is a whopping $2,399 off (71% off) the regular price tag.</a> There’s enough power for all your everyday plus resource-intensive tasks, and it’s an easy yes at the current discount. Just act fast, because the offer might wrap up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4465/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, Reliable Performance for All Tasks At Hand</h2>
<p>This isn’t one of those ultra-compact mini PCs that fit in the palm of your hand. Those are great if you just need something basic for everyday tasks, but you’re usually trading off a lot of power for the size. The OptiPlex 7020 is slightly bigger, but still easy to carry around.</p>
<p>It boasts a 14th Gen Intel Core i7-14700T processor with 20 cores (8 performance + 12 efficiency), and is also capable of hitting up to 5.2GHz speeds. This translates into ultra-fast performance for all your tasks, whether it’s using a bunch of different applications at once, dealing with never-ending spreadsheets, working on creative projects, or even gaming. The built-in 32GB of DDR5 RAM keeps things running smoothly, while the 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD makes sure you’re not stuck waiting around for the system to boot and the programs to load. Average work days will feel a lot more productive and, honestly, a lot less frustrating.</p>



<p>For connectivity, you’ve got Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth, plus a whole bunch of ports for all your essentials, including one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2×2, three USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, two USB 2.0, two DisplayPort 1.4a, one HDMI 1.4b, one RJ-45 Ethernet, and a universal audio jack. The DisplayPorts, HDMI, and USB-C here also let you connect up to four displays, so there’s plenty of room for expansion as well.</p>
<p>This mini PC runs on Windows 11 Pro, and you even get a keyboard and mouse in the box. Setting it up and getting started is easy. Those who like their desks to be as clean as possible will appreciate how it just mounts at the back of your monitor. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4465/">Just be sure to grab it while it’s still discounted (-71%).</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/good-boy-does-the-dog-die-horror-movie-indy-showtimes-2000631497</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fellow-animal-lovers-i-promise-the-dog-horror-movie-is-safe-to-watch-and-also-very-good.1315732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>If you’re a fan of horror movies or dogs, you’ve probably heard about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/good-boy-trailer-horror-movie-dog-actor-release-date-2000618245"><i><span>Good Boy</span></i></a><span>, the horror movie in which the events play out from the perspective of a retriever named Indy. I am a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-nickname-pet-name-go-black-white-legends-arceus-1850392164"><span>card-carrying dog lover</span></a><span> who can barely stand to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-rocket-raccoon-animal-vio-1850408326"><span>see an animal distressed in a movie</span></a><span>, and I still bravely made my way to the theater to see the film after being intrigued by its premise and the rave reviews coming out of advance screenings earlier this year. I had resigned myself to possibly leaving the movie early if Indy’s No Good Very Bad Night proved to be too much. Thankfully, I didn’t feel the need to, and I was actually really impressed with the titular good boy’s performance, considering Indy had no prior movie training. If you’re a fellow animal lover who’s wary of the film, I understand your hesitation, but </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is an interesting enough experiment that it’s worth seeing, and is surprisingly restrained as far as the horrors it subjects its furry star to.</span></p> <p><span>We won’t get into major spoilers until later, and we’ll put a big ol’ spoiler warning over it if you’re concerned about that, but what I left </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>most excited to talk about was how well it masks Indy’s lack of film experience. After the movie, director and co-writer Ben Leonberg presents a short documentary breaking down how he and his crew managed to pull off a horror movie starring a dog who had no prior training. Indy is Leonberg’s dog, and </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>was filmed with a small crew of people the dog was familiar with. So any time you see his character upset or scared, he’s actually just chilling. Leonberg explains how almost every shot of this pup is only made unnerving or scary by the surrounding shots of ghostly figures and the ominous music.</span></p>

 <p><span>Indy may not know he’s in a movie, but</span><i><span> Good Boy </span></i><span>is tailor-made for him and his perspective. Scenes are shot from his level, and you go long stretches of the movie without seeing a human face. </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>isn’t merely a horror movie with a dog in its cast; it is a horror movie that makes every creative decision in its tight 72-minute runtime to emphasize that he is the star of this waking nightmare. </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>follows Indy as he and his owner, Todd, move from the city to the family’s seemingly haunted rural home. From the outset, Indy sees ghosts his owner doesn’t, and as Todd’s condition worsens, Indy begins to fear they may be a threat to the ailing human.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000618247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618247">© IFC</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Thanks to some smart filmmaking decisions, good editing, and shot composition, Indy is a very emotive actor for someone who has no idea what’s going on. In the documentary, Leonberg and his crew show how they would make sounds from behind the camera to get the dog to look where they needed, and his lack of training meant that they could spend all day shooting and only get a few seconds of usable footage. The whole production took over a year because the team was committed to Indy being the star, and I mean, look at that face. That’s a face made for the big screen.</span></p>

 <p><span>But you’re probably wondering if Indy is shown suffering throughout the movie. The horror genre has a way of putting its stars through grave situations that usually end with them bloodied and battered, if not worse. Without spoilers, I will say that </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is pretty tame as far as what it subjects Indy to for most of the film. I imagine that was a conscious choice, considering, again, Indy isn’t an acting dog, and the more distressing moments his character is put through are some of </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>’s more awkward shots because it was clear the crew didn’t want to stress the pup out, so some scenes, like when Indy stumbles into a fox trap, are a little clunky, but they’re also very quick.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now, for the question a lot of you may be wondering: Does Indy die? I can tell you that </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>doesn’t do a lot of terrible shit to its canine star, and none of that will matter if the poor baby doesn’t make it to the end, right? Well, here’s a spoiler warning, so if you don’t want to know, don’t scroll down any further.</span></p>

   <p><span>No, Indy doesn’t die in </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>, but another dog does. As Indy investigates his new home, he learns about Todd’s recently deceased grandfather, who was also subjected to the horrors of this house. The old man also had a dog named Bandit who could see the same monsters Indy does, and Todd mentions that his grandfather’s dogs all “ran away” over the years. Well, that wasn’t true for at least one of them. At a point later in the film when shit’s getting real, Indy finds Bandit’s skeleton in the house cellar. In a few instances, Bandit’s “ghost” tries to help Indy by guiding him to clues within the house, but he’s only able to do this because he’s already dead under the house. If that’s a deal breaker for you, I understand. But if you’re primarily worried about on-screen dog suffering, </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is as about as light on it as it can be with its premise.</span></p> <p><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is such an interesting, imaginative movie that I do urge people who just enjoy cinema to give it a watch, even if they’re worried the subject matter might be challenging. The movie is an experiment that really pays off because its crew commits, and the moments where it pulls its punches speak to that commitment to its star’s comfort. If the premise scares you off, that’s understandable, but if you’re even mildly curious, as a dog lover myself, I say it’s worth giving it a shot.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> developer Arrowhead Studios still doesn't have a solution for the shooter's groaning installation size on PC — but it is working on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>update</u></a> posted to Steam earlier today, Arrowhead's deputy technical director, Brendan Armstrong, penned the first in a series of posts in which the engineering team talks about the "technical health" of the game, as well as the "technical challenges we're working through."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admitting that the installation size "seems to be a hot topic right now" — at 150GB, Helldivers 2 takes up three times the space on PC than it does on console — the developer revealed that one of the reasons the PC size is so much bigger is because of data duplication and mechanical hard drives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The main issue with a mechanical HDD is seek time," Armstrong explained. "An HDD stores data on a spinning platter, and a physical arm with a read head has to move across the platter to find and retrieve data. The time it takes for this arm to 'seek' or move to the correct location is a significant performance bottleneck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Imagine a large game level with various objects — trees, rocks, buildings, props. If the data for these objects is scattered all over the hard drive, the read head has to physically jump around the disk, which adds a lot of time to the loading process."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, the director added, is why Arrowhead deliberately duplicates certain data files like a common tree texture or a sound effect and "place copies of them in physically close proximity to where they would be needed in the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Much of the data in the PC version of Helldivers 2 is duplicated. The practice of duplicating data to reduce loading times is a game development technique that is primarily used to optimize games for older storage media, particularly mechanical HDDs and optical discs like DVDs," the director explained. "This practice is largely unnecessary for games deployed on Solid State Drives (SSDs) which is why the console versions of Helldivers 2 do not do this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the post admits that with the advent of SSDs — which store data on flash memory chips that have no moving parts — seek time is virtually nonexistent, but as long as mechanical HDDs are part of the minimum spec PC requirements, it has to be included. Steam user surveys are "unable to give us data on mechanical HDD use in the overall gamer population," but Arrowhead's "best estimates" put it at around 12% of all PC gamers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Until we can more accurately determine the number of mechanical HDDs that Helldivers 2 is installed on, it is difficult to know how many players will be impacted by reducing the amount of data duplication," the post said. "Even if that number is small, keep in mind that the load time for each player dropping into a mission is determined by the slowest member of the squad."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2 Review Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Arrowhead grapples with this issue and tries to get better data on how many of their players use mechanical HDDs, the team said it's made "some small gains in the next update" by sweeping for unused assets and "obvious problems," but admits we "will not likely notice them because the new stuff we’ve added will eat those gains."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the longer term, the team will make improvements to the engine to ensure the game doesn't waste RAM loading common data that isn't needed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Beyond that, the remaining work is a bigger, riskier, more speculative project where we apply some kind of compression to the game data and potentially replicate some of the de-duplication we do on consoles," the post concludes. "We don’t yet know if the impacts to load-times could make these approaches infeasible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re taking your concerns very seriously but there are no easy solutions. Until we live in a world where we know that most of our PC players are using SSD drives, sacrificing some extra hard drive space is necessary to ensure we’re all able to load into missions in a reasonable amount of time. We’ve clearly reached the limits of how much duplicated data is acceptable so smarter solutions and compromises are now required. We are very carefully weighing up the costs and tradeoffs of the options we have, and we’ll be sure to find a better balance between loading times and installation size soon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's here, and it's all shiny and new. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop"><u>Pokémon TCG</u></a> has moved on from its Scarlet &amp; Violet series of expansions and is now in its official Mega Evolution era. The first of which is aptly titled "Mega Evolution", and is now available to buy (supposedly). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the US, at least, stock is remarkably scarce; no surprise there. While in Europe and EMEA regions (including the Middle East and Africa), the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/important-notice-about-the-upcoming-pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-expansion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official release has been delayed until October 10, 2025</a>. The Pokémon Company has said this is down to "challenges impacting product delivery dates," which sure clears things up... right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well no. But for now, we're going to focus on where you can <em>actually </em>buy Pokémon TCG: Mega Evolution in the US, and find those elusive ETBs, Booster Bundles, and more in stock. Be sure to bookmark this page and check back often to stay informed. We will keep this page updated when there are developments for the UK and Europe as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To make navigating the preorder chaos as easy as possible, here’s the complete breakdown of where to secure your Mega Evolution boxes, bundles, and packs before launch. Just to note, it'll likely cost you, as finding sealed products like these at a fair price is already a challenge. </p><p id="elite-trainer-boxes-etbs"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Elite Trainer Boxes (ETBs)">Mega Evolution: Elite Trainer Boxes (ETBs)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Evolution is already shaping up to be one of the most competitive Pokémon TCG sets in years, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-symphonia-most-expensive-cards">Mega Lucario ex and Mega Gardevoir ex</a> driving demand through the roof. Unsurprisingly, Elite Trainer Boxes availability is chaotic, and pricing depends heavily on where you shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The retail price is $49.99, but most outlets are out of stock or only show fleeting availability. Best Buy and Walmart do occasionally cycle listings back in at or near MSRP, though they rarely last long once they appear.

                <p>Unlike the previous two entries in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy that launched exclusively for PlayStation consoles--with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/">Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S versions</a> on the way--the third game will adopt a multiplatform release strategy. This means that Square Enix will be developing for multiple consoles and PC for a wide release, but the company doesn't expect this approach to hinder production on the game.</p><p>"We do have designated teams working on each platform so that our multiplatform approach won't impact the development whatsoever," Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi said to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZB4XGfyLrTo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Easy Allies</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-three-wont-be-impacted-by-multiplatform-approach-says-director-despite-xboxs-problematic-lack-of-memory" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>). Hamaguchi did acknowledge that Square Enix was facing some challenges with bringing Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth to Xbox Series X|S, suggesting that a "lack of memory" was to blame.</p><p>"As for the Xbox version, like many other publishers, I think we did see some issues with the lack of memory compared with other platforms," Hamaguchi said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB4XGfyLrTo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZB4XGfyLrTo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Talking about the upcoming Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Hamaguchi sounded confident about the progress being made, with Square Enix engineers working on optimizing the game for the Nintendo console's docked and handheld modes while also focusing on the lighting to improve the overall graphical quality.</p><p>While a release date for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S hasn't been revealed yet, the first game in the saga, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, will launch for both consoles on January 22. One of the new features here will be a progression boost that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-ridiculously-easy-mode-on-switch-2-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6534874/">makes the game ridiculously easy to play</a>, and it'll be added to the PC and PS5 versions via a future update.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-get-proper-high-quality-part-3-despite-rebirths-disappointing-sales/1100-6535048/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 is also currently in development</a>, and despite Rebirth's disappointing sales, Hamaguchi said the saga will conclude with a "proper, high-quality" finale. It hasn't been formally revealed yet, but Final Fantasy producer Tetsuya Nomura recently said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-reveal-date-already-decided-says-nomura/1100-6534518/">Square Enix knows exactly when it will officially reveal</a> the game.</p>

			<p>Along with Microsoft and Xbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">hiking the price of Xbox Game Pass up by 50%</a>, the three tiers of Game Pass also changed, adding new features for each tier. But it also seems like some features were removed, namely the 10% discount that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers would get on add-ons for Call of Duty, including COD Points.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279">CharlieINTEL on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, prior to the price change, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription got you discounts on games included in Game Pass, and in the case of Call of Duty, subscribers also a 10% discount on Call of Duty cosmetic add-ons and COD Points. Not anymore though.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xbox has removed the 10% discount that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members could get on add-on content for Call of Duty - including removing the discount on Call of Duty Points and BlackCell as part of the changes to Game Pass this week. <a href="https://t.co/ipaMgENuwi">pic.twitter.com/ipaMgENuwi</a></p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's the latest example of Microsoft sending a clear message that playing games on Xbox and using Xbox services, including Game Pass, are no longer for people trying to save money on their annual gaming spend.</p>



<p>Removing a 10% discount is the kind of squeezing that, after a price hike for Game Pass, which followed a price hike of the Xbox Series consoles in the US (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">the second console price hike this year</a>), will only work to drive a bigger and bigger wedge between Xbox and its players. It's the kind of thing that leads people who have been with the Xbox platform since the beginning <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-xbox-generation-will-be-remembered-for-one-thing-greed">to write features lambasting the greed Microsoft has shown</a>.</p>



<p>Pretty much everything coming out of Xbox lately has told players they will have to pay a premium to play games on Xbox. It's no wonder that after the console price hikes, Microsoft removing the ability for players to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">redeem Microsoft Points towards Game Pass subs</a>, and of course, the price hike of Game Pass itself, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/">players swarmed to Microsoft's website to cancel their Game Pass subscriptions</a>.</p>



<p>Actual living essentials are already increasing and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">encouraging people to spend less on non-essential areas of their lives, like videogames</a>. The decision to leave Xbox and its services behind is made even easier when Microsoft is simultaneously raising prices and removing discounts.  </p>

            <p>Lo, when we perform the great ritual to open the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> beta, the cheaters will come. That's what Activision said a few days ago, more or less. Hark, friends and foes enveloped in tactical gear and the occasional goofy crossover skin, it's now a few days later and the cheatening is upon us. It arrived with the beta going live, just as prophesised.</p>

</p></div>
<p>Cue posts like the one above, from helpless souls caught in the frothing swirl of the cheatening maelstrom. And cue responses from Activision's powerful anti-cheat druids, writing of these foretold ritual side-effects things like: "This clip was from earlier today. The account was already banned."</p>
<p>The bearded warders against the likes of wallhacks and aimbotting have even broken out a powerful magical artefact, the hammer emoji of reassurance, in their responses to clips like this, a number of which went viral on the tweeter last night. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/">Reddit</a>, as a far as I can tell, looks relatively free of such clippage or anger about cheating, which is a sign of the end times if I've ever seen one.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>It's at this point that Activision would want us all to take solace in their prediction from <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">this blog post</a> a few days ago, AKA the prophecy I paraphrased earlier. "Cheaters will try to test the limits during the Beta," it read. "That’s exactly what we want because #TeamRICOCHET is here, watching, learning, and removing them as they appear. Any account permanently banned for cheating during the Beta will be banned across all Call of Duty titles, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> to future releases."</p><p>Obviously, this isn't an affliction unique to Call of Duty. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-battlefield-6-betas-hacking-problem-shows-the-difficulty-in-playing-cat-and-mouse-with-cheaters">James eloquently outlined when Battlefield 6's beta was similarly afflicted by cheating</a>, despite both it and Blops 7 seeing studios take the extra step of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">making it mandatory for PC players to enable secure boot</a> in an effort to curb tech-savvy tricksters. The debate is whether continuing to take more and more measures like that in an effort to whack whatever persistent cheating moles keep popping up or slipping through the array of defenses already assembled is worth any inconvenience caused to those playing fairly as a result.</p>
<p>It's a delicate balance to strike, and where you stand on the issue may well depend on just how many cheaters you've happened to run into in online games over the years and the situations in which those encounters happened.  In Black Ops 7's case, there's also arguably a little bit of irony in Activion's strong stance, due to the ability to temporarily see and shoot foes through several layers of wall, a bit like some cheats allow you to do permanently, actually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amid-call-of-dutys-war-on-cheating-black-ops-7-says-ehh-whatever-heres-a-wallhack-esque-killstreak">being in the game as a killstreak reward</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I await Black Ops 7's full release on November 14th, at which point I prophesise that the cheating chatter will emerge once more. That's provided the round of cheat chatter prompted by Battlefield 6's arrival on October 10th has actually managed to dissipate by mid-November.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Netflix’s gaming strategy <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-app-subscription-team-blue-1851755122">has yet to take clear shape</a>, but generative AI could end up being a big part of it. Or at least that’s what the company seems to hope for, based on a recent job posting. The <em>Squid Games </em>and <em>Stranger Things</em> streaming giant is looking to hire a director of generative AI for gaming to potentially lead implementation of the experimental technology across its game studios. They’ll be paid up to $840K for the honor.</p> <p>Shared <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kendrawcandraw.bsky.social/post/3m2aecshw2k2e">on Bluesky</a> by the comic writer and artist Kendra Wells, <a href="https://explore.jobs.netflix.net/careers?query=AI&amp;pid=790304524254&amp;domain=netflix.com&amp;sort_by=relevance">the listing</a> describes how this prospective leader within the company’s gaming division will “define and lead the Gen AI strategy across Netflix Games, helping to shape foundational infrastructure to player-facing features” and “identify and evaluate opportunities to apply Gen AI across our portfolio and studios both in the creation of new experiences and improving our workflows and pipelines.”</p>

 <p>The position, posted back in September, is onsite in Los Angeles, California and, thanks to state disclosure laws, advertises a salary band of $430,000 to $840,000. Netflix laid off developers at its <em>Oxenfree</em> maker Night School Studio who probably weren’t making close to a million each <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">earlier this year</a>.</p>   <p>This isn’t Netflix’s first foray into generative AI gaming. The division’s previous boss, Mike Verdu, held the title VP of GenAI for Games until earlier this year when he <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-mike-verdu-exit-gdc">abruptly left the company</a>. “Many view this technology with fear, but I am a game-maker at heart and I see its potential to unlock all of us, to create mind-blowing new experiences for players, to lift us to new heights,” the industry veteran <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7259029850827423744/">wrote in a 2024 LinkedIn post</a> complete with AI-slop imagery. “Yes, we’ll have to adapt and change, but when have we failed to meet that challenge as an industry?”</p> <p>His replacement, former Epic Games exec Alain Tascan, took over in March and <a href="https://kotaku.com/spirit-crossing-netflix-trailer-mobile-tv-cozy-mmo-sim-1851771671">said Netflix’s evolving gaming strategy</a> would focus on party games, narrative games, and quick mobile adaptations of its hit franchises. Its first Smart TV games are supposed to launch later this year, while <em>Spirit</em> <em>Crossing</em>, a cozy MMO sim that mashes together <em>Animal Crossing</em> and Studio Ghibli vibes, will be the test of whether it can finally deliver a breakout hit. It walked away from <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">its AAA blockbuster gaming ambitions last year</a>. Who knows if this exploration of generative AI-influenced gaming will be just as short-lived?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> takes up around 150GB to install on PC (three times larger than on console), and the game's deputy technical director has now explained why that won't be changing anytime soon.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286">blog post on Steam</a>, Arrowhead's Brendan Armstrong explained for the PC version the developers utilised data duplication to reduce loading times, something that's primarily used to optimise games for HDDs.</p>
<p>As the older storage drives use a physical arm to read data, duplicating that data can make it quicker to find and thereby reduce loading times. SSDs don't work in this way, which explains why the console versions of Helldivers 2 take up less storage space.</p>

<p>However, as Armstrong acknowledged, HDDs are part of the game's minimum specs on PC but the studio doesn't know how many players are still using them.</p>
<p>"Our best estimates put it at around 12 percent of all PC gamers but the data is very unreliable and relies on a lot of extrapolations," said Armstrong. "Until we can more accurately determine the number of mechanical HDDs that Helldivers 2 is installed on, it is difficult to know how many players will be impacted by reducing the amount of data duplication. Even if that number is small, keep in mind that the load time for each player dropping into a mission is determined by the slowest member of the squad."</p>
<p>Still, the studio is "actively exploring" a number of solutions for the future, although it "cannot eliminate all duplication without making loading times for mechanical HDDs 10 times slower and we do not feel that this is acceptable".</p>
<p>In the short term, unused assets will be removed in the next update, though these will be replaced by new additions so won't reduce the amount of storage space required.</p>
<p>A medium term solution is to bundle frequently used assets and remove duplicates, though Armstrong admitted this would increase load times for players using HDDs. In the long term, engine improvements are planned to not waste RAM loading data that isn't needed.</p><p>A further solution would be to make the highest resolution textures an optional download. However, this isn't natively supported in Arrowhead's engine so would be a substantial project, Armstrong explained. As such, time on this would not be spent elsewhere on optimising performance or fixing stability issues.</p>
<p>"We're taking your concerns very seriously but there are no easy solutions," Armstrong surmised. "Until we live in a world where we know that most of our PC players are using SSD drives, sacrificing some extra hard drive space is necessary to ensure we're all able to load into missions in a reasonable amount of time. We've clearly reached the limits of how much duplicated data is acceptable so smarter solutions and compromises are now required. We are very carefully weighing up the costs and tradeoffs of the options we have, and we'll be sure to find a better balance between loading times and installation size soon."</p>
<p>As a broader issue of game size, Armstrong's reasoning explains why many modern games on PC now require an SSD, even as a minimum requirement. Arrowhead has instead aimed Helldivers 2 at a wider spectrum of PC specs, but this comes at a storage cost.</p>
<p>This blog post is the first of what the developer aims to be a series of posts detailing the technical challenges it's working on.</p>
<p>An update for Helldivers 2 is due later this month to alleviate a number of performance issues players are currently experiencing, particularly as the game has grown in size and content since release.</p>

              <p>Prime Big Deals Day is coming next week. Through the day on October 7 and October, you can save big on a ton of great stuff all across Amazon. Whatever it is you’ve been waiting on for a good deal, you might be able to finally pull the trigger as you see the price drop low. We’ll be seeing products across every category from power banks to microwaves to other power banks going on sale. If you are feeling antsy and don’t want to wait that wrong for something to give you that hit of dopamine that buying new things give you, good news. There are already some great stuff on sale right now. Do you like Lego? Of course you do. Everyone does. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4464/">Well, this Lego dancing Groot set has dropped from $45 to just $36. That 20% savings amounts to $9 you get to keep in your wallet.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4464/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>This Groot Actually Dances</h2>
<p>Groot who first showed up on the big screen in 2014’s <em>Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;</em>has taken many shapes and sizes in his various appearances throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the comics before that. Though, it is this writer’s humble opinion that the best version of this walking tree man is the one that didn’t walk at all. You may have forgotten he was once smaller than Baby Groot in the second&nbsp;<em>Guardians</em> flick. In the post credits scene following the first of the trilogy, we saw the new Groot come to life as a tiny twig in his pot, dancing to the music stylings of The Jackson 5.</p>
<p>This dancing Groot can be yours in Lego form. The <strong>459-piece set</strong> is fully posable with a head and arms that turn and move. At the back of the pot once fully constructed is a handle you can crank which makes Groot waist shift back and forth and arms go up and down, effectively making the little guy dance right before your eyes.</p>



<p>The flower pot can also be used to store extra pieces and accessories. The dancing Lego Groot does come with three different name plates. One depicts his iconic catchphrase (and practically only phrase), “I am Groot.” Another has the title on the movie while the last also shows the title of the movie but in James Gunn’s made-up space language. Lego Groot also comes with some extra leaves, headphones, and eve sunglasses which can be added or removed like some kind of modern-day Mr. Potato Head.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4464/">The Lego dancing Groot make for a great gift for Marvel fans of all ages. Get it for 20% off for a limited time.</a></p>

              <p>Players are still <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">discovering new ways</a> in which their Xbox Game Pass subscriptions <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=+kotaku+xbox+game+pass&amp;sca_esv=1001961491ba09a8&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifOqnIJ-sk57N88LRgENtAPrEj6Ttg%3A1759496735838&amp;ei=H8rfaKH2MrOqptQPq6vCwQg&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhgbGPjIiQAxUzlYkEHauVMIgQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=+kotaku+xbox+game+pass&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiFiBrb3Rha3UgeGJveCBnYW1lIHBhc3NISFAAWABwAHgBkAEAmAEAoAEAqgEAuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIAoAIAmAMA4gMFEgExIECSBwCgBwCyBwC4BwDCBwDIBwA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">are getting worse</a>. <em>Call of Duty</em> is the latest target, with a 10-percent discount on <em>Call of Duty</em> points and add-on content like the BlackCell premium battle pass bundles. While small, the savings can quickly add up for dedicated fans over the annual lifecycle of a new entry in the series like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>.</p> <p>Spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1973938451830747279%7Ctwgr%5E2120216adb854b9deedab5678f7e582be9eee66d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">by <em>CharlieIntel</em></a>, the 10-percent discount on buying<em> Call of Duty</em> points no longer appears for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers in the Xbox store. This impacts any add-on content players buy throughout the year, of which there is increasingly a ton. It’s another stealth nerf to the program not mentioned in Microsoft’s official blog post about the pricing changes this week. PC Game Pass going from $12 a month to $16.49 wasn’t listed either.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xbox has removed the 10% discount that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members could get on add-on content for Call of Duty – including removing the discount on Call of Duty Points and BlackCell as part of the changes to Game Pass this week. <a href="https://t.co/ipaMgENuwi">pic.twitter.com/ipaMgENuwi</a></p> <p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also the second discount that’s eroded under the new version of what used to be considered the best deal in gaming. Microsoft is also capping the Xbox Rewards fans can earn at lower tiers of the Game Pass subscription, as well as removing the option to spend those loyalty program points on additional months of Game Pass for a cheaper price. “They’ve been slowly enshitifying Rewards for a while now but this really is the nail in the coffin for anyone who uses points to pay for Game Pass,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1nujypo/microsoft_rewards_starting_october_1st_users_will/">wrote</a> one user on the subreddit. “You simply can’t earn enough in a month to pay for a month after this change.”</p> <p>Microsoft had previously teased the release of its first $80 games this fall beginning with<em> The Outer Worlds 2</em>, but ultimately ended up reversing course amid an ongoing backlash from players and likely soft-preorder numbers for the upcoming RPG shooter. So far at least, the tech giant hasn’t offered any signs it plans to compromise on the latest price hikes, even as it touts Game Pass’ profitability and annual revenue of $5 billion. “They’re on their villain arc,” one player <a href="https://x.com/MalikRules_/status/1973944018406179308">quipped</a> in response to the <em>Call of Duty</em> discount change.</p>

<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159351/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Disgaea fans know the drill by now. Whenever a new mainline entry in the long-running tactical RPG series breaks onto the scene, it’s only a matter of time before it gets a re-released edition that bundles in the base game’s DLC along with a suite of gameplay tweaks and additions. It’s series tradition at this point, as every single numbered Disgaea game to date has received an expanded version (or even a couple) post-release. Now, with the Western release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">Disgaea 7 Complete</a> at hand, the latest title in Nippon Ichi Software’s zany crown jewel of a franchise is ready to join its brethren in the Valhalla of unparalleled game definitiveness.</p>
<p>D7C takes 2023’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disgaea_7_vows_of_the_virtueless">Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless</a> and repackages it with a plethora of brand-new additions, like a special bonus campaign episode and a new superboss to conquer. The title doesn’t lie — this is the ultimate version of Disgaea 7 and it completely supersedes the original release as the ideal way to experience the game.</p>
<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159349/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For some current and potential fans, that alone is reason enough to dive in on this release. That said, others — especially those who already picked up the base game on Switch or other platforms — may be wondering whether there’s enough value added to justify double-dipping. Unfortunately, the answer as to whether to pick up this definitive edition isn’t quite so definitive itself.</p>
<p>Just as in the base game, Disgaea 7 Complete centres upon the story of two unlikely leads. The ruthless demon warrior Fuji wanders the feudal Japan-inspired realm of Hinomoto, a land that has been plunged into a dark era under the ruling shogunate. In a chance meeting, he encounters Pirilika, a bubbly, ultra-rich corporate elite and self-proclaimed Hinomoto otaku. Spurred to action by the populace’s abandonment of bushidō (the Japanese term for the samurai code of honour), Pirilika contracts Fuji as her bodyguard, and the two embark on a wacky quest throughout the Netherworlds to gather the Founding Weapons and defeat the dark forces in control of Hinomoto.</p>
<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159350/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In Mitch’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/disgaea-7-vows-of-the-virtueless">original review of Disgaea 7</a>, he described the game as “the ultimate distillation of the Disgaea experience” and praised both its irreverent tone and its handling of the series’ classic gameplay hook of training units up to ludicrous power levels and dealing eye-popping amounts of damage in turn-based tactical battles. Those observations all still ring true for this re-release, so give Mitch’s review a readthrough for a deeper dive into the game’s core.</p>
<p>But the crux is this: There are very few tactics RPGs out there that can even hold a candle to the level of flexibility, depth, and freedom that Disgaea 7 offers in its gameplay. At every turn, you’re encouraged to experiment with and exploit the game’s mechanics, all in service of building a team that can utterly destroy even the most absurdly difficult challenges. Simply put, you get out what you put in, and the game can be as simplistic and straightforward or as mind-bendingly complex as you prefer.</p>
<p>Disgaea 7 Complete still has that same great core, but what actually sets it apart from the base game? Well, not much — during the core campaign, at least. For anyone who did play the game’s original release, those first 20 to 30 hours in which you progress through the main story are awfully familiar. Aside from all of the DLC episodes and bonuses being available from the get-go, the primary campaign here remains largely unchanged.</p>
<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159344/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>All of its brand-new gameplay additions are locked behind the post-game, and some require a not-insignificant time investment to access. Returning players hoping to retain their hard-earned save file progress from the base game and skip right to the new stuff are out of luck, too, as there’s no upgrade path available between the two versions.</p>
<p>Not having any significant brand-new content to experience until the post-game is a bummer, but once you finally reach those fresh additions, they’re pretty neat. Perhaps the most substantial piece of new content is the Nethertime Support Force episode. This mini-campaign, set after the main story, sees Fuji, Pirilika, and the rest of the crew crossing paths with characters from previous Disgaea titles and engaging in a couple of fun and unique battle maps along the way.</p>
<p>For fans of the greater series, these crossover cameos serve as a great bit of fan service, though the lack of voice acting for these sequences is disappointing. Clearing this episode also unlocks Asagi — a legacy character who many Disgaea enthusiasts are no doubt acquainted with — as a playable unit, which is a nice little bonus.</p>
<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159352/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from that, several exclusive post-game bills have been added to the Dark Assembly that offer some entertaining gameplay additions. The Freely Use Infernal Treasures! bill, when unlocked and passed, allows any unit you have to equip one of the titular weapons and enter the powered-up Hell Mode during battle. Then, there’s the Take Me Beyond the Limits! bill, which lifts the previously-held caps on unit stats and allows you to power them up to an even greater degree of insanity.</p>
<p>Offering yet more ways to tweak and strengthen your units is Disgaea’s bread and butter, and these smart additions give any unit you’ve trained — whether it’s a story-relevant character or a custom character you scouted and built from the ground up — an equal shot at becoming your team’s next big-hitter.</p>
<p>The final addition of note is the inclusion of a new, ultra-difficult superboss in the form of Rakshasa Baal. In keeping with superbosses from Disgaea history, this challenge is intended solely for those who are committed to spending hour after hour delving deep into the game’s mechanics and raising units to a formidable degree.</p>
<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159346/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While it’s cool to add yet another lofty objective for Disgaea devotees to clear, this last piece of content hammers home a crucial point about Disgaea 7 Complete: pretty much all of the new stuff added to this release exclusively appeals to pre-existing Disgaea players or people who intend to spend a ton (and I mean a ton) of time with the game once the main campaign has concluded. Even then, it’s not a revolutionary amount of new content, and franchise fans may have been hoping for a bit more to justify picking up this re-release.</p>
<p>I’d also be remiss in not mentioning the odd nature of Disgaea 7 Complete’s Western release. Even though the game launched in Japan in 2024 for the regular ol’ Switch, this localisation is launching exclusively on the Switch 2 with no Switch 1 version in sight (at least, at the time of review).</p>
<p>It’s certainly nice to play natively on Switch 2, on which performance is as smooth as can be, but it’s strange to eschew a localised Switch 1 version when the game can demonstrably run just fine on that hardware. This decision also means that Disgaea 7 Complete can only be purchased digitally or as a Game-Key Card, a move that is sure to ruffle the feathers of a number of would-be players.</p>
<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159348/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps some substantial Switch 2 enhancements would have made this weird release strategy an easier pill to swallow, but there are none to speak of. I would have very much appreciated integration with the Switch 2’s mouse controls for the map cursor in the hopes of alleviating how finicky maps can get with varying elevations — my one major grievance with the moment-to-moment gameplay. Alas.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With how stellar a package the Vows of the Virtueless proved to be upon release, the expanded and feature-packed Disgaea 7 Complete should be a slam dunk of a recommendation to any tactical RPG fan — but re-releases are rarely that simple. For anyone who missed out on the original the first time around, this version is every bit as great and stands tall as the ultimate, feature-complete iteration of the game.</p>
<p>At the same time, there’s no denying that the handful of brand-new content additions fall on the niche side and mostly serve those who want to live and breathe Disgaea 7 for their next hundred-plus hours of game time. Even stalwart fans who loved the base game may want to think twice before dropping the price of admission on this updated version and starting from scratch for a couple of post-game goodies.</p></section>

			<p>Earlier this year, DOOM: The Dark Ages became the sixth PC game (not counting RTX remakes like those made for Quake II and Portal) to support real-time path tracing after Cyberpunk 2077, DESORDRE, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. </p>



<p>id Software's latest entry in the DOOM franchise did not support the technology at launch. Still, a month later, on June 18, 2025, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-pc-performance-slaying-demons-never-looked-better-nvidia-dlss-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released an update introducing path tracing and NVIDIA's DLSS Ray Reconstruction</a>. Both features significantly improved the game's visual quality and made it, alongside its excellent performance, a benchmark against which developers must compare their work.</p>



<p>This week, NVIDIA <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-id-software-used-neural-rendering-and-path-tracing-in-doom-the-dark-ages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a Q&amp;A with id Software's Director of Engine Technology</a>, Billy Khan, to discuss the studio's implementation of path tracing. According to Khan, it took the Texas-based studio around six months to implement the technology in their game. The programmer also shared the belief that more games will make the leap from ray tracing to path tracing in the coming years.  </p>



<p><em>Path tracing is now part of id Tech 8. We’ll continue research and development in this area. As with all technology, we evaluate its use on a per-game basis to ensure it meets the needs of the game and delivers value to players. I believe path tracing will continue to evolve and will be used in more games in the coming years. </em></p>



<p>Of course, game developers' adoption will likely accelerate if, as rumored, future AMD graphics cards <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-details-how-next-gen-udna-gpus-could-boost-ray-tracing-with-dense-geometry-format/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are going to offer significant ray tracing optimizations</a>. Meanwhile, Khan mentioned NVIDIA's Opacity Micro-Maps and Shader Execution Reordering, the latter specifically, as highly helpful for optimization in DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>



<p><em>For high-performance, visually complex scenes, optimizing both surface shading and transparency is crucial. Techniques that allow the GPU to intelligently reorder shading work and skip unnecessary calculations—like on pixels fully occluded by alpha-tested geometry—yield significant speedups. Both NVIDIA Opacity Micro-Map (OMM) and Shader Execution Reordering (SER) have been extremely useful for optimizing surface shading on the GPU. Some of our biggest optimizations for path tracing resulted from utilizing shader execution reordering.</em></p>



<p>Lastly, Khan noted that DLSS RR really helped surface all the amazing details enabled by path tracing.</p>



<p><em>DLSS Ray Reconstruction added much-needed fidelity to denoising our path-traced results while preserving more detail. It’s a strong improvement in performance and quality over traditional denoising techniques. I’m excited to see further innovation here, which will empower more devices to play games with higher visual fidelity.</em></p>



<p>Did you play DOOM: The Dark Ages (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our game review is here</a>, by the way) with path tracing on? If so, what was your impression of id Software's implementation? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first episode of Critical Role Campaign 4 is now available, and with it the first episode helmed by Brennan Lee Mulligan, played in by Matthew Mercer and his fellow twelve players, and our introduction to the world of Araman and its people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Critical Role: Campaign 4 doesn't start with a bang. With a fiery explosion or a world on the brink, but with a quiet moment. A moment between brothers, one whose neck is about to have a noose tied around it, and the other who is trying to do what they can to save him.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-character-sheets.jpg?itok=g3TkADRh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-character-sheets.jpg?itok=GLAE1h__ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Liam starts at the table alone as Halandil Fang. For a table that shifts between a dozen characters I was a bit worried going into the season about how disorienting getting introduced to so many characters would be. Getting to meet just one, join them in their hope for a way to save their brother, and then watch it all be for nought what a perfect introduction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From here we move through an afternoon of mourning at the Fang home as Azure, Luis, brings the body to the wake. Aabria and Alex arrive to confirm Hal and pay respects, and a variety of other colorful (black is a color too) characters that had ties to Thiazi.</p>

<p>I would have never expected for a funeral to be the perfect place to introduce these characters but as ever character filed in we were able to perfectly get an introduction to them from who they are in the context of the city, who they are in relation to Thiazi and each other, what part they had to play in trying to rescue him, and how they're feeling that the plan was not successful…</p>

<p>There was some unavoidable word vomit of noble houses, places within the city and across the land of Araman, and factions but it never felt like knowing or focusing on that was important as you were drawn into such a relatable feeling of loss.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-aabria-and-ashley_0.jpg?itok=6sGwgysk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-aabria-and-ashley_0.jpg?itok=wGNkzUKd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Among the characters introduced, while all were fascinating to watch, Aabria Iengar and Ashley Johnson gave elevated performances.</p>

<p>From the moment Aabria arrived she brought with her the energy of a mother, a friend and partner, and a mentor. Once again playing the ex of another party member this time the relationship isn't a strained one, but one of two people on different paths.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This energy continued to evolve as she had a speedy "enemies to best friends" moment with Tyranny, had nothing but love for Arinessa, and an intense hatred for Sir Julien Davison. I particularly loved the way that Aabria used her druid abilities, creating vines and a beast spirit to continue conferring funeral rights, that she was able to project her characters internal emotions for all to see while not having to resort to soliloquy.</p>

<p>Immediately, I recognized what Sam Riegel spoke to me about last week, that in this larger group it became all the more important for characters to take what time they have and shine bright. Subtlety famously isn't great in actual plays so it's important the audience understands characters relationships and intentions, especially when meeting so many over the house of four hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Johnson's character, an immortal drow still engaged by the loss of their God, was stoic and cold from start to finish. From the moment she approached the table she dominated the scene while remaining cool and collected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it was incredible to see Johnson so deep in her role it was just as wonderful to see Brennan ask her to roll a side and her immediately panic and she attempted to wake her tablet and remember what her Insight bonus is.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-whitney-and-sam_0.jpg?itok=cpwqgfjF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-whitney-and-sam_0.jpg?itok=5gtmiVKG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>So far the character that I feel was the least developed in the ensemble was Tyranny. A tiefling rebelling against polite society whose present situation, and notable anecdote include getting drunk and throwing up did feel shallow compared to the other performances. Her and Riegel did have a fun double act between the performative holy man and the devil trying to act better.</p>

<p>Each other character seems established in their roles and who they are, and it's in this way that Tyranny has a serious narrative advantage. Currently she's a blank slate, a character with so much room to grow and hundreds of game hours to develop. Episode 1 might not be my favorite, but I can't wait to see Tyranny in 10, 30, 100 episodes time.</p>

<p>Outside of character introductions, a mystery was being set up, and a macguffin has gone missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following who I assume will be the more soldiery characters of Teor, Azure, Thimble, Kattigan, (and maybe Occtis?) we are presented with a number of unanswered questions: How was Thimble found and attacked? Who got away with the Stone of Nightsone? Is there a traitor in their midsts? If the sigil was still with Thimble, then what was it that Hal detected on Thiazi?</p>

<p>These kinds of questions getting mentioned, but never dwelled on was a perfect way to sew the seeds of intrigue.</p>

<p>We're one episode in, statistically less than 1% of the way into the campaign, but so far it's very promising. In just a single episode I feel that the plot has done an excellent job introducing us to characters and beginning to intrigue the players and viewers as to where this story might be heading next.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we continue through the overture, and players play musical chairs diving in and out of scenes I feel that everything is going to continue to be a bit confusing and fast paced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the true strength of the campaign will be seen once smaller groups are made, goals are known, and we're able to really get into the meat of the campaign.</p>

<p>Of course, being something of a master builder ourselves <em>*shines counterfeit master builder badge*</em>, we already got our hands on one, and have been busy building away at a set that, for the price of $59.99/£54.99, has provided a whole lot of very nice nostalgia.</p>
<p>Indeed, given that this particular writer is fond of the odd adult Lego set or two, this dinky little gaming delight really has stood out as one of the more fun builds that the company has put out in a while. What grabs you most at first, obviously, is the incredible attention to detail. Everything you remember is here, looking way closer to the original console than we'd thought it possible to get with bricks of plastic.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6ysxtgv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>The real joy, though, comes in piecing together the layers of history; the Game Boy's little circuit board, those iconic 'A' and 'B' buttons and so on, with each significant part being put together and set to feel just like the real thing in lots of creative ways: a little rubber Lego piece under the D-Pad so it moves around and reacts as it should; the on/off switch is <em>just</em> stiff enough; the volume and contrast wheels move just like we remember, and on and on.</p>

<p>Oh, and you've got to see these little lenticular screens actually moving. There are different qualities when it comes to these things, and these ones are top-notch; the Nintendo Logo, along with the Zelda and Mario Bros. scenes that come with the set, are a lot of fun to lay into the 'screen' inset for display. They've even managed to make loading the carts feel perfect (they click into place very satisfyingly), and the interchangeable screens are easy to remove and replace, meaning we'll actually switch them out from time to time.</p>
<p>There are a few other surprises hidden throughout the build — little attentions to detail all around — but we won't ruin <em>everything!</em> Here are some more shots of our own build:</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is considerably more powerful than its predecessor, but a recent online comparison shows the original Switch could have held its own better against the new console with a few key hardware tweaks.</p>



<p>The video comparison shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030">naga</a> compares loading speed, handheld and docked performance in multiple games, and battery life between the current generation Nintendo system and <a href="https://wccftech.com/overclocked-nintendo-switch-playstation-3-games-rpcs3/">an overclocked modded "pro" version of a Nintendo Switch OLED</a>. The modded system's hardware includes an overclocked CPU (1707 MHz) and GPU (1724 MHz), 8 GB of RAM, an upgraded 8600 mAh battery, and modded cooling to prevent damage to the system.</p>



<p>While loading speed in games such as The Witcher 3, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is much faster on Nintendo Switch 2, the difference isn't massive in other games, such as Hogwarts Legacy. Even in terms of handheld and docked performance in backward-compatible games, the differences aren't huge. </p>



<p>In GRID Autosport in handheld mode, for example, the two systems are an almost complete match, with the Nintendo Switch 2 sporting better frametimes thanks to its more powerful CPU. Docked performance is also impressive on the modded Nintendo Switch, as Zelda: Breath of the Wild runs at close to 60 FPS most of the time, although at a clearly lower resolution than the Nintendo Switch 2 edition.</p>



<p>In some unpatched games, however, the performance comparison between the two systems becomes more interesting. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, the modded Nintendo Switch runs the game at smooth 60 FPS, as opposed to the locked 30 FPS on Nintendo Switch 2. The modded system can run Metroid Prime Remastered at 1440p resolution while maintaining a solid 60 FPS framerate. With Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, the modded Nintendo Switch also has no trouble pushing the framerate to a steady 60 FPS, while the unpatched game on Nintendo Switch 2 continues to be locked at 30 FPS.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While comparing how unpatched backward compatible games run on the two systems may be a little unfair, the comparison shows how some design decisions, such as the limited amount of RAM, held back the original Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't have similar constraints, and it shows, as it runs some PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S ports surprisingly well, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-better-anticipated-switch-2-footage/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. The new entry in the CAPCOM series, in particular, is setting out to be another benchmark release for the system, so much so that <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-surprised-how-well-it-runs-switch-2/">even the development team was surprised at how well the game runs on the system.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher vedinad has announced that their 3D&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-esque roguelite game&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;has managed to hit a major sales milestone within its first two weeks on sale.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1973773917040111965" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> on social media,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>has crossed a million sales since it was released on September 18th. Humorously, vedinad says they'll be "eating spaghetti with EXTRA sauce tonight" as a result of the sales milestone.</p>

<p>The developer also says they "really appreciate" the feedback fans have provided for&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>since its launch, and that there are "definitely a lot of things [they] wanna fix and change". A roadmap could be on the way, but vedinad says they're taking a few days off due to being "a bit overwhelmed and tired", so don't expect it imminently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/megabonk-sales-1m-running.jpg?itok=CqtAF_0H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/megabonk-sales-1m-running.jpg?itok=QJ9wTizz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>has racked up a million sales since being released around two weeks ago.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Megabonk</em>'s million-sale milestone puts it in the same league as games like Konami's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">Silent Hill f</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a></i>, both of which had hit a million sales at last count, although they got there a little quicker (as you'd expect from established franchises).</p>

<p>In indie terms,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;is now on the same page as hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sultans-game-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">card-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">driving roguelite&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em></a>, so however you slice it, vedinad's game is in some pretty good company.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>, it's an action roguelite that combines the wave-based combat of games like&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>with full 3D movement and traversal, adding another layer to the formula's strategy element.</p>

<p>Just like in&nbsp;<em>Survivors</em>-esque games, you'll have to survive against infinite waves of enemies in procedurally-generated maps, but you'll now have to worry about things like verticality and positioning yourself in a 3D space.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it'll set you back $10 or your regional equivalent.
