<p>Is that looking... less tarnished?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We might have to wait a little while longer than expected until we can see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> in its full glory on Switch 2, but the title is still popping up at games expos around the world, giving us plenty of opportunities to see it in action.</p>
<p>The latest slice of hands-on time came from the Milan Games Week 2025, where '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Coreydaflame">Corey Da Flame</a>' captured the over-the-shoulder footage found above (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/nuevo-gameplay-de-elden-ring-en-nintendo-switch-2-muestra-mejoras-en-el-rendimiento/">Nintenderos</a>). It's the same opening section that we have seen played on Switch 2 a couple of times now, and off-screen recording is never the <em>best</em> way to get an idea of things from a performance perspective, but things seem... less tarnished than we were expecting.</p>
<p>Okay, it's no PS5 build, but as far as talk of the Switch 2 version goes, it looks pretty darn fine. Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">initial impressions of the game in handheld</a> were rather rough, and while things certainly seemed to be a step in the right direction when getting our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/first-footage-of-elden-ring-running-on-switch-2-appears-online">first look at the game in docked</a>, the latest footage suggests that things are getting better still.</p>
<p>Again, we won't know for sure until the full game comes our way at some point next year — and we don't <em>only</em> have over-the-shoulder footage to go off. At the time of writing, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition is still hanging with a vague '2026' release window after FromSoftware decided to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/elden-ring-delayed-on-switch-2-to-allow-time-for-performance-adjustments">delay</a> the port back in October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Fans of the stealth series Styx will have to wait a little longer for the titular goblin to return. After it was initially set to arrive sometime in 2025, developer Cyanide Studio and publisher Nacon have confirmed that the game has been delayed, and will no longer make its 2025 release window. The silver lining in all of this is that while we know it won't be out this year, we do have a release date for next year, as Styx: Blades of Greed is set to arrive on February 19, 2026.</p>



<p>A release date trailer accompanied a post on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3290690/view/529864539779367425?l=english">game's Steam page announcing the delay</a>, which also includes a snide comment from Styx, where he says, "<em>What? I'm not late, I just like making you wait."</em></p>



<p>The post on the game's Steam page includes a similar tone, with Cyanide Studio - speaking in character as Styx -  writing, "<em>Yeah, yeah, I know, waiting isn’t your favorite thing. Mine either. </em><em>(Unless I’m waiting in the dark to stab someone, of course)</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The devs are taking a few extra months to polish everything up, tweak the bits that need tweaking, and make sure my grand return is as glorious </em><em>(and chaotic)</em> as it deserves to be. <em>A much more sharper adventure. One worthy of slipping back into my slightly grimy, perfectly stylish boots.</em>"</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-gamescom-hands-on-preview-not-for-the-faint-of-heart/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo got the chance to preview</a> Styx: Blades of Greed during Gamescom 2025. Though its hardcore approach to stealth might not be for everyone, it still presents as an interesting game that will likely please fans of the originals. "<em>Though a little complex at times, the Styx: Blades of Greed Gamescom demo did an excellent job showcasing how the third entry in the series will elevate the franchise to new heights. With the abilities and tools on show being so diverse and versatile, I'm really interested to see what else the game will offer when it launches this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how fans of the original games and newcomers to the series take to it when it arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on February 19, 2026.</p>

              <p>Whether you’ve accepted the PvP nature of PvPvE extraction shooter <i>Arc Raiders</i> or not, getting betrayed still sucks. Getting stabbed in the back always feels unnecessarily mean <i>and</i> there’s no direct way to get some revenge, as the odds of you running into and recognizing the same person in a future game are pretty low.</p> <p>But a new community resource hopes to change that.</p> <p>Enter <a href="https://speranzabounties.com/">Speranza Bounties</a>, a fan-made site that does just what you think it does: publicly tracks troublesome rats up to no good out there in the Rust Belt (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-bounty-hunting-fansite/">h/t <i>Polygon</i></a>). Not only can you check to see what active bounties are on deserving players, which includes information such as what bad deeds they committed (extraction camping, lying, bait and switches, etc), but you can also post your own. All you need is a player’s Embark ID, which you can find by looking at who killed you in the post-game carnage report.</p>

 <p>Speranza Bounties keeps track of all bounties for 30 days, after which they expire. So if you find yourself on this naughty list, just lay low for about a month. The site also awards you with titles for taking down a player with an active bounty.</p>

 <h2>PvP could use a little extra love in <i>Arc Raiders</i></h2> <p>I’ll gladly get sent back to Speranza on this hill: PvP belongs in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. We don’t need exclusive PvP modes or maps or a PvE mode.</p> <p>That said, every time I get downed by another player, damn do I wish there was someway to exact revenge. While it’s a neat social experiment to wrestle with that impulse, I think tools like Speranza Bounties (as well as the fictional Speranza Watchlist) show that some added social elements to PvP, such as a bounty system or user-facing behavior report system that isn’t strictly punitive could add more ways to interact with the PvP element of this otherwise fantastic game.</p> <p>And no. I do not have a bounty on my head.</p> <p>…yet.</p>

              <p>Good morning! I hope you enjoyed a lot of turkey. I did. I celebrated two Thanksgivings. Double the fun, double the calories. Anyway, welcome back from holiday break, and let’s get right into Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of gaming news and other stuff you might care about. And please, nobody mention turkey. I’m done with it until next year.</p> <h2>There Will Be Another <em>Hitman</em> Game, Says IOI</h2> <p>IO Interactive is currently wrapping up <em>007: First Light,</em> which is set to launch in March of next year. While some are excited, there are plenty of <em>Hitman</em> fans who are worried that perhaps Agent 47 and his deadly franchise have entered extended retirement. That’s not the case.</p>

 <p>“So of course there will be more <em>Hitman</em>,” <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak told <em>Variety</em>.</a> “But right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you’ll get more news about <em>Hitman</em> co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in <em>World of Assassination.</em> But we will, after that, be talking about the next <em>Hitman</em> — because, of course, there’s going to be a next <em>Hitman</em>.”</p>

 <h2><em>Zootopia 2</em> had one of the best opening weekends ever</h2> <p><em>Zootopia 2</em> hit theaters over the holiday weekend, and it broke a whole bunch of records on its way to earning an impressive $556 million. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/zootopia-2-box-office-records-1236631348/">As reported by <em>Deadline</em></a>, Disney’s new animated sequel had the largest opening for an animated movie in history, was the fourth-biggest opening in movie history ever, and now also holds the record as Disney’s biggest animated movie opening. And that’s just <em>some</em> of the records it smashed.</p>

 <h2>A bunch of Xbox games are nominated for PlayStation Game of the Year awards</h2> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/01/ps-blog-game-of-the-year-awards-2025-polls-are-now-live/">Sony announced</a> that fan voting for this 2025’s PlayStation Blog Game of the Year Awards was now open. And if you peruse the categories, you’ll notice that an awful lot of games are from studios or publishers owned by Xbox, including <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, The Outer Worlds 2,</em> and <em>Forza Horizon.</em> In fact, four of the games nominated for the blog’s top honors, Best PS5 game of 2025, are from Xbox-owned studios. Video games in 2025 are so weird now, y’all.</p>

 <h2>Oops, some <em>GTA 6</em> animations have leaked</h2> <p>A demo reel containing what appears to be <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/1995234091856478416"><em>GTA 6</em> animations</a> was uploaded by an animator who worked on the highly anticipated open-world game. Fans quickly spotted the animations and started sharing them online. Of course, the video has since been deleted, but that hasn’t stopped the animations from spreading on social media and Reddit.</p> <p>The clips show a man loading an electric bike into a bike rack and a woman jumping out of a pickup truck. Not the most exciting stuff, but fans who have been waiting for over a decade for<em> GTA 6</em> will take anything they can get their hands on between now and the game’s launch on November 19, 2026.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-perfect-thanksgiving-plate-2000648127">What’s the perfect Thanksgiving plate?&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-games-pc-steam-wishlist-black-friday-thanksgaming-2000648371">Here are some good indie games!</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/2025-best-games-monster-hunter-split-fiction-avowed-1851767689">The best of 2025 (so far…)</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rockstar Games promised everyone a definitive Red Dead Redemption Remastered upgrade for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 consoles, and the release date is a defining day.</p>



<p>Recency bias would cause most people to pick Red Dead Redemption 2 as their favorite game. But many underestimate the impact and power of the original RDR story and gameplay. Yes, RDR 2 provided substantial upgrades, but the first game still has a certain charm that makes it worth replaying even now.</p>







<p>If RDR is something you want to play or you’ve never tried, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-owners-on-last-gen-consoles-are-eligible-for-free-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption Remastered upgrade</a> release date for all modern hardware should interest you.</p>

<p><strong>The Red Dead Redemption Remastered Upgrade for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and even Netflix, iOS, and Android launches on December 2.</strong></p>



<p>It’s an early Christmas present for all Red Dead Redemption fans. Rockstar Games might be busy with GTA 6, but the team is big enough to handle extra goodies—such as the remastered upgrade.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-red-dead-redemption-remastered-upgrade">How To Play Red Dead Redemption Remastered Upgrade</h2>



<p><strong>You need to own a copy of Red Dead Redemption Remastered to experience the free revamp for modern-day consoles and platforms, a <strong>GTA+ subscription,</strong>&nbsp;or download it via PlayStation Plus on December 2.</strong></p>



<p>On the one hand, the upgrade is free. Conversely, it’s only free if you already own Red Dead Redemption Remastered through one of the stated means.</p>



<p>Here’s what Rockstar says about the upgrade:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Current owners on PS4, Nintendo Switch, or the digital backward compatible version on Xbox One will be able to upgrade digitally for free. Anyone who owns the PS4 version can utilize previous PS4 save data to pick up where they left off, and Switch 2 players can continue with their previous save data from the previous Nintendo Switch console.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you are looking forward to playing the RDR upgrade, it includes the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>60 FPS.</li>



<li>Enhanced image quality.</li>



<li>HDR support enabled.</li>



<li>4K capabilities.</li>



<li>Nintendo Switch 2 owners get DLSS, HDR, mouse controls, and 60 FPS at high resolution.</li>



<li>Undead Nightmare DLC.</li>
</ul>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft - Housing 101 Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The tutorial will show players around the neighborhood, the basics of decorating, and answer some common housing-related questions players may have. As noted in the video, housing is available almost immediately, even for entirely new players. After doing the first few quests in the tutorial zone Exile's Reach, new players will be given the option of continuing with the game's introductory zone or jumping straight into the housing tutorial.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will be able to easily see which houses are available for purchase in any given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">neighborhood</a>. There's plenty of housing plot options for all kinds of players, with a variety of different biomes to choose from. Those who want to be more secluded can buy a home farther away from the center of town, while others may want to be closer to the action and have neighbors directly next door.</p><p dir="ltr">If a specific plot is taken, players can simply travel to a different neighborhood until they find one where it's available. A house typically costs 1,000 gold but that already-small fee is waived for brand-new players. Players aren't locked into a specific neighborhood or plot, and can pick up their house (as well as all of its interior and exterior decorations) and move to a new plot or neighborhood at any time for a fee.</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">decorating, Blizzard is giving players plenty of options</a>. All players will receive a housing starter pack of decor items to get going. Both the inside of a home and the outside plot can be customized with decor items gained from quests, raids, professions, vendors, and more. There are both simple and advanced tools for placing and customizing decor items for those who want to get lost in the details. As players increase their housing level over time, they'll be able to add more rooms to their home and place even more decor.</p><p dir="ltr">For those worried about what happens to their home if they take a break from WoW and let their subscription lapse, the home is never lost. It will be saved as it last was with all of its decorations and customizations and put into storage after a certain amount of time, freeing up whatever neighborhood plot it occupied. Once that player resubscribes to WoW, the home can then be placed back down in a new plot or neighborhood.</p><p dir="ltr">Make sure to check out Blizzard's Housing 101 video above for a more in-depth look, but housing in WoW looks to be remakarbely straightforward compared to how it can be in some other MMOs, where players need to enter a house lottery or pay taxes on their virtual real estate. Housing will be available early for those who preorder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">Midnight, with the expansion proper coming on March 2, 2026</a>. Completing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-gets-you-rewards-in-other-blizzard-games-including-an-overwatch-2-skin/1100-6536542/" data-ref-id="1100-6536542">WoW housing tutorial will score players some additional rewards</a> in other Blizzard games, including an Overwatch 2 skin.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has once again discussed the proliferation of AI, comparing the tech to "mad cow disease" and describing the execs pushing it as "not the most human or creative people".</p>
<p>Houser, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">left GTA developer Rockstar back in 2020</a>, is currently on a media tour for his forthcoming novel that not only explores AI as part of its narrative, but is set in the same world as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meet-absurdaverse-gta-5-writer-dan-housers-next-big-project">the game his new studio is working on</a>.</p>
<p>Interviewed on Virgin Radio UK by host Chris Evans, the discussion turned to the topic of AI. "Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity, or whatever it is using AI, are not the most humane or creative people," said Houser. "So they're sort of saying, 'We're better at being human than you are.' It's obviously not true."</p>

<p>He added: "Humanity is being pulled in a direction by a certain group of people, who maybe aren't fully-rounded humans."</p>
<p>More specifically on the technology, Houser was damning on its future promise.</p>
<p>"I think that AI is gonna eventually eat itself, because as far as I understand it - which is really superficial - the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models," he said. "So it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease."</p>
<p>He admitted it will "do some tasks brilliantly, but it's not going to do every task brilliantly".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-games-co-founder-is-dabbling-with-ai-for-his-next-game-but-admits-its-not-as-useful-as-some-of-the-companies-would-have-you-believe-yet">Houser's comments echo his appearance last week</a> on UK TV, interviewed on Channel 4's Sunday Brunch programme.</p>
<p>"We have a whole field of areas we need technology for and AI's great at some of the tasks and can't do the other tasks yet," he said in that interview. "So [AI companies] will claim it can solve every single problem and it really can't yet. As far as I understand it, it's a sort of hold-all term for all future computing and it's not really doing a lot of the stuff yet. But if we all give it all of our money, it might do in the future."</p><p>In game development, AI is becoming more prevalent, but not all studios are using it. "I don't feel that games created with only AI will have soul," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-feel-that-games-created-with-only-ai-will-have-soul-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-director-doesnt-think-ai-can-replace-human-creativity-but-the-studio-is-using-it-in-reasonable-ways">The Witcher 3 and The Blood of Dawnwalker director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz told Eurogamer</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maybe-ai-is-a-creative-solution-if-you-arent-a-creative-person-dispatch-devs-take-a-firm-refreshing-stance-against-ai">developers of Dispatch stated: "Maybe AI is a creative solution if you aren't a creative person"</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160866/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s been over three years since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a> was released, and Tribute Games has been really busy. Stuffed like a return-trip suitcase, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/marvel_cosmic_invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>’s enormous cast of heroes and villains is here united in a rapturous beat-'em-up fanfare. Its pixel art positively simmers, with beautifully rendered backgrounds, giant set-pieces, and solid, impressively animated sprites. And, in addition to primary antagonist Annihilus, nemeses like Galactus, Hela, and Thanos make sufficiently heavy-duty appearances.</p>
<p>What’s particularly endearing is that the production feels wholly comic book. Its story mode, fleshed out with superbly rendered cutscenes and spot-on voice acting, really honours the source material. From Wolverine’s growl to Spider-Man’s quips, Venom’s brusque manner to Nova’s heroic fortitude, the exchanges really capture the Marvel feel. The slightly squat sprite styling works well, too, and the soundtrack is on-point throughout.</p>
<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160865/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of palette swap options, there are no Marvel movie elements here, and the roster is interestingly formed, teaming up the likes of Captain America and Iron Man with lesser-knowns like Beta Ray Bill and Phyla-Vell. In total, there are a whopping 15 playable characters, several of whom are unlocked during playthroughs.</p>
<p>Any modern scrolling beat 'em up worth its salt requires a creative and dynamic combat system, and Cosmic Invasion rises to the challenge with a dual-character tag-team setup. In Story Mode, you choose a fresh duo each time you begin a stage, selecting your destination of choice via a bullet-pointed map that runs along branching paths. Certain stages need to be beaten before you can progress, and finishing a stage will level up your team with increased power and health.</p>
<p>Story Mode also comes with a set of optional Challenges. These include tasks like defeating a set number of enemies with a specific move or finishing a boss with a specific character. The challenge list shows which heroes properly align with a stage’s cutscenes and narrative. Characters that are narratively required for each level have glowing boxes around them on the select screen, too, although that could be signposted better.</p>
<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160869/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Arcade Mode operates in true linear fashion: your initial character choices remain fixed for the entire game, there’s no levelling up, and you’re restricted to a limited number of stages across optional routes. For many, this will be the most enjoyable way to play.</p>
<p>The cast’s fighting properties are amazingly varied, with differing speeds and weights, and enough unique attack forms to make each one feel interesting. Some can fly with a double-jump tap, patrolling the air, while others, like Rocket Raccoon, dominate from range with heavy artillery. Each wields a basic tap combo, a double-tap rush attack, and a dodge or block that, when timed right, enacts a parry. Every character can charge a unique breakout move, and the 'X' button lets loose their special attack. The 'R' button is reserved for big, flashy supers, requiring a “Focus” energy that recharges while battling.</p>

<p>Tag-teaming works entirely around the left trigger. Tapping switches characters, who can swing in and break you out of holds. You can also combine attacks, whereby pressing the trigger mid-combo will have your partner appear alongside you, dealing out extra blows. Interestingly, you can combine the tag function with different buttons, creating different partner effects like aerial dives or rushing slashes. All tag battling eats into your Focus energy, a point to consider if you’re trying to build a team super: a devastating dual attack engaged with 'ZL' and 'R' that requires maximum Focus for both characters.</p>
<p>Cosmic Invasion is flashy and superbly slick, and mining all the little details is quite the adventure. There’s not much included in the rather threadbare tutorial, so it’s down to you to experiment, discovering which grabs can be turned into throws with D-pad combinations, and which characters have functions that respond to simultaneous button presses. The fastest hack here is to hit pause and read through your character’s movelist.</p>
<p>In a world post-<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, Cosmic Invasion doesn’t quite land in the same way Shredder’s Revenge did. While it does get furiously heated, its pace does feel a tad slow overall. What's surprising, though, are the numerous oversights in the visual feedback department. The map points on Story Mode, for example, don’t change colour when you clear a stage or complete its challenges, and post-toilet break it can take a moment to recognise which you just did.</p>
<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160871/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tribute Games clearly aren’t fans of prominent combo counters either, which is a shame as Cosmic Invasion seems to be crying out for one. Here, the combo counter is small, tame, and seated inconspicuously beside your health bar. As such, your building of blows isn’t as rewarding, and, being a comic-book-themed game, classic onomatopoeia or <em>“Dazzling!”</em>, <em>“Amazing!”</em>, or <em>“Super!”</em> would have been the perfect way to celebrate combo milestones.</p>
<p>The feedback element that really needs bolstering, though, surrounds the tag mechanic. With so many different usage combinations, some additional visual, aural, or haptic cues to delineate each state would have been helpful amidst the game’s flurrying pyrotechnics. For example, a short pad vibration upon engagement, and perhaps character colour flashes could give some idea of how much Focus energy is being consumed. And, as the tag function can be combined with different buttons for different dual attack types, some kind of visual feedback to articulate each state wouldn’t have gone amiss.</p>
<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160873/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s not the end of the world, but your tag mechanics tend to get drowned out in the fighting stew, lacking a sense of tactility. For your mammoth dual super attack, too, any kind of wind-up effect or chime would have been welcome, just to let you know you’re primed to go. Additionally, recovering the secret green cubes hidden on each stage is so perfunctory it’s like a fart in the wind. There’s no indication it even has value, no message screaming “Cube Recovered!” or the like. In fact, it’s quite possible to pick one up accidentally without realising it.</p>
<p>These aren’t criminal offences, and they certainly don’t diminish the effort involved. But anyone who understands arcade games knows that good feedback aspects can really elevate the experience. As such, while impressively deep with its dodging, parrying, and potential for wild mix-ups and tag-team juggling, Cosmic Invasion's combat doesn't feel quite as satisfying as something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, the recent Absolum, or even Shredder’s Revenge, which was a touch more honed in the battling department.</p>
<p>The more overt problem with Cosmic Invasion, though, is its difficulty balancing. Credit-feeding arcade games robs them of their value, largely because of their routine nature, and a lack of challenge has a similar effect. For some reason, Cosmic Invasion’s default Medium difficulty setting is a total cakewalk. Bosses, whose attack patterns are often thoughtfully designed, go down to first-attempt spamming in all but the last few stages. Health items are scattered all over, and being able to tag characters, regularly deploy super attacks, and regenerate not only Focus but your health too, actually makes the campaign a tad mundane. It’s much like the Marvel movies themselves in this respect: when there are no stakes, you start to switch off.</p>
<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160870/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, there is a Hard Mode, but it isn’t available from the outset. Instead, you need to earn cubes to be spent on a hexagonal grid, unlocking additional character palettes and other in-game adjustments. For your information, you want to go right to the top middle of the hexagon and unlock that Hard Mode option, because frankly, it’s transformative.</p>
<p>Playing Arcade Mode on Hard Difficulty suddenly makes Cosmic Invasion both reasonably challenging and, with it, far more interesting, requiring thought and skill over mindless button mashing. All aspects of your moveset take on genuine importance, with different enemies and situations demanding experimentation — and the dodge and parry become crucial. While, in my opinion, the default difficulty should have been set somewhere between Medium and Hard Mode — and that means Tribute Games didn’t quite get either quite right — Hard Mode is still the place to go lest things get boring.</p>
<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160868/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, if you’re primarily here for the multiplayer aspect, all this challenge criticism goes out the window. With friends, it’s just a blast, even if the four-player is a little too chaotic, all things told. In terms of delivering campy Marvel magic, however, in which iconic superheroes smash iconic supervillains, Cosmic Invasion comes through with flying colours.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pure cartoon fun, and all the better for it, Tribute Games has not only totally honoured the source material, but delivered one of the best arcade Marvel games ever made. The aesthetic is beautiful, and the effort involved in creating such a varied cast of beat-'em-up protagonists is admirable.</p>
<p>Yes, there are areas for improvement, and some of its combat-feedback oversights feel like missed opportunities. But if you primarily want multiplayer action, to unlock and grind and level up your cast, and to get knee-deep in Marvel mayhem, it’s right on the money. If you’re working through its single-player Story campaign, you’re likely to get bored before the end owing to its ease, but unlock Hard Difficulty and Cosmic Invasion becomes all it was destined to be.</p></section>

			<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is a nostalgia-soaked love letter to nine-year-old you. A side-scrolling beat ‘em up that looks like it just stepped out of a 90’s arcade, Cosmic Invasion features the character design of Marvel’s comic heyday, pixel-art visuals that ape Capcom’s Super Hero fighting series, and a tag team mechanic that is pure X-Men vs. Street Fighter. In short, with this much 90’s nostalgia powering it, how can Marvel Cosmic Invasion possibly fail?</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Cosmic Invasion | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Marvel big bad Annihilus wants to take over the universe and it’s up to you and three friends – either online or local in very slick drop-in drop-out multiplayer – to stop him. The story is suitably silly and slight. The, thankfully skippable, static cutscenes bracketing each level are completely incomprehensible scrolling beat ‘em up hokum, but the opening animated intro and accompanying theme-song is an unadulterated delight, perfectly capturing the essence of the iconic X-Men cartoon. You’ll be listening to it on repeat on your chosen music streaming platform of choice, let me tell you.</p>


<p>With an impressive character roster of 15 heroes, Cosmic Invasion certainly offers a stacked cast of Marvel do-gooders. There’s the expected A-listers like Spider-Man, Wolverine and Iron Man, but also a few more niche picks, such as Beta-Ray Bill, Cosmic Ghost Rider, and Phyla-Vell. Whilst I would have personally liked developer Tribute Games to delve a little deeper in the weeds of the Marvel character back catalogue – Marvel Rivals did this &nbsp;with Jeff the Land Shark, turning the diminutive hero into a fan favourite and star of numerous comics in the process – the overall depth and breadth of the line-up really can’t be faulted.</p>


<p>What can be faulted is the variance in how much fun the characters are to play as. Flying characters suffer the most, the cost of being able to hover around the place a bit is seemingly being lumbered with a vastly reduced move-set. Storm is a total snore-fest, with only a handful of attacks on offer, whilst Silver Surfer, Iron Man, Phoenix and Phyla-Vell struggled to get much play time, simply because they can’t do very much. A couple of basic attacks, a range attack and a special? It’s not much terribly exciting. Plus, the insistence on flying heroes and enemies is unnecessarily fiddly, it’s often difficult to tell where you and your enemy are, resulting in a lot of accidental punching of thin air.</p>
<p>Wolverine and Black Panther are both superb, however, with varied combos and juggles putting their flying counterparts to shame. She Hulk’s range of pro-wrestling themed moves are brilliant fun to unleash, and Venom and Spider-Man deliver all the web-based antics a fan could hope for. The impressive sounding 15 character roster is quickly reduced down to five heroes you’ll actually want to play as, with the rest acting in a support role, leaping into the action with a brief bonus attack at the touch of a button.</p>

<p>If the heroes are well catered for, the villains they’ll be punching are not. Considering the vast universe of characters Tribute Games could call upon to include, they picked some lame ducks here. Most of the time you’ll be beating-up the exact same bug-like minions, only they’ll be painted in slightly different colours from level to level. Sure, there’s a few Sentinels to take on and some symbiotes, but mostly you’ll spend your time battling big mutated bees. Where’s the Kree? The Skrulls? The Chitauri? For a game set in the galaxy-spanning Marvel Cosmic comics, the lack of decent bad guys to duff up feels like the waste of an iconic licence.</p>
<p>Boss fights are also quite boring, even if they do feature a decent range of Marvel villains. No matter if you’re facing Knull, The Phoenix, or MODOK, your enemy will launch the same limited range of attacks and will soon be defeated without much effort. Indeed, for a game aping a 90’s coin-up, Marvel Cosmic Invasion is unexpectedly easy, offering little challenge and only occasionally pushing back against the player. My partner and I only had one or two re-starts and saw off the entire game in a couple of hours. We had little use for the tag-team mechanic either. Sure, you can swap in and out characters to deliver a massive juggling combo – so long as you don’t pick a flyer as a partner – buy why bother when a few punches will kill most opponents?</p>

<p>Worse, the levels themselves are oddly dull and repetitive. Scrolling beat ‘em ups are hardly known for their variety when it comes to level design, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/absolum-review/">Absolum</a>, and Tribute Games own <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a> prove it can be done. With no weapon pick-ups, no vehicles to drive or mounts to ride, no new moves to unlock, and the aforementioned limited range of enemies, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, even with its short run time, ultimately becomes a bit of a slog.</p>
<p>Despite all of the over-the-top visuals with nostalgia dripping loveliness then, playing Marvel Cosmic Invasion is just a bit, well, boring.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-nextgen-edition/">an unofficial remaster of the classic entry in the series developed by Rockstar Games built in RAGE Engine</a>, looks better than ever before thanks to a new RTX Remix path tracing mod.</p>



<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows the unofficial remaster developed by Revolution Team <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-4-rtx-remix-compatibility-mod-publicly-available-enjoy-path-tracing/">running with the custom RTX Remix runtime created for the RAGE Engine by Xoxor4d released last week to the public. </a></p>



<p>The side-by-side comparison shown at the beginning of the video highlights how the path tracing mod brings significant visual changes, but also a heavy performance hit, which is not surprising at all, considering how even <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-2-rtx-remix-mod-brings-stunning-path-tracing-but-a-very-high-cost-from-1200-to-36-fps-on-an-rtx-5080/">the best current gaming hardware has a hard time handling path tracing without serious optimization work</a>. In this case, the mod is reportedly one of the most CPU-intensive RTX Remix projects to date, which even the most powerful CPUs on the market, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-most-popular-zen-5-cpu-germany/">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a>, struggle to run at a steady 60 FPS.</p>



<p>The remainder of the MxBenchmarkPC video shows how Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Next-gen Edition performs with the RTX Remix mod at 4K and 1440p resolutions, utilizing NVIDIA DLSS in Performance and Balanced modes. Additionally, it highlights how Frame Generation is essentially required to achieve framerates higher than 60 frames per second.</p>

<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">As the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition overhaul is no longer available for download from trusted modding websites, such as<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-the-next-gen-edition" target="_blank">&nbsp;mod.db</a>, only those who downloaded the overhaul before it was removed can test it out with the Xoxor4d compatibility mod.</span> Even so, there's no denying that ray tracing will be a central element of future entries in the series following its <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/">implementation in Grand Theft Auto V</a>, as the two <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-quality/">Grand Theft Auto VI trailers</a> released to date heavily suggest the tech will likely be widely used in the highly anticipated next entry in the series.</p>



<p>Speaking of Grand Theft Auto VI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-animator-seemingly-shared-grand-theft-auto-vi-animations-in-demo-reel/">another small glimpse of the game arrived today</a> via a leaked demo reel from a Rockstar Games animator. The footage, though very brief and unpolished, showcased new character animations—including bike rentals and actions involving the bed of a pickup truck. While the video doesn't feature much we haven't seen already, any new look at the game is still welcome to make the wait for the game's<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/"> November 2026 release </a>more bearable.</p>

<h3 id="h-gameplay-overview">Gameplay Overview</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MARVEL-Cosmic-Invasion-Characters-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion's gameplay is deeply rooted in the classic side-scrolling beat'em up experience popular back in the 90s.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion is a classic side-scrolling, four-player drop-in co-op beat'em up, but it introduces the unique <strong>Cosmic-Swap tag-team mechanic</strong> which radically changes the flow of combat. Teams consist of two heroes, allowing players to instantly switch characters to maximize combo potential, strategically avoid damage, or deploy powerful assist attacks.</p>



<h3 id="h-starter-tips-for-beginners">Starter Tips for Beginners</h3>



<ol>
<li><strong>Familiarize yourself with only a few characters first</strong>: the 15 heroes have very different fighting styles that may not be suited to your playstyle. Find at least two you find yourself confident with, and focus on learning the intricacies of their movesets. No matter the pair you pick for each stage, you won't miss any story content, and you can eventually return to complete stages to clear Challenges requires specific characters later on.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Use Cosmic-Swap to Escape:</strong> One of the most important technique to use is using <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cosmic-Swap (L1/LB/L)</strong> to get out of trouble. If you are cornered, about to be hit by a boss attack, or immobilized by a grab, a quick swap tags in your partner, letting them get out of the fight to avoid additional damage and restore the red portion of their HP gauge.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Farm Level 5 ASAP:</strong> The Passive Skill learned at Level 5 is crucial for most characters. Focus on replaying the first few Campaign stages a couple of times to hit Level 5 on your favorite heroes quickly. This can be a massive help to clear the most challenging stages of the campaign.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-play-modes">Play Modes</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MARVEL-Cosmic-Invasion-Campaign-Mode-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Campaign mode offers 15 stages filled with enemies to defeat</em> <em>and challenges to complete</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The game features two main modes, designed for different types of players:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign Mode:</strong> Navigate a map and progress through 15 stages, each featuring unique hazards, a final boss, and three optional Challenges to complete. Completing certain stages unlocks new characters.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Classic Arcade Mode:</strong> A true throwback experience with no continues, replicating the difficulty and high-score pressure of an arcade cabinet.

						<h5>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</h5><p><span>December 1, 2025</span>

							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Back in the 90s, the side-scrolling beat'em up genre dominated video games, with series like CAPCOM's Final Fight, SEGA's Streets of Rage, and Konami's licensed games such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and The Simpsons gaining widespread success, which sometimes even surpassed traditional fighting games, thanks, for the most part, to the immediacy of their gameplay.</p>



<p>Despite its popularity, however, the genre quickly disappeared from the spotlight when 3D graphics became all the rage, leaving it to smaller, independent teams, to create new side-scrolling beat'em ups. However, the genre had some sort of resurgence following the launch of the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(106, 175, 226, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(106, 175, 226, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/streets-of-rage-4-beautiful-brawl/">amazing Streets of Rage 4</a>, which led to the creation of a lot of excellent games that tributed the best games of the 90s while also innovating the classic formula, such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HC51VgRPdY8">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a>, a fantastic game that easily stands head to head with the classics developed by Konami.</p>



<p>A few years after the release of the game, Tribute Games returned to side-scrolling beat'em ups with MARVEL Cosmic Invasion. Leveraging universally recognizable characters and the tag-team mechanics that fighting game fans associate with the Marvel name, the developer created a game with tons of personality that is very fun to play, despite not reaching the heights of Shredder's Revenge due to some design and balance flaws.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MARVEL-Cosmic-Invasion-Cutscene-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion brings 15 heroes together to face a terrible threat</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion's story is relatively simple, but it does an excellent job of bringing together heroes from both Earth and the cosmic realms to fight against the super-villain Annihilus and prevent his Annihilation Wave from destroying the universe. Traversing a variety of battlefields, ranging from New York City to floating citadels and the Negative Zone from which Annihilus launched his invasion, Spider-Man, Captain America, Iron Man, Nova, Wolverine, Cosmic Ghost Rider and nine other heroes will fight the villain's forces and his closest allies such as M.O.D.O.K. and Taskmaster to save the universe in the most epic of clashes.</p>



<p>Involving some of the most established characters in media nowadays, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion doesn't reserve any huge surprises in terms of plot or character development. If you are a fan of Marvel Comics, you already know what to expect: humorous quips, tons of fun interactions, and all-powerful, arrogant villains brought down after tense battles. Much of this simple story, which is told via pixel art cutscenes and quick in-game dialogues happening before boss battles, merely serves as a credible background for all the intense action of the game, much like in classic side-scrolling beat'em ups, and in this sense, it does well the little it is supposed to accomplish.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251115122028_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The MARVEL Cosmic Invasion story isn't the best, but it serves its purpose well</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Being a side-scrolling beat'em up, much of the success of MARVEL Cosmic Invasion hinges on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/marvel-cosmic-invasion-ultimate-guide-game-modes-characters-progression-combat-mechanics-explained/">combat mechanics and character roster</a>, which are solid, for the most part. However, some issues, as already mentioned, impact the experience, which is ultimately not as good as TMNT: Shredder's Revenge.</p>



<p>The highlight of the combat mechanics are the Cosmic-Swap tag-team mechanics. Before starting any of the game's stages, players select two among the 15 heroes available in the game, which can be swapped at pretty much every time, including when the controlled character is grabbed or in a hit-stun state, and unleash a selection of assist attacks that change depending on the button pressed together with the Cosmic-Swap button as long as enough Focus is available. This not only makes for an incredibly dynamic experience, but opens up some creative combo possibilities as almost the entire moveset of the two selected characters are available with the press of a few buttons.</p>



<p>Compounding these mechanics well is each character's moveset design. All of the 15 characters in MARVEL Cosmic Invasion have very different moveset deeply rooted in each character's history and unique characteristics. Some characters like Nova and Storm, for example, can fly. Others, like Spider-Man and Venom, can use their powers to glide across the screen. Others, like Cosmic Ghost Rider, Iron Man, and Rocket Raccoon, have excellent long-range fighting abilities, compounded by their extensive weapon arsenals.</p>



<p>Even defensive options are different, depending on the character. Some, like Captain America and Venom, can block and parry enemy attacks. Others like Black Panther and Wolverine can dodge and quickly reposition themselves thanks to their superior agility. These different offensive and defensive abilities add a layer of depth to team creation, forcing players to prioritize these abilities over simple personal preference for certain characters. With how some enemies are designed, especially bosses, you will definitely want to have two characters that cover all offensive and defensive options.</p>



<p>Although characters' movesets are quite diverse, their design is a little too safe, in my opinion. As if the tag-team mechanics wouldn't have been enough to make the game feel like a CAPCOM's Marvel series spin-off, the movesets of characters that appeared in a fighting game by the Japanese studio feel a little too familiar. So much so that I think this is a result of the desire to tribute the series in some way, and does not stem from a lack of inspiration.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251126165258_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Cosmic-Swap tag-team mechanics are among the game's best features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the safety of the roster's movesets is not inherently an issue, as even so, their movesets synergize well together to create complex combos, other combat issues have a much bigger impact on the experience. Unlike Shredder's Revenge, which I feel strikes a good balance in terms of enemy density for both solo and multiplayer, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion seems to have been balanced with multiplayer in mind. Not counting the first few stages, players are constantly harassed by a swarm of enemies with different movesets that are sometimes frustrating to deal with while playing solo.</p>



<p>While one could make the argument that Cosmic-Swap tag-team mechanics forced this balancing approach, it still feels like Tribute Games may have gone a little too far. As a result, the last few stages are very frustrating to play solo, also due to the excessive number of environmental hazards, which make it difficult not only to avoid damage, but even to understand what is going on at certain times. Thrown in flying enemies that are really good at getting away from the player, and you get a very frustrating final hours or so of the experience when playing solo. I am usually someone who complains that games are way too easy nowadays, but there's a fine line between challenging and frustrating that MARVEL Cosmic Invasion, sadly, crosses too often.</p>



<p>Boss battles are also a great indication of how the game may have been balanced with multiplayer first in mind. Most of the end-stage enemies not only come with a damage-protecting "super armor" that must be depleted first before dealing real damage, but their attacks also have wide ranges, and they can also call regular enemies to help. In addition, there are times when they are not staggered, even when they should be in certain situations, which adds a degree of uncertainty to the experience and makes boss battles less enjoyable than they could have been.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251120182653_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Late stages in MARVEL Cosmic Invasion become frustrating quickly in solo play due to balancing choices</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even in terms of content, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion disappoints somewhat. The light RPG mechanics that power character progression are not as meaningful as in Shredder's Revenge since characters don't learn new moves when they level up, but only get HP and Focus improvements and learn a Passive Skill, so they essentially play the same no matter their level. And while each stage presents its own set of challenges and collectibles that can be used to unlock new color palettes and additional content, the game doesn't offer much beyond its 4-hour-long story campaign and classic Arcade Mode.</p>



<p>With its gorgeous 2D graphics, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion is deeply rooted in the comic books that made these characters so iconic, but it's not just the visuals that give the game a ton of personality. Great care has been put into the interactions that all heroes have when using the Cosmic Swap tag-team mechanics, as each pairing has unique voice lines to address each other. This is a genuinely great touch that masterfully leverages the long history of these characters, enhancing the experience considerably for their fans with a generally solid presentation. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, outside of solid voice acting, audio leaves something to be desired. Not only does music sound generic and not really memorable, but the sound effects are also really thin, and prevent hits from being as impactful as they should be in a game that is centered on combat.</p>



<p>Although the good outweighs the bad, it is difficult to recommend MARVEL Cosmic Invasion to anyone but the most hardcore of Marvel Comics and beat'em up enthusiasts, due to the limited amount of content, and the asking price of $29.99/ €29.99. With games like Streets of Rage 4 and Absolum that offer a lot in terms of content and gameplay depth at similar or lower prices, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion definitely needed to be something more than a well-made tribute to the Marvel universe to have a broader appeal.</p>

				<p>With its tag-team mechanics and well-designed characters, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion is a competent side-scrolling beat'em up that can offer plenty of chaotic fun, especially in multiplayer. However, some balancing issues that make the final few stages frustrating to play, especially solo, and the lack of content beyond the 4-hours long campaign limit the game's appeal to Marvel fans and beat'em up die hards looking for a few hours of simple fun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Cyanide and publisher Nacon have announced the release date for goblin sneak-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em>, and although the game has technically been delayed, it won't be too much longer before you get to play it.</p>

<p>As announced in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed&nbsp;</em>will be launching across PC and consoles on February 19th. The game was originally set for a 2025 release, a fact that the new release date trailer acknowledges rather neatly.</p>

<p>When it does arrive,&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed&nbsp;</em>will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/styx-sequel-shards-darkness-announced" rel="nofollow">the third game</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Styx</em>&nbsp;series; although the franchise began as a spinoff of 2012 RPG&nbsp;<em>Of Orcs and Men</em>, it's probably fair to say that <i>Styx&nbsp;</i>has overtaken its parent in terms of popularity by now.</p>

This time around, he's after a new power source known as Quartz, which will lead him to take part in the events that will form the basis for&nbsp;<em>Of Orcs and Men</em>'s Black Hand organization's foundation.</p>

<p>Cyanide and Nacon say that they've made "freedom and creativity central to the experience" in&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em>, too, promising "vast vertical environments" for you to explore, alongside "new tools and powers" to use on your enemies.</p>

<p>These powers include new Mind Control and Time Shift abilities, which will be granted to Styx thanks to his acquisition of Quartz, and abilities from the series like Cloning and Invisibility will return as well, so you should have a decent suite of tools at your disposal.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013900" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/styx-blades-of-greed/9NZTKVTDZ2LB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 19th next year. Stay tuned for more on this one (and all other things&nbsp;<em>Styx</em>).</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-goes-beyond-ssds-dropping-2tb-external-hard-drive-to-0-03-per-gb-for-playstation-xbox-pc-and-mac-2000648968</link>

              <p>Storage issues are more common than you think, and they affect almost everyone now and then; from work professionals to creatives, students, gamers, and even casual users. If you’ve been looking to expand the capacity of your PC, Mac, or console, we just spotted a deal that lets you do it for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6133/">Thanks to Cyber Monday, Amazon is offering the Seagate 2TB portable external hard drive at a 19% discount.</a> It usually sits at an already-affordable retail price of $80, but this $15 discount is making the upgrade even more approachable. It’s available to all shoppers, whether you have a Prime membership or prefer shopping without it. The only catch? The offer is selling out fast, and it expires tonight. You only have a few more hours left to save, so it’s better to grab yours without wasting more time. Once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6133/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Offload Files, House All Your Important Data</h2>
<p>Starting off with the capacity; you’re getting a nice 2TB of additional storage for your device. That’s enough to offload a bunch of files you don’t use as frequently to free some space on your internal storage, plus house all your important data. Think thousands of photos, hundreds of videos, heavy presentations, creative projects, long research papers, and never-ending spreadsheets. You’ll even be able to throw in some gaming titles. The 2TB capacity is enough for most users who don’t just want to rely on their internal storage for day-to-day use, but if it feels limited, Seagate is offering plenty of other options at a discount, too.</p>
<p>This HDD plays nicely with Windows or Mac computers, and the drag-and-drop functionality lets you transfer files across both with ease. It’s a traditional hard drive, so the speeds won’t be as fast as an SSD, but still not too bad for casual use. Getting started couldn’t be simpler. It’s preformatted for Windows and Mac, so all that you need to do is connect the drive to your device using the 18-inch USB 3.0 cable. Your device will recognize the HDD automatically, without requiring any specific software installation. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes for it to get up and running!</p>



<p>It’s also quite portable, which makes it easy to carry your entire digital library of documents and games with you, wherever you go. Just plug it into any computer, and access all the important stuff in seconds. This is great for anyone working remotely, and even for those relying on two devices at the same time. You won’t need to transfer files to both your PC and your laptop; the drive does it all.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been wanting to invest in a storage solution that’s both reliable and easy to carry around, this deal lets you do that for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6133/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $80 to enjoy the same features, but Amazon’s Cyber Monday sale lets you pick the solution up for just $65.</a> If 2TB is more than what you need, there’s a 1TB option available, too. Creatives looking for more space can consider the 4TB or 5TB versions, or go all out with the massive 8TB or 12TB options. There’s plenty to choose from, but we highly recommend grabbing yours fast. The deal ends soon, and you don’t want to be disappointed at the very last minute. It’s also a good idea to stock up on anything else you missed grabbing during Black Friday, whether it’s tech gadgets or entertainment upgrades.</p>

            <guid>1369357</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Being </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-movies-best-worst-ranking-frozen-moana-tangled-1851708848"><span>a </span><i><span>Zootopia </span></i><span>fan</span></a><span> on the internet is like being god’s strongest soldier fighting the uncaring deity’s toughest battles. You can’t talk about how much you like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-plus-ai-generated-user-videos-ugc-sora-mickey-2000644077"><span>Disney’s</span></a><span> politically-charged take on the animal kingdom without it somehow veering into the topic of furry porn or a buckwild fan comic about aborting a fox/rabbit hybrid.</span></p> <p><span>Despite </span><i><span>Zootopia </span></i><span>not really getting into cross-species romance, something that has followed the franchise since the 2016 original is that a large, very loud side of the internet ships ex-con fox Nick Wilde and his bunny cop bestie Judy Hopps, and there’s no shortage of art, fanfiction, and fan theories about the two pining for one another. Infamously,, someone wrote a viral fan comic starring the two in which their relationship unravels over Judy wanting to abort their fox/rabbit hybrid baby that has become such a prominent meme in pop culture that it </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Will_Survive_(comic)"><span>has its own Wikipedia page</span></a><span> After seeing </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>twice, I’m pretty confident someone at Disney has read that comic or is at least aware of it, and all the other nasty things y’all have been saying about these two for nearly a decade. Disney may not be looking directly into the abyss, as a lot of big studios </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction"><span>won’t read fan works</span></a><span> for fear of potential legal trouble if their stories end up overlapping with something an admirer wrote or drew, but </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>has all the makings of a movie almost winking at its fans in an hour-and-a-half-long metatexual tease. Despite this, the studio refuses to give WildeHopps shippers the catharsis they so desperately crave.</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>is straightbaiting, or using a potential romantic pairing like a carrot on a stick to draw in an audience they won’t actually satisfy. After living decades watching pairings of men with a ton of chemistry not end up confessing their love for one another in a sloppy on-screen kiss, I think that’s beautiful. Don’t come for me, saying that “straightbaiting” isn’t a real thing because straight ships aren’t victims to the same societal stigmas as queer ones. This is too funny for me. Let me have this. The movie begins with what feels like a direct homage to the abortion comic by having the pair do some undercover cop work, masquerading as a couple with a baby (Nick’s ex-crime partner Finnick, also in disguise). Their perp acknowledges the interspecies pairing is a bit different, but not unheard of in the city of Zootopia, where predator and prey live together in harmony. But when one of the most viral fan creations is about these two as would-be parents, leading your long-awaited sequel with a scene of these cops cosplaying as mom and dad to a little fox baby feels very intentional, and </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>doesn’t let up with one gag.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you ignore what Nick and Judy actually say to each other, </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>has all the makings of a slow-burning enemies-to-friends-to-lovers arc a decade in the making. They’re constantly referring to each other as “partners,” as they’re the Zootopia Police Department’s newest duo, and they’re celebrating their week-long anniversary while trying to sort through their differences. They go to partner counseling, when Judy makes a joke about their anniversary while they ride on a Walrus’ belly, their chauffeur puts on mood lighting and plays one of Disney’s most iconic love songs, “Bella Notte” from </span><i><span>Lady and the Tramp</span></i><span>, and there’s a scene where mountain goats send the pair up to a honeymoon suite likely assuming they’re heading up to make a hybrid baby.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/z2spoilers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#z2spoilers</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/zootopia2spoilers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#zootopia2spoilers</a> <br>i don't see anyone freaking out over this yet so allow me bc this is one of my many new roman empires: </p> <p>WDYM THEY PLAYED BELLA NOTTE FROM LADY AND THE TRAMP ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC MOVIE SCENES EVER??? <a href="https://t.co/P3CKTNh6iD">pic.twitter.com/P3CKTNh6iD</a></p> <p>— caro 🐾 #z2spoilers❗ (@pumpkinberryxo) <a href="https://twitter.com/pumpkinberryxo/status/1994198957312835724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The brilliant part of this is that these assumptions play out without Nick and Judy ever acknowledging them. It would be so easy for the two to get really animated about these moments and be like, “No way! He’s just my partner. We’re just friends who have never even considered each other like that.” Instead, Nick and Judy let these moments go and focus on what’s actually important. Even in the height of the two’s crisis point, Nick refers to Judy explicitly as a friend, and when all of these conflicts come to a head in a glorious overshare of therapy speak, the two never even say a word about any romantic feelings. They talk to each other the way two secure, platonic individuals do: with an open, honest apology for their respective flaws, and a hope that they can work together better in the inevitable next movie.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That’s not to say that </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>doesn’t have moments that could absolutely be read as romantic tension. Early on in the film, when the pair is scoping out a gala, Nick sees Judy yapping it up with Pawbert Lynxley, the awkward rich kid who seems to be an outcast in his evil rich people family. He gets so distracted by what looks like a fit of jealousy that he runs into a fellow party patron. It was in that moment that I worried that </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>might actually go down the romantic road, but even when Nick is having a major confessional moment, much later, after Judy runs off with Pawbert to try and salvage their larger case, he doesn’t confess any romantic feelings.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Fans will inevitably read </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>as another chapter in a decade-long slow burn, but as someone who finds Nick and Judy’s security in their friendship to be one of these movies’ greatest strengths, I gotta give Disney props for keeping their love platonic. That’s after a decade of earnest shipping and also a </span><i><span>whole fucking lot </span></i><span>of fan works. There are </span><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Judy%20Hopps*s*Nick%20Wilde/works"><span>literally thousands of fanfiction entries</span></a><span> of the two’s hypothetical relationship, and the Nick and Judy tags on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/rule-34-rule34dle-guessing-game-stream-site-where-play-2000642575"><span>Rule 34</span></a><span> both have five-figure post counts of illustrated smut. But in </span><i><span>Zootopia 2</span></i><span>, Nick says, “Love you, partner,” at the end of the movie, and he means that platonically. Jury’s still out on how he feels about abortions, though. But hey, he has some very weird hangups about reptiles that are giving “conservative cousin at Thanksgiving,” so maybe he’s anti-choice, and we’ll find out when </span><i><span>Zootopia 3 </span></i><span>comes out sometime in the 2030s.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review—A Cosmic Blast]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is the latest game in the recent run of arcade-style beat ‘em ups that have made a resurgence in recent years. From the same developers behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge and the upcoming Scott Pilgrim EX comes a new telling of a popular storyline from the mid-2000s.</p>



<p>Annihilus has launched an attack across the galaxy. It’s up to you to fight your way across earth and beyond to stop the Annihilation Wave from destroying everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion takes a classic Saturday morning cartoon energy and blends it with the slick pixel art style fans have come to expect from Tribute Games. Each level is loaded with bright animations, detailed designs, impressive music, and clever nods to the original Annihilation comics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What helps sell the experience is how fast everything moves. Combat is quick, responsive, and surprisingly readable even when four players are swapping characters with a screen full of enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It feels chaotic in a good way. There’s just enough depth to keep the action engaging without overwhelming players who just want a fun, vintage beat ‘em up.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-cosmic-invasion-review">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review</h2>



<p>The main gameplay element of Marvel Cosmic Invasion is its “Cosmic Swap” system. This allows you to quickly swap with the second character you select for your run. Players can go solo or play with up to three friends, and choose two characters per level or run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each hero—there are 15 in total after everyone is unlocked—has their own list of moves. Some have a couple more than others, but even those with fewer moves still feel fun such as Storm and Black Panther.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With your two heroes selected, you can swap out as often as you’d like when both characters are still alive. But, it’s not always about swapping whenever you like. Sure, you can do that or just not swap at all for that matter. But there’s a benefit towards timing the change during your fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can swap to perform combos with certain characters. One such combo is using Beta Ray Bill’s “Soaring Hammer” attack that sends enemies into the air followed by a Spider-Man swinging kick to launch them off a ledge. There are even Cosmic Assists that can be called in such as specials or other attacks to do extra damage and clear out larger groups of enemies.</p>



<p>You can even use the swap to get out of trouble. For example, you could find yourself grabbed by a tentacle. Swapping allows your other hero to come in and free the trapped character.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-quick-campaign">A Quick Campaign</h2>



<p>In the game you have the option to play the campaign in a modern format with saved progress or do it with an old-school arcade experience with limited lives, continues, and no save progression. For a first run, it’s definitely recommended to go through with progression because it also allows you to unlock everything available.</p>



<p>Each level has hero-specific challenges that allow you to earn Cosmic Cubes for the Cosmic Matrix. That matrix is where you unlock new color pallets, music tracks, corps files (bios), and arcade-mode modifiers like faster enemies, the ability to play as the same character, free play, and more. As you complete levels, you’ll also upgrade your heroes with extra HP, focus upgrades, and passive skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can play each level with whomever you want, but the cutscenes they show will feature the characters the level was designed for. So, if your challenges call for She-Hulk and Storm like in the Savage Land, that’s who you’ll see in the scenes. They’ll also be highlighted on the character selection screen as a reminder.</p>



<p>In the campaign, it also offers what look to be branching paths. But it’s kind of misleading. You’ll see branches that make it look like completing the level before it will allow you to progress only to find you need to complete both anyway to move forward. It makes the lines kind of pointless.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There were also a couple times where bugs required full level restart. During the boss fight on the second level, one of my characters died (Wolverine). Rather than swap the way it should’ve to Storm, the fight kept going but I couldn’t play. Wolverine just stayed laying down. The only solution was to restart the level. Then, it happened again at the same point.</p>



<p>Those were the only instances where it happened, and it was tough to figure out what actually caused it. It’s something that will certainly be fixed in an update, but shouldn’t have made it through in the first place.</p>



<p>Overall, the campaign will take you about three-to-seven hours depending on how you play for a first run. With everything to find and unlock, however, it’s not likely to be the only playthrough you want to do.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-cosmic-invasion-review-verdict">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review Verdict</h2>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion hits the sweet spot between nostalgic arcade fun and modern polish. The Cosmic Swap system gives combat a surprising amount of strategy, the roster has no real duds, and the progression loop makes it easy to jump back in for another level or run. A couple of bugs do hurt the momentum, but not enough to take away from how enjoyable the ride is. If you are looking for a co-op brawler to play with friends, this one delivers in every way.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games co-founder and ex-GTA boss Dan Houser has given more opinions on artificial intelligence, claiming that we're not too far off from a future in which the controversial technology eats itself in some sort of ouroboros way that gives us mad cow (AI?) disease.</p><p>Speaking to Chris Evans (not the actor) for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4RTTcvFxJU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his Virgin Radio UK Breakfast Show on November 26</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/rockstar-co-founder-compares-ai-to-mad-cow-disease-and-says-the-execs-pushing-it-arent-fully-rounded-humans/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Houser was asked about his gaming origins, the founding of Rockstar Games and the creation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto/" data-ref-id="5000-1060">Grand Theft Auto</a>, and his new sci-fi thriller novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Better Paradise</a>. During the nearly 30-minute chat, Evans questioned Houser about the technodystopia he laid out in A Better Paradise and whether AI is as amazing as C-suite executives want us to think it is. Houser isn't fully convinced.</p>

<p>"I personally don't think it will because AI is going to eventually eat itself," Houser said. "As far as I understand it--which is really a superficial understanding--the models scour the internet for information, but the internet is going to get more and more full of information made by the models. So, it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease. I can't see how the information will get better if they're running out of data. [AI] will do some tasks brilliantly, but it's not going to do every task brilliantly, and it's going to become this sort of mirror of itself."</p><p>It's worth mentioning that Houser is possibly hinting at the "dead internet" theory, or the idea that the internet is largely made up of bots and AI-generated content engaging with and scraping itself. A <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2024/05/-the-dead-internet-theory-makes-eerie-claims-about-an-ai-run-web-the-truth-is-more-sinister" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">May 2024 paper by the University of New South Wales</a> purports that the implications of this theory--and the evidence we're seeing with the proliferation of tools like chatbots and LLMs--suggest a more sinister undertone of politicking and profiteering.</p><p>Houser admitted that AI can "get you some information very quickly" if you ask it to perform specific tasks, but he noted that it's still "random and wrong a lot of the time." He also clarified that, particularly as an underscore to his novel, the "human element" can never be replaced by AI, no matter how hard billionaires want it to.</p><p>"Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity, or whatever it is using AI are not the most humane or creative people," Houser said. "So they're sort of saying, 'We're better at being human than you are,' and it's obviously not true. That's one of the other things we're trying to capture is that humanity is being pulled in a direction by a certain group of people who maybe aren't fully rounded humans."</p><p>Houser's latest AI criticism follows his previous comments about the controversial technology. While touring his novel, he said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-boss-dan-houser-thinks-ai-is-overrated/1100-6536480/" data-ref-id="1100-6536480">AI is overrated</a> and claimed the games industry is at a tough crossroads.</p><p>"[Gaming] can either go somewhere really interesting or somewhere that gets overly focused on making money," Houser said on a November 23 episode of Channel 4's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaJ8EIebQ8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunday Brunch</a>. "I think there's always that danger with any commercial art form that they get distracted by money. But I think there's still a big ceiling creatively to make these kind of living narrative experiences, and I think that was what we were always trying to do."</p><p>Dan Houser is no longer with Rockstar Games, but development continues at the studio on Grand Theft Auto 6. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">recently suffered a delay</a> to November 19, 2026, and has found itself at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">the center of controversy over the firing of staffers</a>.</p>

<p>Featuring 24 UK variety and gaming influencers, the event showcased <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World's</a> Knockout Tour at its most chaotic. The selected streamers were split into <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRfGgROjV48/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==">six teams of four</a>, and commemorative trophies were offered to the quartet that accumulated the most points throughout the competition. Clearly, <em>much</em> more than honour was at stake here.</p>
<p>Hosted by IGN UK’s George Forsyth-Nash (aka Nash) and <a href="https://www.outsidextra.com/">Outside Xtra’s Jane Douglas</a>, The Mario Kart World: Knockout Tour Streamer Showdown also benefited from insights by Outside Xtra's Mike Channell and presenter Jules Hardy, both of whom were on hand to supply colour commentary and general Mario-related waffle.</p>

<p>Some of the UK's biggest streamers took part, including TooBizyGaming, GetMadz, OwengeJuiceTV, KickThePj, InTheLittleWood, TheOrionSound and ReadySetBen.</p>
<p>The event delivered a true masterclass in Mario Kart skills, but ultimately, it was the Orange Team (TheOrionSound, Solidarity, InTheLittleWood and Ravs) which emerged victorious, while the poor old Red Team came in last. Better luck next time, guys!</p>

			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been out for a little more than two weeks at the time of this writing, and according to the latest report of <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD Sales Data</a> from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-drops-to">The Game Business</a>, it has already lost some ground in the EU sales charts in its second week on the market. Meanwhile, games that haven't been in the charts for some time reappeared, thanks to favourable Black Friday sales.</p>



<p>In its launch week, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was able to reach the top of the charts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">though its numbers were 63% worse than Battlefield 6</a>. In its second week (November 17-23), it fell to the number two spot in the charts, with EA Sports FC 26 overtaking it on both the revenue chart and the units sold chart.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6, meanwhile, stayed within the top five, but made it in the number three spot, just behind Black Ops 7 on both charts. Other recent releases like Anno 117: Pax Romana and Pokémon Legends Z-A were able to keep their spots in the top ten for both lists, <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-26-knocks-battlefield-6-out-of-eu-sales-charts-top-spot-with-the-biggest-launch-in-gsd-weekly-charts-history/">while Football Manager 26 has seemingly disappeared after its standout opening week</a>.</p>



<p>The only other new addition to the list with regard to newly released games is Kirby Air Riders, which barely scratched into the revenue list in the number ten spot. The rest of the new additions to either chart came from Black Friday sales, boosting older titles. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and It Takes Two both reappeared in the charts due to the holiday sales.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top ten best-selling games by units sold in the EU per GSD Data for the week of November 17-23:</p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
