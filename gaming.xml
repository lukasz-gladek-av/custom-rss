            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of the biggest announcements made <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-sony-ps5-god-war-castlevania-kena-castlevania-2000668291">during Sony’s first PlayStation State of Play of the year</a> wasn’t for a brand new game or a new entry in a popular franchise. It was instead a small teaser for a remake of the original <em>God of War</em> trilogy. This is just the latest example of a big series going backwards, and more proof that big publishers are getting more and more risk-averse, even with some of the most popular franchises around.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/original-god-of-war-trilogy-getting-a-full-remake-2000668356"><em>God of War Trilogy Remake</em></a>, which is hopefully not the final name for the actual project, was announced on Thursday during the latest State of Play. TC Carson is back as the voice of Kratos, returning to the role he originated back during the original trilogy. That’s cool. And perhaps if this were the only big franchise returning to its past instead of moving forward, I’d be more jazzed about this announcement. The reality, however, is that this is becoming a depressing trend in the game industry.</p>

 <p>Last year, Xbox announced that Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) is <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">remaking the original </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>,</em> and it will launch in 2026 on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and PS5. Microsoft has promised more <em>Halo </em>games in the future, but it is very telling that after a few misfires, Xbox is running back to the safety of the first game for its next big project.</p> <p>Fans have been wanting a new <em>Splinter Cell</em> game for a very long time. But instead, Ubisoft is working on a remake of the original game. When will this remake launch? Unclear. And considering how many games Ubisoft has recently canceled, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866">including a remake of the first<em> Prince of Persia</em> game released on PS2</a>, I’m not confident that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-splinter-cell-being-remade-by-far-cry-6-devs-1848221698"><em>Splinter Cell</em> remake</a> will even happen.</p>

 <p><em>Max Payne</em> is a series that hasn’t received a new game since Rockstar’s<em> Max Payne 3 </em>back in 2012. So it’s disappointing that the next <em>Max Payne</em> project officially in development isn’t <em>Max Payne 4</em> or an interesting spin-off, but instead a remake of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/remedy-remaking-max-payne-1-and-2-inside-control-engine-1848759888">first two games being developed by series creators Remedy Entertainment.</a></p>

 <p><em>Tomb Raider</em> is also getting a full remake of its first game later this year in the form of <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-tomb-raider-game-details-leak-and-it-looks-like-a-reboot-2000652612">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>.</em> This one is especially annoying because there already exists a remake of the first game, <em>Anniversary</em>, which was released in 2007. Not to mention the OG game was remastered not long ago. At least in this case, we do know that there’s a totally new <em>Tomb Raider</em> game in the works as well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-tomb-raiders-new-lara-croft-2000652781?"><i>Tomb Raider Catalyst</i>, which is launching in 2027</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-e-day-trailer-marcus-dom-xbox-sgf-showcase-1851528894">I’d also toss the upcoming <em>Gears of War</em> game, <em>E-Day</em>,</a> on this pile. Sure, it isn’t a remake, but it is a prequel starring the original characters from the first game, Marcus and Dom, and it looks to be entirely focused on recapturing the nostalgic feelings of gamers who played the OG game 20 years ago on Xbox 360. Meanwhile, will we get a continuation of the characters and storyline established in <em>Gears of War 4</em> and <em>Gears 5</em>? <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-e-day-gears-6-ending-storyline-2025-1851528933">Maybe. But it will likely be years from now, if ever</a>.</p>

 <p>And now we can add <em>God of War</em> to this growing pile of old franchises going backwards instead of doing something new or unique with their established characters and lore. Video games are taking longer and longer to make and cost more money than ever. One flop can sink a studio or destroy a publisher. And even Xbox, Sony, Rockstar, and Amazon are so risk-averse these days that some of these big franchises are being forced to cash in on nostalgia instead of moving forward and telling new stories. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/oblivion-remastered-is-already-the-third-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us-industry-analyst-says/">Considering how successful last year’s <em>Oblivion</em> remaster/remake was</a>, I’m not surprised publishers are continuing on in this direction. Welcome to the future, folks. It looks very familiar, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>REANIMAL constantly has you on the edge of your seat, and while you fight for survival and ways to escape, there’s a wealth of collectables to hunt down, including all the Masks to earn the Beneath The Mask Achievement.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tarsier-studios/" id="1858">Tarsier Studios</a>‘ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/reanimal/" id="170941">REANIMAL</a> is split into nine chapters, and Masks can be found in almost every chapter. Additionally, they’re easy to miss, as there is no way to return to a specific section. Instead, the game must be started from scratch if you fail to find everything the first time around.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for the Beneath the Mask achievement in REANIMAL, Insider Gaming has the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-reanimal-mask-locations-listed">All REANIMAL Mask Locations, Listed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to collect. Image via Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-chapter-1-mask-locations">Chapter 1 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Bird Head</strong></p>



<p>The first Mask to collect in REANIMAL is found in the Mill section of Chapter 1, after you have passed through the giant fan. The mask is available soon after your first encounter with The Sniffer.</p>



<p>When the Sniffer appears, run past the big door he closes and turn left, then interact with the wall to hoist your companion up to the platform. Continue to climb the platform, using the companion’s help, until you reach the top of the ladder.</p>



<p>Head left until you reach a door and follow the platform to a crack in the wall. Then collect the Bird Head inside.</p>



<p><strong>Worm Head</strong></p>



<p>The Worm Head mask is again found in the Mill, once you have stopped the boiler from spinning. Once that has been completed, go through the door to continue your progression.</p>



<p>Inside the room, open the locker on the right side to unlock a secret room, and head inside. The Worm Head is waiting inside.</p>



<p><strong>Conch Head</strong></p>



<p>The Conch Head is the final mask in Chapter 1, and is found near the train tracks. When standing alongside the draisine, head to the right-hand side, and enter the second door (the first one is a restroom).</p>



<p>Follow the platform up the stairs to reach a room with the Conch Head inside.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-2-mask-locations">Chapter 2 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Pig Head</strong></p>



<p>The Pig Head is the first mask in Chapter 1, available at the start of the village section.</p>



<p>Inside the Clothing Store, go to the left behind the counter. Here, crouch, and enter the hole in the wall found on the left-side. This leads to another secret room, where the Pig Head is found.</p>



<p><strong>Cone Head</strong></p>



<p>After surviving your close experience with the Sniffer, exit the cinema and go to the broken building on the right side of the main square. Keep an eye out for a citter that exits the broken building. It will enter a secret room on the right-hand side.</p>



<p>Using the crowbar, pull the planks off the door and enter. Hit the critter with the crowbar to kill it and collect the Cone Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-3-mask-locations">Chapter 3 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Deer Head</strong></p>



<p>The Deer Head is found soon after you kill the seagulls that are attacking you, using the crowbar. Once that’s done, climb to the top of both ladders to reach the flower field.</p>



<p>Go to the far left side of the flower field to find a scarecrow and hit it with the crowbar. Then, kill the critter that appears to collect the Deer Head from its dead body.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-4-mask-locations">Chapter 4 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Bucket Head</strong></p>



<p>In Chapter 4, the Bucket Head is found in the Orphanage section, and can be from the area with the petrified spider kids. While here, destroy them all to earn the Scared to Dust achievement. </p>



<p>In this room, head to the right-hand side of the room, crouch, and go through the bookshelf to reach a secret area. A critter will then run out of the room, into the area you were just in.</p>



<p>Exit the secret room back into the main room of the clock tower and kill the critter using the crowbar. Then, collect the Bucket Head from its body.</p>



<p><strong>Crown Head</strong></p>



<p>The Crown Head is found shortly after the Bucket Head, after the spider kids begin to attack you in the next area aftern the main room of the clock tower.</p>



<p>Inside the food hall, go into the middle of the room and kill all the spider kids that appear. When the spider kids climb down from the throne from the right side of the room, go behind the throne. One of the kids who appears is the spider king, identifiable by the crown on his head.</p>



<p>Using the crowbar, kill the spider king quickly, as he will leave the room if you don’t kill him quickly. Once he’s defeated, collect the Crown Head from the body.</p>



<p><strong>Plant Head</strong></p>



<p>The Plant Head is the final mask in Chapter 4 and is found just after you reach the point with the child wearing the bucket. Kill all of the spiders before advancing.</p>



<p>Once the spider kids are defeated, shimmy through the crack in the broken bed. Then, head through the door on the other side. Once through the door, walk back towards the camera and shimmy through a crack in the wall.</p>



<p>Pull out the Plant Head from the ground, then pick up the Plant Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-5-mask-locations">Chapter 5 Mask Locations</h3>



<p>There are no masks to find in Chapter 5 of REANIMAL.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-6-mask-locations">Chapter 6 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Fish Head</strong></p>



<p>Once you input the code on Cannon Island, the Fish Head is ready to claim. First, though, there’s a small cutscene to watch.</p>



<p>When it’s finished, go left and shimmy through the door of the bunker, and down the ladder to the bottom. From here, jump down to the beach below.</p>



<p>Head to the left-hand side of the beach to find a critter and kill it. Then, collect the Fish Head from the body.</p>



<p><strong>Package Head</strong></p>



<p>To get the Package Head, return to the boat after firing the cannon on Cannon Island, and enter the path that was previously protected by the Brook Horse until you reach a big opening.</p>



<p>Continue down the path, blowing up any mines by throwing the harpoon, and when you get to the end of the path, turn left and follow the cliffs until you reach the mines, which you need to blow up again using the harpoon.</p>



<p>Follow the path to reach a beach, drive the boat onto the beach, and collect the Package Head from the middle of the area.</p>



<p><strong>Diving Helmets</strong></p>



<p>There are two Diving Helmets to collect, both at the same point, which are found soon after the cutscene following the chase by Brook Horse.</p>



<p>Once the cutscene ends, wait for the characters to put down their costumes, and then pick up each of the Diving Helmets.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-7-mask-locations">Chapter 7 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Bush Head</strong></p>



<p>The Bush Head mask is obtainable right at the start of Chapter 7. After the cutscene ends, go forward into the next area, and head to the right-hand side to find a small metallic door.</p>



<p>Crouch to go under the door into the secret area, and pick up the Bush Head.</p>



<p><strong>Mine Head</strong></p>



<p>The Mine Head is obtained immediately after the Bush Head. Once you pick up the Bush Head, go down the ramp on the left and proceed forward past the two dead soldiers, then turn right and go past the shotrgun soldier.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the trench, turn right and shimmy through the broken wall, and collect the Mine Head in the area.</p>



<p><strong>Rabbit Head</strong></p>



<p>Once the Mine Head is collected, go further into the trench until you reach a soldier blocking the way. Approach the soldier to trigger an animation, run a safe distance away from the soldier, and then go past the exploding soldier to the opening.</p>



<p>Now, head left and shimmy through the broken wall to collect the Rabbit Head.</p>



<p><strong>Amphibian Head</strong></p>



<p>The Amphibian Head is the penultimate mask to collect in REANIMAL and can be collected once you reach the surgery room in the hospital in Chapter 8.</p>



<p>Find the desk on the right-hand side of the room, crouch, and go under the desk into the next room, then pick up the Amphibian Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-8-mask-locations">Chapter 8 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Gas Head</strong></p>



<p>The Gas Head is the final mask to find in REANIMAL, and is available to obtain once you have shot the hanging soldier, who drops a key.</p>



<p>Use this key to unlock the door on the right-hand side of the area and go through it, then look for the oven and interact with it to open the door with a crowbar. No, head back into the shooting range, and shoot the critter with a gun or rifle, and pick up the Gas Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-9-mask-locations">Chapter 9 Mask Locations</h3>



<p>There are no masks or any other collectables to find in Chapter 9.</p>

Yet fate proved unstoppable, and they paid the ultimate price.</p><p>Now, as the Night starts devouring every single glint of light, Vesper, a Stalker by right and daughter of the traitor, will travel a dying land trying to save the last embers of humanity.

<p>Nioh 3 has proved popular since its debut. On its first weekend in the wild, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-reaches-almost-90000-concurrent-players-on-pc-after-launch-over-doubling-series-record">game welcomed just shy of 90,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. As our Connor reported at the time, this was <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1325200/charts/">over double what Nioh 2 achieved on the same platform</a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/485510/charts/">eight times what the original Nioh managed</a>.</p><p>"It feels as though the series, after three iterations, has finally refined its formula to the point of excellence: like the shogun it so reveres, it has taken the roots of what has come before, paid homage to its legacy, and deigned to build something even more powerful - something even more enduring - on those foundations," our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review">Dom wrote in Eurogamer's Nioh 3 review</a>.</p>
<p>"Enjoy the brutality, revel in the power fantasy, and let yourself be hammered into the ground by the blunt-force trauma of a world dedicated to seeing everything in terms of absolutes."</p>

			<p><strong>Castlevania: Belmont's Curse</strong>, a brand new 2D game in <strong>KONAMI</strong>'s revered series, was announced yesterday <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the State of Play</a>. This year, the franchise celebrates its <strong>40th anniversary</strong>, and fans are thrilled not only because of the new game (the first since <strong>2014's Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2</strong>) but also because KONAMI <strong>has confirmed it's just the first in a series of new projects</strong>.</p>



<p>Castlevania: Belmont's Curse is set more than two decades after the events of <strong>Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</strong> and the recent animated series on Netflix. It takes place in the streets of <strong>15th-century Paris</strong>, where a new chapter of the legendary House Belmont is about to be written in bloody red ink. Armed with the legendary holy whip "Vampire Killer", the protagonist, Trevor Belmont's successor, must descend into the French capital city <strong>under attack by monstrous creatures</strong>, making his way to a looming mystical castle to hunt down the beasts and save the Parisians from eternal darkness.</p>



<p>Long-time fans and newcomers to the franchise <strong>will have to master different weapons and spells</strong> if they hope to defeat these foes. Moreover, the developers (<strong>Evil Empire</strong> and <strong>Motion Twin</strong>) suggested that <strong>thoroughly exploring the castle will benefit daring players</strong>. New areas are rich with secrets and puzzles to uncover, as well as deadly traps that demand constant vigilance.</p>



<p>The iconic whip, a <strong>trademark of the Castlevania franchise</strong>, returns with renewed purpose and will now serve as a vital traversal tool, <strong>allowing players to swing across diverse areas to uncover hidden rooms</strong> and reach previously inaccessible areas. Mastery of the whip’s mechanics also unlocks alternative combat possibilities, enabling players to strike enemies from unconventional positions.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The hottest indie game is about breeding cats with ADHD and dyslexia]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/877906/mewgenics-steam-sales-edmund-mcmillen-interview</link>
            <guid>1435216</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When the <em>Mewgenics </em>team announced in 2024 that it had added autism to the list of disorders the game’s cats could inherit, developer Edmund McMillen — best known as the co-creator of <em>Super Meat Boy</em> — was unprepared for the reaction.</p><p>“It was like the most positive response I’ve ever had to anything I posted,” he says. On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/evilautism/comments/1j3y70r/holy_shit_autism_creature_representation_in/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@edmundmcmillen/video/7403411133987573034">TikTok</a>, fans expressed gratitude and excitement for the inclusion. “Everybody was like, ‘This is the perfect representation for autism. I feel seen,’ etc., etc.,” McMillen says. “That felt like somebody opened the door and said, ‘Go on. Go ahead, do your thing.’”</p><p><em>Mewgenics</em>, which launched for PC on February 10th, is the year’s first surprise indie hit. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/20/3530584/mew-genics-team-meat-announcement">Announced in 2013</a>, it was originally a Team Meat title from McMillen and Tommy Refenes; McMillen saved the project after it was put on hiatus. A darkly funny and deceptively complex combo of adorable characters, roguelike gameplay, and tactical roleplaying, <em>Mewgenics</em> is, as the pun in its name suggests, a game about breeding and bloodlines. It’s currently Steam’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2F" rel="sponsored">top-selling game</a> this week. Co-creator Tyler Glaiel <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-sells-over-150k-copies-in-first-6-hours-this-is-beating-expectations-by-quite-a-lot">told <em>IGN</em></a> it took less than three hours to recoup development costs, while McMillen tells <em>The Verge</em> the game is already expected to top 500,000 units sold. “It’s blown past anything I’ve ever done by a mile,” he says.</p><p>The game’s arrival in 2026, when <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/rfk-jr-vaccines-eugenics">misinformation about disorders</a> like autism is rampant and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/sundance-doc-ghost-in-the-machine-draws-a-damning-line-between-ai-and-eugenics-180613367.html">pro-eugenics</a> <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2026/02/epstein-emails-eugenics-chomsky-altruism-billionaires/">attitudes</a> abound, is eerily topical, albeit accidental. McMillen, to be clear, has not created an intentional commentary on the state of the world. “I hate politics,” he says. “It’s a game about cats fucking, you know what I mean?”</p><p>There is a deluge of mutations and disorders cats can inherit in the game — from bad gas or kidney stones to ADHD and depression — that impact their stats. ADHD gives players only seconds to make decisions or the cat will start acting on its own. Autism includes accelerated intelligence but lower charisma; the cat will be naturally very good at the abilities they’re born with, but other skills might be a little more difficult. “I’m very well versed in this,” McMillen says. “I have two children that are on the spectrum, and I have a wife who is as well. … It has been a big part of my life for the past 10 years.”</p><div><p>“I want people to play and read between the lines.”</p></div><p><em>Mewgenics</em> includes over 100 disorders — name one, McMillen says, and it’s probably in the game — but each has its own silver lining. The point isn’t to immediately dump cats with certain disorders, but to appreciate them. “I want people to play and read between the lines,” McMillen says. “I want you to have a cat with autism, and instead of throwing it away, realizing its strengths and embracing the challenge and potential that that cat would have.”</p><p><em>Mewgenics</em> is a personal project for McMillen, one that haunted him for years when it was unfinished. “I fell in love with the characters, and I fell in love with the world, and I fell in love with the things that I thought were interesting and fun about the genetic aspect of it,” McMillen says. The game’s road to release has been over a decade in the making; following their success with<em> Super Meat Boy</em>, he originally conceived the project with Refenes. While the original project was about cat breeding and the genetics involved, McMillen says, it wasn’t actually much of a game. “It was like a toy, a little idle game where you would breed your cats, and then you’d use your cats in minigames,” McMillen says.</p><p>After 18 months of development and a public showing at PAX, however, McMillen says that Refenes’ enthusiasm for the project had waned. “It was very apparent that I was the only person that wanted to continue working on the project,” McMillen says. “And I can’t force somebody to just continue to work on something.” The pair decided to put the project on pause to work on another <em>Super Meat Boy</em> project.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel</cite></p></div><p>To McMillen’s surprise, he received an email from Steam expressing condolences about the game’s cancellation. After talking with Refenes, McMillen says, it became clear that <em>Mewgenics</em> would never happen while he worked at Team Meat. When McMillen left Team Meat in 2016, he took <em>Mewgenics</em> with him.</p><p>After teaming up with Glaiel, the two spent another six years reworking it into the massive game it exists as today; Glaiel did extensive amounts of research into breeding — and inbreeding — to work out the finer points of the game’s main mechanic. Felines can be any sexuality, and how their relationships progress is sometimes out of the player’s hands. “They can be very passive,” McMillen says. “They can have rivals. They can fall in love. They can be rejected.” Online, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1qzfwae/edmund_mcmillen_here_mewgenics_is_steam_deck/">he’s said</a> the game will take most players over 200 hours to finish.</p><p>Writing <em>Mewgenics</em> has made McMillen regard some of his previous work differently. He points specifically to <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> and its themes on nature versus nurture and “how nurture can really fuck a kid up.” Some struggles in life, however, are inherited.</p><p>“The game definitely became more about children — the experience of raising children,” McMillen says, reflecting on how fatherhood changed his view of the game from its inception to release. “The legacy that you leave, and the genetics that you pass to them and curse them with. I started to write more from that perspective.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDE2MzM="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Megan Farokhmanesh</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/877906/mewgenics-steam-sales-edmund-mcmillen-interview]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega </a>has big plans for the immediate future.</p>



<p>On February 13, 2026, <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf">Sega announced its third-quarter earnings</a> for the fiscal year 2026. When outlining their business initiatives for the upcoming fiscal year, Sega stated that they planned to release four major new titles for their mainstay properties.</p>







<h2 id="h-sega-has-a-wealth-of-classic-properties-to-choose-from">Sega Has A Wealth of Classic Properties to Choose From</h2>



<p>Sega was once a titan of the gaming industry. At one time, they had even knocked Nintendo out of the number one spot during the Golden Age of the console wars of the 1990s. For most of the last three decades, however, they have focused on third-party software development, continuing the legacy of their popular gaming IPs on other platforms.</p>



<p>Several years ago, Sega announced it was developing new games in its classic series. The rollout schedule in Sega’s earnings presentation reaffirms this. Not only did they say they plan to release at least four major games across mainstay properties, but the release schedule also lists new projects in the Virtua Fighter, Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi franchises. Alien: Isolation is also listed. All six of those titles have TBD release dates.</p>







<p>With forthcoming releases in those classic properties, Sega could be hoping to return to a higher level of notoriety. Recently, Konami announced a return of one of its strongest franchises, Castlevania.

		<p>Konami, Evil Empire and Motion Twin have announced Castlevania: Belmont’s Curse, an all-new 2D side-scrolling metroidvania that will release this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Castlevania: Belmont‘s Curse Announcement Trailer (ESRB) | KONAMI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3k9Yy-o6tpo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set more than two decades after Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse, Belmont’s Curse is set in 15th century Paris. The whip has been passed on to Trevor Belmont’s successor, who must head out into the city and battle monstrous creatures, heading into a mystical castle and threatens to doom Paris to eternal darkness.</p>
<p>It’s the 40th anniversary of the Castlevania series, and so it’s a massively fan-pleasing announcement to see a new 2D game announced, and then to have such highly regarded developers behind it. Original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/06/dead-cells-review/">Dead Cells</a> studio Motion Twin is here in an advisory role, while their successor studio at Evil Empire are the main developers alongside Konami on Belmont’s Curse. Evil Empire was founded in 2019 to continue to support Dead Cells, but since wrapping up that game’s DLC in 2023, moved on to adapt <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/26/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-review/">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> as a roguelite, which hit its full release last year.</p>
<p>Evil Empire are no strangers to Castlevania, though. The fourth and final expansion for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/13/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-review/">Dead Cells was Return to Castlevania</a>, arriving in 2023 with characters, weapons and enemies licensed from the Castlevania series. With a working relationship already established, and that DLC well-received, they’re getting a second crack of the whip at the franchise. What’s interesting is that, where Dead Cells and TRPOP were both rougelites, this is described as a “2D Action-Exploration”, implying a more traditional metroidvania. One to keep an eye on, that’s for sure.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Escape From Ever After (Switch) - The Closest We've Yet Come To A Brand-New, Old-School Paper Mario]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/escape-from-ever-after</link>
            <guid>1435177</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Once upon a time...</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section><section><p>While we continue to wait for a true RPG sequel to the early <strong>Paper Mario</strong> games, many indie developers have attempted to fill the void, and while nobody has <em>quite</em> managed to recapture their magic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/escape_from_ever_after">Escape from Ever After</a> feels like the closest anyone has gotten yet. It’s got some quirks, but it does a great job of offering an approachable, funny, and brief take on the lighthearted RPG format many fans crave more of.</p>
<p>It follows the plight of Flynt Buckler, a fairytale hero who arrives at the castle of the dragon he’s destined to defeat in his story, only to discover the beast’s lair has been appropriated by a corporation. Flynt is then politely but firmly recruited into a low-level job in the company, kicking off an adventure in which he travels between various books, fulfilling tasks for his corporate overlords while searching for a way to overthrow them.</p>
<p>It's a cute and clever story driven by surprisingly strong characters and witty, lighthearted writing. Not every joke lands quite as well as intended, but Sleepy Castle Studio is clearly making a game more targeted towards adult audiences and the humour generally hits more than it misses.</p>
<p>Gameplay follows the format established by the more RPG-forward Paper Mario games, wherein you navigate a world that rewards exploration and light platforming prowess. Every party member has their own special field ability and these are often utilised and combined in clever ways for the many puzzles to solve throughout the environment, which feels densely packed with interesting things to do and goodies to find.</p>
<p>Familiar turn-based combat integrates some light timing-based commands for variety. Timely taps or releases of a button can lead to both more damage output and increased defence, which means that success in battle is reliant on both dexterity <em>and</em> raw numbers. As you defeat enemies, you slowly level up the whole party at once, with equippable Trinkets offering you some additional ability to distinguish their stats and abilities further from each other. It's a strong system, though the timing windows can sometimes feel just a <em>bit</em> wonky, leading to some missed inputs that feel unfair.</p>
<p>Aside from the timing windows, the only real complaint I have is that there isn’t quite enough of it. It wraps up after about 20 hours and while that’s decent value for your money, it feels like this game ends just as it’s getting <em>really</em> good.</p>
<p>The visuals do a great job of combining charming 2D characters with simple but effective 3D environments that contrast nicely with their flat forms. Playing on the Switch 2 is especially nice, too, as you can opt for a performance mode that ratchets up to a smooth 60fps with no obvious hit to the resolution.</p>
<p>If you’re at all a fan of the more RPG-focused Mario RPGs, you owe it to yourself to play Escape from Ever After. It may be over a bit too quickly, but the writing, charm, and gameplay mechanics all come together to make for something you won’t want to miss.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/escape-from-ever-after]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's 1996. The weather's crap. You're wandering the streets of a Scottish village that looks deserted aside from some lumbering horrors who seem intent on sticking weird needles into you.

<p>Revealed during last night's PlayStation State of Play, Townfall's the next quiet knoll entry after last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>. Glasgow-based developers Screen Burn, makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stories-untold-review">Stories Untold</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/observation-review">Observation</a>, have opted to being the series' signature spooks to Scotland.</p>
<p>A first-person perspective puts you into the shoes of protagonist Simon Ordell, who's returning to a sleepy town on the island of St. Amelia. He's got some past connection to the deserted and fog-veiled place, which is probably to blame for the fact he seems to keep waking up in the water next to its docks. Armed with a pocket television that'll probably illicit plenty of memories if you show it to your dad and a peculiar hospital drip thing in his arm, he wanders about looking for clues.</p>
<p>This being a Silent Hill game, there are semi-human monsters wandering about whom he'll need to deal with via some well-timed stealth or violence. Plus some puzzles to unpuzzle.</p>
<p>Sark about 90s Scotland instilling existential dread, as someone who's had good fun with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall</a> over the past couple of years, I'm well up for more games depicting spooky or mysterious goings on in the northern bit of Sadness Island. My view's certainly skewed by the fact I live here, but Townfall looks like it has potential for some unique spooks, assuming it doesn't go the slightly disappointing route of just being a fairly standard Silent Hill game which happens to be set in the UK.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's due out at some point in 2026 and you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1636440/SILENT_HILL_Townfall/">Steam</a> here if you're so inclined.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[High On Life 2: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-the-kotaku-review-2000668283</link>
            <guid>1435168</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>During an extremely tense narrative moment late in </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span>, I tried to do something silly: I pointed one of my talking alien gun companions at the villain of the story and pulled the trigger. The gun stopped me. I did it again. Once again, the alien gun said no. When I tried once more, my weapon friend stopped me yet again…but warned that, next time, it wouldn’t. If I </span><i><span>really </span></i><span>wanted to interrupt this scripted moment and shoot the bad guy in the face, it would let me do that. And so I pulled that trigger again, and the game reacted, and I laughed. Later, while fighting that same villain in the game’s big final boss fight, I died and got stuck in an infinite death loop when respawning. My only option is to restart from the beginning of the game or hope an upcoming patch fixes my predicament.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This is a perfect encapsulation of my experience with </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span>, out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. It is a shooter willing to react to the player at all times in creative and funny ways, but also one that is filled with messy bugs, poorly implemented mechanics, and other issues that sometimes derail the hijinks.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>She gets high, she gets high, on life 2&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span> is a follow-up to 2022’s surprise hit sci-fi comedy shooter </span><i><span>High on Life. </span></i><span>Like that last game, the sequel is a wacky FPS featuring a ton of goofy dialogue, gross-out humor, and oddball references to places like Party City and Spirit Halloween. This time around, however, controversial </span><i><span>Rick &amp; Morty </span></i><span>co-creator Jusitan Roiland isn’t involved, having left the company in 2023. For those worried that his absence would change the game’s vibes or humor, I can report that, for better or for worse, that isn’t the case.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>After defeating the evil G3 alien cartel in the last game and stopping them from turning humans into a drug, the nameless bounty hunter you played as during that adventure is now a celebrity. Over the next five years–as seen in a wild montage opening–you party, go on talk shows, and take down tons of other criminals and monsters, all while your sister goes off to join a resistance group that believes humans are still in danger.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That eventually gets her into trouble with a large alien pharma company, and in the process of saving her, you end up a criminal outlaw, join her group, and with the help of some new and old allies, you fight back and try to once again save humanity from aliens hell-bent on turning us into a controlled substance.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Some of those helpful allies are talking alien guns with faces. If you haven’t realized it yet, </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span> is weird. Yes, the big gimmick in the first game returns in</span><i><span> High on Life 2</span></i><span>. All of the weapons you use are talking characters with their own personalities, desires, and dreams.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This time around, you have some new guns to hang out with, including a married couple dealing with a lot of drama who function as twin handguns that spit out colorful goop together. My favorite new alien gun buddy is a former assassin who, after realizing the error of his ways, lets you cut his head off and shove it into a burst fire assault rifle that can fire spikes. I used him a lot. There are also some returning favorites, like the shotgun lizard alien Gus and the SMG-like Sweezy. The pistol voiced by Roiland, Kenny, doesn’t return, though he is referenced.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Feed your head, then shoot their heads</b></h2> <p><span>Combat in a first-person shooter is indeed different than usual when your rifle or handgun cracks jokes or reacts to things happening in the world. Sometimes I’d switch to a gun not because I thought it would help me in the ongoing firefight, but simply because I was curious how they might react to a situation.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For example, in one level, I walked under some dripping water and my gun gagged and spat it out. So I spent the next 10 minutes switching between each gun to see how they would react.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Noticeably, the guns seem less chatty than in the first game, but also have more voice lines. So I rarely heard them repeat lines, which was nice and made them less grating to carry around for a dozen hours.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Finally, a game that lets me shoot aliens with a talking gun while skateboarding!”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Squanch Games</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>First-person semi-open-world sci-fi comedy shooter</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Funny jokes, varied environments, lots of gags to find, alien guns look great</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Lots of bugs, frequent performance issues, so-so combat</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S (Played)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Nearly completed the full game after 15 hours, but the final boss fight broke</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date:</p>                 <p>February 13, 2026 (Launching in April on Switch 2) </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Unfortunately, combat involving these talking guns isn’t much to write home about. I wouldn’t classify the gunplay as bad, but enemies, while varied across the different levels you visit, don’t react much to shots and seem pretty dang stupid. I played on normal difficulty and never died once during combat outside of two deaths during boss fights.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>You can buy upgrades for your guns, as before, but they don’t improve the combat. They do help you kill more enemies faster, though, which is nice, as it helps you get through some longer encounters in less time.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The other big addition to combat is a skateboard, which you acquire early on. In most areas of the game, as well as most fights, you can skateboard around, grind rails, and hop about like it’s </span><i><span>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</span></i><span>. The game even directly references Tony Hawk’s games with floating letters you can collect, and it reveals who made all those letters in the first place.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Riding the skateboard is a blast as it moves fast and provides more ways to get around arenas during fights. But it can also cause some headaches as the controls are sometimes unresponsive. I frequently bounced off surfaces by accident or was unable to grind something for no apparent reason. Still, it is nice to be able to skate around areas quickly, and shooting guns from a skateboard is indeed cool, so I’m happy it’s here even if it doesn’t always work.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Go ask Alice for a funny joke</b></h2> <p><span>The humor in </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span> is a mix of meta references, absurdist nonsense, slapstick, and satire. I found the game’s ratio for good jokes to be solid. About three out of five jokes landed and made me at least smile or laugh. That’s pretty dang good for a video game.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Even better, if you just don’t want to talk to some weirdo for three minutes about an elevator or hear people giggling while delivering their lines, you can ignore most of the jokes in </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span>, which are often hidden out in the worlds you visit. Ignoring all of these gags would likely lead to a less funny experience. Still, if you hate this kind of low-energy, improv-heavy humor, well, skipping a lot of it is an option.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But like </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span>’s new skateboard, the comedy is only good when the game works correctly.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000668298" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668298"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668298">©Squanch Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Far too many jokes and gags were ruined in </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span> for different reasons, including dialogue cutting off other dialogue, characters getting stuck in reaction loops, audio disappearing randomly, or some other bug happening and derailing the punchline.</span></p> <p><span>I also ran into bugs and glitches outside of jokes. I got stuck playing </span><i><span>Bible Adventures</span></i><span> (yes, the actual NES game from back in the day) because I couldn’t back out. Another time I got stuck in the floor while trying to play hide-and-seek. Enemies spawned underground, forcing me to abandon a side encounter. One time, I couldn’t even switch my guns, making it impossible to solve one of </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span>’s many simple puzzles until I reset.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s a shame that this game is in such a rough state at launch, including numerous performance hiccups on Xbox Series X. There are some really cool and funny ideas in </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Shatter your illusions of love</b></h2> <p><span>One memorable mission involves a full-on murder mystery that you must solve, complete with an in-game notepad that lets you mark off clues and suspects. Another time, I visited a retro game planet with low-poly enemies and environments. A standout boss fight involved the baddie digitally inserting themselves into my high-tech bounty suit and clawing their way into my pause menu, forcing me to fight them in the different settings menus.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A favorite mission of mine takes place on a planet dedicated to conventions. Exploring the different cons, including a Murder Con and Human Con, was a treat, especially because I took the time to poke around and interact with everything and everyone I saw.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span> is a game that is chockablock with creativity and passion. One that rewards you for taking your time and poking at every corner and bit of it. The people who made this game jammed it full of ideas and details, many of which I probably missed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But wacky ideas, good jokes, and weird set pieces aren’t all it takes to make a great FPS. You need satisfying gunplay, consistent movement, and enemies that are engaging to kill.</span><i><span> High on Life 2</span></i><span> doesn’t pull that off. And when it does succeed at something, the odds are high that a bug or performance issue will get in the way or even outright break it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Maybe the ending of </span><i><span>High on Life 2</span></i><span> will completely change my mind. I’ll have to hope that the game is patched and I can escape my infinite death loop and beat the final boss. If that happens, I’ll return to this review and let you know. For now, I’d suggest people wait to see what’s fixed in the first update before hopping into this wonky but creative sci-fi adventure.&nbsp;</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-the-kotaku-review-2000668283]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1435162</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A developer who worked on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard"><u>Highguard</u></a> has discussed the "hate" he received after the free-to-play shooter debuted at December's The Game Awards, saying the game, and by extension its team, "turned into a joke from minute one, largely due to false assumptions about a million-dollar ad placement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just two weeks after the free-to-play game's January 26 launch, yesterday <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-studio-wildlight-hit-with-layoffs"><u>Wildlight let go all but a "core group of developers"</u></a> despite the newly unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-episode-2-is-here-with-a-new-warden-map-ranked-mode-and-more"><u>Episode 2</u></a>, and despite debuting in the top 10 in weekly active users on US Steam, and the top 20 on both US PlayStation and Xbox. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a candid <a href="https://x.com/Joshiepoo25/article/2022003361059631301" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>statement</u></a> posted to X/Twitter, tech artist and rigger Josh Sobel — who was one of those let go — talked about the impact of the launch on himself and the wellbeing of the entire team.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The day leading to The Game Awards 2025 was amongst the most exciting of my life. After 2.5yrs of passionately working on Highguard, we were ready to reveal it to the world. The future seemed bright. Everyone I knew who had any connection to the team or project had the same [positive] sentiments," he wrote, adding that "unbiased" internal pre-reveal feedback was "quite positive," and when it was negative, "it was constructive, and often actionable."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But then the trailer came out, and it was all downhill from there," Sobel added. "Content creators love to point out the bias in folks who give positive previews after being flown out for an event, but ignore the fact that when their negative-leaning content gets 10x the engagement of the positive, they’ve got just as much incentive to lean into a disingenuous direction, whether consciously or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The hate started immediately. In addition to dogpiling on the trailer, I personally came under fire due to my naïveté on Twitter, which almost all of my now-former coworkers had learned to avoid during their previous game launches," he explained. "After setting my Twitter account to private to protect my sanity, many content creators made videos and posts about me and my cowardice, amassing millions of views and inadvertently sending hundreds of angry gamers into my replies. They laughed at me for being proud of the game, told me to get out the McDonald’s applications, and mocked me for listing having autism in my bio, which they seemed to think was evidence the game would be 'woke trash.' All of this was very emotionally taxing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sobel acknowledged that there's "much constructive criticism" about Highguard's trailer, marketing, and launch, but also isn't sure if things would've been any better had the game not been announced at The Game Awards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were turned into a joke from minute one, largely due to false assumptions about a million-dollar ad placement, which even prominent journalists soon began to state as fact," Sobel said. "Within minutes, it was decided: this game was dead on arrival, and creators now had free ragebait content for a month. Every one of our videos on social media got downvoted to hell. Comments sections were flooded with copy/paste meme phrases such as 'Concord 2' and 'Titanfall 3 died for this.' At launch, we received over 14k review bombs from users with less than an hour of playtime. Many didn't even finish the required tutorial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In discussions online about Highguard, [<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Sony's troubled live-service shooter] Concord</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-games-lays-off-dozens-from-2xkos-development-team-less-than-a-month-after-launch"><u>[Riot's recently launched] 2XKO</u></a>, and such, it is often pointed out by gamers that devs like to blame gamers for their failures, and that that’s silly. As if gamers have no power. But they do. A lot of it. I’m not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role. All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering Highguard. And it worked."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a consequence of this, Sobel said many of Highguard's hitherto independent team will "now be forced" to return to the corporate industry "many gamers accused Wildlight of being a part of."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If this pattern continues, all that will be left are corporations, at least in the multiplayer space. Innovation is on life support," he added. "Even if Highguard had a rocky launch, our independent, self-published, dev-led studio full of passionate people just trying to make a fun game, with zero AI, and zero corporate oversight…deserved better than this. We deserved the bare minimum of not having our downfall be gleefully manifested."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sobel finished on wishing the colleagues that remain at Wildlight "the best of luck," and thanked a slew of "incredibly supportive journalists and creators" for their "empathy, intuition, and integrity." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some of the best times of my life were spent with [the techart team]," he concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/when-did-it-become-trendy-to-hate-on-a-new-game-as-highguard-struggles-to-win-over-the-internet-video-game-developers-come-to-its-defense"><u>high-profile video game developers defended Highguard following the online backlash during the game’s launch</u></a>. Developers from the likes of Baldur’s Gate 3 studio Larian, as well as Fortnite maker Epic, have hit out at the discourse surrounding Highguard, and the internet’s capacity to “hate” on video games at launch. Developers like Cliff Bleszinski of Gears of War fame, Epic executive Mark Rein, and Larian boss Swen Vincke spoke up against, in particular, negativity from critics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

		<p>It’s a funny old time isn’t it? After last night’s State of Play, it’s got me thinking about how we find out about all of those lovely games we’re going to be playing. It used to be practically once-yearly, the industry taking over LA for E3, and a blast of information that you’d pore over for months afterwards. Now, though, there’s practically an E3-like wealth of knowledge every week thanks to a Nintendo Direct here, a State of Play there, oh, and of course, Geoff’s TGA trailer extravaganza. As gamers, we’ve never been closer to developers and publishers, learning all the intricacies of a game before it even arrives, and in some ways, that’s good, but, as with everything now, there’s something to be said for a good old surprise. Thankfully, we still get those, and Sony pulled that off with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/god-of-war-trilogy-remake-and-god-of-war-son-of-sparta-out-now/">God of War Son of Sparta</a> last night!</p>

<p>While I’ll be giving that a go later, this week I’ve spent a lot of time hatching eggs. Monster eggs. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-preview-ecology-and-environmentalism-thrive-in-capcoms-latest/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> is already doing a lot of things better than its predecessors, and I think Capcom may have another big hit on their hands at this early stage in the year. Besides that, I played Citadelum on the Switch 2 and enjoyed the magic of Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, while getting involved in Dosas Divas and Earth Must Die too.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> was the first to show her face, but she did so in the kitchen, brandishing a wrench, which was a bit disconcerting. That’s because she’s been reviewing Clue: Murder By Death, which you’ll see a review about shortly. She also cheated the Wolf Spirit bosses in Spirit of the North 2, “by sitting my fox on a wall where the attacks couldn’t hit me. I stayed there all the way through while the wolves huffed and puffed and I occasionally popped down to get a hit in when they got tired. I probably wasn’t supposed to do it that way but it was much less stressful!”</p>
<p>It was the reviews train for <strong>Gamoc</strong>, who played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/romeo-is-a-dead-man-review/">Romeo is a Dead Man</a> and the new Styx stealth ’em up, adding Halls of Torment to the mix. Coming down from the high of reviewing and playing Nioh 3, <strong>Jason</strong> put time into Hordes of Hunger, “which is fine”, and a lot more into Heretical, “which is amazing”. He also made a start on Mewgenics, the new game from the maker of Binding of Isaac, but he’s not sold on either its humour or playstyle.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub’s</strong> gaming this week was all about the gruesome platforming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/reanimal-review/">Reanimal</a>, which he was filled with praise for in his review.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> returned to the 2010s with Red Dead Redemption’s remaster. “I originally played it at launch back in 2010 and it’s fair to say that I didn’t have as much of an appreciation for the story and setting that I do now that I’m (slightly) more mature. Given its age, I was also worried that it would feel a little too dated, especially given how busy open world games are nowadays. However, I’ve been pleasantly surprised at just how much I’m enjoying it. Turning off the auto-aim has certainly helped to make the gunplay more engaging, something that has always felt lacking in Rockstar’s games.”</p>
<p>He’s wrapped up Star Wars Outlaws this week, so <strong>Aran</strong> will be trying to convince you it’s a cosy game in a blog this weekend. He’s since moved on to The Expanse Telltale Series, “which is decent but suffers as a prequel, as none of the events are mentioned again in the show that I can remember.” So he’s also started&nbsp;Like A Dragon Gaiden The Man Who Erased His Name, and is enjoying getting back into the Yakuza world.</p>

<p><strong>Miguel</strong> played Arknight Endfield, which sounds to me like a shonky Batman game knock off, but he’s impressed by it: “A lot of new gacha games feel like they’re just vehicles to get you to spend money, but this one really takes its time just letting you play an interesting game for the sake of playing it. Soooo much Death Stranding style and vibes and even gameplay mechanics in it, too. I’m a fan!”</p>
<p>Having bounced around various genres with Mario Tennis Fever, Under the Island, The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest, and Crisol: Theatre of Idols, <strong>Steve</strong> has embraced the 90s nostalgia of &nbsp;Lost Records: Bloom and Rage, and is passing an eye across Steam Next Fest demos while waiting for Resident Evil Requiem.</p>

<p>And finally, <strong>Tef’s</strong> been getting into High on Life 2, which has much the same tone as the original game, but has evolved its bizarre riffing on the first person shooter genre.</p>

			<p>USA-based independent developer <strong>ProbablyMonsters</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/probablymonsters-interview-ethical-ai-storm-lancers-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we recently interviewed</a> about the launch of <strong>Storm Lancers</strong> on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>) was featured <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the State of Play broadcast</a> with an interesting new game called <strong>Crimson Moon</strong>. It's an action/adventure roleplaying game with optional co-op with another player. The setting is "<strong>Gothic High Renaissance</strong>"; the protagonist is a half-human, half-angel <strong>Nephilim</strong> born of a forbidden union and sworn to protect humanity as a <strong>Knight of the Crimson Moon</strong>.</p>



<p>The game takes place in <strong>Gildenarch</strong>, a once grand metropolis <strong>now overrun by the Infernal Legion</strong> and a corruption known as "<strong>Hellgrowth</strong>". As players reclaim the city district by district, they will uncover the secrets behind the titular Order of the Crimson Moon and the city's fall. The narrative culminates in a high-stakes confrontation with <strong>Solomon Moore</strong>, a sinister vampire lord who engineered Gildenarch's demise.</p>



<p>The gameplay loop is built around <strong>intense, replayable missions</strong> rather than a continuous open world. Players embark on <strong>15 to 45-minute "runs" into the demon-infested street</strong>s, where dynamic maps and evolving enemy compositions ensure that no two incursions feel the same. Combat is described as <strong>fast, visceral, and "Souls-inspired,"</strong> emphasizing mastery and skill expression with parries and finishers. As a Nephilim, <strong>players can wield divine abilities and unleash explosive celestial transformations</strong> to instantly reshape the battlefield.</p>



<p>Between missions, players will return to the <strong>Sanctus Clypeus</strong> (the Church's headquarters), a living hub where they can upgrade persistent stats, craft gear at the Blacksmith, and interact with various non-playable characters (NPCs) before planning their next move at the War Table.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier in the article, Crimson Moon <strong>features optional co-op</strong> that is designed to amplify the game's intensity. Cooperative play <strong>unlocks unique synergies,</strong> allowing players to combine abilities for devastating attacks and revive one another when overwhelmed by the Hellgrowth. The game utilizes <strong>dynamic difficulty scaling</strong> to keep the challenge high regardless of the group size.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The Project Windless team isn't using gen-AI for "content creation or narrative elements", Krafton has confirmed.</p>
<p>Last night, Krafton announced Project Windless, an open-world PlayStation 5 game based on an acclaimed series of South Korean high fantasy novels known as The Bird That Drinks Tears.</p>
<p>Soon after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/open-world-ps5-game-project-windless">trailer debuted at last night's PlayStation State of Play</a>, many began to wonder if generative AI had been used during development. So, I decided to go to the source and find out, and while the Project Windless team has used AI "internally during exploratory phases" for efficiency's sake, it is not "a central, player-facing feature" of the upcoming game.</p>
<p>"Krafton's studios operate with a high degree of creative independence, enabling each team to select the tools and methods that best suit their projects," a Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer. </p>
<p>"For Project Windless, the Montreal team is taking a traditional, craftsmanship-driven approach to single-player development. The team primarily uses AI internally during exploratory phases to support iteration and efficiency rather than as a central, player-facing feature of the game. </p>
<p>"Project Windless uses traditional game AI systems to drive NPC behaviour and bring the world and its characters to life beyond combat. These systems govern how characters react, move, and behave in the environment. We are not using generative AI for content creation or narrative elements."</p>
<p>So, there you have it. </p>

<p>You of course don't need me to tell you how much of a hot topic AI is these days, and many studios have said they use the technology during development. Most prominently in recent months, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">Larian came under fire when founder Swen Vincke suggested the Divinity team was using gen-AI to develop concept art</a>.</p>
<p>Following backlash to this statement, Vincke said "to ensure there is no room for doubt", Larian had decided to "refrain from using gen-AI tools during concept art development" for its upcoming game.</p>
<p>"That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Vincke said in January</a>.</p>

		<p>Sony and Arc System Works have announced that the release date for their upcoming fighting game. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a> will launch on 6th August 2026 for PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>Oh, they also revealed some more characters, too…</p>

<p>That’s right, the Unbreakable X-Men will feature in Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls. This team of mutant heroes has been assembled with Storm as their leader, and the endlessly popular Wolverine. Joining them is the young mutant Magik, who can use both magic and her Soulsword, and the now autonomous AI of the Danger Room, Danger.</p>
<p>The X-Men’s appearance will tie into a new narrative mode that Arc System Works is creating in collaboration with Marvel Games. They’ve adapted the narrative, world and characters specifically for this game, blending together the comics and manga, and collaborating with an as-yet-unnamed writer to do so.</p>

<p>The story will be presented as motion comics, featuring full voice acting across&nbsp;English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Latin American Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest surprises of <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's State of Play broadcast</a> was undoubtedly the announcement of <strong>Project Windless</strong>. An open world action RPG in development at <strong>KRAFTON Montréal</strong>, it is based on the "<strong>The Bird That Drinks Tears</strong>" fantasy universe created by the Korean novelist <strong>Lee Youngdo</strong>, which has been described as "<strong>The Korean Lord of the Rings</strong>".  <strong>Patrik Méthé</strong>, Head of KRAFTON Montréal Studio and Creative Director, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>From the start, we asked ourselves what it really means to play a legendary figure in a fantasy world. For us, that meant giving players real agency, not just in combat, but in how wars unfold, how alliances are formed, and how history is written. Project Windless is built around the idea that legend is not something you observe, it is something you actively create through play.</em></p>



<p>Project Windless is technically <strong>a prequel set 1,500 years before the events narrated in Youngdo's books</strong>, a common choice for game developers whenever they want to draw from lore while maintaining complete creative freedom. The story will focus on the origins of the "<strong>Hero King</strong>," the legendary founder of the <strong>Aragit Kingdom</strong>. The setting features four unique races:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Tokabi:</strong> Tricksters who wield fire and magic, known for laughing in the face of death.</li>



<li><strong>The Humans:</strong> Ambitious and strategic, constantly vying to shift the balance of power.</li>



<li><strong>The Naga:</strong> A cold-blooded and brilliant reptilian race, driven by a ruthless desire for domination.</li>



<li><strong>The Rekkon:</strong> The bird-like playable race. Fierce, nomadic warriors of immense size and speed, driven by a singular "life wish."</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz6NK4164iY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the first developer diary</a>, KRAFTON Montréal, which is working alongside KRAFTON teams based in teams in Pangyo, South Korea, to ensure authenticity, <strong>the combat was described as brutal, visceral, and overwhelming</strong>. In the lore, Rekkon warriors have immense strength, so <strong>players will often face dozens or even hundreds of enemies simultaneously</strong>. To achieve this scale, the team behind Project Windless is using a new "<strong>Mass Entity AI</strong>" technology. This system allows for the simulation of hundreds or thousands of smart, reactive characters. The goal is to transform standard encounters into unpredictable, large-scale conflicts that simulate the feel of a world truly torn by war.</p>



<p>Project Windless is being developed as a <strong>premium single player experience for PC and consoles</strong>. There's no release window in sight.</p>

            <p>A goose with your skillset must be able to honk freely, unconstricted. They must be versatile, capable, adaptable. They must be grounded, stable, constant. I believe you are ready, goose. Honk.</p>
<p>That isn't quite what Keanu Reeves' talkative tailor says in the reveal trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> devs Saber's Untitled John Wick Game, but it's what I heard. The stubbled and suited hitman's latest journey into videogamedom is touted as an uber-faithful putting of Wick's cinematic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/do-you-know-gun-fu">martial arts brawling and gunfighting</a> into your hands, but until Saber prove otherwise, I'm treating it as a spiritual twin to House House's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/untitled-goose-game">Untitled Goose Game</a>.</p>

<p>My argument for doing so isn't exactly nuanced. Both games currently bear similarly formatted monikers and John Wick's got a lot in common with the Goose Game's anarchistic avian. Think about it. John Wick just wants to live a normal life, until he's provoked into unleashing his dark talents on a bunch of people whose days are thoroughly ruined as a result. The goose just wants to live a normal life, until it's provoked by the fact the villagers exist into unleashing its dark talents on a bunch of people whose days are thoroughly ruined as a result.</p><p>John Wick is nicknamed the Baba Yaga, a witch in Slavic folklore who either fries and eats children or helps out the hero of a tale. A golden egg-laying goose is the subject of one of Aesop's Fables. Let's face it, geese would also probably fry and eat human children if given the necessary opposable thumbs and cooking apparatus.</p>
<p>So, ignore the fact Saber have already made clear in this <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/john-wick-game-announced-for-ps5/">PlayStation blog post</a> that they've yet to reveal the Wick game's proper title, with a release date also still to come. This is an Untitled Goose Game spinoff and I won't hear otherwise.</p>
<p>As for what we do know of this game that'll loosely follow in the footsteps of delisted previous John Wick game adaptation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-wick-hex-review">John Wick Hex</a>, Saber say they've worked "closely" with Reeves, Wick director Chad Stahelski and Lionsgate on it. The latter have had a hand in shaping the game's story, which Saber write "addresses a significant time in John Wick’s life, featuring well-known and iconic characters, as well as compelling new characters specifically created for this production". Judging from their <a href="https://x.com/SaberGames/status/2022082792046129464">Twitterings</a>, it looks to be winding back the clock for a bit of stubbled killer origin storying.</p>
<p>Otherwise, all that's been made clear is that this Wick game's very much keen on being as close to a playable action film as it can, with Saber's PR speak describing it as "something that blurs the line between movies and video games, making it something truly special".</p>
<p>Untitled John Wick Game's release dateless for now, but the studio have at least confirmed it'll be coming to PC at some point between now and whenever the apocalypse signals that humanity's goose is cooked.</p>

<p>A new claim reveals that another title is in the works at Santa Monica Studios, alongside the God of War Trilogy Remake, which could be Cory Barlog’s game. </p>



<p>There were many God of War titles rumoured to be in development, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer title</a> and one set in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egyptian mythology</a>. Out of all the rumoured ones, the Trilogy Remake and Sons of Sparta got confirmed yesterday. However, there is one more title players have been curious about: Cory Barlog’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/santa-monica-studios-next-game-is-progressing-well-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next game</a>, for which we seem to have new details. </p>







<h2 id="h-cory-barlog-s-game-could-be-revealed-soon">Cory Barlog’s Game Could Be Revealed Soon</h2>



<p>During a new discussion on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-22#post-151278571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>, shinobi602 replied ‘naw’ when asked “Please&nbsp;shinobi602&nbsp;tell us that the GoW remake is not the Cory Barlog project? The insider then added that the game is “Not that far (barring any delays of course).” He also added that the reveal of this project is expected to be this year, and “given the quarter they’re targeting,” it is likely the reveal could be at the May State of Play or Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but Shinobi doesn’t know that for sure yet. </p>



<p>Shinobi added that if the reveal doesn’t come by then Santa Monica may have either pushed the game’s release, or kept a “shorter reveal to release” window. That’s all we know about the other Santa Monica game at the moment; however, readers should take this information with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>Santa Monica had some huge reveals planned for yesterday’s State of Play event, giving it a picture-perfect finale. They not only confirmed that a God of War Trilogy Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was in development</a>, but also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-dropped</a> the 2D God of War title for players to try out now. </p>
