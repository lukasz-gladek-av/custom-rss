			<p>2025 is shaping up to be the year of Ninja Gaiden. NG2 Black was released in January, the highly anticipated Gaiden 4 is due out in October, and now we have the return to the series’ 2D roots, Ragebound. While the 3D series focuses mainly on extreme difficulty and punishing gameplay, Dotemu have opted for an approach that takes clear influence from the NES games but benefits from much greater fluidity and quality of life improvements. The extreme difficulty is there if you want it, but here it’s an unlockable extra rather than the default.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/II9CmTRac8M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As I laid out in my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/10/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-is-the-perfect-mix-of-nostalgia-and-modern-game-design/">preview of Ragebound</a>, this game takes a departure from the usual protagonist, Ryu Hayabusa, and instead features Kenji Mozu – a redheaded protégé. Chronologically the game takes place during the events of the NES games when Ryu heads to America to follow the will of his dead father. As soon as Ryu sets out his village is attacked by demons and it is up to Kenji to fight them off. Along the way, Kenji finds out the origins of the attack but also has to team up with a member of the notorious Black Spider clan in order to defeat the Demon Lord.</p>


<p>Ragebound looks fantastic, with beautiful pixel graphics and smooth animation throughout. Layers of depth are added through the backgrounds whilst visual effects such as flames and lasers look how I remember 16-bit graphics looked – as opposed to how they actually look when you replay them. Enemies are varied and new forms of demon atrocities are introduced steadily throughout the game from possessed soldiers to eldritch monstrosities. Speaking of monstrosities the bosses are fantastically designed both visually and mechanically with each really challenging you to master the full range of your abilities.</p>
<p>Kenji himself has a small but effective range of skills with his katana being a powerful attack for most foes. Along with simply slashing enemies you can use a guillotine attack to bounce on enemies or obstacles to do damage but more crucially to navigate larger gaps and make more difficult jumps. This works surprisingly similar to the classic pogo attack in Duck Tales which is a NES influence I wasn’t expecting heading into the game. Later in the game you’ll also have access to a ranged attack as well as secondary weapons and powerful magic. To do so, however, requires a pact to be made with a long-time enemy.</p>


<p>A short while into the game, Kenji will track the enemy down to a demonic gate through which the mighty Demon Lord is hoping to emerge. To enable this, the Demons are collecting crystals which power the gate and Kenji must track down and destroy the powerful lieutenants holding each of these. At the same time Kumori, a Spider Clan assassin is sent to forge a deal with the Demon Lord. The two ninjas’ stories collide as each is mortally wounded and so they must link their souls in a magical rite in order to fend off the demon invasion. This narrative twist is neat but also unlocks a range of new abilities for Kenji.</p>
<p>Kumori exists as a spirit within Kenji and can be called upon to offer ranged attacks, the aforementioned secondary weapons which range from axes to umbrella shields, and, perhaps most importantly, powerful magical abilities which can prove the difference in boss battles. The first of these is the titular Ragebound attack and this does high damage to enemies across the screen. You can unlock further abilities through collecting items and successfully completing missions in each level, with new unlocks being blocked by specific ratings in a given level. I opted for a handy healing ability and this saw me through some of the more challenging encounters but a more offensive approach may suit you better.</p>
<p>As well as offering Kenji new abilities, Kumori can be controlled directly whenever Kenji interacts with demonic alters that release her spirit. These areas play out as timed platforming puzzles since Kumori’s energy is constantly depleting. Finding the optimal route through these areas whilst also shooting energy crystals to recover health provides some of the most memorable platforming parts of the game and the final boss requires you to have mastered this aspect to triumph.</p>

<p>Every level has hidden skulls and scarabs – the latter being the currency for buying new equippables from the merchant – as well as set objectives to complete as missions. These range from killing a certain number of a specific enemy to finishing the level without dying. Completing these and collecting all of the hidden items goes towards your ninja rank for each level and there is a great deal of replayability to be found in aiming for the best ranks – some of which can only be obtained through equipping items that offer severe disadvantages such as removing health pickups or even checkpoints entirely. Alternatively, there are accessibility options that enable you to tweak things if certain parts prove too frustrating</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is a perfect entry in the series that makes for a great entry point and a standout experience in its own right. Smooth controls, fantastic level design and some perfectly judged boss battles make for one of the best 2D action-platformers you’ll find. With the extra layer of replaying levels for better ranks and the unlockable hard mode for the bravest ninjas, Ragebound provides plenty of enjoyment and challenge for those who want it, while also being approachable for newcomers.	</p></div>

            <p>Some people don't like cockroaches. I've always found them to be reliable mounts for the tiny gnome army via which I'll one day conquer the world. Anyway, forget I wrote that. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2s-early-access-gets-off-to-a-flying-start-as-obsidian-detail-the-next-year-of-updates">come out this week</a>, and as such folks have fired up their modding machines and got to work tweaking the garden survival extravaganza to their liking.</p>
<p>Let's see here, we've got some of the usual useful changes, texture swaps, and...ah. A mod designed to help folks who're afraid of cockroaches. It'll do just that, provided you're not also terrified of clowns, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-red-soldier-ant-egg-location">bugs</a> vaguely dressed like them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'm starting off with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/20">this roach mod</a>, put together by gallant Arthurian knight/modder Sir_galahad172. They've had a good idea. Save the folks with phobias by arranging the cockroach equivalent of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-arachnophobia-mode-spider-differences">arachnophobia mode</a> the game has to change eight-legged enemies into something less spidery.</p>
<p>Here's the thing, though. At first, I just saw the party hats and painted eyes they've given the roaches and thought oh, ok, they must be going for a Saturday night under the floorboards sort of vibe. Then I clocked the goofy shoes on each spindly limb and the red nose. Putting two and two together, this has to be a roach clown. Is it clowny enough to go off the deep end in the other direction and give nightmares to folks who can't sit through IT? I'm not sure, but you get a mixed review of your valiant attempt at making people un-scared, Sir Galahad.</p>
<p>To cut them some slack, I can throughly appreciate the fact they've swapped the SCAB scanner for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/15">Pip-Boy</a>, in some Xbox brand synergy so synergistic Phil Spencer's probably just had to reach for the tissues. Ditto their spooky, scary skeletonising of the player character.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, they're not the only one at it. There are bunch of tweaks to the likes of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/8">stack size</a> (all the way up to 999 if you want), <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/9">difficulty</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/13">player stats</a> from modder Caites. You can also chuck in a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/14">hasty port of an item spawner</a> for the first game and some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/10">Mod Organiser 2 support</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, aside from the roach clown, it's close to what you'd expect for most big-ish games that've recently debuted on PC. We'll have to see if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> 2 has the insect legs to outdo the fairly titchy total of 144 mods planted in its predecessor's backyard.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-modding-kicks-off-with-cockroaches-dressed-as-clowns-which-is-good-for-bugphobes-so-long-as-they-arent-also-circusphobes]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs won't be totally abandoned after 2025; Nvidia says it will release quarterly security updates for these cards through October 2028. These updates won't optimize performance or fix bugs in any new games, but if you still have an older or hand-me-down PC using one of these cards to play <em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, you won't be leaving yourself open to GPU-related security exploits.</p>
<p>Nvidia has dropped hints that the end of support for these older GPUs was coming. The company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/nvidia-winding-down-support-for-older-gpus-including-the-legendary-750-ti-and-1060/">announced back in January</a> that CUDA support for the Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures was considered "feature complete" and was being frozen. This is the first time since 2021 that Nvidia has dropped support for older GPUs.</p>
<p>As for Windows 10, Microsoft has been pushing users toward Windows 11 for years, including by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-pushes-full-screen-ads-for-copilot-pcs-on-windows-10-users/">using full-screen ads</a> encouraging people to buy new Copilot+ PCs, but the older operating system still has a sizable user base. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/">According to the Steam Hardware Survey</a>, Windows 10 is in decline, but it still powers over a third of the PCs in the survey as of June 2025, compared to a little over 60 percent for Windows 11.</p>

                <p>Persona 3 Reload is officially coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on October 23, 2025, as announced during Thursday's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/" data-ref-id="2900-6828">Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase</a>. This version arrives well after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/persona-3-reload-review-burn-your-dread/1900-6418171/" data-ref-id="1900-6418171">the game's initial release in February 2024</a> across PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, Series X|S, and PC. Preorders will be available later today on the eShop.</p><p>Persona 3 Reload follows a high school student who transfers to Gekkoukan High and discovers a mysterious hidden hour known as the "Dark Hour," which occurs between one day and the next. During this time, the world transforms into a twisted, shadow-infested realm, and only a select few can remain conscious. The protagonist joins SEES (Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad), a group of students who use powerful beings called Personas to battle Shadows and uncover the secrets behind the Dark Hour, Tartarus (a massive tower that appears only during this time), and a looming catastrophe tied to death itself.</p><p>A Switch port had been rumored for a while now, with Atlus initially <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/persona-3-reload-and-metaphor-refantazio-are-coming-to-switch-2-atlus-insider-claims/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">deciding against a Nintendo Switch version</a>. Developers previously admitted that "the idea is there" if the team opted to pursue it, but it was never truly planned for the original hardware, citing "performance concerns."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVcHF5_UtM0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hVcHF5_UtM0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Those same concerns aren't an issue for Switch 2. Persona 3 Reload was built using Unreal Engine 4, which presented some challenges when trying to port to the Switch. Switch 2, with updated hardware specifications such as 4K support, higher CPU/GPU performance, and increased memory bandwidth, seems to be better suited for the game's overall visuals.</p><p>Reload also contains additional scenes not featured in the original game or any of its re-releases, including new party interactions, dialogue, and fully voiced cutscenes. Every Social Link route is now completely voiced as well. Even exploration within Tartarus also features additional dialogue amongst the party, depending on who is taken into the dungeon at the time.</p><p>On its original release last year, Persona 3 Reload <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-3-reload-is-atluss-fastest-selling-game/1100-6520927/" data-ref-id="1100-6520927">became Atlus' fastest-selling game</a>, with a million copies in its first week.</p>

            <p>Krafton has admitted that "talk about legal proceedings" surrounding the company following the delay of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> and changes within the development team could lead people to believe its internal milestone process is being "mismanaged".</p>
<p>However, Krafton's chief financial officer Dongkeun Bae wants to assure this is not the case, and actually somehow this is all a <em>good </em>example of how the company is managing its milestone process.</p>

<p>During an investor<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lghT4WUpgZQ"> Q&amp;A following Krafton's recent earnings report</a>, Bae said:</p>
<p>"For you to think that, regarding Subnautica 2 and looking at that case and thinking that within Krafton our milestone and development pipeline is not being well managed… there is a bit of, I believe, a reasoning leap or gap between those two points. I say that because the actions that we have taken on Subnautica 2 actually represent that things are effectively being managed inside Krafton when it comes to milestone management."</p>
<p>Bae added that because the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> IP has a large following already, he believes that as long as Krafton markets the sequel and then releases it, the game will get good sales regardless of any company politics.</p>
<p>"What we are seeking to do is, we want to make sure that we satisfy the highest level of satisfaction that the gamers have," Bae continued. "Because we have managed the whole milestone process very rigorously within the company, we were able to make the decision that we made regarding Subnautica 2."</p>
<p>The exec said Krafton did not believe Subnautica 2 was "up to par" or the "level" it had wished it to be, so the decision was made to delay the release. "I think that case goes to show that our milestone process is being rigorously managed," he concluded.</p>

</figure>
<p>The story of Subnautica 2 has become quite a saga. Krafton initially delayed the release of Subnautica 2 from this year into 2026 earlier this month. Just prior to this, Krafton - which is the game's publisher - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">ousted key members of the development and leadership team at Unknown Worlds</a>, including Charlie Cleveland, who was game director on the original Subnautica.</p>
<p>Krafton told Eurogamer the decision to delay Subnautica 2's early access release into 2026 was "under discussion" prior to any leadership changes at Unknown Worlds, adding feedback from playtests had "highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release". At this time, Krafton claimed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">delay wasn't to do with a reported bonus for the Subnautica 2 team should they have reached previously determined revenue targets</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after his dismissal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/">Cleveland shared a statement on reddit</a>, where he called recent events "quite a shock". In this same post, he said Subnautica 2 was in fact ready for its early access debut, despite what Krafton had suggested. Cleveland along with his fellow ousted leaders then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">announced legal action against Krafton</a>, after the publisher shared a statement accusing the former employees of 'abandoning' the underwater survival sequel. A few days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-ready-to-take-on-subnauticas-creators-in-court">Krafton said it "look[s] forward to defending itself in court"</a>.</p>
<p>We will keep you abreast of any further developments as and when they happen.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-defends-itself-amidst-subnautica-2-fiasco-says-milestone-process-is-being-rigorously-managed]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.walesinteractive.com/">Wales Interactive</a>, a studio you might recognize for games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/maid-of-sker-hotel-evil/">Maid of Sker</a>, Sker Ritual, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wales-interactive-reveals-fmv-game-i-saw-black-clouds/">I Saw Black Clouds</a>, is ramping up to the launch of its next FMV title, Dead Reset, which it's just revealed is due to launch on <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-reset-release-date-ps5-xbox-nintendo-pc/">September 11, 2025, on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC</a>. Ahead of that launch, I got to check out the first chapter of the game to get a taste of what's to come across the rest of the interactive horror film.</p>



<p>Now, I do want to be clear that I've only played through the first chapter as part of a preview build. The full game is eight chapters long, and across it, players will make more than 280 choices, have the potential to see 340 video sequences, in seven different locations, and uncover four different endings. I've seen only a fraction of what's to come in Dead Reset, but if the rest of the game is anything like what the first chapter introduces, then I fear some horror fans (me, I'm some horror fans) are in for a disappointing time.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cole is being restrained by Slade after just resetting</figcaption></figure>



<p>A fun time, don't get me wrong, and certainly the right kind of horror fan will have no issue with what Dead Reset has to offer, but at least a bit of a disappointing one in my book. </p>



<p>I want to start out by saying I love horror. Whether its video games, films, TV shows, books, comics, whatever, I'm always going to be up for a scary time. I love that horror can run the gamut between being shallow, gore-riddled for the sake of gore, half comedic jump scares and silly plots, to serious, theme and/or character-driven stories that are as deep as they are terrifying. It's the genre that, for my money, has pushed art forward more often than any other genre, where creators are still innovating, and where the biggest swings are taken from a risk perspective.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cole backs up against a desk while hiding from the creature</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dead Reset, at least based on this introduction, is not that kind of innovative, risk-taking horror story. It's a pretty surface-level, hammed-up horror story that mashes time loops with parasitic aliens, as if the concept started with the idea to combine the 1993 film Groundhog Day with 1982's The Thing. It's a creature-feature, which isn't inherently a bad thing; it just seems to lack the kind of depth I've seen in other horror works, which is what makes me excited for every new entry in the genre.</p>



<p>You play as Cole, a surgeon who is stuck in a time loop that resets when he dies, and for the first few times you die, it resets to him on the floor of a facility, before being rudely picked up by a security guard named Slade, and told by a woman named Magason that he must perform surgery on a woman (who we soon learn is named Amanda) and remove a "<em>foreign specimen"</em> from her abdomen. That foreign specimen is the creature, whose name remains unknown for now, and whose design seems to really be leaning into comparisons to The Thing, save for morphing into copycats of the people around it. </p>

				    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>That design is part of what makes Dead Reset feel pretty hammed-up, especially when you see it attack the surrounding characters for the first time. The deaths were comical, with any tension built up to that point shattered by a mound of flesh that is the creature sliding around and jumping at everyone in the room, and watching the actors do their best to hold it to their neck or stomach while pretending to fight back, with a blood-spouting gash left behind that, admittedly, does not look very realistic.</p>



<p>From there, Dead Reset struggled to build up any more tension, especially considering that some of your deaths were entirely scripted, without a choice to be made before you died, either from being shot, getting killed by the creature, or a bit of both. There is a layer of mystery to be discovered, specifically around how exactly the time travel works, what the creature is, and why Magason has the same kind of drive to keep it alive that synthetics working for Weyland have for catching and breeding Xenomorphs.</p>



<p>It took me an hour to get through the first chapter, dying seven times before making it to the end of the chapter on my eighth run. While the performances and the various blood spats were fun to watch in that hour, and the rest of the story's mystery is set up nicely, I couldn't help but feel disappointed for reasons that, ultimately, came down to my own expectations and hopes. I wanted something more than a popcorn horror, and Dead Reset is more of a popcorn horror FMV game. At least that's how it introduces itself anyway.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cooper screams after being splashed with blood. Image credit: Wales Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>I could, of course, be wrong about the final product and how the story will shape up over the other seven chapters included in the full release. This is, after all, just chapter one, and everything could take a deeper, darker turn as we learn more about the creature and how time travel works, why Cole is having his visions, and why his visions seem connected to the creature. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Previews are always an incomplete picture, so we'll see if there's more depth to be found in the next seven chapters, and if not, if Dead Reset is able to appropriately deliver on being an entertaining and popcorn-level horror story.</p>

He said, "This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value."</p><p>For Xbox, Microsoft's cuts included not only layoffs but game cancellations and the closure of at least one studio. See the gallery below to learn more about the extent of the cuts.</p>

                <p>While today's Nintendo Partner Direct wrapped up with a couple of Square Enix reveals, there was one more announcement from the RPG maker that only made an appearance in the Japanese version of the Direct. As detailed on an <a href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/roto-trilogy/dq3/faq/en.html" rel="nofollow ">FAQ page</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-532331">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a> is getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">free Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade</a>, though it doesn't sound like a particularly big one.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the FAQ, the update includes "Graphical improvements which make the game appear sharper and smoother," and "Additional options which allow players to prioritize frame rate or graphics." It also stressed that "No changes have been made to the story or which items can be obtained in the game," so it really does just sound like a case of making the game look a bit prettier and run a bit better on Switch 2. The update is available today.</p>

<p>Coming to Switch 1 &amp; 2 September</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It was only a matter of time until <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pac-man_world_2">Pac-Man World 2</a> got the remake treatment, and today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase confirmed the inevitable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</a> is coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>26th September 2025</strong>. Based on the PS2, Xbox, and Gamecube sequel to the PS1 original — which also got a remake a few years ago — you'll play through 25 levels across six themed "worlds" after Pac-Man's home is invaded by Ghosts, who have stolen the Golden Fruit.</p>
<p>The game will feature two-player co-op, a landing target for your jumps, and missions that will let you unlock costumes for the yellow puck. If you own the Pac-Man World Re-Pac remake, you'll also get a Toc-Man costume!</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there are a bunch of pre-order bonuses too in the form of Team Ghost costumes and statues, and some collaboration DLC.</p>

<p>It's priced at $29.99 / £34.99, and the Switch 2 'physical' version is, predictably, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">a Game-Key Card</a>.</p>

Gaming revenue for the company grew nine percent on the previous year, adding another $2 billion, “driven by growth in Xbox content and services, offset by a decline in Xbox hardware.” Even with falling console sales (down 25 percent), Microsoft saw colossal increases in income from its gaming, in the same year it chose to cancel multiple gaming projects, close down multiple studios, and lay off thousands of employees.</p><p>The document didn’t feel a need to mention all these closures in its celebration of an operating income of $34.3 billion, and instead stated, “We continue to invest in gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators.

            <p>It's been a couple of months now since Nintendo launched its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> console, with its previous Direct stream in April detailing everything we needed to know about the new console.</p>
<p>Today's Nintendo Direct was the first since launch, and as a Partner Showcase it gave us a look at third-party games coming to Switch and Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>So while we didn't see the likes of Mario, Metroid, or Zelda, there were still plenty of exciting game announcements to check out.</p>
<p>Here's everything shown in today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.</p>

<p>The Direct got off to a cracking start with a splitting egg central to the story of Monster Hunter Stories 3. This will be the third in Capcom's RPG spin-off series that first began on 3DS.

As with versions on other consoles, it'll feature a revised UI, improved graphics, new difficulty options, and will be fully-voiced. It's a great opportunity to experience a cult classic of the series, with its more politically-leaning narrative. It's out on 30th September across both Switch consoles.</p>

<p>This new game in the Hyrule Warriors Zelda spin-off series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-is-getting-a-hyrule-warriors-sequel">revealed before the Switch 2's launch</a>, and here we got a fresh look at its gameplay. It will show the canonical events leading up to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (essentially, more of Zelda's storyline) and will have players controlling the Sages as well as the princess herself. It also seems to be hinting at some sort of robotic Link character. There's still no release date, but it's coming to Switch 2 this winter.</p>

<p>This is the latest horror game from Bloober Team, following its Silent Hill 2 remake. It sees players as The Traveller, exploring a desolate Polish city plagued with evil zombie-esque enemies that can merge together into new monstrosities.

<p>A cute looking game with a terrible name, The Adventures of Elliot is a new top-down HD-2D action-RPG from Square Enix. It mixes the visuals of Octopath Traveler with the gameplay of classic Zelda, and even features a main character with a fairy companion. The trailer shows combat with multiple weapon types - swords, bows, chains, and sickles - as well as boss battles and dungeon environments. There's a two-player mode to control Elliot and Faie together, too. It will launch on Switch 2 next year, but there's a demo out today if you want to give it a try.</p>

<p>Speaking of Octopath Traveler, a prequel is on the way to both Switch and Switch 2. It will once again feature HD-2D visuals and turn-based battles, as well as town-building mechanics. Players will start from zero (hence the name) and restore the realm through the eyes of a customisable protagonist. It's coming to both Switch consoles on 4th December this year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Square Enix wasn’t content to reveal just one HD-2D game, and has also announced Octopath Traveler 0, a prequel to the title that originated this art style, which is coming to Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 – Announcement trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klKrQZXDWkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Embark on an adventure of your own creation,” reads the trailer blurb. “Start from zero in a quest of restoration and retribution! Confront powerful villains and rebuild your hometown in OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 – a new entry in the HD-2D series.”</p>
<p>For the first time, you’ll be able to create your protagonist in this series, but will still be gathering a large party of fellows to journey with you.</p>
<p>There’s also a new town-building side to the game, which is glimpsed in just moments from the trailer, which could be really interesting.</p>

<p>We loved the last game in the series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/17/octopath-traveler-2-review/">Octopath Traveler II</a>, with Reuben saying “Octopath Traveler II manages to improve on almost every aspect of its predecessor, whether they needed it or not. The exploration is deeper with more nooks and crannies to nose your way through. The combat is far more intricate, giving greater options to build your party and skillset, and a large degree of player choice. The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and the sound design is phenomenal once again. Honestly, Octopath Traveler II has basically negated the need to play the first title, and I cannot think of higher praise.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Square Enix also revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/the-adventures-of-elliot-is-a-new-hd-2d-adventure-for-switch-2-and-theres-a-demo-out-today/">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, a Switch 2 exclusive branch of the HD-2D visual style, embracing it for an action RPG.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>EA has just announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/apex_legends">Apex Legends</a> will be receiving a Switch 2 upgrade next month, or rather next week, as it drops on August 5th. Hooray!</p>
<p>Yep, as part of today's very good/middling/awful (delete as appropriate) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/watch-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-live">Partner Direct</a>, we learned that the online squad-based shooter, which first launched all the way back in 2019 — when it singlehandedly invented pinging stuff for your mates in-game (maybe) — will hit Switch 2 next Tuesday.</p>
<p>It came to the original Switch in 2021, although it's far from the best place to ply it. The Switch 2 version will boast an enhanced resolution and better performance, according to the trailer, which you can check out above.</p>
<p>Of course, this dickied-up new version will also be released to coincide with the start of the game's 26th season of online murdering. How time flies!</p>

<p>Introducing, Elliot</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase was closed out by a pair of announcements from Square Enix: <strong>Octopath Traveler 0</strong>, and an all-new action RPG called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>.</p>
<p>This is yet another HD-2D joint, which will see you playing as 'Elliot, the Adventurer' (badass name, that), who sets out across the fantasy land of Philabieldia to keep his kingdom safe.</p>
<p>Action seems to really be at the heart of this one, with seven weapon types at Elliot's disposal to take on foes and safely make it through the environment. You can even team up with a pal in co-op mode, and split your combat duties between the titular hero and his fairy companion, Faie.</p>

<p>We still don't have a precise release date for this one just yet outside of the '<strong>2026</strong>' window, though Square Enix did announce that a free demo will be available later today, with a player feedback survey coming shortly after.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this one? Have you also forgotten the title already? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

			<p>IO Interactive and Feral Interactive have <a href="https://feralinteractive.com/en/news/?platform=ios&amp;game=hitmanabsolution">announced</a> that Hitman: Absolution will be making its way to handheld devices, with a mobile version of the 2012 game coming to iOS and Android later this fall, followed by a Nintendo Switch version before the end of 2025. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is also in the works, though that won't arrive until 2026.</p>



<p>Feral Interactive is the same porting house that brought <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-isolation-switch-better-ps4/">Alien: Isolation to the Nintendo Switch</a> with extremely impressive visuals, and the team who brought <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-blood-money-reprisal-is-sneaking-its-way-to-mobile-platforms-this-fall/">Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal</a> to mobile and Nintendo Switch in 2023. This new version of Hitman: Absolution is the studio directly building off its mobile port of Blood Money.</p>



<p>The gameplay trailer that debuted alongside the announcement shows how Feral Interactive is bringing the experience of Absolution onto your mobile devices, with full touchscreen controls, though the studio also clarifies that these versions will also support you plugging in a controller or keyboard and mouse, if you have the time and space for it. </p>

<p>If you're keen to jump into Hitman: Absolution on mobile, then you can pre-order the game today for $14.99 / £9.99 / €12,49. You'll have to wait a little longer for pre-orders to go live on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, however. No specific release date for the mobile versions or the Nintendo Switch versions has been confirmed.</p>

        <p>Great news for Deep Desert Draculas</p>

            <p>The next big patch for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s now out there via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-first-major-patch-has-entered-public-testing-so-you-can-give-some-deep-desert-pve-a-go">Steam testing client</a>, as devs Funcom look to test out its various tweaks before pressing go on full deployment next month. If you've been desperately screaming for the ability to slop out a bunch of blood and/or water at once, or have recently be chased by a swarm of griefy ornithopters, this is the patch for you.</p>
<p>In fact, the devs make clear that they'd really prefer it if you were to dedicate the bulk of your two-week-long patch testing time to those two things in particular. They're also turning off taxes and sandstorms, the latter very much being the tax equivalent of the natural world, for the first week so <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-devs-are-reimbursing-players-for-a-deep-desert-patch-mistake-that-lost-folks-bases-and-gear">bases won't be at risk</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The rundown of the notes for patch 1.1.20, naturally, starts off with these two changes. "Colliding ornithopters will now get an impulse applied to separate them," the devs wrote, "This will mitigate the griefing done to Carrier ornithopters by swarming with multiple ornithopters." So, no more getting crashed into by a gaggle of cheeky spice field seagulls, or pinned down by one until you get wormed, at the cost of not being able to have a friendly head-on wreck when you fancy it.</p>
<p>Funcom are even offering a free top-tier buggy, scout ornithopter, assault ornithopter, and carrier ornithopter to folks who've already been into the game's test client and created a character, so people have no excuse not to see how this tweak works. Instructions to claim them are in the <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/public-test-client-version-1-1-20-0/">full notes here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the devs have finally added the option to deposit all of the blood and water you're carrying into purifiers and cisterns with one button press, something players have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">begging for since launch</a>. You can also take all of the water back out again with one button press, though not the blood, which earns a boo from me.</p>
<p>Among the other tweaks are things like the flour sand and spice sand fields in Hagga Basin being put in the path of sandworm danger, which is bad news for folks who've been taking advantage of the chance to gather those without having to worry about being Shai-Huluded. The worms have also been made slightly deadlier, as running into its body during any of its animations will now result in death or your vehicle going pop.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, the prices of melange spiced beer, spiced wine, spiced liquour, and also napalm are all among those lowered by the patch in an effort to make them more attractive to buy, so there's your next long weekend in the back garden of your base sorted.</p>
<p>As I was writing this, Funcom have ducked their heads around the door to <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/upcoming-change-to-pentashield-only-bases/">announce another change</a> they'll be making with this patch. They're making it illegal to build pentashields without proper support, so if you've erected one in that manner, here's your warning that it'll collapse once patch 1.1.20 goes live in full.</p>
<p>The devs are currently aiming to have that happen on August 12, so make sure you pin a note to your fridge.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-are-testing-a-patch-thatll-let-you-deposit-all-of-your-blood-and-should-help-tackle-ornithopter-griefing]]></content:encoded>
