			<p>After confirming that Assassin's Creed Mirage <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-indeed-getting-new-free-content-later-this-year/">would indeed be getting a DLC update this past August</a>, Ubisoft revealed the full free DLC today, titled Valley of Memory, which is set to arrive on all platforms this coming November 18, 2025.</p>



<p>The free DLC update will add a new region for players to explore called AlUla, a historical setting placed right in the middle of the Incense Road from the Golden Age of the Abbasid Empire. Ubisoft worked with archeologists and historians to ensure it could recreate AlUla as accurately as possible for this new DLC to showcase what this bustling trade-hub would have looked like during the 9th century.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Valley of Memory will feature an entirely new storyline that's part of Basim's coming-of-age journey, with this DLC specifically revolving around his search for his father. Beyond the main arc of this new DLC, there will also be new contracts, side quests, and some highly-requested gameplay changes, namely the ability to replay missions at your leisure. It also adds a new faction of Robbers for Basim to deal with. </p>



<p>Ubisoft has also further expanded the gameplay in Mirage by adding a new tier to tool upgrades, new parkour abilities like being able to jump manually and refinements for the less-populated northern region of AlUla, where Basim will be climbing rocky terrains instead of the ubran areas of Baghdad.</p>



<p>When Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">first released Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, new DLC content wasn't initially part of the plan. This DLC eventually happened partly because of the positive reception Mirage got, though more significantly because of Ubisoft's partnership with Savvy Games Group, the videogames-focused investment company founded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). The same PIF that will be one of the lead investors <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">acquiring EA and making the company go private.</a></p>

<p>In an official reveal today, Ubisoft revealed that the DLC will arrive on November 18. Valley of Memory's new story chapter takes place just before the final story beats of the base game, with Basim looking for answers about his father. Both the base game and the DLC will see a bit of a parkour revamp, the ability to replay base game missions with fresh rewards, and three new difficulties - medium-plus, very hard and custom.</p><p>"When developing a game, we explore countless ideas and iterations for the setting in which the story takes place, the DLC's creative director, Oliver Leonardi, said. "For Mirage, we ultimately chose 9th century Baghdad as the backdrop. But, from the start, we had other locations in mind for Basim's journey." So, Ubisoft say, this DLC's about celebrating the game's second birthday by bringing one of those old ideas to life.</p>
<p>The reveal saw Ubisoft discuss how AlUla's been re-created in the game, with one of the talking heads being <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulrahman-alsuhaibani-299443a6/?originalSubdomain=sa">Dr Abdulrahman A Alsuhaibani</a>, vice president of culture at the Royal Commission for AlUla. <a href="https://www.rcu.gov.sa/en">The Royal Commission for AlUla's website</a>'s 'our aspiration' section notes that their "development work in AlUla encompasses a broad range of initiatives across archaeology, tourism, culture, education, and the arts, reflecting the ambitious commitment to cultivating tourism and leisure in Saudi Arabia, outlined in Vision 2030." That'd be the <a href="https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en">Saudi state's Vision 2030 project</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has declined to offer conclusive answers as to whether the free DLC has been funded by the Saudi government's Public Investment Fund. Since news of the DLC broke, the company has faced criticism and questions over working with the country, both externally and reportedly from staff. According to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-deal-with-saudi-arabia-over-free-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-has-reportedly-seen-staff-pushback">internal Ubisoft Q&amp;A published by Game File's Stephen Totilo last month</a>, Ubisoft workers asked whether Ubisoft execs believed associating with the authoritarian Saudi state could have a negative effect on the company's image earlier this year.</p>
<p>The worker specifically cited the killing of journalist <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">Jamal Khashoggi</a> in their question, which was allegedly carried out at the order of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman. Khashoggi's murder aside, Saudi Arabia have an abysmal human rights record, including state-sanctioned homophobia and mass killings of migrants at the country's border with Yemen. The state has been accused of using investments in industries like games and sports to attempt to 'wash' this reputation, rendering itself more palatable in foreign eyes.</p><p>In that internal Q&amp;A, Ubisoft, who have asserted that they've retained creative control over the DLC, attempted to make a distinction between the Saudi government's Public Investment Fund and bin Salman - who is also <a href="https://www.pif.gov.sa/en/who-we-are/">the Public Investment Fund's chairman</a>. "The [PIF]'s money is not MBS's, and talking with partners who do not share our democratic values does not mean abandoning them," the company's management said at the time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>OpenAI launched its new generative AI video tool, called Sora 2, last week, alongside a TikTok-like social media platform where invite-only users could share <a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-sora-2-videos-pokemon-spongebob-dragon-ball-2000631137">all of their favorite copyright-infringing nightmare fuel</a>. There was Mario racing from the cops and Goku fighting the hero from <em>One-Punch Man</em>. But the 9-second clip I can’t get out of my head is an AI-generated <a href="https://x.com/SHL0MS/status/1973959800754217190">Sam Altman barbequing Pikachu</a> before munching on a slice of the beloved Pokémon mascot like it’s seared tuna.</p> <p>Nintendo and other companies have yet to comment on OpenAI’s latest legal minefield, but Altman is already backpedaling on Sora 2’s initial free-wheeling, anything-goes, copyright-holders-be-damned spirit. The company recently announced a change to how the tool is structured so that companies have to “opt in” for users to get Sora 2 to generate videos using that company’s IP, where previously they had to “opt out” for it <em>not </em>to do so. OpenAI will also be setting up some sort of payment system to give companies a fraction of the revenue generated from their IP-adjacent slop.</p>

We assume different people will try very different approaches and will figure out what works for them. But we want to apply the same standard towards everyone, and let rightsholders decide how to proceed (our aim of course is to make it so compelling that many people want to). There may be some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t, and getting our stack to work well will take some iteration.</p></blockquote> <p>He also specified that Sora 2 users were producing a disproportionate amount of meme clips using anime and video game characters. “In particular, we’d like to acknowledge the remarkable creative output of Japan—we are struck by how deep the connection between users and Japanese content is!”</p>

Disney, Warner Bros. and other major media companies are already suing competitor Midjourney over the ease with which its users can generate rip-offs of <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>The Avengers</em>, and<em> Batman</em>. Meanwhile, publishers like<em> IGN </em>owner Ziff Davis and <em>The New York Times</em> are suing OpenAI <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/14/nx-s1-5258952/new-york-times-openai-microsoft">over unauthorized copying</a> of their online archives to train its algorithms.</p>

 <h2>What is Nintendo saying about generative AI?</h2> <p>So far, however, most video game companies have have yet to cut deals with OpenAI or accuse it of theft. The notoriously litigious Nintendo recently called a report from a Japanese politician stating that it was lobbying for AI protections untrue. “Contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI,” the Switch 2 maker <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220">announced over the weekend</a>. “Whether generative AI is involved or not, we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights.”</p>

 <p>While companies have stayed silent about how they’re dealing with potential infringement concerns, most are happy to advertise their ambitions to use new generative AI tools to try and streamline production. <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/over-50-of-japanese-game-companies-use-ai-in-development-according-to-tokyo-game-show-organizer/">According to a recent survey</a>, roughly half of Japanese game studios are already using some form of AI in game development. Microsoft, an early backer of OpenAI, is one of the technology’s loudest proponents, though the results so far have been meager at best. When it comes to gaming in particular, the tech giant has rolled out <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ai-copilot-minecraft-overwatch-insider-microsoft-1851769746">AI chatbots</a> for game help, and is experimenting with quick prototyping of gameplay.</p> <p>“You could imagine a world where, from gameplay data and video, that a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run,”&nbsp; Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said earlier this year. Who knows if that will ever actually happen? For now we have fake footage of <a href="https://x.com/fofrAI/status/1973152115259482575">Master Chief in <em>Mario Kart 8</em></a> instead.</p>

Among the customers and shelves of old films, there is someone who sees a side of Anton that few others do: a woman who works in the store and notices the gentler side of him, the part he rarely shows to the world. Hang out in your apartment, manage the store, and experience the life of a man trying to maintain balance in a city that doesn’t forgive weakness.</p><p>But when the shutters roll down and the streets go quiet, Anton heads to the basement, a private space where there’s more than movies to rent.

        <p>Anton thinks he’s the protagonist in his story, but someone is always watching, directing from the shadows. In <em>BLACKWOOD</em>, style and brutality intertwine, and the story bends to both choice and consequence, where every fight is a reckoning, and every decision matters.</p><p><em>BLACKWOOD</em> blends tight, close-quarters combat with slow-burn storytelling. From the basement of a quiet Brooklyn DVD store to the neon-lit streets of 2012 New York’s underworld, every encounter is choreographed, every fight feels cinematic, and every choice has consequences. The quiet moments with the woman in the store remind Anton, and the player, that even in a world of darkness, glimpses of his humanity endure.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_998351"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fight Your Way Through the City</strong> – Gunplay is fast, stylish, and unforgiving — with fluid movement options like dives, rolls, and slides to keep the action relentless.

		<p>Haven’t had one of these for a while, the ESRB (Entertainment Software Ratings Board) are usually on the ball when it comes to what they post and when, but something has slipped through, namely Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/aliens-fireteam-elite/">Aliens: Fireteam Elite</a> 2 has not been announced, there has been nothing from the publishers but perhaps that is because, according to the ESRB, Daybreak Games are publishing the game and not Focus Interactive.&nbsp; Daybreak are more famous for its MMORPGs such as DC Universe Online, Everquest, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online,&nbsp; a multiplayer shooter is somewhat of a departure for them. Cold Iron Studios developed the first title – more on them later.</p>


<p>Last year, a design document for the game,&nbsp; codenamed Project Macondo, leaked, and it said, “unlike Aliens Fireteam Elite, Project Macondo will feature fixed preset character archetypes and non-customisable characters.” It also stated that a new horde mode called Annihilation would be part of the game. It also suggested the game would be out near the end of 2025.</p>
<p>We can now add that information to a<a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/daybreak-advances-cold-iron-partnership-with-additional-investment-of-approximately-6-5-usd-million-ahead-of-2025-release/"> press release for investors made by Cold Iron Studios in February,</a> in which they stated, “Daybreak is working closely with Cold Iron and on track to bring its new game to market later this year.” It appears that Cold Iron are developing the sequel it’s just the publisher that has changed.</p>
<p>According to the ESRB, Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2 will launch on Windows PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>We gave the original game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/03/aliens-fireteam-elite-review/">7/10 in our review,</a> “Aliens: Fireteam Elite has a lack of mission variety, technical issues, bad matchmaking, and a repetitive structure. All of that said, it’s still a fun time. I’m off to play some more right now,” said Nic.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/broken-sword-smoking-mirror-reforged</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/broken-sword-the-smoking-mirror-reforged-revealed-for-early-2026.1317703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary point-and-click developer Revolution Software has announced&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged</em>, a remastered version of the second game in the&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword&nbsp;</em>series, and it's due to arrive early next year.</p>

<p>Per a press release, <i>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</i>"celebrates the series' enduring legacy while introducing enhancements for modern players". CEO and founder Charles Cecil says the remastered version will "respect the original while making it shine for modern audiences".</p>

<p>It sounds as though the new remaster will work in a similar way to last year's&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</em>, coming complete with new visual enhancements, audio improvements, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/broken-sword-the-smoking-mirror-reforged-beach.jpg?itok=yg8s4qC3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/broken-sword-the-smoking-mirror-reforged-beach.jpg?itok=VJRNpiHn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</em>remasters a point-and-click classic next year.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Revolution Software, the new version will feature "beautiful high definition" visuals, as well as "crisp audio", but if you love the original, you'll still be able to switch between the new and old styles at any time.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you're the kind of person who gets frustrated at point-and-click adventure puzzles (for which I will throw absolutely no shade your way whatsoever), then you can play with the new "story mode" in order to get "subtle hints".</p>

<p>Once this one's been released, it will be intriguing to see whether Revolution Software decides to revisit its adventures into three dimensions with remasters of 2003's&nbsp;<em>The Sleeping Dragon&nbsp;</em>and 2006's&nbsp;<em>The Angel of Death</em>. Arguably, they're the ones most in need of remastering.</p>

<p>For now, though, you can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</em>right here. It'll show off the new art style and give you a sense of what you can expect if you pick the game up.</p>




<p>Let's also hope that this remaster is successful enough to prompt a potential new entry in the series, a la 2020's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/beyond-steel-sky" rel="nofollow"><em>Beyond a Steel Sky</em></a>.</p>

<p>For now, though,&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch early next year. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shut-down-funcom</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-hellsinger-developer-the-outsiders-shut-down-by-parent-company-funcom.1317700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>developer The Outsiders has been closed down by its parent company Funcom, according to studio founder David Goldfarb, but he says he's determined to press on regardless.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/locust9.bsky.social/post/3m2jumlqlmc2m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky post</a>, Goldfarb confirms The Outsiders' closure after ten years of operation. The studio's shutdown is part of a wider spate of layoffs at Funcom, which the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced recently</a> (despite latest release&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>being Funcom's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">most successful game</a> to date).</p>

<p>Goldfarb says he and his studio "survived a near-death studio experience years back when&nbsp;<em>Darkborn&nbsp;</em>was canceled", referring to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embrace-your-inner-monster-in-darkborn" rel="nofollow">a project</a> that was first revealed back in 2015 before being <a href="https://x.com/outsidersgames/status/1255834216815890434" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">canned in April 2020</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shutdown-shooting.jpg?itok=_3dTMF_o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shutdown-shooting.jpg?itok=zFSmQ3n5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Outsiders' latest (and last) game is 2022's&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Goldfarb says he and his team were hoping to "do something even better" than&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>this time, "things don't always go the way you hope", and The Outsiders has instead been closed down.</p>

<p>However, Goldfarb says this might not be the end for him and his team. He says they're "not giving up", and that they "are going to try to continue on in some new form", asking followers to help out with "business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is".</p>

<p>Funcom originally purchased The Outsiders back in 2021, just a few months before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funcom-acquires-conan-ip-holder" rel="nofollow">acquiring the rights</a> to the&nbsp;<em>Conan&nbsp;</em>IP and the holding group that originally held those rights (along with the rights to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Solomon Kane&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mutant-year-zero-road-to-eden" rel="nofollow"><em>Mutant Year Zero</em></a>, the latter of which uses the Swedish <em>Mutant&nbsp;</em>RPG's setting).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, The Outsiders is far from the only studio to be closed down by its parent in recent months. Others include Xbox subsidiary and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative</a>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">NetEase-backed outfit T-Minus Zero</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echtra-games-shut-down-torchlight-3" rel="nofollow">Echtra Games</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/torchlight-3-echtra-games-closure.jpg?itok=1HbqPY62 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/torchlight-3-echtra-games-closure.jpg?itok=jNgJ5trY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Outsiders joins the likes of&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3&nbsp;</em>studio Echtra Games in being closed down by a bigger parent recently.</figcaption></figure><p>Let's hope that The Outsiders and Goldfarb manage to find a way to continue on beyond the whims of Funcom. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/metal-hellsinger-review" rel="nofollow">re-read our&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>review</a> to find out just how much we thought the studio's rhythm FPS rocked.</p>

            <p>
When Microsoft lit the rocket booster under Game Pass pricing last week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-reveal-massive-game-pass-ultimate-and-pc-pass-price-hike-concede-that-price-hikes-are-never-fun">raising the cost of the Ultimate tier in the US by 50%</a>, they neglected to tell you that they'd also scrapped a 10% discount on DLC for Game Pass games, previously available to Ultimate subscribers. Now, when Ultimate subscribers buy DLC, they'll earn extra Microsoft Reward points, which can be traded for things like gift cards. Rather than saving you money, in other words, they're incentivising you to spend more of your cash inside Microsoft's business.
</p>
<p>
"This is not specific to any one game and reflects all games and DLC purchases," a Microsoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-it-scrapped-the-xbox-game-pass-discount-on-all-games-and-dlc-purchases-gives-subscribers-more-rewards-points-instead">Ian Games</a> in a statement. "Instead of a discount on the purchases, Ultimate and Premium subscribers will earn 10% and 5% - respectively - in points when purchasing select games and add-ons from the Game Pass library. Ultimate members continue to have 20% discount on select games from the Game Pass library. On top of that, all Rewards members will earn points when shopping games and add-ons on the Store, while Premium and Ultimate subscribers will earn even more, 2x and 4x respectively."
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's Game Pass price hikes have attracted some spicy headlines, and a lot of wrathful posting on the socials. I'm sure they're as shocked by the negative reaction as you are. Meanwhile, former US Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan has observed (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-a-result-of-microsoft-becoming-too-big-to-care-says-former-ftc-chair">Eurogamer</a>) that these kinds of service "upgrades" are precisely why the FTC took the corporation to court over their acquisition of Activision-Blizzard. 
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://x.com/linamkhan/status/1974192096841265511">a Xitter post</a>, Khan remarked that the acquisition "has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers. As we've seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand. As dominant firms become too-big-to-care, they can make things worse for their customers without having to worry about the consequences." The FTC made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ftc-accuses-microsoft-of-breaking-promise-not-to-raise-game-pass-prices-after-activision-blizzard-acquisition">much the same arguments</a> last year, when Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pc-and-xbox-game-pass-are-getting-a-worldwide-price-hike">a smaller price hike</a>.</p><p>Game Pass has made billions for Microsoft, but evidently, the bosses think it could be working harder for them, not least because it might be significantly cannibalising direct sales of Microsoft-published games. Given the timing, it’s possible the price hikes are designed to offset lost direct sales of Call of Duty games – Black Ops 7 launches on November 14th.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-03/xbox-s-game-pass-hike-shows-cost-of-lost-call-of-duty-sales">Bloomberg</a> (paywall) quoted an unnamed former Microsoft employee as saying that putting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 6 on Game Pass resulted in an internal estimated loss of $300 million in sales revenue across both console and PC. In their coverage of Bloomberg's story, <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-on-game-pass-cost-microsoft-300-million-in-lost-sales-2000631659">Kotaku</a> calculate that Microsoft would need around 15 million players to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate for one month to make that up. Bloomberg also report that Microsoft CFO Amy Hood has “asked Xbox to find other ways to increase profit” – they’re allegedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-streaming-free-ad-supported-report-price-increase-2000631520">testing an advertising-supported version of the Xbox game streaming service</a>.

</p><p>
Microsoft are making headlines for many reasons, right now - they're still the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">a boycott over their Israeli military connections</a>, and they're about to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-a-third-of-all-gaming-pcs-are-still-running-windows-10-even-as-microsoft-prepare-to-kill-it">pull the plug on Windows 10</a>.

		<p><em>Fortnite</em> really does come for everyone eventually, huh? At least, that's what I learned when my nine-year-old scrolled through a video promoting <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> coming to <em>Fortnite</em>, at which point she asked a fated question: "What's <em>Fortnite</em>?" Fast forward: most of the weekend was spent tell me she'd played enough and needed to find something else to do. (I'll probably be writing about this a fair bit on <a href="https://www.crossplay.news/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>Crossplay</em></a> in the future lol). Also, while it was nice to have a weekend where the Chicago Bears didn't stress me out, it just became a weekend where the Chicago Cubs did more than stress me out: they smothered my hope.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This summer, Nintendo raised the prices of it’s previous generation Nintendo Switch consoles following President Donald Trump’s announcement to impose new tariffs on a range of countries. The base model Nintendo Switch, which originally launched at $300, is now sold for $340 new. You can, however, find the Nintendo Switch for much less than even the starting price. Buying refurbished hardware is a great way to save some money while refreshing what you play or work with. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4528/">Amazon has a renewed Nintendo Switch on sale for $227</a>. That’s 24% less than the original value it sold for from 2017 to the beginning half of this year and 33% less than it’s new selling price for 2025.</p>
<p>It may seem like a weird time to dip into this eight year old gaming console. This summer, the next generation of Nintendo consoles launched with the Switch 2 after all. However, if you missed out on this chapter from the Japanese game and hardware developer, there is a treasure trove of amazing games just waiting for you to experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4528/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Library of Hit After Hit</h2>
<p><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is a wonderful little life sim that many Nintendo fans and even folks who wouldn’t normally describe themselves as gamers found solace in during the 2020 lockdown. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and its sequel <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>&nbsp;can provide hundreds of hours of discovery, adventure, a problem-solving for any eager player looking to get lost in a beautiful open world.</p>
<p>Beyond just the first party stuff, the Nintendo Switch has countless indie titles for you to sink your teeth into. Games like <em>Celeste</em> and&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em> are routed in the side-scrolling platformers and JRPGs of the Super Nintendo era. The Switch is still receiving new titles as well. Two of the best indie games in the console’s history are Supergiant Games’&nbsp;action roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hades</em> along with Team Cherry’s grueling Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>. Both titles received sequels this past month —&nbsp;<em>Hades II </em>and <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>—&nbsp;which are available for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4528/">As a renewed gaming console, the Nintendo Switch you receive after ordering is confirmed to have been professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned by Amazon-qualified suppliers</a>. Your console is guaranteed to have no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at arm’s length and is even eligible for replacement or refund within the first 90 days of receipt if you aren’t satisfied with the purchase.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/10/05/nintendo-is-requesting-4500000-in-damages-from-a-switch-piracy-reddit-mod/"><em>My Nintendo News</em></a>, Nintendo is continuing to pursue its <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-reddit-switchpirates-court-filing-1851710042">attempts to take down members of a Switch piracy Reddit</a>, and more specifically the sub’s moderator, James Williams, known as Archbox. As with most of Nintendo’s court targets, he was seemingly given an opportunity to walk away and chose not to take it. As <em>Kotaku</em> mentioned in July 2024, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-piracy-hacked-roms-emulator-1851572451">Nintendo had sent Archbox cease-and-desist letters which the company alleges he chose to ignore</a>. As a result of that, court filings were made and it seems Archbox ignored those too. Now the company is demanding $4,500,000 in a default ruling.</p> <p>Nintendo’s ongoing pursuit of all involved in potential piracy of their consoles and games would be proving quite the revenue stream for the company, if it ever demanded the millions of dollars from people who could actually pay. After <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-lawsuit-modding-switch-2-ryan-daly-2000623984">successfully suing Modded Hardware’s Ryan Daly last month for $2 million</a> that he’ll never be able to give them, bringing about <a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-10-million-in-hacking-la-1848172917">the eternal ruination of Gary Bowser in 2021</a> who will owe Nintendo $10 million for the rest of his life, and the company’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-piracy-lawsuit-mario-luigi-zelda-echoes-1851693898">attempts to get $7.5 million from Jess Keighin</a> last year, the Japanese behemoth is now going after Reddit moderator James “Archbox” Williams and asking for $4.5 million he won’t have. The idea, presumably, is to send shockwaves through piracy communities, given almost everyone who is targeted wouldn’t be able to pay for even Nintendo’s legal fees, let alone any money awarded.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, sticking your fingers in your ears and hoping it will go away rarely proves to be an effective legal response, especially if you’ve no anonymity and evidence very convincingly suggests you committed the crimes. As OatmealDome stated on BlueSky, Nintendo is coming after James Williams for $4,500,000 in damages by “default judgment.”</p>   <h2>The Lost Cause</h2> <p>(Just for the sake of my colleagues, let me state right here that this article is&nbsp;<em>my</em> opinion, and not necessarily that of others at <em>Kotaku</em>. God knows, we disagree on a lot.)</p>

 <p>As is always the case in all of these proceedings, aside from the simple fact that illegally downloading something is…illegal, the idea that piracy costs a company significant losses is always stated as fact but is never asked to be proven or evidenced. Courts frequently take it on face value that any downloaded ROM must automatically represent a lost sale; something that’s never been demonstrated and <a href="https://draginol.joeuser.com/article/303512/Piracy_PC_Gaming">is clearly very spurious</a>, no matter how widely believed it may be. Ever since the days of Napster, corporations have been using “one download = one lost sale” to work out their claimed losses, which led to the gruesome spate of rulings in the early 2000s in which individuals were being bankrupted with ludicrous damages because their kids (who obviously wouldn’t have been able to afford to buy the music if they’d not pirated it, thus representing no lost sales at all) downloaded a bunch of mp3s. Nintendo continues with the same thinking <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.25.0.pdf">in its latest court filing</a>, stating,</p>

 <blockquote><p>“NOA has suffered damages as a result of these breaches, including but not limited to decreased profits and a loss of profits related to reproduction and distribution of the Nintendo Switch games and related to users whose accounts NOA has terminated for violation of the EULA.”</p></blockquote> <p>(I really do love the argument that Nintendo is suffering losses because it terminates people’s accounts.) It also goes on to claim that these losses are directly affecting employed individuals.</p> <blockquote><p>“These activities have substantially damaged NOA’s overall business and intellectual property rights, as well as the business and intellectual property rights of NOA’s development and publishing partners, and further has caused harm to the many artists, game designers, programmers and others whose livelihoods depend upon the sale of authorized Nintendo products.”</p></blockquote> <p>I find it quite extraordinary to declare that there has been harm to the livelihoods of specific employees without providing any evidence at all, instead relying on people’s feeling that piracy surely must cost a company money. It really behooves Nintendo to demonstrate any example of one of its own employed artists, designers, or programmers as having had their livelihoods affected, but it doesn’t attempt to and certainly never will. Claims like this are commonplace and pernicious, and I believe it’s crucial to at the very least ask for proof when they’re made. (It’s especially unpleasant at a time when we’re seeing companies reporting massive profits while sacking thousands of staff, making a mockery of the entire concept.)</p>

 <p>And please let me make clear: if you’re shouting at your screen, “<em>Of course game piracy causes significant losses and harms!</em>” all I am asking for is your evidence. Please demonstrate it, so I can agree with you. Of course it costs them <em>some</em> sales, it’s certainly not nothing, but nothing close to the ruinous amounts being claimed.</p>

 <h2>Expensive Speech</h2> <p>The case is unusual in that Williams is not only being sued for his making some manner of profit from allegedly charging for “pro” services, but primarily for “promoting” the piracy, directing Reddit users to his pages where Nintendo ROMs can be downloaded. This area of <em>encouraging</em> piracy is far more tricky in court, although historically that hasn’t been something judges have been particularly troubled by. The Nintendo filing repeatedly refers to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/case-summary-mgm-studios-vs-grokster-1410184/">2007’s Supreme Court ruling in the MGM versus Grokster case</a>, although that left a lot of ambiguity, and became overly focused on the technology rather than the principle. However, exploiting these issues would require Williams to be able to both afford a legal defense that could stand up to that of Nintendo’s, and—well—for him to acknowledge the situation at all.</p>

 <p>Nintendo usually reserves its ire for those who are actively profiting from piracy, charging for services or access to ROMs through so-called “Pirate Shops,” at which point the criminality is far more clear. That’s really not so much the case in this latest situation where the filing instead breaks down how Williams has promoted free Pirate Shops and given people information on how to circumvent the Switch’s anti-piracy measures. It does go on to allege that Archbox created “pro” versions of these offerings, exchanging access for “donations” of eShop cards, which far more immediately suggests tangible criminality, but this isn’t the emphasis.</p> <p>The filing, however, does lay out some extensive detective work, explaining why Nintendo believes Archbox has been involved at every stage of the piracy process, from being a member of the ROM dumping team to distributing circumvention software, then the creation of the distribution sites all the way to providing instructions for how to use them on Reddit and Discord. Again, Nintendo’s lawyers lay out how the “donation” schemes applied throughout, which potentially means the court won’t have to consider all the other claims and how they relate to free speech, or will more likely just handwave them through, given there’s evidence of profit.</p> <p>This is all made more damning for Archbox given his own responses, or lack thereof. Nintendo’s filing claims he initially “acknowledged his conduct violated NOA’s rights and stated he would work with NOA to satisfy its demands,” but that he denied involvement with the “Shops,” and then when Nintendo requested confirmation in writing that he’d comply with its demands, “he became combative and uncooperative.” Archbox rather pointlessly deleted his GitHub and took a few of the sites offline, but Nintendo says he left LiberaShop running throughout. Nintendo says that on May 17, 2024, it gave him “a final opportunity to comply with its demands prior to litigation,” and Williams responded saying an attorney would contact them. This never happened, and later, after some rather limited communication with a lawyer stating he represented Williams in early 2025, this, too, fell apart.</p>

 <h2>Damaging Figures</h2> <p>The rest of the filing goes on to argue for a default ruling, lists all of its allegations against Williams while making many more spurious claims about lost sales, then cites copyright and EULA violations, before finally reaching its rather loose justification for the $4.5 million figure: because someone did the same for Bungie. The figure itself just appears to have been plucked from the air, given the document states,</p> <blockquote><p>“Here, the amount of money sufficient to remedy NOA’s injury would be extremely difficult to quantify; but it is indisputable that such amount would be large. Therefore, the money at stake by this Motion is nowhere near an amount that would compensate NOA for the seriousness of Defendants’ conduct.”</p></blockquote> <p>For all the back-and-forth, there’s obviously no doubt that distributing ROMs and circumventing piracy measures is viewed as criminal. While there are unquestionably arguments to be made about the nature of the related rulings, it would require massive financial backing to successfully argue any of this in courts, and not within the purview of Nintendo’s targets. Meanwhile, it’s essential to take on board that Nintendo does appear to give these people the chance to agree to cease and desist, although the exact terms are unclear, and only resorts to litigation after that’s refused.</p>

 <h2>No Mercy</h2> <p>For me, the larger issue is the nature of the punishments, which seem to defy any notion of mercy. From my scant understanding of the situation, James “Archbox” Williams seems like a fool, an allegedly leading figure in an action known to be against the law who was given a chance to get out of this situation and refused to take it. However, no matter the individual, a way to make amends is an essential part of a judicial system. Criminals are supposed to be able to “pay their debt to society,” and rehabilitation should be central to consequences. Financial debt of the magnitude Nintendo demands from individuals is obviously impossible to ever pay back, and means a permanent, life-long punishment for a crime that—given the nature of offenses for which people are routinely sentenced to years in prison, or the meaningless financial penalties given to vast corporations for their deadly negligence—is relatively minor.</p> <p>Famously, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gary-bowser-hacking-case-legal-jail-xecuter-1850346297">Gary Bowser will have to give between 25 and 30 percent of his income to Nintendo for the rest of his life</a>, and given that his time spent in prison makes it far harder for him to get well-compensated employment, this will likely leave him in dire straits until he dies. There’s no opportunity for reform here, no way to “pay his debt” either literally or metaphorically, and the same is true for every other individual pursued in this way.</p> <p>But so long as courts allow “one download = one lost sale” to continue to be accepted without asking for any evidence at all, and let through claims that employees’ livelihoods are harmed without demanding a single example, Nintendo will continue to chase such outrageous financial penalties in its furious (and ultimately futile) pursuits. “If you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime” might be a popular (if ignorant) refrain, but when the crime is copying video games, and the time is eternity, perhaps something is dreadfully amiss.</p>

Further, fewer than 1% of people who attempted to cheat actually got into a match. Those who did were booted "within minutes."</p>

<p>"Cheaters were expected. But our upgraded systems caught them faster than ever, powered by strengthened TPM 2.0 checks and automated systems helping to eliminate a large number of attempts to cheat," Activision's anti-cheat team, Ricochet, said. "Those who did manage to slip through didn't last long. Most never made it into a match."</p><p>People may have seen clips online of people cheating in the Black Ops 7 beta, and that maybe made you think the beta was overrun with cheaters. However, Activision said, "We had already actioned on most of those accounts before they hit social media."</p><p>"We're watching closely, acting in real time, and learning from every attempt. And this is just the beginning. When launch arrives, every layer of protection will be in full force, and Ricochet anti-cheat's defenses will only grow stronger," the developer said.</p><p>Activision added that its anti-cheat efforts have included disabling the cheats provided by cheat-makers and shutting down their businesses altogether. "We have now directly contributed to the closure of over 40 cheat developers and resellers since Black Ops 6 launched. Vendors sharing clips during beta were already on our radar and we will pursue them beyond in-game enforcement," Activision said.</p><p>Also in its post, Activision admitted that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-enable-tpm-2-0-so-that-your-pc-is-ready-for-windows-11/1100-6496686/" data-ref-id="1100-6496686">TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot requirements for Black Ops 7's beta</a> can feel "disruptive," but it's necessary to "help ensure a secure, fair experience for every player, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation as we strengthen PC protections."</p><p>The Black Ops 7 beta is now free and open to everyone following the early-access period. Additionally, Activision has added something fans had been asking for: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-adds-non-sbmm-playlist-opens-for-everyone/1100-6535236/" data-ref-id="1100-6535236">a non-SBMM playlist.</a></p><p>For more, check out these stories:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-all-guns/2900-7063/" data-ref-id="2900-7063">All Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Guns, Weapons, And Perks Available At Launch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-all-maps/2900-7062/" data-ref-id="2900-7062">All Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Maps Available At Launch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-all-modes/2900-7059/" data-ref-id="2900-7059">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 - All The Multiplayer Modes For Beta And Launch</a></li></ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f%E2%80%99s-best-puzzle-is-a-masterclass-in-anticipation.1317655/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A thick and terrible fog has fallen over <em>Silent Hill f</em>’s rural town of Ebisugaoka, trapping high school student Shimizu Hinako and her friend Shu in monster-filled streets. The current plan? Head across town to their friend Rinko’s house. As they cross the town’s rice field, the fog grows even thicker. Strange mask-adorned scarecrows dot the field. Some are monsters in disguise, and if Hinako is going to clear the fog, she’ll need to take a closer look.</p><p><strong><em>Some spoilers for </em>Silent Hill f<em> follow.</em></strong></p><p>This is the frame for <em>Silent Hill f</em>’s finest puzzle. Locked in the rice fields, the only way to proceed is for players to identify certain scarecrows in the field—using hints provided by a “friendly” scarecrow nearby—and remove thorns from their bodies. If the correct scarecrow is chosen, you can proceed to the next group. If not, the one you chose will spring to life and attack you.</p><p>Your first clue is as follows: "Can you even imagine how I feel? I'll put on my polite smile for now." The solution is to find the only scarecrow with a smile out of the group. Walk up to it, examine the body for the location of the thorn and pull it. You’ll be able to go on to the next set of scarecrows and the next clue. You might need to look for a scarecrow that is “betrayed” and has a knife in its back. You might need to find another averting their eyes from one of its peers. All the while there are sounds in fog and, although it is rare, you might stumble upon enemies.</p><p>I first saw this segment of the game while watching a friend play (I’m not someone who really cares about spoilers), and throughout the experience, they often swung their camera around and wondered if some of the scarecrows were shifting position. The answer is both yes and no: Many of the scarecrows here will not come to life unless you choose an incorrect solution to the puzzle, but there are some enemies who can approach when you’re not looking. Yet for all the sense of danger, the threat is relatively limited. It’s mostly the player themselves filling in the blanks. Did that one there just turn their head to look at me?</p><p>I’d venture a guess that many players coming to <em>Silent Hill f</em>, perhaps even a majority, are folks who have some familiarity with the series and genre.These are players confident in their ability to anticipate whatever scare the funhouse has prepared for them. <em>Silent Hill f</em> plays with this impulse: There are enough “living” scarecrows to keep players on their toes, but because most are safe until meddled with, there’s plenty of moments where “smart” players might simply be wrong about what is happening around them. That sense of doubt is important to maintaining an oppressive mood. There are ways to get through this segment with a very minimal amount of violence and few actual monster encounters if you’re careful.</p><div><p>Unless you keep choosing the wrong scarecrow! Which a lot of people seem to be doing!</p><p>After my first playthrough of the game, I took to the internet to see some of the most immediate responses. Most of it was the kind of dreck you might imagine—there’s the usual cadre of chuds mad a game starring a young woman focused on women’s issues—but I was surprised to see debate about the quality of the scarecrow puzzle. Clearly, it was memorable and stood out as a set piece, but many players seemed frustrated by its difficulty. Were the clues good enough? Could people solve the puzzle “easily,” or was it an annoying exercise in trial and error, padded out with excess combat if you failed?</p></div><figure></figure><div><p>“This whole puzzle sucks,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1nr8xw7/the_field_puzzle_is_terrible_and_also_terribly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player wrote</a> on Reddit. “I actually thought the scarecrows were scary at first but that gave way to sheer frustration at how bullshi[t] this puzzle was. I've lost so many resources and durability due to this. I hate it and I want to have never encountered it.”</p><p>I can sympathize with this and other players’ struggles, to a point. I don’t think combat in <em>Silent Hill f</em> is particularly good, and the way this puzzle slips combat in as a punishment for making mistakes can be annoying. My sympathy is complicated by the fact that I think this puzzle simply cannot work without the threat of violence. If you were able to rush through without a blood price, there would be no incentive to pause and observe things.</p></div><p>Some players also hit a snag with the question of <em>what</em> they’re observing. Are you supposed to look at the expression on the scarecrow’s mask or the person underneath?&nbsp;</p><div><p>This section isn’t just a little brain-teaser or pace-changer meant to add novelty. This is a puzzle about Hinako’s failure to see her friends for who they really are and accept that their relationships have changed. Like any good high school story, there’s a bit of a romantic tangle here. Hinako and Shu have been close friends for ages, but Rinko has feelings for him as well. Meanwhile, although <em>Silent Hill f</em> is coy about the matter at first, Hinako is in an arranged marriage with a rich suitor. Shu clearly loves Hinako but can’t find the strength to say anything about it. Everyone is leaving something unsaid.</p><p>Rinko puts on the face of a supporting peer but would do anything to get Hinako out of the picture so that she could have Shu all to herself. Meanwhile, Shu puts on a bold front for his childhood “partner” and hides his disapproval of Hinako’s arranged marriage. The wrong course to take in this puzzle is to focus on the expressions of the masks. In order to move forward and break free from the fog-filled field, Hinako must look beyond the false faces. She needs to accept that things have changed. And here in the midst of these literal strawmen, Hinako finds herself tasked with the challenge of confronting the uncomfortable group dynamic.</p></div><p>Fog is never simply fog in a <em>Silent Hill</em> game. Whenever those roiling clouds draw in close, whenever a character finds themselves trapped somewhere, it is because they have trapped themselves. In a game like <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, the deep fog throughout the titular town is a symbol of protagonist James Sunderland’s delusions about his role in his wife’s death. The fog-filled field here in <em>Silent Hill f</em> is a place that Hinako wants to remain. These are the fields she played in with Shu as a child, and as long as she stays here, she doesn’t need to confront her relationship with her friends or the terror she feels about her impending marriage. In these fields, if she could remain, it might be possible to pretend everything is fine. But there are no “real” people here. There are only straw mockeries with false faces. Seeing beyond them means getting close.</p><figure></figure><div><p>In order to proceed, particularly as the criteria for identifying the right option grows more and more specific, you need to walk up to a scarecrow and enter an examination view to look closely at them. One of the final scarecrows in particular, who we are told has a “forced smile,” hides her sick smirk underneath a mop of hair that has fallen over her face. In order to see it, you need to really get close and look from the right angle in this view mode.</p><p>This feels dangerous and forbidden and uncomfortable. If any of these scarecrows can leap to life, what does it mean to lean in close and take a look? Furthermore, unlike some games, <em>Silent Hill f</em> doesn’t always toss the player into a safe little pocket dimension when examining objects or puzzles. On the off chance that something is moving behind you in the fog, there’s now no way to look behind you. You are completely vulnerable.</p></div><p>This shift to a closer view contains an important kind of intimacy. People don’t often think of games having “intimate” features or qualities, but they can. If a game requires you to delicately trace a path on a map using a stylus, that is an intimate act. Similarly, camera shifts and changes of perspective can be intimate. Here, Hinako gets closer and closer to her friends. Sometimes she is up close to a scarecrow that resembles Shu. Leaning in closer and closer…</p><p>Earlier in the game, Hinako makes a point of nervously drawing away from Shu’s physical touch. As the two have gotten older and been unable to resolve the nature of their relationship, a deep discomfort has crept in. In this puzzle, there’s a kind of transgressive closeness at play. Drawing near, you push through certain boundaries. Come here, get closer and take a look at my true face. Close enough for me to kiss you. Close enough for me to kill you.</p><p>This intersection of helplessness and sensuality is a centerpiece of the game’s conflict and aesthetics. Even as characters strive to keep their true faces hidden and their feelings at arm’s length, they drift towards each other until they touch. The nature of the resulting touch differs. Once Hinako and Shu reach Rinko’s house, the most significant act of touch that will occur is Rinko shoving Hinako down the stairs. She lashes out dangerously like one of the scarecrow monsters in the field, using her false friendship to poise herself for the kill.</p><p>This violent touch contrasts with other moments of connection we have seen in the game until this point. Chiefly, between segments where Hinako explores the town, she is drawn into strange dream sequences where she is guided along by a soft-spoken man in a fox mask. Astute players cannot help but notice he is able to engage in the soft and intimate touches that Shu is not allowed. We come close to emulating as we examine his straw doppelgangers. This theme of touch and sensuality, of both the danger and excitement that comes from physical proximity, is found throughout the scarecrow puzzle. Pretty loaded for a brain-teaser!</p><p>That mixture of holistic storytelling and player-driven paranoia turns this puzzle into a truly fantastic sequence. There’s anxiety and bloody failure, but astute players will be drawn into the portrait it paints of Rinko and her simmering hatred for Hinako. Through it all, as their observation skills are tested, the threat of failure looms heavily. One mistake could lead into a battle that leaves them under-equipped for a future fight. If players sit and really consider Hinako’s situation, the reward is relatively brisk progress. If you’re a less than ideal friend? The price is blood and steel and potentially even more vulnerability later on.</p><p><em>Silent Hill f</em> is not always a contemplative game in spite of the genre space it is working in. The back half of the game in particular is packed with intense combat gauntlets. The pace slows here in the early hours in order to make that chaos sing louder in the climax. But even in this field of self-delusion, you can’t delay too long. Something is closing in from the fog, and some of these scarecrows are primed to strike. But you’re a good friend, right? You’re observant and clear-headed, yes?

<p>Earlier today, the game's developer shared five new profiles, and a bunch of new screenshots, of the cast on the official website (via <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-characters-zeldas-maid/">Nintendo Everything</a>). So we now know the names of the four Sages (well, their Japanese-translated names) and of... Zelda's maid?</p>
<p>First up, we have Argusta, the Goron Sage and leader of the Goron Tribe. Known as a close friend to Rauru, he is a kind, generous, and intelligent ruler. Kia is next, the Zora Sage and princess who is a master of martial arts. She's known for her bravery, which inspires her people.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Krafika is the Rito leader and the Rito Sage, and perhaps not the easiest to understand. However, he is loyal and cares about his friends. The last of the Sages then is Ardi, a member of the Gerudo tribe and a follower of Ganondorf, the current leader.</p>
<p>Of everyone here, though, we <em>most</em> want to meet Lanaria (or Ranaria), who is Zelda's maid. Trusted by Rauru, she's is a gentle woman who is both quick at her work and is fascinated with the mystical. She's always carrying around a notebook with her.</p>


<p>While that's not a ton of new info, simply knowing <em>anything</em> about the Sages is a big deal at this stage. Especially given that we're one month away from the game's release date.</p>
<p>We got a chance to go hands-on with Age of Imprisonment <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/feature-zelda-layton-mega-man-10-games-we-played-at-tgs-2025-coming-to-switch-1-and-2">very briefly at Tokyo Game Show</a>, and we're pretty excited to see what this "canonical" prequel brings to the Tears of the Kingdom story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Battlefield 6 PlayStation 5 retail version reportedly has the full game on disk, requiring no additional download to play both the campaign and the multiplayer modes.</p>



<p>As confirmed on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/">series' official subreddit</a>, retail copies of the highly anticipated new entry in the series launching this week are already in the hands of some lucky players. One of these users reported that the full game is on disk and can be played without an additional download, <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-retail-requires-full-download/">reversing a disappointing industry trend</a>. In addition, multiplayer servers are reportedly live, so those with early copies can already enjoy the full experience with no limitations.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Putting the full game on disk to avoid mandatory launch downloads is yet another indication of how the Battlefield 6 development teams have placed a greater focus on the technical elements of the game. With  solid optimization on every platform, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/">Xbox Series S</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/">minimum spec PC hardware</a>, the market is set to reward this approach significantly, judging from pre-order numbers. According to data firm Ampere Analysis, the game has an <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-1-7-million-pre-orders-predicted-to-sell-5-million-first-week/">estimated 1.7 million pre-orders, and is expected to sell 5 million units in the first week of availability.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10 worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-console-hardware-rumors</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-microsoft-isnt-giving-up-console-development.1317625/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has reiterated its intention to remain in the first-party console business, despite rumors swirling recently that the company may be contemplating an exit from that side of its operations.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-xboxs-next-gen-console-hardware-plans-arent-cancelled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft says it is "actively investing in [its] future first-party consoles and devices designed, engineered, and built by Xbox", which is a pretty definitive rebuttal of rumors to the contrary.</p>

<p>The company also suggested that those who want to see proof of its commitment to the console business can remind themselves of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">the agreement</a> Xbox made with AMD back in June, which will see the tech company creating chips for new Xbox devices.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-hardware-rumors-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=nkZV2fzt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-hardware-rumors-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=t0lUZem6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Despite its current multi-device "This Is an Xbox" campaign, Xbox insists it hasn't given up on hardware development.</figcaption></figure><p>Recent rumors appear to have started with leaker <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-revamps-xbox-game-pass-plans-and-hikes-ultimate-to-29-99-a-month-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-and-more.1688694/post-270866538" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SneakersSO</a> (who was previously apparently responsible for leaking the news that Xbox would port its games to other hardware, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow">erstwhile rival PlayStation</a>).</p>

<p>The leaker said over the weekend that Xbox's future lay in software rather than hardware, and that previously "concrete" plans for new Xbox hardware had become "up in the air". Evidently, that's not the case, or at least that isn't the image Microsoft wants to publicly project.</p>

<p>If Microsoft were to pull out of the console race, it wouldn't necessarily be an entirely ridiculous decision. According to Aldora Intelligence's sales data (via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/18/new-ps5-versus-xbox-sales-estimates-are-probably-worse-than-youd-expect/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Forbes</a>), Xbox Series X|S sales are sitting at under half of the PlayStation 5's numbers, having failed to break 30 million between the two available machines.</p>

<p>These are not, however, official figures; Microsoft is,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-75m-best-quarter-ever" rel="nofollow">unlike Sony</a>, fairly reticent about regularly announcing how many Xbox Series consoles it's managed to sell. Still, it's fair to say Xbox is almost certainly trailing Sony quite significantly in terms of hardware sales.</p>




<p>Microsoft's statement comes after Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">introduced new tiers for its Game Pass subscription service</a> last week, with Ultimate now costing an eye-watering $30 per month. That move itself came after Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-2025" rel="nofollow">revealed that this year marked its "largest investment"</a> in the service to date.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/playstation-concert-cancelled-dates-delay-us-tour-2000632085</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-cancels-most-of-its-concert-series-without-explanation-update.1317616/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-concert-last-us-god-war-horizon-ghost-1851784665"><span>PlayStation: The Concert</span></a><span>, an orchestral show featuring music from games such as </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, and more, was scheduled to begin the American leg of its tour this week with a show at Williamsport’s Community Arts Center. However, it seems like the tour might be collapsing in on itself days before the first show, as Sony has started canceling performances without explanation.</span></p> <p><span>The show’s </span><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/playstation-the-concert-tickets/artist/3244629"><span>Ticketmaster page</span></a><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-quietly-cancels-remaining-playstation-the-concert-2025-tour-dates-in-the-us/"><i><span>VGC</span></i></a><span>) lists several of its remaining 2025 shows as canceled, with tickets for only a few still for sale. To some extent, this isn’t much of a surprise, as the concert series had already canceled </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-the-concert-is-reportedly-cancelling-numerous-tour-dates-and-delaying-others/"><span>several of its UK shows earlier this year</span></a><span> and pushed them to next summer. Right now, it looks like most of the US cancellations are just that, rather than postponements to another date. I checked some of the listings that have yet to be officially canceled on the site, but I was still met with an error message saying tickets were no longer available on Ticketmaster. At the moment, the concert’s 2026 dates remain largely untouched on Ticketmaster’s website.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sony has yet to explain the reasoning behind the cancellations, but we have reached out for comment and will update this story if we hear back. Some speculate that poor ticket sales may have played a part, as some attendees noted </span><a href="https://x.com/Hazzehh/status/1914836561402744976"><span>a lot of empty seats at their shows</span></a><span>, though other performances </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magictreehouse.bsky.social/post/3lnj7g35t7s2x"><span>look pretty packed</span></a><span>. I wouldn’t be surprised if, even with the PlayStation branding, the show wasn’t drawing a lot of people in because it seemed very fixated on the PlayStation 4 and 5 era, spotlighting games like </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span>, rather than making a show that encompassed a wide spread of the brand’s history. I feel like a dedicated show for any of those franchises would have pulled in crowds, but when you put them all under one umbrella and the whole thing seems like an ahistorical account of PlayStation history, I can see why people might not be flocking to buy tickets. It also doesn’t help that Sony didn’t have a huge marketing push behind the tour. I frankly forgot that it was coming up, and I was supposed to go to the Madison Square Garden show.</span></p>

 <p><strong>Update, 10/6/25 at 11:45 a.m.:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>GEA Live, the company behind the PlayStation Concert, has released the following statement to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is with great regret that we have cancelled the PlayStation | The Concert tour in North America. Our team has spent a considerable amount of time developing this project, and we share in the disappointment of fans who will no longer be able to attend. We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who supported the show and appreciate your understanding in making this difficult decision.</p> </blockquote> <p>Though the initial statement reads as if the rest of the North American tour has been canceled, GEA Live representatives clarified in a follow-up statement that it specifically refers to the 2025 dates.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7%E2%80%99s-beta-has-players-complaining-about-matchmaking-and-doors.1317613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Oh hey, a new <i>Call of Duty </i>is on the horizon. This time it’s <i>Black Ops</i> season (even though we just had one of those), and to help them fine-tune its competitive action and the overall ebb and flow of its speedy combat (as well as to test the game’s anti-cheat tech), developers Treyarch and Raven Software ran a beta for those with an active pre-order over the weekend.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-next-blops-7-wall-bounce-maps-tac-movement-2000630271"><i>BLOPS7</i> aims to be a very fast</a>, bouncy shooter of a game, with players granted the ability to jump off walls much like they could in <i>Titanfall</i>. It looked super fun in motion during the multiplayer reveal last week, but now that folks have finally been able to pour into the lobbies and get some matches in, how did it all work out?</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-next-blops-7-wall-bounce-maps-tac-movement-2000630271"><i>Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7</i> Shows Off Everything Coming To Multiplayer At Launch</a></p> <p>TL;DR: The community is really upset over doors; TTK rates might be a touch too high; no one will ever be satisfied with SBMM; and <i>Battlefield</i> threatens to eat <i>COD</i>’s lunch for the first time in a long while.</p>

 <h2>Cheaters got the boot (most of ‘em, anyway)</h2> <p>This weekend’s beta was a perfect opportunity for <i>Call of Duty</i>’s anti-cheat initiative, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-beta-cheaters-cod-blops-black-ops-7-ban-secure-boot-ricochet-2000630268">Team Ricochet</a>, to test out their defenses. And from the sounds of things, cheaters had a hard time getting into matches. TMP 2.0, along with whatever other magic Team Ricochet is using to block cheaters, <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/article/1974942752485077132">appears to have caught 97 percent</a> of cheaters “within 30 minutes of their first sign-in,” with “fewer than one-percent of cheating attempts reach[ing] a match, and those that did were removed within minutes.”</p>

 <h2>SBMM, the eternal debate</h2> <p>Discourse over skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) was at the heart of last weekend’s beta, with a mode that specifically sought to avoid this controversial form of matchmaking. SBMM aims to make sure you’re matched with other random players of similar skill level. Sounds good in theory, but in practice it tends to be a bit of a tricky situation, especially if you’re playing with a friend who’s of a different skill level than you, resulting in unfair pairings. It can also make games feel more competitive and sweaty when some folks are just looking for a chill set of rounds.</p>

   <p>The debate over SBMM is sure to rage on, but Treyarch and Raven seem to be aware that not everyone’s a fan. During the beta, “<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes#oct4">Open Moshpit” was introduced</a> to let folks jump into matches where “skill consideration is drastically reduced.”</p>

 <h2>Time-to-kill rates and those frakin’ doors!</h2> <p>Time-to-kill (TTK), the average amount of time it takes a player to die while being shot, would appear to be pretty speedy in <i>BLOPS7</i>. Perhaps too speedy. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes#oct3">The devs are aware</a> that folks are finding they die a bit too quickly right now, and so they’ll be “releasing a weapon balance patch in the coming days to adjust TTK and ensure all weapons available in the beta are competitive.”</p>

 <p>Quick deaths weren’t the only issue some folks had. Doors, it would seem, really got under some players’ skin. Though doors in <i>BLOPS7</i> maps are automatic (they can be shot to open them too), they don’t stay open, and the interruption of sightlines and the unwelcome surprise of running into someone you didn’t expect runs counter to the flow of gameplay many folks expect from <i>COD</i>. (Previous games saw doors stay open during a match.)</p>  <p>There aren’t too many doors, however. Treyarch reports that just five of its 16v16 maps currently have them. Still, the team is looking to possibly reduce that number, with an option to disable them in private matches.</p> <h2>The <i>Battlefield</i>-sized elephant in the room</h2> <p>As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/the-black-ops-7-beta-introduced-a-mode-without-sbmm-and-call-of-duty-players-are-psyched-we-need-battlefield-6-to-come-out-every-year/">reported by <i>GamesRadar</i></a>, the upcoming <i>Battlefield 6</i>, which is shaping up to be somewhat of a return-to-form for the beleaguered military shooter franchise, seems to be spooking Treyarch and Activision a bit. That the devs even considered removing SBMM via Open Mosphit, according to some, is proof that <i>COD</i>’s gonna do whatever it takes to try and offer an alternative to the allure of <i>Battlefield</i>.</p> <p>At the very least, it should be entertaining to see where this arms race between <i>Battlefield</i> and <i>COD</i> will go as we near the release of both games. <i>Battlefield 6</i> arrives on October 10, 2025, with <i>Black Ops 7</i> following it a month later on November 14.</p>

Many of us had survived a near-death studio experience years back when <em>Darkborn</em> was cancelled, and because of this team’s loyalty and refusal to quit, <em>Metal: Hellsinger</em> was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen.</p><p>We had hoped to do something even better this time—.</p><p>—things don’t always go the way you hope.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But we are not giving up, and we are going to try to continue on in some new form. If you think you can help in any way, with business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is, I would be genuinely grateful if you reach out here. Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting.</p><p>Thanks so much.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/metal-hellsinger-developer-the-outsiders-shuts-down]]></content:encoded>

One person on Reddit posted a photo of the game's Phantom Edition for PS5. It sports the PEGI logo, which means the copy of game likely came from a European retailer, but it's not clear which one.</p><p>Many theorized that, although this person obtained a copy of the game early, they might not be able to play until the servers officially go live. However, the person said the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/comment/ni2iofv/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">servers are online already and the campaign is playable as well.</a> Officially, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-times-seemingly-revealed-and-there-is-no-early-access/1100-6535079/" data-ref-id="1100-6535079">EA says Battlefield 6 servers go live on October 10. </a></p><p>Others have apparently <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1975197858497454532" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">obtained a physical copy of Battlefield 6 already as well</a>. Given this, people who care about spoilers for the campaign may want to be extra mindful for the next few days until launch.</p><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC; it's not coming to last-gen platforms and there is no early access like there was for Battlefield 2042.</p><p>The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-not-on-game-pass-but-is-coming-to-a-subscription-service/1100-6533658/" data-ref-id="1100-6533658">not coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>, but EA Play Pro subscribers can get Battlefield 6's Phantom Edition ($100 USD) as part of the subscription, which costs $17/month.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is the first entry in the series since 2021's Battlefield 2042, a game that was a disappointment for many fans.

                <p>Recently, a rumor swirled online that Microsoft was canceling its next-generation Xbox plans, but that is apparently not true or the full story. Microsoft said in a statement that it is "actively investing" in future first-party consoles and devices that are "designed, engineered, and built by Xbox."</p><p>The statement, shared with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-xboxs-next-gen-console-hardware-plans-arent-cancelled" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, pointed fans to the announcement from June this year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">Microsoft is working with AMD on future consoles and devices. </a></p><p>At the time, Xbox president Sarah Bond said Microsoft and AMD will work together to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices, including our next-generation Xbox consoles. In your living room and in your hands."</p><p>In February 2024, Bond said the next Xbox would offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a></p><h2><strong>What did the original source say?</strong></h2><p>The rumors that Microsoft had canceled future Xbox hardware plans stemmed from <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-revamps-xbox-game-pass-plans-and-hikes-ultimate-to-29-99-a-month-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-and-more.1688694/page-29#post-270866538" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NeoGAF forum member SneakersSO</a>, who said plans for future Xbox hardware had morphed from "really concrete" to "up in the air." The internet did what the internet does and extrapolated from this that plans for future Xbox devices made by Microsoft had been canceled, even though the source did not say that.</p><p>The person added that Microsoft's future may be more focused on games, and specifically its biggest franchises, including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Minecraft, Candy Crush, and Forza Horizon and away from dedicated hardware. To that end, the report said Microsoft will look to further push Xbox Cloud Gaming on more devices to help drive Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.</p><p>The Verge's Tom Warren, a person known for breaking stories about Xbox, said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ny8bms/tom_warren_sneakersso_knows_a_lot_of_what_goes_on/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this person is known to have reliable sources and good information</a>. This is presumably part of the reason why the "Xbox is dead" story spread so fast and wide over the weekend prior to Microsoft issuing its statement.</p><h2><strong>Xbox's struggles</strong></h2><p>It's no secret that the Xbox platform is lagging behind PlayStation this console generation, with monthly US sales reports from Circana showing Xbox regularly ranking third against PlayStation and Nintendo. Microsoft itself has told fans they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">do not need an Xbox to play Xbox games</a>. Thanks to Game Pass and the cloud, the devices people may already own--including a smartphone or tablet--can play Xbox games via Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft is reminding people of this with its "This is an Xbox" campaign.</p><p>Xbox has also faced public perception challenges of late thanks to the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">mass layoffs, game cancellations, and studio closures</a>. Most recently, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raised Xbox Game Pass Ultimate's price by 50%, up to $30/month</a>, with many saying Microsoft is a greedy company looking to squeeze players even more.</p>
