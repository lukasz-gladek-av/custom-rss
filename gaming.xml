			<p>Until Dawn Remake on PC is reportedly filled with several bugs. Users report that ray traced settings are completely broken, and some upscaling technologies aren't effective at all.</p>
<p>For those unaware, the studio Ballistic Moon, a new team founded by former leads at Supermassive Games, was selected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-pc-specs-released-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-and-ray-tracing-are-supported/">release Until Dawn Remake on PC</a> (and PlayStation 5), which did excite fans considering that the title's stunning visuals were being held back by inferior platforms, but now it is being disclosed that the game's graphical state is entire of bugs and that users are utterly disappointed by how the PC port isn't working with RT like it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-pc-specs-released-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-and-ray-tracing-are-supported/">originally advertised to be</a>.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/until-dawn-remake-amd-fsr-3-0-frame-generation-ray-tracing-hdr-are-not-working-on-pc/">DSOgaming</a> claims that Until Dawn Remake on PC sees no visual change when ray-tracing is enabled and that the image quality is exactly the same. This is a surprising fact, given that not having RT on a PC port makes it completely useless. Here's a look at the game before vs. after RT is enabled, and by first impressions, there are no changes to the overall graphics.</p>

<p>Well, the non-functionality of RT isn't the only disappointment here, as it is said that the title isn't working with AMD's FSR 3.0, however, NVIDIA's DLSS works just fine. The developers promised that all upscaling technologies would support the PC port; however, for AMD users, it is a disappointment that a crucial feature wasn't working for them. Overall, the title feels rushed, and several other bugs make the PC port a failure when it comes to addressing the graphical capabilities that the PC platform holds.</p>
<p>We expect the developers to push out an optimization update to get the PC port up and running since, in this state, it won't prove to be much of a success.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> star Josh Hutcherson says the second Freddy-themed movie is "much bigger" and "scarier" than its predecessor.</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.esquire.com/style/mens-fashion/a62490388/josh-hutcherson-ritz-carlton-late-checkout-interview-2024/">Esquire</a>, as spotted by <a href="http://v/">TheGamer</a>, Hutcherson talked about the "higher stakes" and teased that there will be "more" and "different" animatronics, with the Freddy universe "opening up in a big way".</p>

<p>"We're finding the balance right now of building this world and expanding it in a really cool way but also making sure the characters stay really grounded," Hutcherson said. "That's something that I really think that we all fought for in the first film, because this world that was created in Five Nights at Freddy's, it's so out-there.</p><p>"It's so over-the-top and wacky, in a way, that to find the emotional truth of the characters was gonna be what was gonna work. I think the fans are gonna flip for it. It's gonna be a lot of fun with the source. It's gonna be scarier, too, actually."</p>
<p>Talking about how much he enjoys working in the Freddy-centric world, Hutcherson says the possibilities with his character, Mike, "are endless".</p>
<p>Does that mean a third movie could be on the way?</p>
<p>"This could have a very potentially long run and it could be a lot of fun, but at this point we're focusing on the second movie. We'll see what comes after that," Hutcherson teased.</p>
<p>Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sequel-officially-in-the-works">announced the sequel back in April at CinemaCon</a>.</p>
<p>On its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sees-second-largest-video-game-adaptation-debut-of-all-time">Five Nights at Freddy's scored the second-largest debut of all time for a video game adaptation in the US</a>, coming only behind that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">Nintendo and Illumination's animated Super Mario Bros.

            <p>Wikipedia has had to lock down the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> page after repeated vandalism from editors who refuse to accept that the remake of Konami's seminal horror game released to critical acclaim earlier this week.</p>
<p>Outright lies around the games reception and metacritic score - including one edit that said the game had "received the worst reviews imaginable" - means the page has now been put into a semi-protected state to stop unregistered users from making wild, unsubstantiated claims, including one that said Eurogamer had awarded it 0/5 stars when, in fact, it got top marks.</p>

<p>It's unclear what's motivating the edits, although its presumed by some to have been fuelled by the nauseating discourse that the game is "woke" because of changes made to the characters facial features and clothing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-is-utterly-miserable-and-thats-why-its-great<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em><strong>Warning: this article contains mild thematic and environment spoilers for Silent Hill 2. </strong></em></p><p>The Silent Hill 2 remake is the most miserable experience I’ve had with a game in recent memory. </p><p>With an opening sentence like that, you’re probably expecting to read a very negative critique of developer Bloober Team’s recreation of Konami and Team Silent’s survival horror classic. But, in this very rare occurrence, complete and unrelenting misery is actually a positive. The original Silent Hill 2 is perhaps the bleakest, most sombre game ever made and Bloober Team has successfully preserved its miserable magic, ensuring this remake is a deeply effective descent into genuinely uncomfortable terror.</p><p>That journey begins with sound and vision. The thick, opaque fog that conceals the town of Silent Hill is part of the story’s instantly recognisable iconography, and the remake’s impressive modern volumetric effects mean it feels thicker and more isolating than ever. Moving away from the monster-infested streets should feel like an escape, but instead you’re forced to find shelter in some of the dankest, most depressingly disgusting residences you’ve ever seen. Much of Silent Hill 2 is themed around a descent, and there’s a clear gradient in the visual texture of each area that communicates that downward spiral. Locations initially feel unkempt and abandoned, such as apartment blocks with peeling wallpaper and empty cupboards. But push onwards and the architecture becomes increasingly oppressive. Recognisable shapes and textures are replaced with rougher, broken alternatives, and eventually the entire area becomes a rusting, decayed husk. What starts as unnerving transforms into truly nightmarish the further you dare to press on. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/03/silent-hill-2-remake-01-1727954034055.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill 2's iconic fog is suffocating, especially in its modern-day form.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Contributing to all this, as horror tradition demands, is minimal lighting. You are locked inside dark buildings for the majority of the game’s lengthy runtime (anything from 12 to 18 hours, depending on your playstyle). This becomes increasingly distressing, particularly during exploration of Toluca Prison – the facility’s lights can only be turned on for a few seconds at a time, forcing you to sprint between breaker switches in a mostly doomed attempt to hold back the darkness. Being starved of the sun for such long stretches means that the mere sight of daylight is like gasping for air after spending what feels like days beneath water. It’s deeply, unpleasantly effective.  </p><p>That visual palette is accompanied not so much by a musical score, but by the most oppressive collection of noises your ears have ever suffered, provided once again by original Silent Hill 2 composer Akira Yamaoka. It’s particularly effective in the late game, when what sounds like an approaching beast is dynamically woven into the orchestration during times of high tension. It makes you second guess every sound you hear, and over time it grinds away at your sense of reality. It’s not easy to simulate insanity, but this soundscape is as close as you can (un)comfortably get. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The most impressive, unsettling achievement is inflicting empathy through gameplay design.</p></div><p>Effective art and sound design has been the flagship feature of many horror games, but these disciplines are the surface of the experience. I don’t mean that disparagingly – the surface is vital – but it’s what’s beneath that truly cements the terror. Games like Resident Evil 4 and Dead Space are, in reality, action games with horror masks, and so are rarely ever truly scary. Silent Hill 2, on the other hand, is a horror game right down to its nerve endings and bone marrow. Its environment and objective design pull on similar threads to the art and sound, constantly seeking new ways to unnerve you. Each location visited is an obtuse puzzle to be solved. You’re forced to walk circuits of each floor, backtracking to find keys or hidden entrances to rooms that will once again send you backwards to progress. This almost spiral-shaped route through the apartments, hospital, hotel and more forces you to endure increasing mental exhaustion. </p><p>This fatigue, combined with the seemingly relentless length of each area, robs you of hope. It’s particularly horrible in the final third, when you’re forced to navigate the prison and the subsequent labyrinth back-to-back with absolutely no respite. These locations feature long stretches of near-impenetrable darkness, thematically grim puzzle work, and the most aggressive, grotesque enemies in the entire game. The resulting emotional toll effectively communicates the mental space that the protagonist James Sunderland finds himself in. And that’s Bloober’s, and by extension Team Silent’s, most impressive, unsettling achievement: the ability to inflict empathy through gameplay design.      </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/03/silent-hill-2-remake-02-1727954070065.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The unrelenting darkness of Silent Hill 2's corrdors grinds away at your mental endurance.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The miserable tone of Silent Hill 2 is maintained through a number of other gameplay tricks. As mentioned earlier, the story revolves around James’ descent into horror, and that’s represented both metaphorically through the visual design, and literally through a frequent need to jump into pitch-black holes. Each leap requires you to press the action button a couple of times, replicating his hesitancy and reluctance to leap into the unknown. </p><p>As the atmosphere becomes increasingly unbearable, there’s nothing built into the campaign to offer any levity or security. In the Resident Evil series, for instance, you gradually collect an increasingly powerful arsenal, allowing the late-game to be an exciting, explosive romp through blood and guts. It also toys with its dialogue and monster design, often opting for goofy characterisation that secures the series its beloved ‘cheesy horror’ credentials. Last year’s Alan Wake 2, despite clearly being inspired by Team Silent’s work, features absurdist humour and Lynchian direction to lean into the weird instead of horrifying, allowing for laughs to cut through the tension. Silent Hill 2, though, has none of this. For the most part your weapons are a broken pipe and a pistol, and even when you do get access to something a little more hard-hitting it’s nothing more than a simple shotgun or rifle with a long reload time and limited ammo. Alongside a difficulty curve that sees familiar enemies become erratic, wall-crawling freaks, Silent Hill 2’s atmosphere consistently finds ways to suffocate you.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Silent Hill 2 isn’t about having fun, it’s about exploring parts of the human experience we traditionally avoid.</p></div><p>It’s not usual for an assessment to use terms like ‘suffocate,’ ‘oppressive,’ and ‘miserable’ as positives, but horror is not a usual genre. It’s one of only two entertainment categories built around eliciting an uncontrollable response from the audience (the other being comedy). Horror is an emotion-manipulating machine, and the genre’s most effective stories can force us to experience feelings we typically don't encounter in our everyday lives. Horror films spend their entire runtimes exerting different levels of pressure in order to achieve that manipulation, and the most effective etch images in our mind that continually reappear when the lights go out. </p><p>Video games are a very different medium, though, and their experiential nature enables them to manipulate us in more intense ways. Rather than ask us to observe, they demand that we interact, typically for four, five, sometimes even 10 times longer than an average scary movie. This can force us to experience a very different reality. While there’s a frequent insistence from some parts of the player community that games are only about fun or escapist entertainment, that’s often not the goal of many developers. Sometimes that goal is communicating uncomfortable ideas, and the path to that is through exposing us to a reality that’s deeply unpleasant. Silent Hill 2 isn’t about having fun, it’s about exploring grief and guilt – parts of the human experience that we traditionally avoid. Strangely, there’s an uncomfortable thrill in actively exploring those ideas via a video game.</p><p>The 2001 original’s technical limitations helped contribute a few thorns to that painful experience; the semi-fixed camera made environments feel restrictive and claustrophobic, and the awkward aiming installed each encounter with a sense of desperation. Bloober Team’s remake prunes those thorns, replacing them with modern third-person controls that make the experience a little friendlier to play. But those are the only significant concessions provided, so while combat sequences are perhaps a little less panicked than they once were, Team Silent’s nightmarish vision is preserved. It means the remake is a modern reminder not just of an era where Konami was a master of survival horror, but also the significant power of Silent Hill 2’s unrelenting misery.</p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Silent Hill: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Every game in the Silent Hill series -- and yes, we're including P.T.</p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund is considering increasing its 8.58 percent stake in Nintendo.</p>

<p>The fund - which also has stakes in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-nexon-become-latest-video-game-companies-in-saudis-investment-splurge">Capcom, Nexon</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-reportedly-increases-nintendo-stake-for-second-time-in-a-month">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-sovereign-fund-acquires-usd3-3bn-stake-in-activision-ea-take-two">Take Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard</a> - is currently transferring its shares in these gaming companies to its Savvy Games Group subsidiary.</p>
<p>It also has an interest in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-increases-stake-in-ea-by-55">EA</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-acquires-stake-in-embracer-group">acquired a £840m stake in Embracer Group</a> in 2022, reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracers-collapsed-2bn-deal-reportedly-with-saudi-arabia-funded-savvy-games">"walking away" from its $2bn "major strategic partnership" with Embracer</a> earlier this year, sending the latter into a tailspin that led to a spectacular collapse back in May.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-raises-eyebrows-with-saudi-prince-meeting">Even Hideo Kojima raises eyebrows after meeting Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud last year.</a></p>
<p>"There are always opportunities," said vice chair Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al-Saud at Tokyo Game Show, but stressed: "It's important to keep the communication going so you get there in the right way. We don't want to rush into anything."</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's PIF is also involved in a number of other entertainment businesses, including sports and films.</p>
<p>The news comes after several key developments for Saudi Arabia and its gaming portfolio, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-is-hosting-the-inaugural-esports-olympic-games-next-year">hosting the next esports Olympic Games</a> and the new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-announces-new-era-of-overwatch-esports-with-saudi-funded-partnership">Overwatch Champions Series, or OWCS</a>.</p>
<p>The Savvy Gaming Group is a subsidiary of the Public Investment Fund, an initiative chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The hugely-controversial figure has been blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Meanwhile, his rule of Saudi Arabia has maintained the country's notoriously poor human rights record, with homosexuality still criminalised and punishments ranging from floggings to the death penalty.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Peter Walczak didn't identify as a "car guy," which makes his hobbyist superproject of choice all the more surprising: building a functional life-size version of the iconic Warthog jeep from the Halo games. By his own admission, the retired Navy test pilot has poured untold hours and thousands of dollars into this amazing prop, which he hopes to feature in Halo fan films someday in the future.</p><p>Walczak grew up playing video games, but his interest in the hobby waned as he got older. However, when a coworker told him about a hot new video game console called the Xbox in the early 2000s, he decided to pick one up. His primary interest wasn't Halo, though--it was Steel Battalion, an obscure Xbox exclusive that required its own intimidating secondary controller, which featured two joysticks and three pedals. "It was an awful game," Walczak says. "At that point, I thought, 'I might as well get this stupid Halo game that everyone's talking about.'"</p><p>Like many others, Walczak quickly fell in love with Bungie's groundbreaking console shooter; he cites its beautiful levels and sci-fi story as two of the major reasons why. He even ended up playing with his coworker online, going head-to-head in beloved maps like Blood Gulch. The franchise ended up reigniting his love for video games. Walczak was stationed in Hawaii when Halo 2 came out, and while his compatriots were exploring the island and going to the beach, he was sitting inside an aircraft carrier, playing the new game on a washed-out 12-inch television. "It was the peak of that gaming era for me," he says. "Nothing comes close."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4378909-img_1073.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378909" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4378909-img_1073.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378909"></a><figcaption>Image courtesy of Peter Walczak</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4378909-img_1073.jpg"></figure><p>To be clear, Walczak does call himself a "car guy" now, but the title was hard-won. A lifelong tinkerer with a background in electrical engineering, he first got the idea of putting together his own Warthog when he saw Weta Workshop's take on the mean green jeep, which was used in the live-action series Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn. ("I just thought, I can probably build something like that," he says, laughing. "How hard could it be?")</p><p>However, it wasn't until Walczak settled into a new home with a garage that he actually felt he could work on it in earnest. That's when he caught a lucky break: an acquaintance of his was selling a beat-up old truck for a very reasonable price. Walczak showed up and wrote a check; shortly after, he and a few buddies were stripping the truck for parts, reimagining it as a base for a futuristic jeep recognizable to a generation of gamers.</p><p>"That's definitely when it became real," Walczak says. "Before, I was just a guy with a few sketches. After I wrote the check, I had a dilapidated old truck in my driveway. I just thought, 'What am I doing with my life? I guess I'm actually building this thing.'"</p><p>Embarking on the project in earnest in 2014, Walczak had to teach himself many skills to pull off the build, a process which he jokingly ascribes to "YouTube University." For example, he had to teach himself how to weld various metal parts securely together, which he hadn't done since college. He also had to master a 3D printer and learn the ins-and-outs of almost every facet of the truck base. From early on, Walczak tried to use as many off-the-shelf parts as possible to keep the project relatively manageable, but over time, he realized that he would have to buy a variety of components from different manufacturers to achieve his goals.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4379020-6619774127-43789.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4379020" data-ratio="0.66640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4379020-6619774127-43789.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4379020"></a><figcaption>Image courtesy of Peter Walczak</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4379020-6619774127-43789.jpg"></figure><p><span>Despite the scale of the vehicle, he says he's done almost all of the design and work by himself, with two major exceptions. He commissioned a racing firm to create the windscreen for the truck--which ended up being the most expensive part by far--and he got help from a friend at a machine shop to help him bend the rear bumper to the proper specification.</span></p><p>"I was a handy person with a technical degree, but I realized pretty quickly that I had to learn a lot to get this done," Walczak says. "I had done a bit of welding in school, but I didn't know how to weld, really…The hardest part of the project was finding parts that were compatible with the base truck. It's really easy to go on a car forum and find some guy who says, 'Yeah, this part in X car looks about two feet long,' but it's a little different when you need something that's exactly 22 inches. It's been a learning process for sure."</p><p>Walczak has documented much of the process of putting the Warthog together on social media, which of course garnered positive responses from the Halo fan community, as well as the usual range of curious missives. Many ask the creator for the plans or blueprint for the Warthog, which always amuses Walczak--no such documents exist. Some have even offered to buy it outright, with one user offering tens of thousands of dollars for the super-prop. Needless to say, it's not for sale. "Every price I've been offered would really just cover the parts," Walczak says. "I just tell them, 'Hey, this is 10 years of my life you're talking about!'"</p><p>Like a lot of hobbyists who have put a lot of time into a single project, Walczak looks on the early days of his endeavor with a sense of bemusement. When I ask him if he might tackle another fan-build of this scale again, he offers a surprising thought. "Honestly, I have to resist the urge to do this one all over again," he says, laughing. "There are things I would do completely differently. But to be honest, I haven't decided yet…People ask me to sell these to them. It's just wild to me." He's considered building his take on the Pelican--the dropships that spill Warthogs and marines from their guts in many well-remembered Halo missions--but that's just a dream for now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4378911-img_0781.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378911" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="4032" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4378911-img_0781.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378911"></a><figcaption>Image courtesy of Peter Walczak</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4378911-img_0781.jpg"></figure><p>As of this writing, Walczak describes the Warthog build as roughly 97% complete, as he recently completed one of the most difficult steps: taking the entire vehicle apart and painting it, which took far longer than he expected. His ultimate goal of creating a drivable Warthog is within reach. "I can see the end of the tunnel," he says. "It's a strange feeling."</p><p>"People always talk about the turret, like the cops will pull me over and say, 'Hey, what's that?'" Walczak says. "Honestly, it's a piece of PVC pipe. It's not something I really worry about…When it comes to making it street-legal, it's more about making sure it has working windshield wipers, seatbelts, that sort of thing. I think it's doable, for sure."</p><p>When it comes to those who would look to follow in Walczak's footsteps, he has some pointed words of wisdom: "Stop talking about it and just do it." He notes that he's seen many projects in the fan community collect hundreds if not thousands of upvotes on their first announcement, only to fall by the wayside once the intrepid leader hits an unforeseen obstacle. He recommends that fans start small and build from there: For example, if you can't afford the materials to build Master Chief-style armor at home, try painting foam mats instead.</p><p>"People always say, 'It's too hard.' Look, nobody said it was ever going to be easy," Walczak says. "Spend less time talking about it and more time learning. You might not have the skills or the money to get started today, but you can go on YouTube and learn something, or just buy a cheap welder and play with it. Scratching ideas on a piece of paper is progress. So you're broke; that's okay. I was pretty broke when I started too…It doesn't have to be life-sized, it can be a scale model, it can sit on your desk. Just do something. That's the main thing."</p>

					<p>Following over a year of rumors, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the PS5 Pro console on September 10. Like the PlayStation 4 Pro console, it's a mid-generation hardware refresh aimed at high-end gamers who wish to run PlayStation 5 games at higher frame rates and/or with better visual quality.</p>
<p>As PlayStation Principal Product Manager Toshi Aoki <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-a-full-package-with-exceptional-value-for-players-says-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> in late September, Sony has started discussing the PS5 Pro internally even before the PlayStation 5 launch (November 2020). The first concrete rumors about the specs <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-zen2-rdna3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came in October 2023</a> via RedGamingTech, while another leaker <a href="https://wccftech.com/additional-ps5-pro-specs-and-details-potentially-leaked-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared even more in December 2023</a>.</p>
<h2>Release date and pricing</h2>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will debut globally on Thursday, November 7, 2024. Its pricing was by far the most contentious topic of the unveiling. Pre-release rumors hinted at a price of around $500, but the reality is far different: Sony asks $699 / £699 / €799 for its new console.</p>
<p>This is a major departure from the PS4 Pro, which launched at the same price as the base PlayStation 4, just $399. Of course, many things have changed over these last eight years, such as inflation and the inability to reduce manufacturing costs over time after launch.</p>
<p>Despite the high price, Sony remains confident that the PS5 Pro console could sell similarly to the PS4 Pro, which accounted for circa 20% of the total PlayStation 4 sales. Since then, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-like-pc-would-cost-a-fair-bit-more-says-df-rtx-4070-is-the-closest-gpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-price-is-not-that-bad-says-zampella-youre-not-getting-the-same-performance-from-a-700-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Respawn's Vince Zampella</a> have argued that assembling a PC as powerful as the PlayStation 5 Pro would inevitably cost more nowadays.</p>

<h2>Hardware Specifications</h2>
<p>The console's main enhancements are undoubtedly found in the GPU, a significant improvement over the PS5's RDNA 2-based graphics card that only featured 36 Compute Units. The PS5 Pro, on the other hand, is equipped with 60 Compute Units, or 67% more than the base console. The memory speed is also 28% faster, going from 448GB/s to 576GB/s.</p>
<p>Overall, Sony says this will translate into 45% faster rendering. But the PS5 Pro's ace in the hole may well be the inclusion of unreleased AMD technology that will greatly improve ray tracing performance (up to twice as fast). System architect Mark Cerny <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-motivated-amds-development-of-advanced-ray-tracing-says-mark-cerny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> outright that Sony spurred this innovation.</p>
<p>The new console will offer a 2TB SSD, more than twice the 825GB of the PS5. However, it does not include a disc drive or a vertical stand, which must be purchased separately (for $79.99 and $29.99, respectively) for those interested. The PS5 Pro also supports Wi-Fi 7 and 8K displays.</p>
<p>So far, few developers have commented on the hardware, but No Man's Sky Engine programmer Martin Griffiths openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-absolutely-rocks-says-no-mans-sky-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> that the PS5 Pro 'absolutely rocks.'</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PSSR-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Software Features</h2>
<p>Another major new feature of the PS5 Pro is the so-called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution. This is the first console with built-in AI upscaling technology powered by machine learning. Cerny said of PSSR:</p>
<p><em>We added custom hardware for machine learning and an AI library called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, or PSSR for short. PSSR analyzes the game images pixel by pixel and can add an extraordinary amount of detail, which boosts the effective resolution.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>While usage of technologies like PSSR will require work on behalf of the individual game developer, the console also includes a system-wide feature called PS5 Pro Game Boost, which can improve the performance of PS4 and PS5 games alike. Moreover, another feature called Enhanced Image Quality for PS4 games will be available to improve the resolution on select PS4 games.</p>
<h2>PS5 Pro Confirmed Games</h2>
<p>So far, 62 existing or upcoming PlayStation 5 games have been confirmed to receive proper support for the new console. You can find them all below, and we'll add more as they are announced by the respective game studios.</p>

            <p>The movie adaptation of Supermassive's Until Dawn horror has wrapped filming.</p>
<p>Director David F. Sandberg shared the news on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAupl0Oo9Su/">Instagram</a> account, saying "we made it until dawn! That’s a wrap on #UntilDawnMovie".</p>

<p>The comment was accompanied by a delightfully gruesome photo of a blood splattered mirror or window and a clapperboard. On the slate is the name Until Dawn and the date filming ended: 4th October 2024.</p>
<p>Until Dawn stars Ella Rubin (The Idea of You), Michael Cimino (Love Victor), Ji-young Yoo (Expats), and Odessa A’zion (Hellraiser), although we still don't know what roles they'll play, or if any of the original star is set to return. The script has been written by Blair Butler and Annabelle and The Nun writer, Gary Dauberman.</p><div>

<p>We learned that Supermassive's acclaimed PS4 cinematic horror game Until Dawn was being turned into a movie by the writer and director of 2017 horror hit Annabelle: Creation earlier this year. It's described as a "R-rated love letter to the horror genre", suggesting it'll retain some of the meta elements of its inspiration.</p>
<p>We also recently found out that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-sees-peter-stormare-reprise-his-role-as-dr-hill">Peter Stormare reprises his role from the game</a>, psychiatrist Dr Hill.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the qualifying rounds for the upcoming BLAST R6 Major Montreal open up, some of the best Rainbow Six teams in the world are earning their spots in the running. Between November 7 and 17, this $750,000 tournament will play out in Montreal, with 20 of the top teams making their way toward a grand stage at the Verdun Auditorium.</p>



<p>Presently, all but one team in Phase 2 of the qualifying structure has been confirmed – but in just a few days, we’ll have these last few teams listed and ready to go.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-it-to-montreal">Making it to Montreal</h2>



<p>In the last couple of days, the following teams have secured their spot at the BLAST R6 Major Montreal:</p>



<ul>
<li>DPlus</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>Soniqs</li>



<li>DarkZero</li>
</ul>



<p>They join a lineup made up of the likes of Soniqs, Virtus, Team Secret, Team BDS, Wolves, Spacestation M80, w7m, Elevate, FURIA, KINOTROPE, and Team Falcons. Some of the boldest and most recognisable organisations in esports are being represented on the stage in Canada next month.</p>



<p>This is the final BLAST R6 event of the year and the last major Rainbow Six Siege tournament of 2024. It follows the BLAST R6 Manchester Major that took place in May 2024, and ultimately it’ll lead into February’s Six Invitational in North America. </p>



<p>For years, Rainbow Six has been building a solid esports ecosystem that has blown up in the last twelve months or so, and events like these typically sit near the top of the table where the industry is concerned.</p>



<p>Going into the BLAST R6 Major Montreal, the deck is stacked and there are plenty of teams with the capability to secure the top spot. Earlier this year, Team BDS won the Esports World Cup in the Rainbow Six Siege category, and the team also wound up in second place at the Manchester Major – could another win be in store for the squad?</p>



<p>Behind Team BDS, the next odds-on favourite is w7m Esports.</p>

The study, which was completed by WhichBingo and backed up by ‘a team of psychologists’, featured an intelligence test designed to rank the IQ of gamers – and the results were pretty entertaining.</p>

<h2 id="h-sorry-rocket-league-fans">Sorry, Rocket League fans</h2>



<p>The WhichBingo study, which was dug up recently by <a href="https://esports-news.co.uk/2024/10/05/league-legends-players-smartest-iq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EsportsNewsUK</a>, suggests that League of Legends has the most intelligent players in the world. I can believe that — I can’t even <strong>nearly </strong>understand how that game works, and the more competitive League of Legends players blow my mind.</p>



<p>At the other end of the scale sits FC 24 and Rocket League. It was assessed that the player bases for these games boast an IQ hovering around the 90 mark, while League of Legends gamers boast an average IQ of 120.4.</p>



<p>In second place sits Black Myth: Wukong, whose players have an average IQ of 119.8 – so it’s a close finish. Baldur’s Gate 3 is in third place at 117.9 IQ, and then making up the rest of the top five are Counter-Strike and Elden Ring players.</p>



<p>The middle of the table is made up of a wide variety of games, ranging from Battlefield 2042 (105.8 IQ) and Escape from Tarkov (104.2 IQ) to Deadlock (108.7 IQ) and Genshin Impact (106.8 IQ).</p>



<p>Call of Duty populates the spot above Rocket League in eighteenth place, with Warzone and Modern Warfare 3 players boasting an average IQ of just 95.3. </p>



<p>There’s a trend here – the more complex the game, the higher the average IQ of the player base. If a title has a mixy competitive meta and more intricate mechanics, it requires a stronger brain to play it and, most importantly, enjoy it. That’s why the jet-powered car soccer game and one of the most arcade-based shooter franchises on the market occupy the bottom spots.</p>

<p>In the highest peak player count moment since December 2023, 5.6 million users concurrently fought Doctor Doom in the latest Fortnite live event. It was the grand finale of the Marvel-focused season that saw Doctor Doom burst onto the map with an impressive stature, seeking to do battle with quite literally <strong>every Fortnite player </strong>on the game.</p>



<p>Per the numbers, a whopping 5.6 million users concurrently fought Doctor Doom, hacking away at a global health pool that took around an hour to deplete.</p>

<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Fortnite’s ongoing success is nothing short of effortless, with Epic Games pumping content into the popular battle royale game that’s lapped up eagerly by hundreds of millions of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>This latest event was a boon, drawing in more than five million players at the same time. They were all focused on taking down Doctor Doom, one of Marvel’s most recognisable bad guys, as he tried to destroy the Fortnite island. After a heroic cutscene that saw Hope open up a chink in Doctor Doom’s armour, millions of players set about taking down the gigantic boss character.</p>



<p>On content and streaming platforms, videos and broadcasts of the event went crazy, which is typical for the Fortnite ecosystem. Those who couldn’t take part were happy enough consuming the event by proxy.</p>



<p>Now, attention turns to whatever is coming for the Halloween season in the Fortnitemares updates. It’s nothing short of impressive that Fortnite still has the legs that it does after all these years at the top, but these events are a testament to the game’s staying power – it’s going nowhere anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Foamstars Is Now Free to Play on PlayStation 4 and 5]]></title>

<p>Foamstars was released back in February to something of a lukewarm reception, and a lot of that was centered around the game boasting a price tag. In a world driven by free-to-play games, a title like Foamstars costing real money was an issue with gamers everywhere, but Square Enix has rectified that misstep.</p>



<p>From now on, Foamstars is officially free to play on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. The previous price tag has been obliterated in the hope of bringing thousands of players onto the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-way-to-go">The Way to Go</h2>



<p>If you’re an old-school gamer, you might not appreciate this trend, but it’s the way the world works. Almost every single game at the top of the charts is free to play and reliant on microtransactions to succeed. From League of Legends to Fortnite, from Warzone to Rocket League, and from PUBG to Counter-Strike, some of the most popular games in the world have adopted this model.</p>



<p>In 2022, PUBG went free to play and broke concurrent player records on Steam. In 2020, Rocket League went free to play and the game became more successful than ever. In the Call of Duty world, free shooters like COD Warzone and COD Mobile garnered hundreds of millions of downloads.</p>



<p>Foamstars is the latest title to go free to play, and that’s certainly not a bad thing. It hasn’t done too well since being released in February 2024, and typically, a free-to-play pivot is an effortless way to boost a game’s audience, even if for a short time.</p>



<p>Square Enix has published Diamond Jam alongside the free-to-play transition, offering players another season packed with new maps, boss battles, and exclusive events. When players enter the fray for the first time, they’ll be doing so hand-in-hand with a fair injection of content that’s being aligned with a premium season pass.</p>



<p>Admittedly, Square Enix is pivoting to do the live service thing the right way – the premium season pass for Foamstars is only $5.99, which isn’t too bad at all.</p>
