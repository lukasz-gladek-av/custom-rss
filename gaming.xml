		<p>Bloober Team popped into the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase to reveal that their upcoming sci-fi horror game Cronos: The New Dawn will be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, right alongside PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. And it’s coming out soon, with release now confirmed for 5th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 7.31.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/91BaLCOQa24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn’s takes place in a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people.</p>
<p>Bloober Team have really ramped up the trailers and reveals lately, posting a good 35-minute gameplay reveal alongside previews, just yesterday!</p>

		<p>Chillin by the Fire has been revealed for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, a new social experience that’s all about going camping, stoking your fire and hanging out with the faces of your friends.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chillin' by the Fire – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 7.31.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKrZUZCDRaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’ll have to construct your fire properly, chopping up wood and building a stack to set alight, and then ensuring that you add logs in a way that adds fuel, but still allows oxygen to circulate and build a roaring flame. Make sure you’re not adding wet logs, as well, and you can master getting a fire going in both rainy and snowy conditions.</p>
<p>Since you’ll need a little patience, you’ll be able to roast marshmallows and set off fireworks, but the real time sink will be playing with friends, who can appear as giant floating head bubbles, making use of the Switch 2 camera.</p>

		<p>Nintendo and Koei Tecmo have revealed that Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, the musou spin-off prequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> this winter – no, they’re still not revealing the release date.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment – A call to arms (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/03rjAKsUbNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will follow the narrative of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which saw Zelda transported back in time to the distant past and the formation of Hyrule and the Imprisoning War.</p>
<p>The new trailer showcases plenty of the Musou action, with some team up powers while cutting through hordes of enemies, and more. It also ended with an intriguing teaser of a humanoid construct coming to life.</p>
<p>The last game in this spin-off series, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, told a prequel story to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, depicting the grand battle to try (and fail) to save Hyrule from the rising evil forces. When the main Zelda series has always been about delving into dungeons and defeating bosses one-by-one, it’s a great change of pace to see the huge wars between the massed forces of good and evil.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/18/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/">our review of that last game</a>, we said, “Age of Calamity is, for all intents and purposes, a prequel to Breath of the Wild. It might be a spin-off in a separate genre, but it’s clearly a labour of love, and the result is a thoroughly enjoyable romp through one of the most interesting periods of Hyrule. If the first game was a love letter to the Zelda series, this not only improves on this concept in every way, but stands as one of the best Zelda games, period.”</p>

<p>Kiwami 1 also getting a Switch 2 release</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Kazuma Kiryu's story will continue on Switch 2 later this year as <strong>Yakuza Kiwami 2</strong> releases on 13th November 2025.</p>
<p>Continuing the story on from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yakuza_kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> — a remake of the first Yakuza game that received a Switch port last year — Kiryu will be facing off against the Dragon of Kansai, Ryuji Goda.</p>
<p>Featuring improved combat and set in both Kamurocho and Sotenbori, this seems to be more of a straight port compared to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>, which was a Switch 2 launch title. We're not complaining! Plus, we can play darts, karaoke, and golf.</p>


<p>If you haven't yet played the first Kiwami, you're in luck — Yakuza Kiwami is also coming to Switch 2! We're not sure whether it's getting a free upgrade, a paid upgrade, or a complete rerelease yet, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p><em>Will you be grabbing Yakuza Kiwami 2 on Switch 2? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-launches-september-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-launches-on-september-5-has-a-switch-2-version-too.1258179/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Nintendo Partner Showcase, Bloober Team confirmed that Cronos: The New Dawn will launch on September 5 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The September 5 date circulated earlier today after TrueAchievements <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-leaked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> something about it in their datamining. Since September 5 isn't fall yet, it seems likely the Polish developer was very loosely referring to Fall when it first <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> its release window during Summer Game Fest 2025.</p>



<p>Anyway, the upside is that the game is only a few weeks away from launching. By <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jumping to this page</a>, you can read Kai's hands-on from a recent press event. Here's an excerpt:</p>



<p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn merges a familiar take on the developer’s homeland with the science fiction of time travel and trying to divert a catastrophe from taking place. With an estimated runtime of sixteen hours, this will be longer than your usual survival horror trip. I am curious to see how Bloober Team intends to pace the story and how rescuing these survivors (or not) will affect how the narrative plays out.</em></p>



<p>During that occasion, Kai also <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-qa-we-want-to-cook-this-one-a-bit-differently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> Lead Level Designer Piotr Tylus. Among other things, he inquired about the similarities and differences with the Silent Hill 2 remake:</p>



<p><em>We are sharing our experiences for sure. We provide each other with feedback, so we try to learn our lessons. During development, as you can imagine, there's a lot of iteration going around. You play test and iterate and so on and so on. But we also wanted to make our own thing. I like the analogy from the presentation, that pizzas have different toppings and there is no superior pizza. We want to cook a little bit differently, just to separate ourselves from the other projects we're doing.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo kicked off its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> today with an announcement from Capcom, and the reveal that Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026. It'll also arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Four years after the launch of Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-2-wings-of-ruin-already-shipped-1-million-units/">sold over 1 million units in its first 10 days</a>, and was eventually able to <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240619.html">surpass 2 million units sold</a>, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection continues the story-focused Monster Hunter series with twin Rathalos being born. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Twin Rathalos born in a twist of fate. Their appearance sets the stage for a new tale of Riders and Rathalos to unfold,"</em> reads the video's description. "<em>Become a Rider, bond with monsters, and explore the vibrant world of Monster Hunter in this next evolution of the Monster Hunter Stories series."</em></p>



<p>A press release for Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection goes further to explain that the game centers on "<em>two nations on the path of ruin</em>," and that the emergence of two Rathalos brings a sense of despair instead of hope, as both monsters have the strength to cause even more destruction while two nations are at war.</p>



<p>Players will play as the heir to Azuria, who is the sole Rathalos rider and sets out on a journey to uncover a phenomena that threatens the whole world. </p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-is-capcoms-best-selling-title-in-q1-fy2026-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-have-dropped-significantly-since-launch/">Devil May Cry 5 </a>has been Capcom's strongest-selling game for its first quarter of FY2026, you'd be mistaken to put out Monster Hunter Wilds, which had an incredibly strong launch and in the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjuoxk57s2j">US alone</a> has been the best-selling game of 2025 so far. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter has been one of Capcom's strongest series in its portfolio, so it's not surprising that the company wanted to have another Monster Hunter game lined up for next year after Wilds kicked off 2025. Hopefully, we'll have more information on a specific release date soon.</p>

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia is releasing a new GeForce Game Ready Driver today that expands support for Windows 10 devices, alongside some games and G-Sync displays. Windows 10 Game Ready Driver support will now be available for GeForce RTX GPUs until October 2026, a year beyond when Microsoft is planning to stop supporting the operating system <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22533018/microsoft-windows-10-end-support-date">on October 14th, 2025</a>.</p><p>The expanded support from Nvidia will ensure that users will continue receiving the latest zero-day optimisations for new games and apps, giving them some wriggle room before updating to a new OS. Windows 10 is still a hugely popular OS in spite of now<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715039/microsoft-windows-10-birthday-10-years-old"> being a decade old</a>, and Microsoft has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336586/microsoft-windows-10-upgrade-year-of-the-windows-11-pc-refresh-ces-2025">struggled to shift consumers</a> to Windows 11 ahead of its predecessor’s retirement date. The number of Windows 11 users only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/699161/microsoft-windows-11-usage-milestone-windows-10">surpassed Windows 10 earlier this month</a>, now holding 52 percent of the Windows market, compared to 44.59 percent for Windows 10.</p><p>Older Nvidia GPUs are getting a lifeline, too. After a final Game Ready Driver release in October 2025, Nvidia says that Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta-based GeForce cards will receive quarterly security updates until October 2028, bringing lifetime support up to 11 years. It’s worth noting, however, that support updates for Nvidia’s CUDA architecture will be dropped for these cards in the next CUDA Toolkit update.</p><p>The latest Game Ready driver update will also expand support to include 62 new monitor displays that are compatible with Nvidia’s G-Sync variable refresh rate tech, and improves performance in <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> when the latter is released on August 8th. You can download this Game Ready Driver update by <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fmafia-the-old-country-geforce-game-ready-drive%2F" rel="sponsored">heading over to Nvidia’s website</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/716607/nvidia-geforce-game-ready-driver-window-10]]></content:encoded>

That includes single-player story campaigns, online battles, and the scenario creator mode where fans cook up their own wild battles for one another to play. I’m still curious to see how it runs on the hardware considering some of the framerate and graphical issues that exist even on PS5 and Xbox Series X. </p><p>While <em>Sparking Zero</em> was one of last year’s bestselling games, fan energy around the game has cooled in recent months <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1k1cb7c/if_this_is_the_real_dlc_then_i_really_dont_see/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1k1cb7c/if_this_is_the_real_dlc_then_i_really_dont_see/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as they wait on delayed DLC</a></span> and grapple with the ongoing shortcomings in the base game, including a somewhat shallow and frustrating branching episode battle mode. Plus, despite the gargantuan roster, there are still plenty of fan favorite characters and transformations that haven’t yet made it into<em> Sparking Zero</em>, if they ever will.</p><p>Even so, it’ll be nice to finally have the game on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid system and, perhaps even more importantly, a fresh influx of new and non-jaded players into the online battle mode. A lack of balance has led ranked play to stagnate, but having more players in casual quick matches who just want to have fun and mess around with all of <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s myriad matchups will be great. Even better would be seeing the game get some features unique to Switch 2, like local wireless GameShare with other nearby Switches. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-switch-2-release-date-trailer-1851787412]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo's first post-Switch-2-launch Direct is here, and its first Partner Direct for the platform. Kicking things off, Capcom revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection/" data-ref-id="5000-688781">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, the latest in a spin-off series that started life on the Nintendo 3DS. It looks like you once again take on the role of a rider as opposed to hunter, with you being the sole Rathalos rider in this game's world Azuria. While it was all in-game footage, no actual gameplay was shown off, but it is slated for release in 2026.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxR3M-FwlWU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SxR3M-FwlWU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to a press release, this threequel follows the "story of two nations on the path to ruin." That consists of the aforementioned Azuria, and Vermeil. A recently discovered egg, the one seen in the trailer, offers up some hope amongst the conflict, only for twin Rathalos to hatch from it with the same mark as the twin Skyscale Rathalos, "portents of destruction that hearken back to a civil war waged 200 years ago."</p><p>The rider you play as is the heir to Azuria, protecting monsters and people across the land, when a "life-changing event" forces them to set out towards "the forbidden land beyond the northern Meridian." They are then joined by Eleanor, princess of the rival nation Vermeil, driven by her concern over her sister the queen of Vermeil's true intentions.</p><p>Capcom also confirmed post-Direct that this won't be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, as it's also coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.</p><p>For more on today's showcase, make sure to check-up our roundup of all the biggest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/" data-ref-id="2900-6828">Nintendo Direct announcements</a>.</p>

<p>The game will be arriving this autumn, on 4th September. While we knew Star Wars Outlaws was set for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">a release on Switch 2 already</a>, until today we didn't know when.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is already available to play via Ubisoft+ Premium, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Amazon Luna and PC via Ubisoft Connect, the Epic Games Store, and Steam. </p>

<p>We awarded Star Wars Outlaws two out of five stars on its initial release.</p>
<p>"It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>. </p>
<p>"It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Ubisoft hinted that another of its games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> - may also get a Switch 2 release. During the company's latest quarterly earnings call, CEO Yves Guillemot commented that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">Assassin's Creed Shadows has "some new versions" coming, which will be available "on other machines"</a>.</p>
<p>Given that Shadows is already available on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, that only really leaves Nintendo's hardware under that 'other machines' banner, unless the studio exec was referring to previous generation consoles or mobile.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-lands-september-switch-2-release-date]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It’s time to roll through a brand new Katamari game, as Once Upon a Katamari has been revealed for Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it’s coming out on 24th October.</p>

<p>This will let you roll through historical settings, like Edo Japan, as you build you Katamari ball by glooping up all things in your way. To help you do this you’ll be able to make use of pick ups like magnet and rockets.</p>
<p>And you’ll be able to style it your way with a customisable look and body shape. That will help you stand out in the online multiplayer modes which support up to four players, competing to make the biggest Katamari possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver (version 580.88) for its GeForce graphics cards. It's optimized for the upcoming game Mafia: The Old Country, due to launch on August 8, as well as the highly acclaimed JRPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-1-4-0-patch-is-now-live-introducing-nvidia-dlss-and-intel-xess-frame-generation-support-visual-polish-across/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> yesterday, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has introduced NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation with update 1.4. NVIDIA has confirmed though that this actually extends to DLSS Multi Frame Generation, allowing owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs to run the game at even higher frame rates. </p>



<p>A recent update also added DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA support to the popular open world zombie survival game 7 Days to Die. Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma supports DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation in the game, with the option to activate DLSS Multi Frame Generation via the NVIDIA app override feature.</p>



<p>Today marks the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/surgent-studios-dead-take-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Take</a>, a first-person psychological horror game crafted by Surgent Studios, the developer behind the Metroidvania game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-spiritual-healing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of Kenzera</a>. Featuring a cast of acclaimed actors (Ben Starr, Neil Newbon, Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, and even Remedy's Sam Lake), Dead Take offers players a nightly visit to a not-so-common haunted mansion. The game will include day one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Lastly, here's a video of F1 25 showing off its path tracing glory with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation accelerating frame rates.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NVIDIA also had another announcement to make: after a final Game Ready Driver release in October 2025, GeForce GPUs based on Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures will transition to receiving quarterly security updates for the next three years (through October 2028). The company notes that lifetime support will reach up to 11 years, 'well beyond' industry standards. Furthermore, they will extend Windows 10 Game Ready Driver support for all GeForce RTX GPUs to October 2026, a year beyond the operating system's planned end-of-life, to ensure gamers continue to receive the latest day zero optimizations for new games and apps.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, this Game Ready driver (580.88) adds support for 62 new G-SYNC Compatible displays. NVIDIA also fixed several bugs, as noted <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/580.88/580.88-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the driver's changelog</a>:</p>
