		<p>Capcom are certainly doing a good of building hype for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and the latest trailer does just that.&nbsp; Grace Ashcroft and Leon S. Kennedy both feature, along with lots of action, including a return a location you may recognise!</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - 4th Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u2jrHzua0jA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We have had a hands on preview of Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/26/resident-evil-requiem-preview-action-and-horror-in-perfect-harmony/">which you can read here</a> and have also tried out the Switch 2 version, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/05/resident-evil-requiem-and-pragmata-both-show-what-the-switch-2-is-capable-of/">which you can read about here.</a></p>
<p>The ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as Grace Ashcroft who – as RE law dictates – finds herself embroiled in an apocalyptic scenario that has players running a gauntlet of jump scares as they peel back layers of a grander conspiracy. Without the series stalwarts at its heart, we’re getting back to much more horror than action of some entries.</p>
<p>As was eventually the case for Resident Evil Village, Requiem will feature both first person and third person gameplay from the off, looking to make the most of the RE Engine’s latest iteration.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem is launching on 27th February 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

		<p>Sony’s State of Play has kicked off with a brand new game reveal.&nbsp;Kena: Scars of Kosmora is a sequel to 2021’s Kena: Bridge of Spirits and it is being by developed by the same team, Emberlab.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kena: Scars of Kosmora - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12EQpTwn4lY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As with all sequels we are promised a bigger and better game than it’s predecessor.</p>
<p><em>“Kena: Scars of Kosmora expands the action, adventure &amp; combat of its award-winning predecessor as the player traverses a vibrant island filled with buried secrets, wandering spirits, epic bosses, and distinct cultures.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Kena, now an accomplished Spirit Guide, travels to the mysterious island of Kosmora seeking a cure for her affliction and to reconnect with a friend from her past. There, she is confronted by a powerful corruption that fractures her staff. Needing it to survive, Kena must accept Kosmora’s forgotten and dangerous form of Spirit Guiding that manipulates the elements. On her journey, Kena discovers and nurtures memorable spirit companions – whose powers she will harness to solve puzzles and defeat enemies using new elemental abilities.”</em></p>

<p>Kena: Scars of Kosmora is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in 2026.</p>
<p>We gave Kena: Bridge of Spirits <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/24/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review-ps5-ps4-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10 in our review</a>. “Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a great palette cleanser, not just in terms of tone but the way it’s carefully designed. Well-paced and beautiful to behold with plenty to see and do, Ember Lab has well and truly captured the spirit of the 3D platformers many of us grew up adoring,” said Jim.</p>

			<p>As we predicted when <strong>Sony</strong> announced the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-announced/"><strong>State of Play</strong>,</a> one of the <strong>PlayStation Studios</strong> reveals for tonight's showcase was the gameplay and release date reveal for <strong>Ghost of Yotei Legends</strong>, after it was initially announced during <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/">Gamescom 2025</a>.</strong> Just like <strong>Ghost of Tsushima Legends</strong>, this new co-op multiplayer mode will be available as free DLC for players who already own Ghost of Yotei, and it'll arrive on <strong>March 10, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Showcased with gameplay captured on a <strong>PS5 Pro</strong>, the new trailer showed a bit of the kinds of missions you'll get to play in Ghost of Yotei Legends, which are Survival, Story, and Raid. You're back as playing through one of four classes: a Samurai, an Archer, a Mercenary, or a Shinobi.</p>



<p>The Survival mode will see you team up with three other players to take down waves of enemies while fighting for territory control. The Story will see you complete a series of 12 missions, each of which ending with a boss fight against a twisted version of one of the Yotei Six: <strong>the Spider, the Oni, the Kitsune,</strong> and <strong>the Snake.</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>The fan response to Legends was one of the most rewarding parts of launching Ghost of Tsushima, and we’re so excited to see the mode return for Ghost of Yōtei; we can’t for you all to dive in</em>," added Sucker Punch's senior communications manager, <strong>Andrew Goldfarb</strong>, in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/ghost-of-yotei-legends-comes-to-ps5-on-march-10/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that went live shortly after the trailer.</p>

<p>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition drops digitally tomorrow on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>In 1995, Rayman launched on the original Sony PlayStation, and more than three decades later, the original game is returning to PlayStation. During the Sony PlayStation State of Play presentation, it was announced that a special 30th Anniversary Edition of Rayman will launch digitally on February 13, just one day away from this writing. Physical editions will be available later in the year.</p>



<p>This will be a five-game collection, featuring five versions of the original game. The Nintendo Game Boy version was shown. The game was also originally released on PC, Sega Saturn, and the Atari Jaguar. There will also be a long-lost playable prototype and an interactive documentary featuring interviews and more.</p>

<p>Tom Henderson of Insider Gaming recently reported that Ubisoft is developing two new Rayman projects. </p>



<p>One of these projects, codenamed “Steamboat,” is thought to be a remake of Rayman Legends. This project was believed to be the one under the codename “Iceman.”</p>







<p>The game was previously rated in Australia as well. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-rated-in-australia-for-ps5-and-switch/" id="171818">here</a>.</p>

<p>Beast of Reincarnation, the highly anticipated post-apocalyptic Soulslike coming from Game Freak, has received a release date during the State of Play showcase. The game, which is a far cry from Game Freak’s Pokémon days, takes players and plunges them into a ruined Japan thousands of years in the future.</p>



<p>It has already been compared to games like Sekiro, Stellar Blade, and Elden Ring, but it has a focus on nature, mythical creatures, and an ever-changing, evolving world.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-beast-of-reincarnation-coming-out">When is Beast of Reincarnation Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Thanks to the new State of Play showcase broadcast on February 12, we know that Beast of Reincarnation is coming on August 4, 2026. The game had carried a 2026 release window since being revealed in 2025, but now we’ve got a much firmer date locked in.</p>



<p>While it was PlayStation that uncovered the release date, it was confirmed a short while ago that Beast of Reincarnation will be playable on Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer that was shared during State of Play to announce the game’s release date:</p>

<p>In Beast of Reincarnation, you assume control of Emma, a warrior infected with the same blight that has brought down the planet, but she alone can change the course of what’s unravelling to save humanity and its fragments. She’s joined by Koo, a powerful canine companion with his own affliction.</p>



<p>As you explore Beast of Reincarnation, you’ll uncover a sprawling world fraught with dangers, but you’ll have the ability to shape <br>Emma and Koo through RPG mechanics and varied approaches.</p>

It not only brings the game to PlayStation 5, but it also adds DLC characters to the main roster and teases the addition of more playable fighters and costumes in future updates. Additionally, a free-to-play version of the game will be available at launch, though it's unclear how that would differ from the paid version. You'll be able to play either version on June 25, when Last Round launches.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dxB5NcPrN4c"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dxB5NcPrN4c" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>After series producer Yosuke Hayashi introduced Last Round, he threw in a teaser for another game: Dead or Alive is getting another entry. While it might be called Dead or Alive 7, it's currently just referred to as "Dead or Alive New Project." The brief teaser also calls attention to the fact that 2026 marks the Dead or Alive Series' 30th anniversary, so the pair of projects is a part of developer Team Ninja's celebration of that milestone.</p><p>For more Dead or Alive, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/dead-or-alive-6/a-low-blow">check out our review of the sixth game</a>.

Titled Kena: Scars of Kosmora, the adventure sees an older Kena travel to a new land, and it's coming this year.</p><p>In Scars of Kosmora Kena, now older and more famous, travels to a mysterious new island in search of a cure for an affliction and to reconnect with a long-lost friend. &nbsp;Unfortunately, a powerful corruption fractures her staff, so she must master a new and forgotten form of Spirit Guiding that allows her to command the elements.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12EQpTwn4lY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12EQpTwn4lY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Most interestingly, the trailer does not show any of her little friends, the Rot, that accompanied her in the first game. Instead, she joined by new animal companions such as a small, magical fox, and we even see her riding a deer-like fox in an open world. Developer Ember Lab promises deeper, more dynamic combat as the action still sees Kena using her staff to unleash combo attacks and parry incoming offense. She also uses it to conjure giant green crystals to drop on foes or transform the staff into a heavier, claymore-like weapon.&nbsp;</p><p>Kena: Scars of Kosmora is coming later this year for PlayStation 5 and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/kena-scars-of-kosmora-guides-players-to-a-new-adventure-this-year]]></content:encoded>

We see the four-player party in the trailer fight various mob enemies in an effort to reach the demonic Yōtei Six in all kinds of locales (in different seasons, too).&nbsp;</p><p>Players will choose between four classes, which haven't yet been announced, and utilize different skills, weapons, and more to take down bosses.&nbsp;</p><p>Ghost of Yōtei's Legends update launches as a free update to the game on March 10.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/ghost-of-yotei/action-and-vengeance-unbounded"><em>Game Informer's </em>Ghost of Yōtei review</a>, and then read about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/16/sucker-punch-productions-co-founder-brian-fleming-is-departing-from-the-studio">Sucker Punch's co-founder Brian Fleming is departing from the studio</a>.

            <p>
Sumptuous 2021 action-adventure Kena: Bridge of Spirits is getting a sequel, despite previous word from its developer suggesting one was unlikely and it's coming to PlayStation 5 and PC later this year.
</p>
<p>
Kena: Scars of Kosmora, as the sequel is titled, sees developer Ember Lab returning to a world in which its titular protagonist is now a "more experienced" Spirit Guide. This time around, Kena is seeking answers to her lifelong affliction, and it's a journey that'll take her to the mysterious island of Kosmora, said to be "full of buried secrets from a tragic past".

</p><p>
Ember Lab <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/kena-scars-of-kosmora-announced-for-ps5-and-pc-out-2026/">teases</a> that Kena's staff becomes broken as she continues her adventure, forcing her to learn Kosmora's forgotten form of Spirit Guiding, which uses Alchemy to manipulate the power of the elements. As such, players can expect new combat skills, new elements infusions, and assistance from new Spirit Companions. Plus, there'll still be corrupted souls to cleanse. 
</p><p>
Today's news is something of a surprise given Ember Lab's previous suggestion a Kena sequel was unlikely. Back in 2021, studio co-founders Mike and Josh Grier said the team would rather make "another IP with the same style in terms of gameplay and story-driven experience", and shift the world of Kena to film or TV.
</p>
<p>Claerly those plans have changed, however, and Kena: Scars of Kosmora will now be with us later this year.</p>

            <p>
If there is anything that is concretely true about the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> follow-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zero-parades">Zero Parades</a>, it is that it is certainly a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from ZA/UM. Everything else, well, that depends on who you ask, and where they lie in the messiness that has been in and around the studio these past few years, but a ZA/UM game in name it is. And now there are two opportunities for you to form a more direct opinion about Zero Parades, and its quality therewithin.
</p>
<p>
The first, which is the quickest and most easily available option to you for the moment, is a good dash of gameplay, about 20 minutes of it to be precisely imprecise. What this collection of minutes shows off is a slice of the opening section of the game, and to wholesale steal from James (sorry James, you just wrote too good a headline), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zaums-spy-thriller-zero-parades-sure-looks-like-disco-elysium-in-glasses-and-a-moustache">Zero Parades sure does look like Disco Elysium in glasses and a moustache</a>.

<p>
That painterly, flirting with impressionism art style is present, there are internal monologues recited by voices you don't commonly hear in mainstream video games (British), you can wave your mouse around to find a bunch of things to click on that prompt yet more lines of taciturn monologues. It even starts out in a room with a puzzling set of surroundings, with little context to push you in the right direction. A formula is being followed, up to the point you are offered the opportunity to lower a skill point to soothe your anxiety.
</p><p>
Really, there isn't all that much that helps make it clear what is truly different this time around, but I suppose only 20 minutes of the beginning of a game won't do that. In any case, I best mention that second opportunity for you to enact your judgement upon Zero Parades: as part of the upcoming Steam Next Fest, a demo will be available to peruse with a couple of quests to complete, a handful of side stories to explore, and a number of characters to meet.
</p>
<p>
That demo will be available February 23rd through to March 16th, by the way, a healthy amount of time to get any bits of discourse you're interested in posted to Bluesky or ResetEra. You can check it out on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863680/ZERO_PARADES_For_Dead_Spies/">here</a>.

<p>Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is finally receiving a PC port, and it will release on March 19th.</p>



<p>Players have been expecting the PC version of the sequel since its release, especially since the first title’s port arrived within a year. Moreover, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-pc-port-leak-esrb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB rating</a> for the PC port of DS2 was leaked late in the year, further fueling anticipation. Finally, the release date has been revealed, along with a brand-new trailer. </p>

<p>Death Stranding 2 PC’s March 19th release date was revealed during the latest PlayStation State of Play event. It arrived with a brand-new trailer outlining the PC features for the title, including higher framerate caps, support for ultrawide monitors, and DualSense controllers, of course. </p>

<h2 id="h-about-death-stranding-2">About Death Stranding 2</h2>



<p>Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding 2 is a sequel, as the name suggests. In this installment, players follow Sam on a quest to save humanity from extinction in a new region: Australia. The terrain is vastly different, featuring dynamic weather and time cycles, as well as various natural disasters, including earthquakes, sandstorms, forest fires, and Timefall.</p>



<p>The combat gameplay has been enhanced with new weapons and other equipment. Players now have the option to use stealth and long-range attacks or engage directly in close combat with mech soldiers, unseen BTs, and new bosses. Additionally, the social aspect from the previous title has been improved, making players feel deeply connected to the world of Death Stranding 2. Every action taken in-game influences how players interact with their environments and vice versa.</p>

<p>Edmund McMillen is one of the creators behind the new cat-breeding roguelike game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mewgenics/" id="170919">Mewgenics</a>. The game has been a tremendous success in its first few days. Now, McMillen is addressing an issue affecting some players, some problematic personalities that have voiced some of the in-game cats.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-on-assembling-mewgenics-meow-cameo-list-the-inclusion-of-people-with-clashing-ideologies-felt-appropriate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">McMillen, in a statement to Rock Paper Shotgun, </a>explained that in some cases, the names included were listed years ago, such as Ethan and Hila Klein from h3h3, who have recently received criticism for their views on the conflict between Israel and Palestine.</p>



<p>McMillen noted that he wanted the game to feature iconic voices from most of his time online. He also argued that “The inclusion of Ethan and Hila was counterbalanced by iDubbbz and Anisa.” iDubbbz is another long-time internet personality who was once friendly with h3h3 but has since called them out for their views.</p>







<h2 id="h-mcmillen-says-inclusion-of-those-with-differing-ideologies-felt-appropriate-for-mewgenics">McMillen Says Inclusion of Those With Differing Ideologies Felt Appropriate for Mewgenics</h2>



<p>Edmund McMillen told Rock Paper Shotgun that he contacted both parties to let them know about the other’s inclusion and said everyone was “very adult about it.”</p>



<p>Furthermore, he believes it was appropriate to have people with clashing ideologies in the game, saying that if the game simply included people with whom he shared the same opinions, he’d probably be the only one meowing in the game.</p>



<p>“I understand we live in a time where a meow from someone who has different beliefs as you is scary and frustrating, confusing and controversial…” McMillen continued, “But it felt interesting, so I decided to explore it.”</p>







<p>Still, the game has received tremendous critical acclaim, and it’s currently sitting at 89 on Metacritic with an overall user score of 8.1</p>

Now, he's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sDOFSiIN4c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made another go at it</a>, using the gigantic grape press in the winery that is Hitman 3's final map.

Well, actually the edit seems to be of two streams – in the first, he drags the NPCs one-by-one to smash them after knocking each one out with a baseball bat. That takes over 15 hours, according to the timer at the top of the stream. Then, the video cuts to what looks to be another stream, started at 5 hours and 49 minutes in, after he had dragged each body to the area just in front of the press, ready to be crushed by Condren's cruel hitman.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/hitman-winery-1770924037316.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The wine is almost ready.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For over an hour after that, he hauls each body beneath the press, framerate tanking every time the pile of bodies enters the camera's view. A few game crashes later, and at about 7 hours and 13 minutes (again, according to the timer at the top of the screen), he's done it. Elated and sounding a little like a cartoon despot, he hits the grape presser's start button and smashes... most, but not all, of the NPCs. A second run of the press takes care of the last few. He then finds another body elsewhere in the winery that he'd either missed or that had been glitchily hucked there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So Condren didn't quite meet his mad goal of simultaneously making wine out of all of the level's NPCs  like some deranged, murderous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUxjOS3g6Uc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucille Ball</a>, but he got close enough for blues. He certainly seems pleased at the end when he adds, “And a shout-out to the population of Mendoza, Argentina. We love you guys. And you make a great beverage.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wes is a freelance writer (Freelance Wes, they call him) who has covered technology, gaming, and entertainment steadily since 2020 at Gizmodo, Tom's Hardware, Hardcore Gamer, and most recently, The Verge.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [5,108 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Ember Lab [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ember-lab">Ember Lab</a> have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/kena-scars-of-kosmora-announced-for-ps5-and-pc-out-2026/" target="_blank">announced</a> <em><a title="Games > Kena: Scars of Kosmora" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/kena-scars-of-kosmora">Kena: Scars of Kosmora</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,390 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,478 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (Steam, <a title="Companies > Epic Games [355 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/epic-games">Epic Games</a> Store). It will launch in 2026. <span id="more-1025979"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Ember Lab:</p><blockquote><p>After releasing <em><a title="Games > Kena: Bridge of Spirits [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/kena-bridge-of-spirits">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a></em>, we took some time to figure out what we wanted to create next. We explored ideas that could capture the heart of what made <em>Kena</em> special while building on everything we’d learned along the way. When we began thinking about returning to her world, we were drawn to the idea of Kena as a more experienced Spirit Guide who could use her skills to help the living, not just those who had passed on.</p><p>In <em>Kena: Scars of Kosmora</em>, Kena is older and renowned as a Spirit Guide. In hopes of finding answers to the affliction she has endured all her life, Kena travels to the mysterious island of Kosmora. Home to distinct cultures and regions, Kosmora is full of buried secrets from a tragic past.</p><p>On Kosmora, Kena is confronted by a powerful spirit that fractures her staff. A spirit guide’s staff is their identity – their tool to help and commune with spirits. Kena’s staff was also keeping her alive. To survive, Kena must accept Kosmora’s forgotten form of Spirit Guiding which uses Alchemy to manipulate the power of the elements.</p><p><a title="Companies > Elementa [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/happy-elements/elementa">Elementa</a>l spirit companions are a big part of this world. They are charming buddies that travel with you, grow over time, and unlock new powers as your bond deepens. Each spirit is tied to a different element and connected to other spirits that exist throughout the world. We revealed one Spirit so far, but we have only scratched the surface. There’s much more we are saving for later!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Don’t worry though, there will still be plenty of corrupted souls to cleanse. We want players to feel Kena has grown in skill and capability. We’ve added new elemental gameplay to bring strategy and depth when facing the threats of Kosmora. These new combat skills, elemental infusions and use of your Spirit Companions will be key to overcoming challenging encounters and epic boss fights.</p><p>While we’d love to talk to you more about the story you’re going to experience, we’re very conscious of anything remotely spoiler-esque. We’ve put a ton of effort into <a title="Genres > Crafting [49 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> the narrative for Scars of Kosmora, and the team is focused on creating an emotional and heartfelt <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,873 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> for returning players of <em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em> and those new to Kena’s world.</p><p>We hope you enjoyed what you saw in the trailer. Partnering with PlayStation Studios has empowered us to craft an even larger world – one built with an emphasis on tightly designed regions, deliberate progression, and a strong sense of adventure. We’re super excited to share more in the future and can’t wait for you to get your hands on what we’ve been crafting. The reception for Bridge of Spirits was humbling, and we hope to deliver on what everyone loved about the first game and more. </p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Kena: Scars of Kosmora - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12EQpTwn4lY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/kena-scars-of-kosmora-announced-for-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Laid Off Highguard Tech Artist Reflects on Game’s Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/laid-off-highguard-tech-artist-reflects-on-games-launch/</link>
            <guid>1434130</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Josh Sobel, a tech artist who worked on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394">Highguard</a>, is reflecting on the highs and lows of the game’s development and launch in the wake of mass layoffs at Wildlight Entertainment.</p>



<p>Josh Sobel was one of the individuals laid off by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wildlight-entertainment/" id="3393">Wildlight </a>on February 11. After the announcement, he shared a lengthy post on Twitter reflecting on his experience working on the game. He mentioned that he had personally worked on the project for two and a half years.</p>







<p>His Twitter statement says that before the game’s reveal at the Game Awards in 2025, the team was receiving positive feedback. In cases of negative feedback, it was always constructive criticism. After the trailer dropped, Sobel says it was “downhill from there.”</p>



<p>“Even if Highguard had a rocky launch, our independent, self-published, dev-led studio full of passionate people just trying to make a fun game, with zero AI, and zero corporate oversight…deserved better than this.” </p>



<p>He then wished the remaining staff members luck and said he hopes the game can continue because he still believes in the project.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-wildlight-previously-stated-a-core-team-will-continue-to-work-on-highguard">Wildlight Previously Stated A Core Team Will Continue to Work on Highguard</h2>



<p>Confirming the news of layoffs in a social media post on February 11, Wildlight stated that a core group of developers would remain on staff to continue “innovating and supporting the game.” This came after a senior designer revealed on LinkedIn that he had been let go, along with most of the team.</p>







<p>Unfortunately, Layoffs continue to be a trend in the gaming space. Riot Games recently issued a statement very similar to theirs about their decision to downsize the team working on 2XKO. Read that full statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">here</a>.</p>
