However, <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1920181314092765494">developer Rockstar Games says </a>that isn’t actually the case, and that the trailer was “comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes.” The fact that it’s hard to discern between the two in the trailer is an impressive achievement for the game, though obviously we’ll have to reserve judgement until we are able to actually play it.</p><p>Here, you can judge for yourself:</p><p>The studio also confirmed that the trailer was “captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5,” something that was noted in the trailer’s fine print.

Originally slated to launch this fall, the game is now due to release on May 26th, 2026.

                <p>One of the big changes coming to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> is the integration of audio and video chats throughout the console experience with a feature called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-c-button-is-all-about-video-and-voice-chat/1100-6530539/" data-ref-id="1100-6530539">GameChat</a>. However, this new feature has required Nintendo to change its privacy policy: The company has disclosed that it may record Switch 2 audio and video chat sessions held between players.</p><p>In a recent update to its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/privacy-policy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy policy</a>, Nintendo explained, "We may collect, monitor and record audio and video of your chat sessions with other users to provide a safe and secure environment for certain of our services." This data collection is done with the player's consent--which, if other consoles are anything to go by, could take the form of a clause in the terms of use for the chat functionality or an opt-in screen. Further, Nintendo specifically states that this recording process is done to "enforce our terms," which could include both safety policies and legal requirements.</p>

      </div>
<p>Recording video and audio chats is not unique to Nintendo, and in fact this brings the company's approach in line with Xbox and PlayStation. Microsoft, for instance, states that it collects data from Xbox chat sessions, at least in part to power <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-live-will-let-you-share-voice-chat-clips-with-microsoft-to-fight-toxic-players/1100-6515906/" data-ref-id="1100-6515906">Xbox's voice chat reporting functionality</a> for safety enforcement. PlayStation party sessions and voice chat are also recorded to some extent for safety and security.</p><p>As voice and video chat functions have become more widespread and integral parts of gaming ecosystems, companies have rolled out increasingly sophisticated capabilities for recording, analyzing, and acting on the data that these produce. While it is often difficult to know the full extent of what companies are using this data for, much of it has to do with ensuring compliance with privacy and safety laws and enforcing community standards. Because of the legal ramifications of violations of some of these laws, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modern-warfare-3-uses-ai-to-listen-to-voice-chat-and-take-action-against-toxic-people/1100-6517338/" data-ref-id="1100-6517338">some specialist companies have emerged</a> to provide services in the voice and video chat safety space.</p><p>Right now, it is unclear exactly how Nintendo intends on using recordings for safety enforcement, and the company has not detailed what types of systems it will employ. We have reached out to Nintendo for comment and will update this story with any additional detail if we hear back.

The Soulslike RPG is set in Ming dynasty China--earning it comparisons to Black Myth: Wukong--and follows a pirate warrior as she attempts to unravel her past after suffering a bout of amnesia. Early footage reveals a stylish, fast-paced adventure, and reserving a copy in advance will unlock a few additional goodies. If you're interested in the upcoming action RPG, preorders are available now, including a physical Day 1 Edition and a digital Deluxe Edition, both of which include some extra DLC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Rockstar surprise-dropped a new trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, along with a bunch of information about the game's story and its characters, many were quick to say that it looked great, but wondered what it would actually look like outside of a trailer that players assumed wasn't actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Well, turns out it was actual gameplay, and it was all captured on a PlayStation 5 console. Not a PlayStation 5 Pro, a PlayStation 5. Presumably, if it was captured on a PS5 Pro, Rockstar would have made the distinction. Rockstar confirmed in a post on <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1920181314092765494">X</a> that the trailer was a mix of in-game cutscenes and gameplay, all drawn from a PS5.</p>
<p>"<em>Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2 was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5</em>," the post reads, "<em>comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes</em>."</p>
<p>It is incredible to know that everything we saw earlier this week came from a PS5, and a credit to the work Rockstar has put in to up the ante for the game players have been waiting over a decade for. Players who didn't fork over hundreds to upgrade to a PS5 Pro (like me) are rejoicing right now, knowing that we're all in for an incredible-looking journey come May 26, 2026.</p>
<p>And if you already bought a PS5 Pro, now you can salivate thinking about how it'll look this good and potentially run at a smoother, higher framerate than what's possible on PS5 and Xbox Series X. Anyone who was on the fence about buying one can now do so with full confidence that they'll be in for an absolutely stunning experience when GTA VI launches.</p>
<p>If you want to continue salivating over how good Grand Theft Auto VI looks, there are already numerous <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-early-comparison-massive-jump/">videos analyzing everything about the trailer</a>, showcasing just how much Rockstar has improved the look of everything in GTA VI compared to GTA V.</p>
<p>Shortly after Rockstar posted this confirmation to quell everyone's doubts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zVIy_La7nk&amp;t=35s">Digital Foundry</a> published its analysis video about the trailer. They spotted a few bits of aliasing and how certain details don't look as good as they could, like hair effects, for example. But overall, the DF experts are just as happy as everyone else to see how amazing it looks, even with all the caveats they present and the fact that analyzing a trailer is still no replacement for the analysis they can do when they have the game in hand.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2 Tech Breakdown - Incredible Realism, Impressive RT, Astonishing Detail" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zVIy_La7nk?start=35&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>They do, however, stipulate that it will likely only have a 30fps mode on launch. It's possible that PS5 Pro users get a 60fps mode, but it's more reasonable to expect a 30fps mode. Not just because of all the tech Rockstar is using to make GTA VI look this good means that a 60fps framerate just isn't possible on consoles, but because Rockstar has a history of releasing its major games with no 60fps mode at launch.</p>
<p>And on the topic of what's not possible with GTA VI, they also speculate that this game is far too big for the Nintendo Switch 2, and that it won't be able to run on handheld PCs, at least in any state that you'd want to play it in.</p>
<p>But who knows, maybe Rockstar is taking the time afforded by the delay to optimize GTA VI as much as possible, and get a Nintendo Switch 2 version, and/or a 60fps mode ready, if not for launch, for sometime in 2026.</p>

It explains, for instance, that the reason behind Mobius's implementation of a staggered release of minor patches across platforms is because of the resources its next project requires. As the patch notes state, "This is no shade to our QA testers, we’re just trying to be extra risk averse and conservative with the resources we put toward Outer Wilds since our new game is our priority!"</p>

<p>Mobius also reminded fans that no more significant changes are coming for its past title. "As mentioned before, there are no more major updates planned for Outer Wilds or Echoes of the Eye because we are hard at work on our next game," the studio wrote. "There may be smaller updates like this from time to time, but no guarantees."</p><p>There's no hint of when we might actually learn what this secretive new project, but that won't stop fans from speculating about what type of game Mobius might attempt next. Outer Wilds was critically acclaimed when it came out back in 2019--and its mix of cartoony space-western aesthetics, complex puzzles, and catchy space banjo were particularly notable. Will we see the return of an interplanetary bluegrass band? Will Mobius stick with the space theme or use a different setting?</p><p>Mobius Digital is most well-known for Outer Wilds, but it actually worked on a couple of other projects in the past. As it lists on its <a href="https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>, Mobius created two smaller-scale mobile titles, Terra Chroma and Beacon 38. If you squint hard enough at screenshots and descriptions of Beacon 38, you might be able to see some common aesthetic or thematic threads that ended up in Outer Wilds. Mobius worked on these titles long enough ago that it's not trivial to play them now; for example, fans have had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/outerwilds/comments/donchi/looking_for_beacon_38_the_other_mobius_digital/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to collaborate on finding a playable version of Beacon 38</a>.</p><p>What do you hope to see from a follow-up to Outer Wilds?

It’s been a specific highlight for those discussing Sandfall’s debut title on social media, and now, that praise is being reflected across Billboard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head to the Billboard website and you’ll find that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 currently sits atop both the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/classical-albums/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Classical Albums</u></a> and <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/classical-crossover-albums/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Classical Crossover Albums</u></a> charts. Sandfall <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1920089990157021371" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also revealed</a> that the soundtrack has managed to make a mark at 13 on the Official Soundtrack Album chart and 31 on the Official Album Download chart. It means players are gravitating to more than just the experience’s story and gameplay as its dreamlike tunes back the entire adventure.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soundtrack is comprised of more than 150 individual tracks, with many boasting hundreds of thousands of streams on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5epJvt9jHbYI1j6WqCppGc?si=oUsD0DkOQNqJi-ERKLpR0Q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Spotify</u></a>.

Cheating is more prevalent on PC (Activision recently confirmed as much, to the point where it said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-console-players-unlikely-to-be-cheating-theyre-just-killing-you-with-an-intel-advantage-activision-says"><u>if you believe you’ve died unfairly to a console player, it’s much more likely that they’ve used ‘intel advantage’ than cheats</u></a>). So, some console players head straight into Call of Duty’s settings to turn off crossplay across the board, just to take the potential for PC cheaters ruining their day out of the equation. With the launch of Season 3, Activision even added new console-only crossplay options for regular multiplayer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-pc-players-who-do-not-cheat-are-being-penalized-by-new-console-only-crossplay-option-for-regular-multiplayer">although PC players who do not cheat said they were being unfairly punished</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision, as IGN has reported, has spent millions of dollars in the battle against Call of Duty cheat makers, cheat sellers, and cheat users, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>. In March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prolific-call-of-duty-cheat-developer-insists-its-shutting-down-but-players-are-skeptical"><u>Phantom Overlay announced it was shutting down</u></a>, with fans reacting in disbelief that such a prominent Call of Duty cheat provider could fall by the wayside. Also in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-call-of-duty-cheat-providers-shut-down-in-apparent-sweep-and-clear-operation-ahead-of-verdansks-return-to-warzone"><u>IGN reported on four cheat providers that were shut down</u></a> ahead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-release-date-for-return-of-original-verdansk-map-to-call-of-duty-warzone"><u>hotly anticipated return of Verdansk to Warzone</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It had been hoped that Warzone's cheating problem would improve following Verdansk’s release, but the honeymoon period has well and truly come to an end, with players reporting that cheaters are back in force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Geegees Cheaters...it is your game now. Enjoy,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1kf0qok/geegees_cheatersit_is_your_game_now_enjoy/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared redditor Patient-Author-2960</a>. “Big congrats to all the cheaters for finally conquering the game again and donkey punching Verdansk. You guys really stuck with it, grinding those walls and aimbots to perfection. It must feel amazing to dominate lobbies without any actual skill. Welcome back.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid this fresh wave of negativity, Activision has published an anti-cheat update from its Ricochet team, recapping what’s gone on with Season 3. Activision failed to address this apparent rise in Warzone cheating, but did outline the work it has been doing to address the problem of cheating generally across Warzone and Black Ops 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our commitment is to keep cheaters out of the game and, for those who make it past our initial systems, identify and remove them as quickly as possible,” Activision said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ricochet Anti-Cheat team is hard at work taking on would-be cheaters throughout the game, including those looking to steal leaderboard glory.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said it had shut down five more cheat makers since its last progress report (this is on top of the 20+ it’s shut down since Black Ops 6 came out last year), and had “disrupted” over 150 cheat sellers in the same period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It said it had protected over 10,000 accounts that had a potential suspicious account link in Season 03 (Activision recently forced players to verify they are in control of an account if someone attempts to link a new PC account to an Activision ID). It’s also added Replay Tech Preview, a new tech that helps examine replays for faster investigation, and added new elements to the Death Widget, making KillCams clearer for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Season 03 update has made a strong impact against cheat makers and resellers,” Activision insisted. “For example, as we announced recently, Ricochet Anti-Cheat quickly detected a cheat provider that came back online after weeks of downtime, resulting in a large-scale ban wave against its customer base, forcing it offline once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve continued to cause chaos in the cheat marketplace and have hit a milestone of disrupting over 150 cheat resellers – shutting them down or rendering their software ineffective. And we’re not slowing down.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🛡️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Warzone</a></p><p>A message from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamRICOCHET?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#TeamRICOCHET</a>:</p><p>Earlier this week, we detected a cheat vendor that was offline was attempting to return.

This, Activision said, is “a reality” for all free-to-play games like Warzone, but it’s targeting new accounts and is now seeing “strong” results. On average from the period between Season 02 through Season 03, new accounts are banned within four matches when they cheat, Activision said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New anti-cheat systems and upgrades are coming throughout Season 03 Reloaded – specifically with Ranked Play online in Call of Duty: Warzone – as well as upcoming seasons, Activision continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our team’s commitment remains the same. While threats continue to exist, we’re focused on strengthening the barriers to make cheating in Call of Duty a fool’s errand, eliminating as many cheaters as possible before they can impact a match, and hunting down and removing any cheating account that makes its way into the game as quickly as possible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Activision said it has issued cease and desist demands to several companies that create and sell third-party hardware used to cheat in Call of Duty games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have already seen compliance from some of the companies we’ve contacted; however, we will continue to pursue other device makers in the market, globally, as well as people that create scripts to manipulate Call of Duty game code,” Activision warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These devices and scripts used to cheat in our games are not welcome. Call of Duty does not endorse the use of these products. Any account that utilizes these devices on PC or console for the purpose of cheating will be permanently banned.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No anti-cheat system can eliminate all threats, but we continue to deliver updates to take the legs out from under cheat makers by banning their users, forcing them offline, and reducing the time to detection for accounts that make it into the game,” Activision concluded. “Today and into the future, the Ricochet Anti-Cheat roadmap continues, with new updates being developed and deployed on a regular basis.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Although Microsoft's blockbuster deal to buy Activision Blizzard was approved in October 2023, the United States government's Federal Trade Commission appealed the decision. Now, a US appeals court has affirmed the deal, bringing about an apparent end to the FTC's attempts to block the buyout.</p><p><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/us-appeals-court-affirms-microsoft-activision-merger" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">As reported by Bloomberg</a>, the 9th Circuit US Court of Appeals <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/05/07/23-15992.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">declared on Wednesday</a> that the trial judge in the case, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, was correct in denying the FTC's attempt to prevent the $75.4 billion deal from going through.</p><p>A chief concern from the FTC pertained to cloud gaming. To satisfy the FTC, Microsoft carved out deals to bring Xbox games to non-Xbox streaming platforms, but the FTC appealed. Now, that appeal has been denied.</p><p>"The panel held that the district court applied the correct legal standards and did not abuse its discretion, or rely on clearly erroneous findings, in holding that the FTC failed to make a sufficient evidentiary showing to establish the requisite likelihood of success on the merits of its claim," the appeals court said. "Thus, the FTC had not raised serious questions regarding whether the proposed merger was likely to substantially lessen competition in the relevant markets."</p><p>Additionally, the appeals panel upheld the district court's decision that the FTC failed to sufficiently show that Microsoft would make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox or release an "inferior" version on PlayStation. The appeals court also concluded that Activision games launching on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>--an Xbox-exclusive subscription service--would not "substantially lessen competition."</p><p>As part of Microsoft's deal to buy Activision Blizzard, the company said it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-signs-10-year-deal-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-platforms/1100-6511660/" data-ref-id="1100-6511660">keep releasing Call of Duty games on rival platforms for at least 10 years</a>. Microsoft's releases on PS5 so far have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">proven to be quite successful. </a></p><p>The FTC's case against Microsoft was driven in part by FTC head Lina Khan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/13-years-later-the-louvre-museums-3ds-audio-guide-service-is-coming-to-an-end<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
13 years after the Louvre announced it was teaming up with Nintendo to create an audio tour of the world-renowned Parisian art museum guests could enjoy using 3DS handhelds, it's been revealed the service is coming to an end this September.
</p>
<p>
The Louvre <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/louvre-replaces-audio-guides-with-5000-3ds">unveiled the partnership in December 2011</a>, explaining it would be introducing 5,000 3DS machines equipped with custom software designed by Nintendo to replace the museum's stock of traditional audio guides.
</p>
<p>
Starting in 2012, visitors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shigeru-miyamoto-demos-3ds-louvre-tour-guide">could roam the museum's halls with a 3DS in hand</a>, listening to audio commentary detailing the artwork they encountered along the way. A more elaborate version, known as Nintendo 3DS Guide: Louvre, was commissioned and introduced the following year, providing an expanded 30 hours of audio, plus new visual material including 3D views and photographs of the museum and its exhibits.

<p>
GPS transmitters installed within the museum enabled guests who'd rented 3DS machines equipped with the software to learn more about nearby artwork based on their current location. Nintendo also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-3ds-louvre-guide-released-on-eshop">released this version on the 3DS eShop</a>, providing purchasers with a way to explore the Louvre from the comfort of their own home. The company even went as far as to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Nintendo-3DS-Guide-Louvre/Nintendo-3DS-Guide-Louvre/1-One-day-the-Louvre/1-One-day-the-Louvre-836504.html">release an Iwata Asks Q&amp;A</a> and air a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WavLP_3ew-A">special Nintendo Direct</a> featuring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> and  Satoru Iwata touring the Louvre and showing the 3DS guide software in action.
</p>
<p>
But now, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-3ds-officially-discontinued">3DS discontinued</a> and Nintendo's focus having long shifted to Switch and its imminent successor, the Louvre has announced the service's impending demise. "The New Nintendo 3DS console audio guides will go out of operation in September 2025," it revealed in a <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/visitor-amenities">message on its website</a>, "to be replaced by a new system." It's unclear if the museum's partnership with Nintendo will continue in a different form - perhaps with Switch or the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> - or if it plans to introduce something completely different.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">arrives in less than a month</a> on 5th June. And if you're wondering, it'll be approximately 16 times lighter than the Mona Lisa.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/the-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-blocked-puzzle-guide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> remastered the original 2014 puzzle classic and its Road to Gehenna expansion with an Unreal Engine 5 upgrade, but it also went further than that. It included a whole new expansion called In the Beginning, which adds another 18 puzzles to solve on the original game and its first DLC release.</p>
<p>Narratively, In the Beginning is a prequel to the events of the first game, but what makes it special is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 out of the 18 puzzles</a> were made in collaboration with members of the community who had been making their own puzzles for the last 11 years.</p>
<p>The result is an expansion that is so tough, the puzzles included with In the Beginning are earning the reputation as being some of the most challenging to solve in the entire series.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to solve the Blocker puzzle in the expansion. If you just want a hint, then all I'll say is to leave the jammer alone. It's already doing everything you need it to do. Keep reading if you want the full solution.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Blocker Puzzle Guide</h2>
<h3>Phase One - Get the second connector</h3>
<p>When you enter the puzzle area and look around, it won't take you long to deduce that you need a second connector to deactivate the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. It's easy to assume that the jammer you see on the right side of the area deactivating a shield between the two spaces is part of the solve. As I said in the hint, you don't need it at all, and you can leave it where it is, keeping the shield in the wall between the two sides of the puzzle area down.</p>
<p>Instead, what you need to do first, is get the hexahedron.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk forward when entering the puzzle area and grab the connector (C1). Connect it to the red laser generator and the red node that sits just behind a fan that will launch you to a platform in the top-right corner of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When the laser has activated the fan, launch yourself onto the elevated platform and grab the hexahedron. Jump back down to the ground.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedron in front of the fan. Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator, the node behind the fan, the blue laser generator, and the blue node on the other side of the puzzle area, behind a wall.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place C1 down on top of the hexahedron. Your laser pattern should look like this.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Step in front of the blue laser generator so that the red laser can connect to the node that will activate the fan.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When it launches into the air, the blue lasers will connect instead of the red, activating the blue node on the far left side of the puzzle area. That node simultaneously turns off the shield blocking the second connector (C2) and turns on a fan that will push it out onto the ground, letting you pick it up.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Fair warning, the hexahedron won't fly for very long with C1 on top of it, so you might have to try this twice, as it's possible for the C2 to get stuck before making it onto the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two - Solve the puzzle</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Gather C1, C2 and the hexahedron together.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator, the red node behind the fan and the red node on the opposite side of the shield blocking the path to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and use the fan to launch yourself, with C2 in hand, to the elevated platform. Connect C2 to the blue laser generator and the blue node to fully deactivate the shield blocking the path to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground, walk over to the tetromino and claim your prize.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-won-the-ftc-appeal-that-still-challenged-its-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's taken nearly two years, but the FTC appeal against Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the Northern District of California's decision to block the Activision Blizzard deal with a preliminary injunction is concluded, and Microsoft has won once again.</p>
<p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/microsoft-wins-ftc-appeal-challenging-69-bln-activision-blizzard-deal-2025-05-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that the three-judge panel of San Francisco's 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/movayzarnva/FTC%20v%20Microsoft%20-%20CA9%20-%2020250507.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled</a> in favor of Microsoft. More specifically, they decreed that the district court had applied the correct legal standards when <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-beats-ftcs-request-for-preliminary-injunction-to-block-activision-blizzard-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it ruled in July 2023</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>First, pertaining to the console market, the panel agreed with the district court that the FTC failed to sufficiently show that Microsoft would foreclose or partially foreclose rivals after the merger either by making the popular game Call of Duty exclusive to its Xbox console or by releasing only an inferior version of the game for Sony’s rival PlayStation. </em></li>
<li><em>The panel next found that as to the library subscription services market, the district court did not abuse its discretion by holding that the FTC had not made an adequate showing that the merger would substantially lessen competition. Because Activision Blizzard had long opposed putting its content on library subscription services, the merger’s effect of making such content available for the first time in the subscription market, even if exclusive to Microsoft, would not substantially lessen competition. </em></li>
<li><em>Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in similarly finding an insufficient likelihood of </em><em>success on the FTC’s claim that the merger would substantially lessen competition in the cloud-streaming market, given that the FTC failed to show that Activision Blizzard content would be available to this market in the absence of the merger.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>That ruling was the definitive step towards Microsoft's finalization of the $68.7 billion acquisition. The whole deal could have fallen apart if the judge ruled in favor of the US Federal Trade Commission. Microsoft would formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> the acquisition's closing on October 13, 2023.</p>
<p>The FTC's fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty exclusive to the Xbox platform turned out to be completely unfounded. In fact, the Xbox and Windows company shifted its strategy toward the opposite side of the spectrum, opting to bring all of its games even to rival consoles such as those made by PlayStation and Nintendo. Just two days ago, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Gears of War: Reloaded will bring the original trilogy of the sci-fi third-person shooter to PlayStation 5 this Summer.</p>
<p>Between that and the fact that all of Microsoft-owned games are now available on cloud services such as NVIDIA GeForce NOW and Boosteroid, there's no doubt that a wider audience is able to play those games following the acquisition.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>This is just a quick write-up, because it's outside office hours, but... Mobius Digital, creators of wondrous virtual orrery and gravitational stageplay <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, are making a new game.</p><!--more-->
<p>The "announcement" takes the form of a throwaway line in an otherwise unremarkable <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/753640/view/521964845255360514?l=english">Outer Wilds update changelog</a>. Here it be:</p>
<blockquote><p>This minor patch is now out on Steam only, but will be brought to all other platforms except Nintendo Switch in late May. If you’re not on Steam, don’t worry, you’re not missing out! This is a minor patch mainly for adding a couple folks to the credits and fixing two PC-only bugs: clicking out of the game disabling certain inputs (such as the key for the ship’s lock on), which affected streamers in particular, and diagonal movement being faster than normal with mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>Why stagger the releases like this? It’s to increase the chance that, if any bad bugs on Steam slipped through testing, they’ll get caught and fixed before the release of the other platforms. This is no shade to our QA testers, we’re just trying to be extra risk averse and conservative with the resources we put toward Outer Wilds since our new game is our priority!</p></blockquote>
<p>After the usual bullet-point round-up of additions and fixes, the changelog post adds that "there are no more major updates planned for Outer Wilds or Echoes of the Eye because we are hard at work on our next game."</p>
<p>So then. Well now. What could they be up to? Another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game</a>? Further attempts at simulating quantum mechanics and other elements of "post-classical" physics? I am all agog. Thanks to reader Faxmachinen  for spotting it and passing it on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of the major highlights included in the patch notes is the Gunsmith's new Blueprint Swap feature that allows players further weapon customization. The update also nerfs a few popular weapons in Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Players now have more freedom with weapon customization. The Gunsmith's new Blueprint Swap feature allows players to mix-and-match which attachment skins they have equipped or fine-tune how weapon blueprint skins apply to their builds.

			<p>PUBG Productions announced that it has launched a new closed beta for its upcoming single-player survival roguelike,<a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-will-launch-in-early-access-this-summer-for-20/"> Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>. This is the fifth playtesting event that PUBG Productions has hosted since the game's reveal in December 2024, with the game due out in early access sometime in summer 2025.</p>
<p>The closed beta will run from today, May 7, to May 14, and is available on Steam and the Epic Games Store. To participate, you need to sign up through the studio's official <a href="https://discord.gg/P3PUCmUV">Discord</a> to receive a code for either storefront. Signing up gets you a code, you don't have to wait to see if you've been accepted into the closed beta. Though, PUBG Productions does stipulate that codes are being given out on a "<em>first-come first-servered basis</em>," so better to be quick if you want to try out Prologue: Go Wayback!.</p>

<p>Even if you do miss this playtest, though, in the PUBG Productions Discord, the team has already confirmed there will be another playtest next month, beginning June 2, 2025. So you'll have another chance, and maybe even another after that, if it ends up releasing in August 2025.</p>
<p>When Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/">spoke to PUBG creator Brendan Greene</a> about Prologue: Go Wayback!, Greene outlined his goals for the game as part of a three-game project.</p>
<p>"<em>Prologue is tackling the terrain where we generate new terrains every playthrough by using our machine learning tech. That'll help us prove out and mature the ML tech. Then, when we go to game two, which is hopefully on our own engine, we can have that ML tech matured, go bigger, and keep scaling up. That's the intention for Prologue. It's quite a simple game. it's not my next opus, but it serves a purpose, which is that of a test bed for our ML tech.</em></p>
<p><em>I still want to make a great single player experience and I'm excited about emergent gameplay in a single player world, kind of like Don't Starve and these games that are unique in every playthrough. Hopefully, we can create an 8x8 world that looks pretty good. Having a unique world every time, I think, gives us something interesting to play with.</em>"</p>

If that’s you too, then allow me to introduce you to the Raider in Nightreign (see the video below).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Guardian — the other big burly class with lots of health and an affinity for big weapons — is more focused on defense with a shield as a starter weapon and an ultimate ability that can mitigate damage for the entire party for an extended period of time, the Raider is designed as an absolute offensive powerhouse. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most important ability of the Raider is Retaliate, which initially may not seem like a very strong skill on its own — it’s just two stomps that deal a bit of physical and poise damage. But the real magic is that thanks to the Raider’s passive, he cannot be knocked down while doing Retaliate. This means that the Raider basically has a free damage-soaking technique that will let you totally armor through pretty much any enemy or boss attack, with the added bonus of that weak second stomp getting replaced by an extremely powerful punch that will stagger even the largest enemies, if you manage to absorb an attack that would’ve done a substantial amount of damage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there is the Raider’s ultimate, Totem Stela, which has him slamming the ground and causing a large totem to erupt, dealing big damage to anything around it. Like all of the other Ultimates in Nightreign, this is an incredibly powerful technique that can alter the tide of a fight. Not only does it deal big damage, but the totem is climbable, giving both you and your teammates either a safe place to lay low, or a vantage point to hit. In addition to that, it <em>also </em>gives everyone a damage buff as well, meaning it's one of the first ults you’ll want to coordinate using so that the rest of the team can benefit from it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Of all the classes I've played in Nightreign, the raider was the one I had the most fun with.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Raider starts with the Raider’s Greavtaxe, which is a pretty solid starting weapon that deals some fire damage and has the “Endure” skill affixed to it, which basically gives you another way to absorb and power through enemy attacks in case Retaliate is on cooldown. Still, you’ll definitely want to find a better weapon as the nights get closer, and large strength-scaling weapons are definitely the Raider’s go-to style of weapon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the classes I’ve played in Nightreign, the Raider is definitely the one that I’ve had the most fun with. It’s the one that is most well-suited for one-on-one battles, which is appropriate because its Remembrances (we’ll talk about those later on in the month) have you fighting in one-on-one boss fights in a sort of gladiatorial arena, which is a nice change of pace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's all for our hands-on impressions of Nightreign's classes, but stay tuned all throughout the month in depth looks at the mechanics of Nightreign, along with interviews with the developers, and more as IGN First continues on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

Through its ever-evolving combat and the introduction of beloved character bonding mechanics, the series has ascended to the upper echelon of tactical RPGs, culminating in two excellent mainline entries on the Nintendo Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we near the end of the original Switch era, we’ve compiled a list of every Fire Emblem game available on the console as well as what's coming to the Switch 2. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How Many Fire Emblem Games Are on Switch?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>There are five Fire Emblem games on Switch: </strong>two mainline games and three spinoffs. There are two additional Fire Emblem games available with Nintendo Switch Online, with a third due out for the Switch 2 in June.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Fire Emblem Game on Nintendo Switch</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Fire Emblem Warriors (2017)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/fe-warriors-1745882938195.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Fire Emblem game released on Switch was the Dynasty Warriors crossover <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/24/fire-emblem-warriors-review"><u>Fire Emblem Warriors</u></a>. The mashup incorporates the best elements of each series, blending Fire Emblem’s team-based strategy with Dynasty Warriors’ button-mashing, hack-and-slash action. It’s a worthwhile spinoff for action fans, though the light story makes it inessential to those concerned with Fire Emblem lore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game was developed by Dynasty Warriors studio Omega Force in collaboration with the action gurus at Team Ninja (Ninja Gaiden, Nioh).</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fire Emblem: Three Houses (2019)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/fe-three-houses-1745882956790.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/25/fire-emblem-three-houses-review"><u>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</u></a> was a milestone release for the series. It was the first Fire Emblem game released on a home console in 12 years, the first mainline entry released on Switch, and a critical and commercial success that carried forward the momentum of Awakening seven years before it.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three Houses is a massive tactical RPG that balances the grand with the intimate. Large-scale battles progress an overarching story of politics and religion within a continental war, while quieter moments between battles are spent in the monastery training, teaching, exploring, and bonding with other characters through well-written and -acted conversations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three Houses is Fire Emblem at its best, and what we'd recommend as a starting point if you’re looking to jump into the series on Switch.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore (2020)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/tokyo-mirage-1745882991839.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2020, Nintendo released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review"><u>Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE</u></a> Encore, an expanded port of the original Wii U release. Encore added new story content, characters, and music to the Nintendo-Atlus crossover game, which blends Fire Emblem’s “weapon triangle” combat mechanic — swords have an advantage over axes, axes over lances, lances over swords — with the flashy style, dungeon-crawling, and moment-to-moment combat of Atlus’s Shin Megami Tensei and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story is a comical, often over-the-top send-up of Japanese pop-culture that, as in Warriors before it, takes a backseat to the action.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes (2023)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/fe-warriors-three-hopes-1745883001863.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo re-teamed with Omega Force for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fire-emblem-warriors-three-hopes-review"><u>Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</u></a>, the companies’ second Fire Emblem-Dynasty Warriors crossover following Fire Emblem Warriors. Three Hopes is a retelling of Three Houses set in an alternate timeline where Three Houses’ protagonist Byleth serves as the main villain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three Hopes is a more robust blend of the two franchises than its predecessor, integrating more of Fire Emblem’s social and tactical mechanics with Dynasty Warriors’ fast-paced action.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fire Emblem Engage (2023)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/fe-engage-1745883011216.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-review"><u>Fire Emblem Engage</u></a> is the series’ latest game and its second mainline entry on Switch. Engage is a progression of Three Houses’ excellence and an ode to Fire Emblem's past: It refines and scales down the social and hub mechanics of Three Houses while shifting its primary focus to the series’ longstanding tactical combat, most notably reintroducing Fire Emblem’s “weapon triangle" system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story of Engage follows a Divine Dragon named Alear, who’s tasked with collecting 12 rings to defeat the Fell Dragon and save the continent of Elyos. Engage’s original story connects to the series past through these 12 rings, each of which houses the spirit of a past Fire Emblem protagonist, allowing you to summon past heroes such as Marth, Ike, Celica, and Byleth.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fire Emblem Games Available With Nintendo Switch Online</h2><div catalogid="f103691f-4710-4305-8c12-09ba36a36696" id="187637"><div id="187637" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack: 12-Month Individual Membership</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are currently two Fire Emblem games available with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">Nintendo Switch Online subscription</a> outside of Japan: the 2003 Game Boy Advance game Fire Emblem, aka Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, and the 2004 follow-up Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A third game, 2005's Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, will be added to the catalog when GameCube games are integrated into the service alongside the launch of Switch 2 on June 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the complete list of Fire Emblem games currently available with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/06/fire-emblem-2"><u>Fire Emblem</u></a> (GBA, 2003)</li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/05/24/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones"><u>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</u></a> (GBA, 2004)</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Upcoming Fire Emblem Games on Switch and Switch 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no official word on new Fire Emblem games in development, but it's pretty likely we'll see something new (or remade) in the series on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide">upcoming Switch 2</a>.

<p dir="ltr">"We have already seen compliance from some of the companies we've contacted," Activision says. "However, we will continue to pursue other device makers in the market, globally, as well as people that create scripts to manipulate Call of Duty game code." It also reminds players that any account using these devices on PC or console for the purpose of cheating will be permanently banned.</p><p dir="ltr">Another part of Call of Duty's protection plan included the recent Account Linking policy change, which requires players to verify they are in control of an account when attempting to link a new PC account to an Activision ID. The publisher says this has already protected over 10,000 accounts that had a "potential suspicious account link" but were blocked by the new verification requirement.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-reloaded-adds-4-20-events-and-major-updates-to-verdansk/2900-6513/">Season 3 Reloaded update</a> included even more improvements from Call of Duty's anti-cheat team. This added an expanded version of the Death Widget UI, which now provides players with even more detailed information about how they were eliminated, including if they were pinged by a heartbeat sensor, a Most Wanted contract, a proximity alarm, a Resurgence mark, or even by a teammate being used as a body shield. The Death Widget was recently added to Call of Duty in an attempt to cut down on false reports of cheaters.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's Ricochet team also made updates to its advanced video replay technology to help better weed out wallhackers. Activision says this method uses clips captured by Call of Duty's Replay Investigation Tool, which is an internal tool that watches completed matches to determine the probability of suspicious gameplay using machine learning. If a clip gets marked by the tool as being suspect, it will then be reviewed by a human.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher says the Replay Investigation Tool captures tons of clips across Black Ops 6 and Warzone, but the tool is most focused on Ranked Play modes. "It's unbelievably frustrating to be bumped off a leaderboard by a cheater, but RIT and its advancements are zeroed in on the Ranked Play experience," Activision says.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision says new Ricochet anti-cheat updates are being developed and deployed on a regular basis, and more information will be provided in future blogs.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to fighting cheaters, Call of Duty is embracing stoner culture with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-seth-rogen-and-all-high-art-event-rewards/2900-6521/">a 4/20 event themed around Seth Rogen</a>, bundles for Jay and Silent Bob, and plenty of weed-related cosmetics to earn.</p>
