            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/623716/hasbro-monopoly-app-banking-board-game-availability<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hasbro <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-playing-win-2025-toy-fairr-slate-new-product-reveals-0">announced a new version of Monopoly</a> that simplifies gameplay by replacing cash and the banker with a mobile app that handles all of the game’s transactions. With Monopoly App Banking, a smartphone or tablet takes over the role of banker and keeps track of every player’s money and properties. It will make the game more accessible to younger players while also making it much harder to cheat, but it also means Monopoly is no longer an alternative to screen time.</p><p>Monopoly App Banking is expected to be available from most major retailers starting in August 2025 and will sell for $24.99. The accompanying mobile app is free, but players will have to provide their own mobile device.</p><p>The game board features a similar layout to traditional versions of Monopoly, but is updated with kid-friendly alternatives to the game’s iconic properties. Instead of Park Place and Boardwalk, the most valuable properties are now a rocket launch pad and the moon, while others include a chocolate factory, a VR roller coaster, and a dinosaur park.</p><p>Each player selects a token and a matching bank card that, along with property cards, are scanned and recognized by the mobile app to automate transactions such as purchasing title deeds or paying rent. That approach may not appeal to parents or teachers who use Monopoly as a covert way to help kids practice their math skills, but Hasbro says the new version will speed up what can often be a long game to play. In addition, the app includes mini games that can be played to earn perks, which could help hold the attention of younger players.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I was a kid, I had one of those Little Tikes toy chests with a green lid. The plastic chest was filled to the brim with random toys like <a href="https://thisoldtoy.com/fisher-price/dept-7-playsets/q-rescue-heroes/1-pics/fpt6142-billy-blazes.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rescue Heroes</a>, G.I. Joes, and&nbsp;McDonald’s toys my family bought me without knowing my astute taste in rad shit. Said rad shit was designated to the bottom right corner of my trunk with my favorite toys: <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, Bruce Lee, and WWE action figures that I twisted my mom’s arm to get whenever we went to Chinatown, Toys R Us, KB Toys, and Montgomery Ward. These, my friends, were bathtub toys: the highest honor of any toy. There, I’d create crossover battles combining their respective storylines, character motivations, and super-powered feats to the fullest extent of their limited joint articulation and my imagination before my mom pulled the drain, signaling a hasty cliffhanger for my next bath. The holy alliance of anime creatives behind <a href="https://aftermath.site/mobile-suit-gundam-gquuuuuux-pronounce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em></a> are letting the same childlike imagination run.&nbsp;</p><p>Before I went to see <a href="https://gizmodo.com/mobile-suit-gundams-next-show-is-coming-to-theaters-2000552177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX: The Beginning</em></a>, a compilation film of the first four episodes of the anime, I sold the friend I brought with me on being my plus one by name-dropping the big-names behind the show. Despite my friend never watching a lick of <em>Gundam</em>, the chain combo of me texting them saying the anime was written by <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>’s Hideaki Anno and <em>FLCL</em>’s Yoji Enokido with mech designs from <em>Eva</em>’s Ikuto Yamashita, character designs from <em>Pokémon</em>’s Take, and directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki of <em>Eva</em>, <em>FLCL</em>, and <em>Diebuster </em>fame was enough to warrant them texting back, “Bet.” I’m not gonna lie: The first episode portion was built solely for <a href="https://gizmodo.com/mobile-suit-gundam-gquuuuuux-beginning-movie-review-gkids-2000567467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diehard OG <em>Gundam </em>fans</a>, and it left my friend overwhelmed by the magnitude of information exposited about its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-uc-timeline-change-gene-char-2000570342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternate timeline</a>. I only grasped the broad strokes of its space colonial war with my limited knowledge of the original anime.</p><p>But when we reached the second episode portion of <em>The Beginning</em>, I realized I was watching Studio Khara and Sunrise play with their toys the same way I once did. <em>GQuuuuuX </em>is the epitome of anime, combining its parts into something both familiar and new for mecha anime fans.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[Spoiler warning, I guess on the premise of the anime]</strong></p><figure><figcaption>© GKids/Bandai Namco Filmworks<span></span><a href="https://en.gundam.info/about-gundam/series-pages/gquuuuuux/gallery/visual/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunrise/Khara</a></figcaption></figure><p>The film opens with the OG anime’s morally grey antagonist, Char Aznable, successfully stealing the titular mech, reverse engineering its specs, and altering the course of events of the original anime’s “One Year War” in his nation of Zeon’s favor. Things eventually go topsy-turvy for Char, leading to a five year time skip to the story of three teenagers: Amate “Machu” Yuzuriha, an angsty redhead girl languishing in cram school; a skittish raven-haired girl named Nyaan (no, really) delivering contraband mech gear while masquerading as an Uber Eats delivery driver; and a blue-haired graffiti artist and savant mech pilot named Shuji Ito, with a weird habit of sniffing people. Their paths eventually converge as the trio comes into ownership of Char’s long-lost Gundam—a giant robot the former warring nations of Zeon and the Federation desperately want their hands on.</p><p>Although <em>The Beginning</em> sets the stage for <em>Gundam </em>to get its own <em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em> treatment, reimagining the original anime’s story, the most fascinating part of the film is how it draws in all the best parts of its staff’s past works. It feels like Khara and Sunrise got in the studio, grabbed a pack of cutesy, approachable, noodle-armed <em>Pokémon</em> characters, waved said toys around while yelling defiant one-liners akin to <em>FLCL</em> quotes, and threw in Gundam’s political mumbo jumbo while bashing giant robots against each other. In short, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> is a designer baby from some of the greatest minds in anime, and I’m digging it.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX -Beginning- | Official Trailer - In Theatres Feb 28" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSDGDl-0olk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Aesthetically, <em>GquuuuuuX</em>’s amalgamation of moods shines through its animation style, switching from emulating the grainy, retro look of the ‘79 anime to the sleek, vibrant, and bouncy mix of 3D and 2D animation of today’s anime. Narratively, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em>’s fusion dance of vibes comes together best through Machu. Her petulant grimaces and defiant attitude towards authoritative grown-ups, while struggling to appear more mature and free, mirrors Naota Nandaba’s whole deal in <em>FLCL</em>. The anime plays with this by having her and Nyaan’s meet-cute happen similarly to Naota’s and Haruko Haruhara—while Naota takes a bit longer to grow into his person, Machu gets her “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AtN4-qqeNE&amp;pp=ygUaZmxjbCBzd2luZyB0aGUgYmF0IG1lYW5pbmc%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swing the bat</a>” moment by chasing the high of piloting a Gundam. She is a <em>Pokémon</em>–looking character with an <em>FLCL </em>protagonist’s rebellious attitude, navigating the complexities of a <em>Gundam </em>world, and I can’t help but root for her.</p><p>While it is still too early to know whether I’ll like <em>Gundam</em>’s new hotness as much as I adored its last adventure with <em>The Witch From Mercury</em>, if <em>The Beginning</em> is any indication of what’s to come when <em>GQuuuuuuX</em>’s anime airs in April, the anime has the makings of a compelling blend of styles from the industry’s best minds.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/valkyrae-cinna-emiru-attacked-amouranth-robbed-twitch-kick"><h3>Three Big Twitch Streamers Attacked, Another Robbed At Gunpoint, On Same Night</h3></a><p>Multiple instances of streamers in severe peril have the Twitch community reckoning with sexism and security</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Knights in Tight Spaces is a deck-building roguelike with the heart of an RPG and the soul of an action film. It’s the follow-up to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/02/fights-in-tight-spaces-review/">Fights in Tight Spaces</a>, but where that game had you basically playing as John Wick, here you’re thrust back into ye olde times of a magic-filled fantasy world. Think more D&amp;D, basically.</p>
<p><iframe title="⚔️ Knights in Tight Spaces | Launch Trailer | Available Now! ⚔️" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6kGiZQrj8aE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You choose your class at the start of each run, with there being a range on offer covering all of the classic archetypes like warrior, mages, and a brawler. You then start the run, and you get a slightly different story each time, with trouble inevitably finding you, and you then needing to figure out how to deal with that trouble. The story side of this is a lot of fun, and you get some cool moments where you get to navigate conversations that can not only lead to different rewards, but also potentially side quests to undertake as well.</p>


<p>It means that you get to feel like an actual character, and not just someone playing a deck-building game. It’s a nice touch of character that goes a long way, and makes the losses hit a little bit harder too. You’re not alone in this one though, as you’ll end up picking up a party as you play through the game. This gives you access to new cards, and adds extra layers to the strategy of the game because you need to think about more people avoiding attacks, along with having more angles to attack from.</p>


<p>Speaking of attacks, let’s go through the combat. You get a set amount of energy each turn to play cards with. Cards can have a lot of different effects. Some just do damage, sure, but a lot of them help you move around, block, move enemies around, disable them, or have other special effects. Battles are incredibly tactical, because you can not only just defeat enemies with damage, but have them hit each other, combo with your party members, or just kick enemies out of the map.</p>
<p>Enemies come in a lot of different varieties too, so you’ll be juggling a lot of information about how best to proceed at any given time. It’s a hard game, sure, but you always feel as though you could have played it a little smarter at some point to do better on the next run.</p>

<p>Also, it’s so darn pretty. There’s a lovely hand-drawn sketch look to all of the characters and an almost comic book styling to the environments. As you rotate the environments, you watch walls slide out of the way so you can see properly as well. It’s incredibly satisfying, and it’s also practical. It helps tie everything together into a package that’s just a lot of fun to play, even if it can be incredibly hard.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Knights in Tight Spaces is an incredibly follow up to an already amazing game. It fuses a wonderful amount of style with plenty of tactically strategy, and the party mechanics at play and side quests all help to make it almost feel like a solo tabletop role-playing game, which I mean as an incredible compliment. If you like the sound of this game at all, or hanker for more Fights in Tight Spaces, then you'll probably love it.	</p></div>

It takes place a few years before the events of the original game and a few years after what transpired in <em>Suikoden V</em>. The cast consists of exquisite pixel art sprites running through 3D environments and the series’ flashy turn-based battles. And of course there are 108 characters to collect along the way. It looks exactly like what fans have long pined for.</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s only coming to mobile and will be burdened with all that entails, like limited-time events and paid loot box-style gambling, otherwise known as “gacha” mechanics. Producer Shinya Fujimatsu said the team wanted as many people to be able to access <em>Suikoden Star Leap</em> as possible, though it’s hard to imagine how paid RNG could be incorporated into the game without fundamentally upending the experience. A base-building mini-game in<em> Star Leap </em>looks ripe for premium currency and stamina cooldown congestion. </p><p>It’s an odd combo especially since Konami made it very clear that this isn’t a “what if” scenario or <em>Suikoden</em>-lite spin-off. <em>Star Leap</em> exists in the mainline history of the series, will include some reoccurring characters, and spares no expense when it comes to orchestral arrangements for the soundtrack and full voice acting for the main story. The monkey’s paw really nailed this one. </p><p><em>Suikoden Star Leap</em> is part of Konami’s mission to try to revitalize the franchise about young heroes and warring nations that’s been on ice since 2012's <em>Gensō Suikoden</em> for the PlayStation Portable, which itself was never localized in the West. Other parts of this initiative include this week’s HD remasters of <em>Suikoden I </em>and <em>II</em>, as well as a newly announced anime adaptation of the latter. </p><p><em>Star Leap</em> still doesn’t have a release date, but if it blows up maybe we’ll finally get a full-blown console sequel in the form of <em>Suikoden VI</em>. For now, fans have the remasters of the originals to keep them occupied, as well as late series creator Yoshitaka Murayama’s 2023 love letter to the games in the form of <em>Eiyuden Chronicle</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-suikoden-2-ps1-rpg-1851427201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-suikoden-2-ps1-rpg-1851427201">a decent but not great spiritual successor</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-far-cry-extraction-based-multiplayer-shooter-has-been-rebooted.1124799/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Far Cry extraction-based multiplayer shooter under codename Maverick has been rebooted, Insider Gaming has learned.</p>



<p>Project Maverick, which was initially intended as a multiplayer component to Far Cry 7 morphed into its own project in early 2023, but after internal review, the project has been rebooted.</p>



<p>That’s according to several sources familiar with the projects development, who said that the “writing was on the wall” for a number of months. It was said that the final nail in the coffin came after its dedicated tech team called Talisker (also the old name of Far Cry 7 before it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">morphed into two separate projects</a>), moved from Maverick to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-story-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully dedicated to Blackbird</a> in late December to ensure the project stays on track.</p>



<p>Maverick was going to be an extraction-based multiplayer shooter set in Alaska, where players would try to survive and extract in the harsh elements against wild animals, AI soldiers, and other players. </p>



<p>It’s understood that Ubisoft Montreal, the studio heading both Maverick and Blackbird (Far Cry 7) will take the multiplayer game back to prototyping with Ubisoft Sherbrooke. Ubisoft Berlin, who where also assisting on the games development has seen around a dozen or so developers move to Blackbird, and another dozen move to another project. However, its understood approximately 50 developers are now left without an assigned project and will likely be placed on viability this month.</p>



<p>The exact reason for Maverick’s reboot is unclear, but the decision seems to have been made as a part of Ubisoft’s new strategy to streamline its teams and projects amid the company’s struggles. That being said, some on the Blackbird project feel like a 2026 release date is still fairly optimistic, with the project bloating in headcount and budget. Teams on the project include Ubisoft Montreal, Ubisoft Berlin, Ubisoft Annecy, Redstorm, and the ‘Talisker team’.</p>



<p>That being said, the project has already started playtesting, with several sources telling Insider Gaming that the game played great and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes up the traditional Far cry formula</a> in a number of ways, from overall gameplay to the movement mechanics.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Ubisoft has yet to officially comment on Maverick or Blackbird.</p>

            <p>
Secret Mode, the UK indie publisher behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> and A Little to the Left, has suffered a "small number" of jobs losses as a result of its sale, Eurogamer can confirm.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, it was announced that Secret Mode had been acquired by Emona Capital, a financial investment firm that also owns Company Heroes studio Relic Entertainment.
</p>
<p>
The move follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">last month's announcement by Sumo Digital, Secret Mode's previous owner, that it would refocus on providing "development services for partners"</a> rather than continuing to create its own IP, in order to balance "creative ambitions and commercial realities". At the time, it said this move would "unavoidably... have an impact on our studios and people".
</p>
<p>
In a press release this week, Secret Mode said it would now continue under Emona Capital, with its focus remaining on supporting PC and console indie games. The company's current bosses, Ed Blincoe and James Schall, will also remain at the firm. 
</p>
<p>
"Secret Mode is deeply passionate about the creativity and innovation within the indie space, and so we are thrilled to be partnering with Emona Capital and to fully focus on the independent publishing scene," Blincoe said in a statement. 
</p>
<p>
"I also want to express our gratitude to Sumo not only for believing in Secret Mode's original vision and overseeing our startup years, but for granting us this opportunity to become a fully independent entity."
</p>
<p>
This week, several former Secret Mode team members have said they had now been made redundant and were looking for work, including staff in PR and marketing roles. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer, a Secret Mode spokesperson confirmed "a small number of roles" were impacted by the sale, as the publisher adjusted its unannounced line-up of games due for launch across the remainder of this year. 
</p>
<p>
The Chinese Room, which developed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-review">Still Wakes the Deep</a> as well as the acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review">Everybody's Gone to the Rapture</a>, currently remains owned by Sumo Digital.

<p>Per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/game-publisher-acclaim-returns-with-focus-on-indie-studios-and-classics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, Acclaim's revival will be headed up by industry veteran Alex Josef, who wasn't among the original founders or executives of Acclaim but who has experience publishing thanks to his time with studios like&nbsp;<em>Turnip Boy&nbsp;</em>publisher Graffiti Games, among others.</p>

<p>Josef says bringing back Acclaim is an "honor", and that the new version of the studio has "already signed some incredible indie titles". In addition, Josef says he wants to "resurrect and revitalize [Acclaim's] beloved portfolio" of intellectual properties, although he doesn't say which ones those might be.</p>

<p>Some of Acclaim's games, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remaster-delayed" rel="nofollow"><em>Turok&nbsp;</em>series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;dark action game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-studios-remastering-shadow-man-restoring-cut-content" rel="nofollow"><em>Shadow Man</em></a>, have already returned to modern systems in one form or another, so it'll be interesting to see which of Acclaim's properties it's able to "resurrect".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Acclaim, it got its start back in the late 80s, going on to become a prolific and fairly successful publisher throughout the 90s and early 2000s.</p>

<p>For many, however, Acclaim is more well-known for its many controversial marketing ideas, including awarding money to parents who named their baby "Turok", trying to buy ad space on tombstones for&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man: 2econd Coming</em>, and offering to pay UK speeding fines when&nbsp;<em>Burnout 2&nbsp;</em>was released.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what the revived version of Acclaim will do, but it's not the only old-school publishing label to be revived recently.</p>

<p>Back in April last year, Atari announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-infogrames-publishing-revival" rel="nofollow">revive the classic Infogrames label</a>, with the studio going on to acquire the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Totally Reliable Delivery Service&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surgeon-simulator-acquired-by-infogrames" rel="nofollow">Surgeon Simulator</a>&nbsp;</em>brands.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/623428/dell-alienware-oled-monitor-aw2725d-price-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>2024 was the year <a href="https://youtu.be/yYjBf94WY2M?si=tn4aXejPyf_7jfQ9&amp;t=510">OLED cemented its victory</a> — and 2025 might let more gamers actually afford the glorious screens. Today, Alienware says it will try* to bring the price of a QD-OLED gaming panel down to $549 this summer with the AW2725D, a new 27-inch 2560 x 1440 QHD monitor that’ll offer OLED’s incredible blacks and deep colors.</p><p>Outwardly, the AW2725D looks and sounds almost identical to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335564/alienware-27-inch-4k-240hz-oled-price-date">$899 27-inch AW2725Q 4K 240Hz QD-OLED monitor</a> that Alienware is just now <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/gaming/alienware" rel="sponsored">putting on sale today</a> — but $350 cheaper, if you can settle for 110 pixels per inch (ppi), rather than the class-leading 166ppi that Alienware’s 4K OLED screen will offer.</p><p>There could be other compromises, too, as Alienware didn’t have spec sheets available by press time… but it’s actually a slightly faster panel at 280Hz versus 240Hz, offers the same 99 percent DCI-P3 color coverage, Delta E&lt;2 color accuracy, and the same small rounded rectangle of an adjustable height stand (see below). Alienware display product manager James Cha tells us it also has the same graphite film heatsink and not-too-aggressive burn-in protection algorithm <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24034953/ces-2024-verge-awards-best-tv-laptop-monitor-gaming-car">I’ve been enjoying</a> in the $1,199 32-inch version of the screen.</p><p>If that $549 panel wasn’t enough to tempt you away from the $899 version, what about a curved 34-inch ultrawide for $799? That’s what Dell is targeting* for the AW3425DW you see above, its latest version of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23011794/alienware-aw3423dw-review-qd-oled-curved-gaming-pc-monitor">the first 3440 x 1440 QD-OLED monitor it wowed us with</a> in 2022.</p><p>There, you’re getting a 240Hz panel (up from 165Hz), HDMI 2.1 fixed rate link instead of TMDS signaling (which should provide enough bandwidth to go above 4K60 HDR over HDMI), a USB-C port with 15W charging, and a new user interface for its onscreen display, all for $100 less* than before.</p><p>Alienware’s also still offering its same three-year burn-in warranty on its QD-OLED panels, where it’ll ship you a new monitor before you have to return the old one. When I asked whether Dell might further extend its warranty now that panel maker Samsung Display offers more protections, Cha says, “That’s something we could look into.”</p><p>Alienware has more new monitors where these came from, including a pair of budget 25-inch and 27-inch Fast IPS screens that start at $249* and $269,* respectively, each using the same new industrial design as the QD-OLED screens. (The 25-inch AW2525HM is a 1080p 320Hz panel coming in the summer; the 27-inch AW2725DM is a 1440p 180Hz screen arriving in two days.)</p><p>It’s unlikely that Dell has an exclusive on the Samsung panels inside these new monitors, so don’t be surprised if other 27-inch and 34-inch QD-OLED screens hit the market at new low prices, too. In fact, Samsung Electronics recently reduced the price of its 27-inch Odyssey G61SD (1440p 240Hz QD-OLED) to $549 in an extended sale <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Odyssey-FreeSyncTM-Warranty-LS27DG610SNXZA/dp/B0DHJD894W?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">at Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-27-odyssey-qd-oled-g6-g61s-qhd-240hz-0-03ms-freesync-premium-pro-and-g-sync-compatible-gaming-monitor-with-hdr-silver-metal-with-slim-design/6604804.p?skuId=6604804">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/oled-monitor/27-odyssey-oled-g6-g61sd-qhd-240hz-0-03ms-freesync-premium-pro-gaming-monitor-with-sleek-metal-design-ls27dg610snxza/">its own store</a>, perhaps in anticipation of successors.</p><div><p><em>*We’ve used asterisks to indicate that Dell apparently can’t promise exact prices for these quite yet, with all of them subject to change — possibly due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/620865/trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico-march-4">President Donald Trump’s tariffs on China that are set to go into effect today</a>.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, Nvidia is trying to get things heading in the right direction with the RTX 5070, a GPU that it promised would deliver $1,599 RTX 4090-like performance for $549.</p><p>It doesn’t, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">it was never going to</a>. It’s about 20 percent faster than the RTX 4070 and a bare 4 percent faster than last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24039832/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">RTX 4070 Super</a>. It’s a solid card for 1440p gaming, just like the RTX 4070, but as with the rest of the 50-series cards, Nvidia’s performance claims rely on Frame Generation rather than meaningful improvements to rendering.</p><p>At $549, the RTX 5070 will also come up against <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/621339/amd-radeon-9070-xt-price-release-date-gpu">AMD’s new $549 Radeon RX 9070</a> and $599 Radeon RX 9070 XT when they launch on March 6th. If AMD manages to beat Nvidia’s RTX 5070 or come close to the $749 RTX 5070 Ti, that’s going to put a lot of much-needed pressure on Nvidia’s pricing.</p><p>You might want to wait a couple of days to purchase anything until we can talk about those AMD cards.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->550</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Compact size</li><li>Great 1440p performance</li><li>Power draw isn’t significantly higher than RTX 40 series</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>12GB of VRAM</li><li>Definitely not RTX 4090 levels of performance</li><li>Multi Frame Generation is less effective at 4K</li></ul></div></div></div><div><p id="1440p-and-4k-benchmarks"><h2><strong>1440p and 4K benchmarks</strong><br></h2></p></div><div><div><p id="test-machine"><h2>Test machine:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D</span></li><li><span><strong>CPU cooler:</strong> Corsair H150i Elite LCD</span></li><li><span><strong>Motherboard:</strong> Gigabyte Aorus Master</span></li><li><span><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB G.Skill DDR5-6000</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB</span></li><li><span><strong>PSU: </strong>Corsair HX1000W</span></li><li><span><strong>Case: </strong>Streacom BC1 V2 open benchtable</span></li></ul></div></div><p>The RTX 5070 Founders Edition card I’ve been testing looks like a miniature RTX 5090 with a slightly darker paint job and no LEDs. It’s still a two-slot card, and it retains the two fans at the bottom that direct cooler air over the card and exhaust it out of the top, as well as the slightly angled 12V-2x6 power connector that makes it easier to fit into more cases. </p><p>I really like the size. It feels like the ideal companion for a small form factor PC, and I don’t think I’d be too worried about the heat this little GPU would generate or the power draw (more on that later).</p><p>I’ve been testing the RTX 5070 card with AMD’s Ryzen 9 9800X3D processor and Asus’ 32-inch 4K OLED PG32UCDP. I’ve put it up against the previous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23678453/nvidia-rtx-4070-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">RTX 4070</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24039832/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">RTX 4070 Super</a> cards, as well as the more expensive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/615075/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5070 Ti</a> and AMD’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499697/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xt-xtx-review-benchmarks-price">RX 7900 XT</a>, which you can see in the benchmark charts below.</p><p>I’ve tested a variety of games at both 1440p and 4K, including more demanding titles like <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> and benchmarking favorites like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. All games have been tested at very high or Ultra settings, so you’ll get a good idea of the RTX 5070’s true capabilities, though you’ll probably want to drop the settings for better frame rates.</p><p>As with every other 50-series card, the 5070 isn’t much of an upgrade in raw performance over the last generation. Without DLSS or RT enabled, the RTX 5070 is 18 percent faster than an RTX 4070 at 1440p and 22 percent faster at 4K; compared to the 4070 Super, it’s only 3 percent faster at 1440p and 4 percent at 4K. You’ll see a solid boost if you’re coming from a 30-series card or older, though; it’s nearly 55 percent faster than the RTX 3070 Ti. </p><p>The RTX 5070 is still largely a 1440p card, which has been the sweet spot for Nvidia’s 70 lineup for a few generations. While it delivers playable frame rates for most games in my test suite at 4K resolution, you’ll need to enable DLSS in some titles if you want to be over 60fps consistently with all the settings maxed out. If you’re willing to drop some quality settings and enable DLSS, the RTX 5070 becomes a lot more capable.</p><p>If you’re looking for better 4K performance, stepping up to an RTX 5070 Ti gets you about 29 percent higher frame rates, but you’ll pay at least 35 percent more, assuming either card stays anywhere near MSRP.</p><p>My main concern about the RTX 5070 for 4K gaming is its 12GB of VRAM. I’ve already run into performance issues testing entry-level 4K gaming with the 8GB RTX 3070 Ti in certain games, and I don’t think 12GB of VRAM is going to fare well in the future, either. This is particularly relevant when AMD is about to ship its RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT with 16GB of VRAM. I wish Nvidia had done the same.</p><div><p id="dlss-4-and-multi-frame-gen"><h2><strong>DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen</strong></h2></p></div><p>It was obvious from the start that Nvidia’s claims that the RTX 5070 would match the RTX 4090 relied entirely on DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation. The 50-series cards have up to 4x frame generation with DLSS 4, so they can generate up to three additional frames per frame rendered traditionally. The RTX 4090 can use DLSS 4, including Nvidia’s updated transformer models, but only has 2x frame generation.</p><p>It’s only the fact that the 5070 can generate three times as many interstitial frames as the RTX 4090 that lets it appear anywhere near as fast. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 4K with Ultra settings, ray tracing enabled, and 4x Frame Generation, the RTX 5070 averaged 122fps. The older RTX 4090, with 2x Frame Generation, managed 128fps, and it’s rendering far more of them the old-fashioned way.</p><p>If you take Nvidia at face value and assume performance equals frame rate, the RTX 4090 is still 5 to 10 percent faster than the RTX 5070 when frame generation is cranked up all the way on both cards. In traditional rendering, the RTX 4090 is 75 percent faster on average. Without ray tracing or frame generation, the RTX 4090 got 76fps in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and the RTX 4070 got 48fps. </p><p>As I’ve discussed in previous reviews, and as even Nvidia’s materials show, multi-frame generation makes gameplay <em>look </em>smoother, but the game will still feel sluggish if the base frame rate is low. You can really feel it on the RTX 5070, especially in 4K. With DLSS Super Resolution and x4 Multi Frame Generation, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> hit 77fps at Ultra settings with full path tracing, but it still feels like the 24fps it is before Multi Frame Gen is applied.</p><p>Multi Frame Gen makes more sense at 1440p because the base frame rates are a lot higher. I wouldn’t buy the RTX 5070 because of Multi Frame Generation alone, but the DLSS 4 improvements and the new transformer model have certainly improved image quality for me in a variety of games, and you can even force DLSS 4 in unsupported games through Nvidia’s new app. But you don’t need an RTX 5070 for DLSS 4, so if you don’t care about Multi Frame Generation and you can somehow find an RTX 4070 Super at a reasonable price, it’s still a good choice.</p><p>Beyond gaming, the RTX 5070 can also deliver better performance in video editing or for AI workloads. In Procyon’s AI XL (FP16) test, the RTX 5070 is nearly 28 percent faster than the RTX 4070, or nearly 4 percent faster than the RTX 4070 Super. For video editing, I tested the RTX 5070 with PugetBench’s DaVinci Resolve test and found it’s 11 percent faster than the RTX 4070 and nearly 10 percent faster than the RTX 4070 Super.</p><div><p id="power-draw-and-heat"><h2><strong>Power draw and heat</strong></h2></p></div><p>Nvidia recommends a 650-watt power supply for the RTX 5070, which is exactly the same as both the RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Super. The total graphics power has increased to 250 watts in total, up by 50 watts over the RTX 4070 and just 30 watts over the RTX 4070 Super.</p><p>At 4K resolution, the RTX 5070 averaged 210 watts across the nine games tested — 25 watts more than the RTX 4070 averaged (185 watts) and just four watts more than the RTX 4070 Super (206 watts). The RTX 5070 hit its max power draw of 250 watts during the <em>Metro Exodus Extreme</em> benchmark, and it hit a maximum temperature of 77 degrees Celsius in that same test on my open bench, compared to 67C on both the RTX 4070 and 4070 Super.</p><p>I’m once again impressed that Nvidia hasn’t massively increased the power requirements here, but it looks like the RTX 5070 will run hotter than previous cards. While the RTX 5090 is certainly power-hungry, both the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti are a lot more efficient, while delivering gains over the previous-generation cards.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The RTX 5070 on top of an RTX 5080.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I feel like a broken record saying that the RTX 5070 continues the trend of modest generational improvements with the RTX 50 series, but unfortunately, that’s the case here again. This is really an ideal 1440p card thanks to the high frame rates at that resolution, or an entry-level 4K card if you’re willing to drop settings down and enable DLSS.</p><p>But it’s hard to recommend the RTX 5070 until the question hanging over it has been answered: AMD’s RX 9070-series cards. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/621339/amd-radeon-9070-xt-price-release-date-gpu">AMD surprised everyone</a> with a $549 price tag for its RX 9070 and $599 for its RX 9070 XT last week. Both cards are challenging Nvidia’s pricing for its RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti, and if they’re good enough, they might put pressure on Nvidia to adjust its pricing.</p><p>Until we know how all four cards compare, I would hold off on buying an RTX 5070 on day one. AMD might just surprise us with its performance as well as its pricing.</p><p><em>Photography by Tom Warren / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Furthermore, choose a boss you genuinely enjoy fighting, as you’ll wind up repeating the battle repeatedly by clearing the instance and starting a fresh one.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="455b19492ee22e6a22bab4a44015d4be" data-recommend-id="image://455b19492ee22e6a22bab4a44015d4be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A unique random shield in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A unique random shield in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="455b19492ee22e6a22bab4a44015d4be" data-recommend-id="image://455b19492ee22e6a22bab4a44015d4be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A unique random shield in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>An Orb of Chance is a rare gemstone-like item that offers a chance to evolve a normal item into a unique item, or outright destroy the item.

			<p>Today, ArenaNet announced the release date for Repentance, the second free update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-finally-launched-bringing-in-housing-mechanism-new-raids-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds</a>. The content patch is scheduled to go live on public servers on Tuesday, March 11th, introducing a host of new rewards and challenging activities for players of the MMORPG, as well as a new map, the Mistburned Barrens.</p>
<p>Deep within the ruins of Bava Nisos lies the Mists Gate, which brought the otherworldly titans to Tyria. Players will delve into the secrets of the mysterious Mursaat, long a source of legend dating back to the original Guild Wars, and confront their arcane experiments that have left their lands riven with spectral torment and bloodstone magic.</p>
<p>Repentance will feature a variety of new rewards, including a new weapon and armor set, six new relics to enhance character builds, an update to the Wizards Vault, new mini-pets, and new homestead recipes to be earned through in-game achievements. A new Mursaat Shadowcraft mastery track will help players explore the far reaches of Repentance.</p>

<p>In addition, the Titan Greer will be added to the Janthir Wilds Convergence gameplay mode, beginning an alternating boss rotation for players to test their mettle in the challenging 50-player activity. A more difficult challenge mode will be available in the Mount Balrior raid (first introduced in the November content update), with the most prestigious rewards available to players who complete it. Following the release of Repentance and the previous launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arenanet-to-release-godspawn-update-for-guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-on-november-19-featuring-new-50-player-titan-battle-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godspawn update</a>, ArenaNet plans to release a third and final free content update for Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds before moving on to the next expansion.</p>
<p>As we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-qa-arenanet-on-switch-to-yearly-expansions-secrets-of-the-obscure-learnings-and-2024-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our exclusive late 2023 interview</a>, ArenaNet has switched to a yearly release plan for expansions. As such, fans can expect a new Guild Wars 2 expansion to land in the latter half of 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Konami Finally Announces a New Suikoden Game, Sort Of]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami-finally-announces-a-new-suikoden-game-sort-of.1124703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has finally announced a new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>series after thirteen years, but&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>might not be what you want it to be.</p>

<p>During a&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-program-march-3rd-announced" rel="nofollow">news broadcast</a> held earlier today, Konami revealed that&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play mobile RPG, although it will be set in the main&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>timeline, so it won't be an alternate-history spinoff or anything like that.</p>

<p>The game will take place a few years after&nbsp;the events of&nbsp;<em>Suikoden V</em>, which itself served as a prequel to the original game. That, of course, also means that we might well see some of both games' characters appearing in&nbsp;<em>Star Leap</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suikoden-star-leap-mobile-rpg-viki.jpg?itok=bjiUk453 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suikoden-star-leap-mobile-rpg-viki.jpg?itok=02oowrx5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Familiar faces may well be making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, one of the screenshots shown on the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/suikoden/star_leap/us/en-us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a> for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>appears to show Viki, a recurring character who serves as your method of fast travel in every mainline&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>game to date.</p>

<p>Of course, Viki is heavily implied to be able to travel through time as well as through space, so her presence here probably shouldn't come as a shock. It does, however, reinforce that this isn't just a spinoff, but a game that wants to take its place alongside the main series.</p>

<p>The trailer for the game also appears to show Gregminster, the capital city of the Toran Republic and one of the key locations in the original&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>(as well as the site of a brief but memorable stopover in the sequel).</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>right here. Honestly, I know it's a mobile RPG, but the art style and overall presentation has me cautiously excited for it.</p>




<p>According to Konami,&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play game with "in-game purchases", although the studio doesn't say what form those purchases will take. I hate to say it, but&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>is ripe for some kind of character gacha mechanic, so that's probably what it'll be.</p>

<p>In addition to&nbsp;<em>Star Leap</em>, Konami is also gearing up to release remasters of the first two&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>games, which are due to land later this week, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> beyond their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-and-suikoden-2-remaster-confirmed-for-2023" rel="nofollow">original release window</a> of 2023.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out those remasters when they launch on March 6th across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/JP0101-PPSA18305_00-SUIKODENREMASTER" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-pre-order-bonus/9P9FM62WZXR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive at some point in the future on iOS and Android, although we don't know when yet.</p>

<p>VALORANT Patch 10.04 is officially live, and since it goes hand-in-hand <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-ditches-episodes-for-yearly-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a new Act</a>, it means that it’s a big one. The latest patch adds a dynamic, potentially game-breaking new duelist agent, major balance changes to existing agents, and some key changes to map pool.</p>



<p>Let’s dive into the full list of updates now live as of VALORANT Patch 10.04.</p>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-the-waylay-era">Welcome to the Waylay Era</h2>



<p>Waylay is the newest addition to the duelist class, and this new light-bending duelist from Thailand has “broken” written all over her. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-pros-say-the-next-duelist-will-be-an-even-more-annoying-jett/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The pros weren’t lying when they said she could replace Jett</a>, or be just as annoying. Her kit is designed to disrupt, hinder, and surprise enemy players.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Refract</strong>: Create a light beacon on the floor. Reactivate to return to the beacon, traveling as an invulnerable mote of pure light. This is like a stationary Yoru Gatecrash, but it affords the opportunity to gather info before returning to the starting point.</li>



<li><strong>Light Speed</strong>: It’s a Jett double dash. Waylay’s Light Speed can be used to jump over walls or push deep into a site during an execute. There are going to be so many highlight plays from this one.</li>



<li><strong>Saturate</strong>: Throw a cluster of light that explodes when it hits the ground, applying the Hinder effect to nearby players. Hinder slows enemy fire rate, recoil recovery, equip time, reload speed, movement speed, and jump speed.</li>



<li><strong>Convergent Paths</strong>: Waylay’s ultimate ability. Project a beam of light forward, which after a delay, applies Waylay with a speed boost and applies Hinder to enemies caught in the beam.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-valorant-10-04-balance-changes">VALORANT 10.04 Balance Changes</h2>



<p>Clove, Tejo, Iso, and Deadlock are the primary recipients of this patch’s balance changes. In this section, we dive into the major changes made to each of those four agents.</p>



<h3 id="h-clove">Clove</h3>



<p>Meddle, Clove’s Decay-applying throwable, now explodes 0.75 seconds after hitting the ground, instead of just a 1.3 second delay. The cooldown on their Ruse smokes has increased from 30 seconds to 40. Pick Me Up’s health buff duration has increased from eight seconds to 10, but the move speed durations drops from eight seconds to just three.</p>



<h3 id="h-deadlock">Deadlock</h3>



<p>GravNet is now Deadlock’s signature ability, costing no money at the start of the round and receiving a 40 second rechargeable cooldown. GravNet’s size has slightly decreased from 16m to 13m. Barrier Mesh now costs 400 credits.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-iso">Iso</h3>



<p>Iso now only gets one charge of his Undercut, but it now applies Suppression along with Vulnerability. The tagging on Double Tap has been changed, so he is now slowed more when his shield breaks. Iso will always have Double Tap applied now when he wins a duel in his Kill Contract ultimate.</p>



<h3 id="h-tejo">Tejo</h3>



<p>Tejo’s Guided Salvo missiles deal 65 points of damage and deal half damage to non-player objects. This changes has been made so that Tejo’s Guided Salvo does not successfully destroy Killjoy’s Lockdown.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-10-04-map-changes">VALORANT 10.04 Map Changes</h2>



<p>With the start of the new act, the VALORANT map pool is getting a change. <strong>Ascent and Icebox are back in</strong> the Competitive and Deathmatch queues, while <strong>Abyss and Bind are being taken out</strong>. Ascent is returning with a big change: the infamous B Main wall that players spam through with the Odin has been reinforced. Riot noted that all the spamming at this spot was “creating unhealthy gameplay and frustrating experiences.”</p>

                <p>Acclaim, an iconic game publisher from the 1990s behind series like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-jam/" data-ref-id="5000-2852">NBA Jam</a>, has been revived as an indie-game publisher.</p><p>Acclaim was founded in 1987 and made a name for itself in many ways. It was known for licensed games, ranging from NBA Jam to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/justice-league-task-force/" data-ref-id="5000-16280">Justice League Task Force</a>, being the console publisher for arcade classics like Mortal Kombat, and its wild marketing stunts promoting games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/turok-evolution/" data-ref-id="5000-4168">Turok: Evolution</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shadow-man-2econd-coming/" data-ref-id="5000-3729">Shadow Man: 2econd Coming</a>. After several high-profile flops like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bmx-xxx/" data-ref-id="5000-4220">BMX XXX</a>, Acclaim filed for bankruptcy in 2004 and had been defunct--until now.</p><p>Companies like Striker Entertainment, Ridge Partners, Global Force Entertainment, VaynerFund, and JET Management have all come together to revive Acclaim as a game publisher that will "support indie developers and reignite classic franchises." It plans to provide funding, marketing, and PR support for any independent developers it works with. This new version of Acclaim is following in Atari's footsteps; Atari has also revitalized itself in recent years and reimagined classic titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-revisits-an-arcade-classic-with-breakout-beyond/1100-6529212/" data-ref-id="1100-6529212">Breakout</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-and-polybius-creator-are-reimagining-the-rare-arcade-game-i-robot/1100-6529425/" data-ref-id="1100-6529425">I, Robot.</a></p><p>It's unclear what specific franchises this new version of Acclaim has ownership over, as this initial announcement is more focused on confirming members of its new leadership team, like CEO Alex Jose. That also includes Jeff Jarrett, a Hall of Fame wrestler who worked with the old version of Acclaim on its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwf-attitude/" data-ref-id="5000-2348">WWF titles</a>. "Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved," Jarrett said of the revival in a press release.</p><p>No new games were announced alongside this revival of Acclaim, although Josef teased that the company has "already signed some incredible titles, which we'll be revealing soon."</p>
