            <p>Tonight, as part of the Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, called Beyond the Strand, we got a new update on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> franchise. The stream promised to be "a celebratory event" that will include "special guest appearances as well as offer a glimpse into future projects," and it certainly lived up to that promise.</p>
<p>The stream began with a quick recap of Kojima Industries' history so far, from inception through to the announcement and launch of Death Stranding, Death Stranding 2, and the reveals of both OD (2023) and Physint (2024). Towards the end of the project, Guillermo del Toro, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, George Miller and Mamoru Oshii took to the stage to talk about the future of entertainment, gaming, and art. Notably, all of the speakers talk about going 'off-screen' with storytelling.</p>
<p>Then John Hanke, founder of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokemon Go</a> developer Niantic and now boss of Niantic Spatial (an 'AI-led geospatial business platform'), joined Kojima on-stage to present a section devoted to how Kojima plans to 'move beyond the screen,' where the Japanese developer envisions "going to the top of a mountain, and even finding entertainment there".</p>
<p>There's no real hint as to what this project will be beyond a fluffy teaser trailer that seems to be Pokemon Go-meets-Death Stranding. "Kojima Productions and Niantic Spatial Team Up to Redefine Immersive Entertainment" reads a blurb on the trailer, as people wonder around interacting with virtual bonsai trees, golden aura, and other weird environmental aspects. It all looks like stuff from the chiral network in the Death Stranding games, so I imagine our job - as porters via our phones or smart glasses, per the trailer - will be to connect things up.</p>
<p>You can see the latest trailer for Death Stranding x Niantic as part of the livestream below.</p>

<p>This seems like very early concept-level blue sky thinking. It's worth noting that Niantic Spatial isn't quite Pokemon Go developer Niantic: the company was split into a games and geospatial division earlier this year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">the gaming development arm going over to Monopoly Go maker Scopely in a deal worth $3.5bn.</a>
</p><p>Niantic Spatial focuses on a refreshed version of Niantic's original core interest - creating a digital map of the planet, now using geospatial AI. The newly-rebranded company has secured $250m of capital investment ($50m from Scopely and $200m from Niantic's own balance sheet), and this is the first game-related project we've seen from the company.</p>
<p>"We're in the midst of seismic changes in technology, with AI evolving rapidly," Niantic founder John Hanke wrote when talking about the goal of the Spatial platform. "Existing maps were built for people to read and navigate but now there is a need for a new kind of map that makes the world intelligible for machines, for everything from smart glasses to humanoid robots, so they can understand and navigate the physical world.
</p>
<p>It seems Kojima wants to leverage this tech, and paste a Death Stranding experience on the top of this evolving tech that is as-yet-untested in a gaming environment.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> received a warm reception when it launched earlier this year, with Eurogamer calling it a "busier, louder, and more emotionally resplendent take on this singular hiking sim" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">our four star review</a>.
</p>
<p>We're also expecting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-animated-movie-with-original-story-on-the-way-with-raised-by-wolves-writer-attached">a Death Stranding animated movie</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-casually-reveals-a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works">an entirely different Death Stranding anime</a> with an original story, too.
</p>
<p>"I love the world of Death Stranding, it's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honoured that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe," says Raised by Wolves creator Aaron Guzikowski, who is penning the script for the animated feature.</p><p>It's clear the series has some life in it yet, and even with games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/od">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/physint">Physint</a> on the way from Kojima Studios, the storied developer is a long way from giving up on this particular baby, just yet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Kojima Productions has released a brand new teaser for its upcoming Xbox title OD, with the new teaser called OD Knock which is really rather creepy. Much of it is seen from a first person perspective, with the character walking into a room and lighting candles. It sounds fine but there is one candle in the shape of a baby and when it is lit you hear a baby cry. Another candle in the shape of a head bleeds when lit, plus there is the picture of the eye on the window that is watching everything unfold. That’s all before whatever is knocking on the door enters the room.</p>
<p><iframe title="OD - KNOCK Teaser Trailer - [ESRB] 4K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer does not give much away about what OD is, except it looks like it will be some kind of psychological horror with occult vibes. What we know is that it is being touted as &nbsp;a game, a movie and something completely new as well. it uses Unreal Engine, 3Lateral and Metahuman technology. Jordan Peele, the director of movies like Nope and Get Out, is collaborating with Kojima Productions so there will be some creepiness and messages within the story. OD will star Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier.</p>
<p>There is no release date yet for OD, but the game is now in full production following the release of Death Stranding 2. OD is an Xbox exclusive.</p>

<p>Hey, listen!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Zelda: Ocarina of Time" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/22378a2e0cf02/zelda-ocarina-of-time.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Lego released its first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>-themed Lego set last year after ongoing rumours, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/lego-zelda-deku-tree-set-rumours-resurface-online">turned out to be accurate</a>. Now, in an update, there's a new rumour doing the rounds about the next set in this particular series.</p>
<p>Instead of a hybrid set bringing together two different games, this next one is rumoured to be based solely on Link's N64 outing, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>. According to a story from <a href="https://youtu.be/b04dj4jMGgI?t=285">BrickTap</a> (<a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-legend-of-zelda-ganondorf-rumoured-2026/">via Brick Fanatics</a>), it will be a Ganondorf Diorama.</p>
<p>The product name, "which may not be final" as <a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-legend-of-zelda-ganondorf-rumoured-2026/">highlighted by the same source</a>, is supposedly '77093 Ocarina of Time Ganondorf Diorama'. It will apparently contain 1003 pieces and is expected to be much cheaper than the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set as a result (which contains 2500 pieces). As for the launch, it's believed to be arriving in March of next year.</p>
<p>Again, this is strictly a rumour for now, but there would definitely be plenty of potential for a Ganondorf Diorama or at least something similar. He obviously has a huge role and plenty of scenes in Ocarina of Time, so it will be interesting to see what comes of this, if it is the real deal. The Zelda series' 40th anniversary is also taking place next year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-everything-announced-for-super-marios-40th-anniversary">and much like Mario</a>, big celebrations are expected.</p>
<p>If you haven't taken a look at the Great Deku Tree set just yet, be sure to read (or watch) our review. The 2-in-1 build allows you to create the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>. At the time of its release, we called it a striking addition to Lego's growing line of Nintendo sets, awarding it eight out of ten stars.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/783409/od-kojima-xbox-game-trailer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-first-look-at-kojima%E2%80%99s-od-xbox-game.1305060/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hideo Kojima first announced he was teaming up with Xbox for a new game in 2022, before a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993035/hideo-kojima-od-xbox">teaser revealed</a> the <em>OD </em>name and some cast last year. We’re now getting a better look at exactly what <em>OD </em>is, in a new three-minute teaser trailer that holds true to Kojima’s promise that the game will be unique and immersive.</p><p>The trailer begins with Sophia Lillis’ character opening a red door, and then lighting candles — some of which look like <em>Death Stranding</em> babies. With rain pouring down outside and mysterious knocking sounds, it’s clear <em>OD</em> will very much lean into horror for its gameplay as Lillis’ character shakes in fear.</p><p>The trailer also shows off some of the early Unreal Engine work that Kojima Productions is undertaking for <em>OD</em>, alongside Microsoft’s assistance. Xbox chief Phil Spencer confirmed on stage at Kojima Productions’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8uF8VQVT7I">10th Anniversary livestream</a> that development of the game is “well underway,” and that Microsoft is helping with the visuals and technical work.</p><p>“<em>OD </em>is bold, it’s unique, and it’s unmistakably from this studio,“ says Spencer. ”We’re deeply supporting the production, it’s our technical work on Unreal that we’re doing with the team, both with the flashy [elements] you see on the screen, but also a lot of the behind the scenes work.”</p><p><em>OD</em> is billed as something of a cross between a game and a movie, with a promise of exploring concepts that test “your fear threshold.” Unreal Engine will drive the experience of <em>OD</em>, instead of the Sony-owned Decima engine that powers both <em>Death Stranding</em> titles. Kojima had high praise for Unreal Engine at the 10th anniversary event, saying “the technology is one step higher than <em>Death Stranding 2</em>.”</p><p>While we know Jordan Peele is somehow involved in <em>OD</em>, Kojima did note today that the filmmaker is working on another part of the overall <em>OD</em> experience. That might be why the game is subtitled <em>OD Knock</em>, to differentiate it from whatever Peele is working on.</p><p>We still don’t know exactly when <em>OD </em>will arrive, despite promises that development is well underway. “Kojima is innovating in gameplay, story, and player engagement,” says Spencer. “We’re collaborating closely, and we’re very excited for what’s next.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783409/od-kojima-xbox-game-trailer#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/783409/od-kojima-xbox-game-trailer]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Johnny Gioeli:</strong> "Everyone- the news is out that the case agasinst SEGA was dismissed. I want you to understand that the reason for the dismissal was based on time, not on ownership. The song remains in "limbo".</p>
<p>Just 2 weeks ago, I was contacted by Epic Games to potentially use Live &amp; Learn... and the amazing part is SEGA had them call ME for the rights to use the song. So- there you have it. The most epic song remains in the "abyss of ownership".</p>
<p>The song is mine. I wrote it with June, I sing it, I created the melody, I recorded my vocals in my studio, and they do not own it.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for your endless support and love. Life isn't always fair... but we all move forward in love and music. - Johnny</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the original court documents, Gioeli received no compensation, and judgement is in favour of Sega, with the action dismissed in its entirety. If we hear any significant updates or developments, we'll let you know.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Released back in July for the Switch 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> lets you go bananas as Nintendo’s giant ape character Donkey Kong. Players can explore and find goodies by freely punching, smashing and digging their way through bizarre and colorful open-world levels. The game’s quirkiness and fruit-obsession extends to the varied sound effects — many of which were made by the staff themselves. Apparently, a lot of biting and eating was involved…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recently published interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/50508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a>, Donkey Kong Bananza’s producer Kenta Motokura explained: “The noise you hear when digging is actually the sound of someone eating watermelon. The sound team actually bought watermelons and recorded those sounds.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, apparently this was not exactly a relaxing snack break: “Since they couldn’t do many takes, the recording sessions were apparently very tense,” one of the game’s directors, Wataru Tanaka, revealed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/dkbananza-interview-250820/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nintendo Dream Web</u></a>, sound director Naoto Kubo went into even more detail about the level of dedication that went into capturing and manipulating foley sounds to create Donkey Kong Bananza’s satisfying noises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He noted that the team “recorded a huge variety of (real-life) sounds,” which were then adjusted and readjusted before being added into the game. “We spent years creating things like rock destruction sounds, investing that much time and effort in meticulous adjustments,” Kubo explained, adding that the in-house sound team created all the effects you hear in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza employs a variety of sound effects depending on what you are making Donkey Kong interact with. The sound when you punch watermelons in-game was actually made by smashing actual watermelons. However, Kubo recalled that this was a tough one to get right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By the time I got around to recording them, summer was already over,” he explained. “There just weren’t any good watermelons left,” adding that he was able to capture the watermelon smashing sound the following year. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island and Emerald Rush DLC Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the sound effect when you interact with an apple, the team “kept biting into all sorts of things and recording it,” Kubo explained. This included apples, cookies, celery and even hard candies (ouch!). However, in the end they decided that the sound of biting into a real apple was the best. On the other hand, the sound effects for the in-game gold were produced by experimenting with metals brought from a DIY store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other effects were created using a mixture of sounds. The team mixed some of the watermelon-smashing recordings into the sound that plays when you break a hamburger patty in Donkey Kong Bananza, because, as Kubo said, “You don’t get a very good sound when you actually bite into a hamburger patty.” The satisfying “boing” sound that rocks make when you smash through them was likewise created by mixing in a cicada chirp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more in-depth insider info about Donkey Kong Banaza’s development, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-bananas-interview-with-the-developers-of-donkey-kong-bananza"><u>our interview</u></a> with Motokura and Takahashi, and find out why the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review"><u>scored 10/10 in our review</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

We then get some redacted text that reads: Ten years since the [REDACTED] Horror [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]." The Cursed [REDACTED] Have Once Again [REDACTED] Into the Forbidden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We then see the back of the card, which says, "Light the Fires to Celebrate Their [REDACTED] [REDACTED].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More Text: This Building Was [REDACTED] From a 3D Scan of an [REDACTED] Found in an [REDACTED]. And then, [REDACTED] Were [REDACTED] In a Sinister Ritual.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More gameplay was shown of someone entering a room on a stormy day. There is a shrine of sorts, and the character pulls out a match from a box that says "missing." They then proceed to light candles, including one that looks like a baby. When they light that last one, a baby starts crying. They then light another candle shaped like another young person's head and it starts bleeding. We then see our character, who is played by Honor Among Thieves' Sophia Lillis, and she looks absolutley terrified as something approaches her from behind and then grabs her.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It then cuts to credits and we see OD will star Lillis, Hunters' Udo Kier, and Euphoria's Hunter Schafer. Oh, and that it is for "all players and screamers."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, it looks like OD will have a subtitle of Knock and an exploration of the "fear of the knock." Kojima also noted that Jordan Peele will be focusing on another fear for his OD project, but that fear of the knock will be one of Kojima's focuses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also said he wants to go all around the world to scary places and even "scan a ghost for the first time and get an awards for that." </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hideo Kojima Reveals New Details on PlayStation's Physint</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/g1gdnwqaaaaa5o7-1758606163369.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Kojima said he was still in the conceptual phase and working on characters and stories, he was still able to help share a few new details on his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-debut-poster-for-playstation-exclusive-physint-first-cast-announcement">upcoming action espionage project for PlayStation called Phyisnt.</a> We started by seeing a poster of Physint with a male character shrouded in darkness and holding a gun. Along with the character who hasn't been revealed yet, we have the words, "Here comes the feeling." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also shared that Charlee Fraser (Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga), Don Lee aka Ma Dong-seok (Eternals), and Minami Hamabe (Godzilla Minus One) will be joining the cast of Physint. To end the segment, he shared a look at Hamabe's character in the game's engine.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Death Stranding: Mosquito Is the Working Title for a New Animation Project, Trailer Revealed</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-shows-off-first-look-at-death-stranding-animated-film-mosquito">Kojima announced Death Stranding: Mosquito,</a> which is the working title for a new animation project from director Hiroshi Miyamoto (ABC Animation Studio) and writer Aaron Guzikowski. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team wants to differentiate the look of the animation film project and the games, and we got to see this in action in a teaser trailer you can see above. It was also revealed the main character, who is not Sam Porter Bridges, will have the ability to "suck something really important" that isn't blood, and that's why they went with the working title of Death Stranding: Mosquito.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also revealed that Death Stranding: Mosquito is being animated in a very unique style that begins with hand-drawn lines that are then digitally used to create the animation itself. The backgrounds of the film are also being done by Studio Easter, who has previously worked on Dandadan.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kojima and A24 Give a Brief Update on the Death Stranding Movie</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima and A24 took the stage to give a few updates on the upcoming Death Stranding film. The movie's director, Michael Sarnoski, also was on hand to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-movie-will-tell-a-story-you-havent-seen-in-that-world-director-confirms">share a bit about how they are envisioning this adaptation.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this project we really want to capture the soul of the game, capture the themes of the game, but we also want to tell a story that you haven't seen in that world and explore characters you haven't seen before," Sarnoski said. "Also, we want to find all of that scope and all of those incredible real locations, but also find all of those nuanced characters and just do justice to this on a micro and macro scale."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team wants the film to tell a new story in Death Stranding's world that will be familiar to those who have played the game but also not confusing to those who never have. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kojima Productions Partnering With Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group On a Credit Card</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions are collaborating with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group on a brand-new credit card that is aiming to be released in the second half of 2026. This card will also have a smartphone app and digital card to make payments, and it will let users accumulate points and exchange them for merch and goods.

            <p>Tonight, as part of the Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, called Beyond the Strand, we got a new update on the studio's Metal Gear-style project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/physint">Physint</a>.
</p>
<p>The title, which to date has been shrouded in secrecy, is still in the early stages of development, but we did get some confirmations this evening: actors Don Lee, Charlee Fraser, and Minami Hamabe are involved, and Hamabe also featured in an in-engine demonstration in which Kojima specifically noted how pleased he was with the rendering of her skin.</p>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio head Herman Hulst appeared briefly before the segment on Physint, doubling down on the statements about Sony working closely with Kojima Productions on the title.
</p>
<p>The game, as previously teased, is a "stealth action title" a la Metal Gear Solid, and we finally got a little look at the key art for the game - you can see it in the header of this article.</p>
<p>You can see the latest Physint information dump here as part of the livestream below.</p>

<p>All that we knew about Physint before this, really, was that the title was 'some way off'. The last update we had on the game came from Kojima in Auguast 2025, as the influential developer noted he was still working on the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-metal-gear-like-physint-is-still-so-early-in-development-hes-currently-working-on-it-all-by-myself">"all by [him]self"</a>.
</p><p>Physint was announced to be in the works <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">for PlayStation</a> in January 2024, with Kojima Productions describing it as a "next-generation action espionage game" at the time. Apparently, the game would enter full production after the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> - and here we are.
</p>
<p>Back in May, Kojima revealed Physint was now "in development", noting it would likely take him<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-next-espionage-game-physint-wont-be-out-for-a-few-years-yet"> "another five or six years"</a> to complete. It's also a personal project for the storied developer, who has described the game as a "culmination of [his] work", that he wants to "transcend the barriers between film and video games". The title was born<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities"> during a period of sickness and surgery</a>, when thoughts of his own mortality convinced him to 'change his priorities' and do something fans had been asking him to do for years. Cheery, then.</p>

            <p>Tonight, as part of the Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, called Beyond the Strand, we got a new update on the Death Stranding movie. Notably, the project is not going to be a direct adaptation, but an original story set in the world of Sam Porter Bridges, Fragile, and the other characters we recognise from the games.</p><p>

Michael Sarnoski took to the stage to join Kojima to talk about the project (now that he's wrapped work on A Quiet Place: Day One). Sarnoski noted that the movie will include new characters and focus on a new plot, though beyond that, details are fairly sparse.

</p><p>"I think, with this project, we really want to capture the soul of the game, capture the themes of the game, but tell a story you haven’t seen in that world and explore characters you haven’t seen before, and find all of that scope and all of those incredible real locations, but also find all of those nuanced characters and just do justice to this on a macro and micro scale," Sarnoski noted on-stage.
</p>
<p>Kojima is too busy to direct the film himself - unsurprisingly - but the storied developer added that he is, at least, "deeply involved" in the production of the title.</p>
<p>We're also getting an animated movie, alongside A24's live-action effort. The animation, named Mosquito, which will also tell an original story. The name relates to one of the main characters who has the ability to 'take something from you', like a mosquito takes blood.
</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below. </p>

<p>The animation project will be written by Aaron Guzikowski, the writer behind Denis Villenue's Prisoners and the creator of Raised by Wolves.</p>
<p>"I love the world of Death Stranding, it's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honoured that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe," says Raised by Wolves creator Aaron Guzikowski, who is penning the script for the animated feature.</p><p>It's clear the Death Stranding series has some life in it yet, and even with games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/od">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/physint">Physint</a> on the way from Kojima Studios, the storied developer is a long way from giving up on this particular baby, just yet.

            <p>Tonight, as part of the Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, called Beyond the Strand, we got a new update on the studio's peculiar work-in-progress, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/od">OD</a>.
</p>
<p>The title, which Kojima has previously referred to as "a game and at the same time a movie and at the same time a new form of media", got a new trailer during the livestream, as the developer was joined by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a>.</p>
<p>"At Xbox, we empower creators to push boundaries, and that's exactly the game that OD is," said Xbox CEO Phil Spencer when he turned up on stage. Kojima added that he wanted to 'go over the system' of films and games, before showing some footage of OD running on the Unreal Engine (assumedly Unreal Engine 5). This is most likely because the Xbox-backed title isn't allowed to use Guerilla's Decima engine, which is owned by Sony.</p>
<p>You can see the latest trailer here as part of the livestream below. "It's very scary," warns Kojima. I do have to say, the motion capture is astounding, if nothing else. The game gets a new tagline: 'For all players and screamers'.</p>

<p>"We have one goal in mind: to bring Kojima's vision to life for all players everywhere," wraps up Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>The game has a new subtitle: Knock, because Kojima wants to create the fear of the 'knock' - "I am afraid of the 'knock' sound, so I wanted to make that very frightening," says Kojima. Kojima cryptically notes that Jordan Peele is working on another part of the OD experience, so that subtitle, Knock, may refer to a specific episode Kojima is working on himself - it's currently unclear.</p>
<p>Kojima also joked that he 'wants to win an award' for being the first person to motion-capture a ghost, and that the scariest experience of all was standing on-stage next to Phil Spencer. Relatable.</p>
<p>So, what else do we know about OD? </p>
<p>The game first surfaced via rumours in 2022, when word online suggested Kojima was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-latest-project-is-reportedly-a-horror-game-called-overdose">working on a horror title called Overdose</a>. This turned out to be true, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">we got a 10-minute blowout on the game</a> that didn't, really, reveal anything at all. 
</p><p>At least <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoUJh7W2xsY">we got a trailer</a> featuring Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier - all reciting the same eerie rhyme, and each with a different emotional emphasis, as the camera held steady on their faces. It ended with a door slowly creaking open, as seen reflected in Lillis' eyes, and a terrified scream. Intriguing.

<p>The Nintendo version launched in July of this year</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="WWE 2K25" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c45ef279a6a5/wwe-2k25.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo, 2K</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just months after the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> on the Switch 2, 2K Games has now revealed the title's server shutdown date.</p>
<p>As of <strong>14th March 2027</strong>, all online features and services will end for the title. Offline services like Play Now, Showcase MyRISE, MyGM and Universe will continue to be playable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scheduled Online Services Retirement Date</strong></p>
<p><strong>WWE 2K25:</strong> "Online features and services are scheduled to be available until 14th March 2027."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives the title a two-year lifespan since its original release for <em>other</em> platforms on 14th March 2025. Based on this, the time frame is even less for Nintendo players as the Switch 2 version was only released on 23rd July 2025. The physical version of this particular entry is also a "code-in-box".</p>
<p>WWE 2K25 is one of many games to join 2K's scheduled online retirement. Ahead of this, the company will end online services for <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/wwe_2k24">WWE 2K24</a></strong> on 5th January 2026.</p>
<p>Although the winding down of online services in games doesn't appear to be stopping any time soon, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/it-will-have-a-chilling-effect-on-game-design-eu-group-responds-to-stop-killing-games">'Stop Killing Games' consumer movement</a> has been attempting to challenge the legality of publishers "destroying" certain video games sold to customers by revoking access following the cessation of online support.</p>
<p>Recently, a video game lobbying group in Europe (made up of major players in the game industry including Nintendo, Microsoft and more) put forth an argument that maintaining online support indefinitely could have a "chilling effect on game design" and act as a disincentive to make such games available in particular regions.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this and WWE 2K25 in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8af306929e64e/street-fighter-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you've been hanging out for a Switch 2 eShop bargain, it seems the first major third-party one has arrived. Capcom is currently offering <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> (which was a launch title for Nintendo's new system in June) for half price in the US.</p>
<p>This takes this title, which has now surpassed five million combined sales globally, from $39.99 down to just $19.99.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is the base game, so the DLC and Season Pass content is locked off, but there's still a lot on offer. This includes three major game modes and a roster of 18 fighters, including new faces and returning fan favourites. It also features some special gyro game modes exclusive to the Switch 2 version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7pnluwz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Old McPalworld has a farm.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld is getting its first-ever official spin-off game from developer Pocketpair, and it's looking just a little bit cozier than the original game. It's called Palworld: Palfarm, and as the name implies, you and your gaggle of Pals will be farming, crafting, and living a life on the land together on an adventure that looks far more Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley than Palworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair announced the game today with a brand new trailer, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Steam page</a>. These reveal that Palfarm will be a slice-of-life farming and crafting sim set on the Palpagos Islands where familiar Pals will join you to build a dream farm. Alongside growing plants, you can cook with Pals, shop at their stores, give them gifts, and- no, no you can't eat them. Of course not. Not this time. They're farming buddies. Not food.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld: Palfarm First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, most of them. Some Pals will apparently come raid your farm, and you'll have to fight them off. And then maybe when they die, they might drop stuff that looks like food. Okay, maybe you can kind of eat Pals in Palfarm too. Don't think about it too hard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Palfarm does seem to be more focused on the cuddlier aspects of life with Pals, including allowing the player to pet Pals and even get married to other humans (with Pals matchmaking and officiating), it's not without its edges. The trailer includes a look at a black market where you can, yes, get a gun. What would you do with a gun in a cozy game like this? Don't think about it too hard!!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, the trailer showed off a number of Pals that can join you to help on the farm, including what seems to be one unannounced new Pal, Sekhmet, that's working with Anubis as a blacksmith. The Steam page also makes it clear that multiplayer will be an option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palfarm doesn't have a release date just yet, and so far only appears to be in development for PC via Steam, though given Palworld's trajectory it's possible other platforms are in the cards for later on. Palworld itself is currently still in early access, but Pocketpair has said it's planning a small update in December, and is working toward a big 1.0 launch sometime next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision and Treyarch have published a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</u></a> multiplayer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGFYtZD53ZA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reveal trailer</u></a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-deep-dive" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>deep dive blog post</u></a> that shows players everything they need to know ahead of its upcoming beta test.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers behind Call of Duty 2025 offered a multiplayer breakdown in a new post published on the series’ website today. It comes with information about every last map, weapon, and mode fans can expect in Black Ops 7, both during the beta and at launch, while showing off a sneak peek at what it all looks like in motion with today’s trailer. You can see the Black Ops 7 multiplayer reveal trailer, with Travis Scott and Playboi Carti’s FE!N providing the musical backdrop, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s Black Ops 7 multiplayer reveal trailer hits the highlights for those who have about two and a half minutes to spare. While players can be seen darting around corners, sliding and shooting at enemies, and even wall-jumping to reach high-up areas, the footage serves as a reminder that this year’s Call of Duty lets players take advantage of near-future technology. These can be seen in futuristic tools like the Echo Unit hologram decoy as well as Scorestreaks, such as the D.A.W.G. quadruped robot and the remote-controlled Rhino soldier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Classic Call of Duty Scorestreaks like the RC-XD, UAV, Care Package, and more are back, too, with players now able to unlock Overclock upgrades that can improve their usefulness in unique ways. The UAV, for example, has Overclock options that equip it with a flare for missile defense and lower its score cost, while the Rhino gains access to an improved radar and extended runtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Treyarch, of course, still has more up its sleeve, but today’s Black Ops 7 multiplayer reveal really pulls back the curtain on what players can expect when beta early access begins October 2 and at launch. While the beta will only allow access to a limited selection of the content available when Black Ops 7’s November release date arrives, we at least know which of the 18 launch maps players can try out in a few weeks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Scorestreaks</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Maps, Modes, and More</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 7 will launch with 16 Core 6v6 maps. Six from that lineup will be included in the beta, with three returning from 2012’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. You can see the full list of Core maps, as well as the two 20v20 Skirmish maps, below.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Core 6v6 Maps</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Blackheart (Beta)</li><li>Cortex (Beta)</li><li>Exposure (Beta)</li><li>Imprint (Beta)</li><li>The Forge (Beta)</li><li>Toshin (Beta)</li><li>Colossus</li><li>Den</li><li>Flagship</li><li>Homestead</li><li>Paranoia</li><li>Retrieval</li><li>Scar</li><li>Express (Returning from <em>Black Ops 2</em>)</li><li>Hijacked (Returning from <em>Black Ops 2</em>)</li><li>Raid (Returning from <em>Black Ops 2</em>)</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Skirmish Maps</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mission: Edge</li><li>Mission: Tide</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Maps</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As per usual, a new Call of Duty means fan-favorite modes have been refreshed, with new modes for players to look forward to, too. Multiplayer mainstays like Team Deathmatch, Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Hardpoint will be available to play during the beta, with Free-For-All, Gunfight, Kill Order, Control, and Search and Destroy following at launch. There are also Face Off versions of many of these modes, giving players an option to experience classic modes while tuning down the chaos thanks to disabled Scorestreaks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main new mode given the spotlight today is Overload. Also available during the beta, the multiplayer option will see players tasked with bringing an Overload Device to control zones. It flips respawns on as teams guard their device carrier, suggesting teamwork will be an important element in order to achieve victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 7 sticks with tradition by offering new and returning modes, but there are even more gameplay-focused changes for longtime fans to learn, too. The three-Perk system, for example, is getting a facelift with a tweak called Hybrid Combat Specialties.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These are activated when pairing Perks from different categories, allowing players to flex their creative muscles by mixing and matching different Perks for unique upgrades. Some examples laid out by Treyarch include the red-and-blue Scout Specialty, which keeps players’ position temporarily concealed after a bullet elimination, as well as the blue-and-green Operative Specialty, which charges Field Upgrades with stealth kills. Treyarch’s Black Ops 7 multiplayer reveal breakdown also includes a first look at a feature that allows friends to share weapon builds with each other with Build Codes, while also granting the ability to access Gunsmith within the Firing Range in Multiplayer itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has a release date of November 14, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S. Those hoping to for a closer look at how Treyarch has updated its formula for this year’s Call of Duty can pre-order to play the early access beta from October 2 – 5, with the open beta following for all from October 5 – 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-major-game-faces-this-issue-activision-steps-up-war-on-pc-cheaters-ahead-of-black-ops-7-launch"><u>how Activision plans to tackle cheaters</u></a> when Black Ops 7 launches in a few months.

Admittedly, performance on Switch 2 isn't the best--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/io-acknowledges-hitman-performance-issues-on-switch-2-promises-fixes-are-coming/1100-6533116/">but fixes are on the way</a>--and this is a Game Key Card version of the game, so you'll need to have a chunk of free space on the Switch 2 SSD to store the game on.</p><p>You'll also get exclusive--and stylish--DLC, that you can use to dress Agent 47 up like a Mario or a Luigi cosplayer on the Paris fashion circuit.</p></div>                      </div><p>So what makes Hitman so great? Following the mixed reception to Hitman: Absolution, IO Interactive went back to basics with the next chapter in the series. The soft reboot of Hitman was released in an episodic format, and it was followed by Hitman 2 and Hitman 3 in short succession. Improvements from the sequels were retroactively applied to the older games, and the entire experience plays like a toybox for assassins.</p><p>Each mission gives you a target to pursue and execute--don't worry, they're always terrible people or actor Sean Bean--and the magic here comes from figuring out how to make each assassination look like a freak accident. There are opportunities to get rid of your marks with ballistic or neck-snapping methods, but it's far more fun to use killer Yoga, sabotaged race cars, or a vegan cake to deliver some karmic justice. The Hitman games have also been supported with several pieces of substantial post-launch content over the years</p><p>With this version of the game, you're also getting more than just dozens of highly replayable levels. Several modes like Contracts, Escalation, and the roguelike Freelancer will push your skills and your lethal creativity to the limit.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Skate</em> was a video game first released back in 2007 that wasn't particularly interested in the waning days of "skate culture", in so much as it had once existed through the lens of the Vans Warped Tour, Jackass and <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>. It was just a game about you, a skateboard and a public space.</p><p>Which meant it never achieved the same cultural (or commercial) success of the aforementioned Tony Hawk series, but it never wanted to. If Activision's games were about licensed music and weird costumes and fanciful stages, playing like a combo-obsessed fighting game, <em>Skate</em> was the opposite. It was all about the <em>skating</em>; it gave players a control scheme that felt like a simulation, was immensely satisfying to master and was rewarded with cult status as a result.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="skate. Game Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-53C6963x1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Skate </em>did not need to come back. It didn't need any more sequels, or remasters, or remakes, because despite its age it was still perfect, a video game truly representative of its time and place. But the brand carries weight, even after all these years, and publisher Electronic Arts exists these days solely to extract value from the things it owns. So in 2025 we have an all-new <em>Skate </em>game to play, and let me tell you, it fucking <em>sucks</em>.</p><p>The game is a marketplace shakedown in search of an audience. It's the Hello Fellow Kids meme stretched over 8.18GB of hard drive space. Its writing sounds like something penned by a marketing intern after four cans of Monster, its premise--that an AI is following you around telling you when you've unlocked a new tanktop in the skate store--closer to <a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-display-ai-rayban-glasses-ai-fail-demo-lmao-look-at-this-huge-dipshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something Mark Zuckerberg would demo on a stage</a> than anything you'd associate with skateboarding.</p><p>Like just tonally, in terms of letting this run in front of you, it's physically painful to sit through, in a way I haven't experienced since <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k23-2k-review-kotaku-mycareer-impressions-myteam-1849528793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last time I subjected myself to an <em>NBA 2K</em> career mode</a>. Everyone you meet in this game feels like a theater kid improvising as a serial Linkedin poster. The stages have the sanitised energy of an Olympics breakdancing venue based on a <em>Fortnite </em>map.</p><p>I hate everything about it! This game is deeply unpleasant to simply be around, and so the stuff it does do well--it's got blooper potential, the overall controls are similar to the originals and there are some interesting open-world stages where you can pull off some incredible stunts--don't matter. I will not talk about it here and will never explore any of that stuff because I would rather lick the paint off my door than see another lootbox screen or hear a robot tell me to collect my DaKs prize package. </p><figure><figcaption>If you're asking yourself why EA bothered bringing Skate back as a free-to-play game, this is why</figcaption></figure><p>You do not need to play this, you do not need to subject yourself to this, you're better than this! If you need to skate around doing tricks there are plenty of <em>Skate</em>-inspired clones, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-au/games/store/skate-2007/C3QWNCV55VLL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original is available for Xbox</a> or, if you're on PC, you know, you could just <em>find a way</em> to play it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-charlie-kirk-recreations"><h3>Why Major Events Like Charlie Kirk’s Death End Up On Roblox</h3></a><p>'It’s impossible to know who’s doing it for the lulls and the clicks and who’s doing it because they’re radicalizing'</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ea-skate-review-impressions]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Sometimes the difference between nailing that first-time shot or shanking it in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26/" data-ref-id="5000-686587">EA Sports FC 26 </a>comes down to what camera you’re using. With the wrong settings, working out where your support runners are or shots on goal can feel like a real pain.</p><p dir="ltr">But by carefully curating your camera settings to benefit you--and your setup--you can gain the upper hand in pretty much any game mode. So to help you win more games, we’ve been experimenting to find the best camera settings in EA Sports FC 26.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best camera settings for Ultimate Team</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>UT Competitive Camera:</strong> Disabled</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Single Player Camera:</strong> Co-op</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Multiplayer Camera:</strong> Co-op</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Height:</strong> 20</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Zoom:</strong> 0*</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The <strong>co-op camera </strong>gives you the best view of the pitch, in our opinion. It’s a wide angle that gives you visibility on both halves, making it easier to spot player runs and target better through balls.</p><p dir="ltr">We’ve opted to max out the height of the camera to provide a more top-down view, while zoom is zeroed to give you the most visibility. However, if you’re playing on a large TV or sitting far away from your screen, you might want to increase the zoom level to make it easier to play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572413-best-camera-settings-fc-26.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4572413" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572413-best-camera-settings-fc-26.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4572413"></a><figcaption>Personalised camera settings make all the difference in online competitive Ultimate Team games, so spend your time learning what works for you.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572413-best-camera-settings-fc-26.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">We’ve disabled the UT Competitive Camera, which is new to the game, only because we found it too distracting. The setting is meant to give you more visibility of the pitch while still showing off the stadium and its atmosphere. However, we’re here to win games--not look at the stands.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best camera settings for Rush</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Rush Camera:</strong> Rush Tactical</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Height:</strong> 20</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Zoom:</strong> 0</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It’s a similar story for Rush. We’ve changed the camera from the default broadcast to Rush Tactical to improve overall visibility and provide more of a top-down view.</p><p dir="ltr">With only 10 players on a pitch at one time, you need to make use of the space around you - and you can only do that if you can actually see where the space is.</p><p dir="ltr">So those are the best camera settings in FC 26--in our view, at least. You’ll see lots of professional players and streamers playing with different settings online, but the important thing is to play around with them yourself to find what works for you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A newly discovered bug in <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">open-world looter shooter <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is letting players use a specific legendary gun to fling themselves across large sections of the game’s map. It looks wild and could be useful for speedrunners. But Gearbox is watching the glitch and might, if needed, fix it to avoid technical problems.</p> <p>On September 19, Twitch streamer and content creator Bahroo shared a video of himself playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-tips-borderlands-4-guide-help-better-loot-gold-keys-side-quests-tricks-2000626554"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> while pulling off a technique known online as “Cricket Jumping.” The bug relies on a legendary handgun known as the “Noisy Cricket” and its powerful kick, which sends players flying backward. The gun itself is a reference to the <a href="https://meninblack.fandom.com/wiki/Noisy_Cricket">tiny gun with the same name seen in the ’90s sci-fi comedy film<em> Men In Black</em>.</a> Normally, this isn’t the most useful trait. But if you tab out or pause the game at the right time while charging up a shot with the Noisy Cricket, you can send yourself flying for miles. It’s wild to watch in action.</p>  <p>Cricket Jumping has been a known bug since at least September 16, <a href="https://youtu.be/g9qh_8N4QU0">as demonstrated in this short video</a> uploaded by YouTube user Platinum. But it wasn’t until Bahroo and other bigger streamers and creators began sharing videos of the technique that it caught on more and became more publicly known. And that attention eventually got Cricket Jumping spotted by <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s creative director Graeme Timmins. While you might assume someone from Gearbox would not be happy about this bug, Timmins seemed open to not patching it out, provided it doesn’t break the game.</p>

 <p>“I’ve got my eye on this,” replied Timmins to a video of the bug on Twitter. “My only worry is streaming issues or if this introduces instability. Not out to ruin people’s fun, but can’t have it cause tech issues. For now, tho, not going to do anything until proven issues arise.”</p> <p>So for now, it seems like Gearbox is going to let people Cricket Jump all around Kairos, assuming it doesn’t ruin the game for other players or introduce some nasty, less cool bug. Besides, I imagine <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">Gearbox has a lot more to fix in <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> right now, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">horrible console performance problems</a>, and isn’t too concerned about a silly super jump bug.</p>
