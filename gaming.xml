The War has changed.</p><p>These are dark times for freedom loving citizens everywhere. Our galaxy grows cold from the embrace of old enemies returning and darkens with the threat of new <a title="Genres > Horror [539 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s emerging.</p><p>We must now stand together in Super Earth’s light and oppose these sinister tidings. These Omens of Tyranny.</p><p><strong>The Illuminate Return</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Missing for almost a century, the Illuminate will challenge our recruits more than the other factions they have faced. They are advanced, highly-intelligent beings wielding powerful technology that appears to average citizens like a kind of dark magic.</p><p>At the end of the First Galactic War, the Helldivers worked together to eradicate the Illuminate. We believed we were successful, and for nearly 100 years, we have lived in relative peace, holding the Terminid and Automaton threats at bay. Thanks to our continued recruitment and training of new Helldivers, we have held these two fronts with complete, unmitigated success.</p><p>But now the Illuminate have emerged seemingly out of nowhere. Even though we don’t know the true origin of the invasion, we have no choice now but to suppress three factions in the Galactic War.</p><p>The Illuminate are spreading through mind control, abducting citizens of weaker dedication to democratic ideals and brainwashing them for a dark purpose which is still yet unknown to us. These mind-controlled citizens have been twisted and corrupted into a menace we call The Voteless—Super Earth’s own people turned against the principles of Democracy and fair elections, losing their ability to vote entirely.</p><p>The intentions behind the Illuminate invasion are still unclear. Right now, they remain as smaller bands of insurgents, staging attacks, building mysterious structures, and abducting citizens before disappearing again.</p><p>It’s up to us to stop them from getting their totalitarian tentacles any deeper into Super Earth’s domain.</p><p><strong>The Fight at Our Doorstep</strong></p><p>Omens of Tyranny is bringing the fight into the streets, with new mission areas inside Super Earth’s many colonies.</p><p>View and download image<br>Our colonies are being ravaged by these invaders, turning our once bright and sunny streets filled with smiling citizens into dark ruins, overrun by Voteless and Illuminate. Arm yourselves with your trusted tools of destruction and rid our colonies of this scum.</p><p>But it won’t be easy. Gone are the wide-open spaces that Helldivers are accustomed to fighting in. Cities mean closer quarters, dark alleys, and forked paths where one wrong turn means meeting a horde of Voteless to liberate. You’ll need your best and brightest squad to navigate them carefully.</p><p><strong>Go Easy on the Gun, Chief</strong></p><p>With all these new developments, there won’t be time to take driver’s ed. courses, Helldiver. A Fast Recon Vehicle “FRV” will now appear in the colonies, ready to plow through the Illuminate at high speed.</p><p>Keep following the Major Orders issued by Super Earth High Command and you will get the keys to your very own FRV–a brand new, top-of-the-line manual transmission reconnaissance and combat vehicle. The whole squad can ride together, and your passengers can even lean out of the windows to lay down some suppressive fire as you shift gears and speed to your next destination. Just one question left: Who’s driving?</p><p>There’s more to discover yet, and we can’t wait to get you back into the fight.</p><p>The newest major update for <em>Helldivers II,</em> “Omens of Tyranny,” featuring the return of the Illuminate faction, is now live! High Command has ordered all Helldivers to report to their Super Destroyers—it’s time to give these squids hell.</p><p><strong>Introducing DualSense Wireless Controller – <em>Helldivers II</em> Limited Edition</strong></p><p>Eliminate bugs, bots and squids with the Super Earth Ministry of Defense’s sleek new DualSense Wireless Controller – <em>Helldivers II</em> Limited Edition, sporting the iconic yellow and black armor paint scheme.</p><p>The DualSense Wireless Controller – <em>Helldivers II</em> Limited Edition will be available in limited quantities for $84.99 / €84.99 / £74.99. Pre-orders start on December 20, 2024 at participating retailers, with launch on February 6, 2025.

This initial alien force brings with it a number of new enemies to fight against as well as brand new Super Earth colonies to fight on. These colonies introduce Helldivers 2’s first urban environments, with city streets packed with innocent civilians who are mind-controlled by the Illuminate. The Voteless, as they’re called by Super Earth, are little more than zombies who want nothing more than to team players limb from limb.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN, game director Mikael Eriksson said this initial invasion involves the Illuminate Vanguard Fleet and does not appear to be the full faction. Initially, the Illuminate won’t capture planets, rather they are using guerrilla tactics. Eriksson wouldn’t say what they’re up to, but did tease that players will get the chance to influence the ongoing Illuminate invasion as part of a new story set to take place over the course of several months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eriksson also discussed the main differences between fighting the Illuminate and the bots and bugs. One is that the Illuminate are “more difficult,” and fighting against them in urban environments feels constrained compared to fighting the Automatons and the Terminids in open, more naturalistic environments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Illuminate themselves are like demi-gods, with huge walking trip-pod enemies called Harvesters that can one-shot you. On top of that, there’s horde-style gameplay with the mind-controlled civilians to contend with. However, players have a number of new toys to help defend against the Illuminate threat, chief among them Helldivers 2’s first vehicle, the Fast Recon Vehicle (FRV).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The FRV, which initially can only be found at various spots on the map, houses a full squad of players: one driving (manual by default but automatic via accessibility settings), two in passenger seats with lean out and shoot functionality, and one manning the rear turret. The FRV will only be fully unlocked as a stratagem you can call in if and when the Helldivers 2 community completes a new major order, thus making it available to buy in the traditional fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eriksson recommended players bring anti-tank stratagems to help take down the Illuminate spawn ships, encounter ships, and the Harvester enemies, all of which have shields (the new Anti-Tank Emplacement defensive stratagem will prove useful). You’ll need support weapons good against the horde; Eriksson suggested an assault rifle. And it’s a good idea to use the FRV to zip around the maps, particularly on city roads.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers II: Omens of Tyranny Game Awards Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Illuminate join the bugs and bots as Helldivers 2’s third enemy faction, and are set to breathe new life into the explosive third-person co-op action game. Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks following its February launch. Arrowhead has endured a number of controversies in the 10 months since, including a review bomb campaign over publisher Sony’s decision to force Steam gamers to log in to a PSN account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s continued to update the game, adding new content and issuing balance changes that have seen recent Steam user reviews hit ‘overwhelmingly positive.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out IGN's round-up of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2024</a> for more on what's coming to the world of gaming in the years ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It's Naughty Dog's first new franchise in over a decade, and is currently in development for the PlayStation 5. No release window was mentioned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/12/announcing-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-a-new-franchise-from-naughty-dog/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, Druckmann revealed that Naughty Dog has been working on Intergalactic since 2020, and confirmed the main character is played by Tati Gabrielle (Jo Braddock in the 2022 Uncharted movie).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Intergalactic stars our newest protagonist, Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," Druckmann explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In fact, anyone who’s flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past was never heard from again. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Beyond that, we’re keeping everything about the story under wraps – at least for now. What we can tell you is that this game lives up to the Naughty Dog tradition of creating an emotional, character-driven epic journey. Our narrative goals are rivaled only by our gameplay ambitions. This will be the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we’ve ever done before.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Jordan is played by the talented Tati Gabrielle, who leads a stellar cast (pun intended!). Eagle-eyed players might spot some of the other cast members in the trailer. We’ll reveal more of our ensemble down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our incredible voyage into the cosmos also needs an equally incredible soundtrack. As tremendous fans of their work, I’m excited to announce our collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who’ll be scoring Intergalactic! The guys are cooking, and the trailer is just a small tease of their work for the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We know you’re eager for more – and trust us, we’re very eager to share more with you. For now, though, it’s time to put our heads back down and keep cranking away on Jordan’s adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out IGN's round-up of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2024</a> for more on what's coming to the world of gaming in the years ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

While it occupies a place within the existing Mafia universe, Mafia: The Old Country tells a brand new story with a new cast of characters about the origin of the mafia itself. You play a new, original protagonist called Enzo, who survived a childhood of indentured labor in Sicily’s sulfur mines to join Don Torrisi's crime family.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Structurally, Mafia: The Old Country is a “focused package”, a “cinematic experience” set in an authentic representation of 1900s Sicily. Expect “grounded” stealth and gunplay mechanics. Structurally, Mafia: The Old Country is more aligned to Mafia 1 and Mafia 2 than Mafia 3, which was more open-world oriented).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a summer 2025 release window, Mafia: The Old Country is potentially running up close against the behemoth that is Grand Theft Auto 6, a prospect IGN asked about in a new interview with Hangar 13.

            <p>For the 10th year running, The Game Awards 2024 was packed with tons of game reveals this evening, and we've got the complete run-down of everything announced right here. Below, you'll find all the new Game Award trailers shown tonight, as well as a quick rundown of what was actually announced. </p>
<p>A quick note: we're keeping this list focused on proper new announcements and game reveals this year, so you won't find any three-second advert-style trailers saying 'Hey, remember this game exists? Go and buy it now!'. Rather, we're here for the real stuff - all the Game Awards trailers and reveals for the big new blockbusters coming out in 2025 and beyond. So sit back and enjoy every announcement from The Game Awards in order, as they were revealed during the show, because we've got everything from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s next game and loads more besides right here for your viewing pleasure.   </p>

<p>Well, that's certainly one way to kick off The Game Awards pre-show. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> is back with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. Made by The Game Kitchen, the studio behind the rock-hard Soulsy metroidvania <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>, and Dotemu, the publishers behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/streets-of-rage-4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, Ragebound looks set to follow in Blasphemous' 2D pixel art footsteps for an agile, slice and dice adventure that's almost certainly going to kick our collective asses when it arrives in summer 2025.</p>

<p>We've all done it at one point or another. It's carboot Tetris time with One Move Away, which is coming in 2025 to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Think Unpacking but with cars, and you're pretty much there with this one, as it looks like we'll be packing up the same car across several different years at key points in our character's life - and it looks absolutely delightful.</p>
<h2>Slay The Spire 2 gets a new gameplay trailer</h2>

<p>Slay the Spire 2 is already a known quantity, but this latest trailer gives us our best look yet at the sequel to everyone's favourite deckbuilding roguelike obsession. There are hints of four character types down, and lots of nifty looking battles. You'll also be pleased to hear that it's still coming to early access in 2025.</p>

<p>Only the briefest of teases for this one, but everyone's favourite diver Dave is seemingly heading to the jungle for his next adventure. At time of writing, it's unclear whether this is an expansion or a full-blown sequel (likely the former), but whatever it is, it's coming in late 2025.</p>

<p>Warren Spector's studio Otherside Entertainment has unveiled its first game: Thick as Thieves, a multiplayer Thief 'em up that blends heist-based stealth with frantic action as you work to beat other would-be hustlers to the punch as you steal high-value treasures from fancy mansions. It's coming out in 2026, to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p>Riffing on the just-released Pac-Man episode of Amazon's Secret Level TV anthology series, this new take on Pac-Man looks to be an intriguing dark fantasy metroidvania, where old Pac (or Puck, as it's known in the TV show) guides a homegrown creature to the end of a maze-like world. In the episode, Puck manipulates the creature to try and escape, but it looks like you'll have greater control of Puck's monstrous jaw powers here. Still, I'm quietly intrigued by this one.</p>
<h2>Steel Paws is a new mobile game from Yu Suzuki</h2>

<p>Coming to Netflix Games in 2025, Steel Paws is Yu Suzuki's latest - quite a departure from the likes of Shenmue and his more recent Air Twister, but this anime-infused adventure looks to feature a Mega Man-like heroine and her robot buddy as they tackle a Tower of Babel-like structure. No more details as of yet, though.</p>

<p>From the creators of Core Keeper comes new pixel colony sandbox Kyora. It looks delightful in all 30 seconds we're shown of it, but its Steam page reveals it will have a proc-gen world and up to eight player online co-op. </p>

<p>Well, I don't know about you, but I wasn't necessarily expecting the next game from Sifu studio Sloclap to be a footie game. I can hear Taps squealing from here, lemme tell you. Rematch is an online multiplayer game that's primarily built for 5v5 matches, but other modes will be coming post-launch, as well as other seasonal bits and pieces as well. Rematch is set to launch on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5 and PC next year.</p>

<p>Solasta: Crown of the Magister is an enormous RPG, and now its sequel has been confirmed for an early access release in 2025, with a demo coming very soon, according to its new Game Awards trailer. Set decades after the events of the first game, this sequel will take players to the high fantasy world of Neokos, where they'll roll dice using the D20 system to guide their party through all sorts of fantastical adventures. And wouldn't you know it? They've even got Baldur's Gate 3's narrator Amelia Tyler on board, too.</p>

<p>If the tub didn't give it away, the white braid certainly did. The Witcher 4 looks absolutely gorgeous in this (albeit cinematic) reveal, and a grown-up Ciri sure is a dab hand with that sword and magic fire chain, isn't she? Yes please and thank you, CD Projekt Red. Tech heads will no doubt have clocked that the trailer was put together on an unannounced Nvidia RTX GPU as well. Time to upgrade your rig for this? Almost certainly. Luckily, there's no release date yet, so hopefully we'll have plenty of time to save up.</p>

<p>Despite FromSoftware saying Elden RIng 2 wasn't in development mere weeks ago, it sure looks like the studio is making more Elden Ring. This time, with multiplayer. But don't call it a sequel, whatever you do. Described as a standalone game by Geoff Keighley in his pre-amble, and then as a co-op action survival game after the trailer aired, this is Elden Ring: Nightreign, and it's coming in 2025.</p>

<p>So much for getting a PS5 Pro to play FF7 Rebirth with fancier graphics again… It's coming to PC on January 23rd 2025. That's, like… really soon! Weeks away, in fact! What a treat! The trailer touts improved lighting, enhanced textures and modelling, as well as DLSS and VRR and more, and I'm sure Digital Foundry will be delivering their expert verdict on all of that lovely stuff very soon.</p>

<p>Move over Stray, this photo-realistic fantasy cat adventure is here to steal your milk. The thing that really bemuses me about this is that it's coming to PC, Apple Watches and Nintendo Switch of all places, and I'm pretty sure only one of those platforms will be able to do its fluffy furballs justice on the graphics front. Still. No release date yet, but more info is promised next year.</p>

<p>Cor, it's been a hot minute, hasn't it Fumito Ueda? Here's our next early glimpse at the next game from Gen Design, the maker of Ico, Shadow of the Colossus and The Last Guardian. It's just a teeny look, admittedly, showing a young boy climbing up a large robot and then taking off inside… its head(?) as we see the body being overtaken by a nasty looking shockwave of some kind. It's currently untitled, but the eagle-eyed among you will have spotted 'Project Robot' as a codename in the credits screen. Consider my curiosity piqued.</p>

<p>Can you sense Obsidian is maybe just a teeny bit aware of the shortcomings of the first Outer Worlds? In this new trailer, it boasts "more action, more weapons, and more graphics?" with a bemused eyebrow raise. But hey, it looks to be shaping up quite nicely i you ask me - and we got a release year too. It's coming in 2025 to Xbox Series X/S, Game Pass, PC and, curiously, PS5. No word yet if that PS5 release will be delayed like Indiana Jones, but watch this space.</p>

<p>From the studio behind It Takes Two comes another co-op action adventure. This time, you take control of two writers who get trapped in a simulation of their respective fantasy and sci-fi novels. Just like It Takes Two, each character will have their own special weapons and items that evolve over time and complement each other when it comes to solving puzzles - dragons with different abilities, for example, or special exo suits that let you Morph Ball around. It's coming in quite soon, too, in March 2025.</p>

<p>The latest game from World of Tanks studio War Gaming, Steel Hunters is an enormous mech fest with lots of robots and big explosions. Think Apex Legends but everyone's in a giant mech suit and that's pretty much Steel Hunters in a nutshell. You'll play as one of seven units in teams of two, and you'll be stomping and flying around lush green worlds - which will presumably be a muddy shade of brown by the time you're done with it. If you'd like to try this free-to-play shooter for yourself, a ten-day beta will begin on PC later this evening.</p>

We get to see all four of the main characters in action, as well as fountains of multi-coloured loot. Oh what fun. It's coming in 2025.</p>

<p>New from Saber and featuring a lot of dinos, Turok is back. I last played Turok on the N64 where the frame rate was so low, and the draw distance so near that I almost always got munched by said dinos within seconds of trying to play it. Luckily, Turok Origins doesn't look to be plagued by any of those issues whatsoever, with lots of silky smooth frame rates and powerful weaponry to take those clever dinos down. Yes please, mates.</p>

<p>Well, here's a thing. Netmarble is making a new Game of Thrones game featuring all your favourite actors from HBO's TV show, including yer man Jon Snow Kit Harrington. Well, everyone apart from <em>one</em> Game of Thrones character, as it looks like you'll be playing an infinitely more generic Northman who could be literally any gruff hulk fantasy man. Still, an intriguing proposition for Game of Thrones fans. It's coming in 2025.</p>

<p>Tensions are high in the new trailer for Mafia: The Old Country, which are only likely to get even hotter as it gears up for its just-announced release window of summer 2025. Cor, next summer is going to be pretty stacked at this rate, isn't it?</p>

<p>Featuring the voices of Aaron Paul and Laura Bailey, Dispatch is an animated superhero game where you must, yep, 'dispatch' heroes to fight crimes around the city. Curiously, the trailer says it's from the studio behind The Wolf Among Us and Tales From The Borderlands, but before you go gooey-eyed about Telltale, the studio behind this one is Adhoc. No release date yet, but consider me quietly intrigued by this one.</p>

<p>Well, there you have it, Naughty Dog heads. The next game from director Neil Druckmann is something quite a bit different from what's come before, featuring a bounty hunter in space who also has a rad laser sword to take down huge beasties. It looks pretty cool! As cinematic trailers go, at least. But hey, you can't fault a trailer with The Pet Shop Boys. Let's take a look one more time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/steel-hunters-combines-mech-warfare-and-extraction-in-wargamings-latest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Venn diagram of people who like tanks and people who like giant mechs might not just be one circle, but it’s probably close enough that it will feel like you’re looking at one of those red and blue 3D pictures without the glasses on. So, having already covered the land, sea and air battles of World of Tanks, Warplanes and Warships, it makes perfect sense that Wargaming’s next game would go all mecha. Enter the Steel Hunters.</p>
<p><iframe title="STEEL HUNTERS - GAMEPLAY REVEAL" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMtdbfsXiY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set in a post-cataclysm world, in which Starfall has polluted the world (because we clearly weren’t doing a quick enough job of it) and forced mankind to evacuate and live in space stations, you’ll play as a Hunter sent back down to the planet to try and harvest Starfall for all the energy and resource it can provide the orbital populace.</p>


<p>It’s a pretty generic premise, and don’t expect to be too surprised by the genres that Wargaming is targeting here, either. This is a blend of hero shooter, battle royale and extraction shooter. But… mechs are pretty dang cool.</p>
<p>Six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, their gigantic mechs keeping them safe from the elements, and handily helping you absolutely massive as you stomp around the world and come across towns, bridges, cars and other manmade structures that have now been left abandoned.</p>


<p>At launch there’s seven hunters to choose from, with the very standard Razorside an all-rounder with frag grenades and a shield recharge ability. Much cooler are the two quadrupeds Ursus and Fenris, who have missiles and greater mobility as their advantages. Heartbreaker is then a sniper stealth assassin, Prophet a glass cannon who’s best staying away from the fight and summoning drones, while Trenchwalker is the combat medic with a grenade launcher.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better than two or four legs? How about eight! Weaver is an arachnid that’s all about territorial control, deploying one-way shields and being able to switch to a minigun mode that slows movement but allows you to put down a lot of firepower.</p>
<p>There’s a good, solid mixture of different archetypes here, and Wargaming will have plenty of ideas of new mechs to add down the line. What’s also important is how they work together. You’ll always drop and fight as a pair, so having Trenchwalker, Prophet or Weaver could be great for their various forms of second line support abilities alongside a faster-moving Fenris to quickly show force to enemy teams.</p>

<p>Still on the planet are drones that you will want to attack to gain loot from them, whether that’s a boost to shields, energy cells (which feed an in-match experience system), repair kits and more. Each mech has unlockable abilities as you gain experience and work up through five levels –&nbsp;level 3 unlocks the second ability. There’s some potential here for different builds to emerge that can add to the player synergies and tactical choices as well.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of your tactics will be determined by the game mode. Starfall Harvest has you heading to try and capture and hold towers that will give bonuses to radar, buffs and the like. Mid-game events will also spice things up with a Tag Hunt, where you need to collect the tags of fallen Hunters, and this can lead to unlocking the Colossus if you collect enough –&nbsp;this will transforms you into an even bigger mech for a short amount of time, which can be a powerful bonus.</p>

<p>It will all come to a head with a final extraction phase, as you need to reach the extraction point and hold the position until time runs out or you defeat all the remaining teams. A tiny bit disappointing, only one pair can extract and win, so there’s none of the social mind games of The Division’s Dark Zone, though it will still build up to a natural fever pitch at the end.</p>
<p>In contracts to their empire of historical wargames, Steel Hunters will be quite the change of pace. From tanks with tracks to big stompy mechs, and from pitched battles to a PvPvE game mode that latches onto all the buzzword multiplayer genres currently dominating gaming, will this start a bold new era for the company?</p>
<p>Well, the proof will be in the playing, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/wargaming-reveal-giant-mech-battler-steel-hunters-10-day-playtest-now-on/">a playtest is now on from 12th to 22nd December</a>, ahead of a wider launch next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Every edition of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Awards</a> needs a headliner announcement, and this year, it was Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Don’t recognize that name? You shouldn’t, it’s a new IP, but you will recognize the developer – <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naughty Dog</a>.</p>
<p>The first teaser trailer for Intergalactic is light on details, but we are introduced to Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter who’s tracking a quarry to the dangerous planet of Sempiria. Most of the trailer is focused on showing off Jordan and Naughty Dog’s always-cutting-edge facial animation tech, but we do get a hint of what gameplay might be like at the end of the video as we see our hero taking on a robotic enemy with a laser sword. So, it looks like the focus is on melee combat and the inhospitable planet hints at perhaps survival elements. But enough of my preamble, take a look at Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for yourself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLGy63pt9vA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Consider me intrigued! We’ve known for a while that The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann’s next thing would be a new sci-fi IP, and this is obviously it. We don’t know yet if Druckmann is actually writing and/or directing Intergalactic but his name is attached to a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/12/announcing-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-a-new-franchise-from-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog post</a> that reveals a bit more info about the game…</p>
<p><em>“Intergalactic stars our newest protagonist, Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. In fact, anyone who’s flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past was never heard from again. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that, we’re keeping everything about the story under wraps – at least for now. What we can tell you is that this game lives up to the Naughty Dog tradition of creating an emotional, character-driven epic journey. Our narrative goals are rivaled only by our gameplay ambitions. This will be the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we’ve ever done before.</em></p>
<p><em>Jordan is played by the talented Tati Gabrielle, who leads a stellar cast (pun intended!). Eagle-eyed players might spot some of the other cast members in the trailer. We’ll reveal more of our ensemble down the line. Our incredible voyage into the cosmos also needs an equally incredible soundtrack. As tremendous fans of their work, I’m excited to announce our collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who’ll be scoring Intergalactic! The guys are cooking, and the trailer is just a small tease of their work for the game.”</em></p>
<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet has been announced for PS5. A release window has yet to be revealed.</p>

Capcom are working on a sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/okami">Okami</a>, the wonderful 2006 Zelda-like in which you play a sun goddess in a wolf's body, roaming a world of ink and parchment. It’s being co-developed by M-TWO Inc, Machine Head Works Inc and CLOVERS Inc, and directed by original Okami game director Hideki Kamiya. I am tickled pink, I tell you. Find a trailer below.

<p>
There’s not much to share at this stage - the game doesn't even have a formal title - but we do have a little blurb from Capcom. Here it be: “Okami is a game critically acclaimed for its unique world, heartwarming story, and exciting adventures. Now, a new adventure in the same vein as Okami has been set in motion.”</p>
<p>The trailer is a departure from the sumi-e-inspired visuals of the original game – it’s gaudier and, er, hairier. Perhaps a bit too busy for comfort, next to the crowded but crisp scrollwork of the first one. But there are plenty of familiar sights: the goddess Amaterasu herself, galloping through verdant fields, the spinning Reflector dish on her back, and the Celestial Brush dropping cheekily into view at the end.
</p><p>
I was not expecting a new Okami game in this, the year 2024. (I wasn’t expecting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-the-capcom-action-rpgs-first-new-instalment-in-almost-20-years">a new Onimusha</a>, either. Nice work, Capcom.) The first one is perhaps less amazing in hindsight – it’s messy in a way Zelda isn’t, with some stodgy action-RPG elements and some repetitive fights. But my goodness, it has vision and heart and imagination in spades. I still play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLMLXfwUJrk">the intro movie</a> now and then to perk myself up. I never did get round to playing Ōkamiden, the Nintendo DS spin-off. Time to change that, perhaps.
</p>
<p>It's something of a homecoming for Kamiya, who left Capcom to co-found PlatinumGames back in 2006. Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bayonetta-director-hideki-kamiya-is-leaving-platinum-to-work-on-new-projects">he left Platinum to go independent</a>, commenting that he would "continue to create in my Hideki Kamiya way". He's been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/06/17/hideki-kamiya-hints-at-okami-2-and-bayonetta-3-5950079/">hinting about ideas for an Okami sequel</a> for years.</p>

The teaser trailer was short, but did confirm the game will come out in late 2025.</p></div><div><p><em>Deus Ex </em>lead Warren Spector’s next project, <em>Thick as Thieves</em>, is up next. The first-person, parkour-based heist game is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div><div><p>Bandai Namco revealed a new <em>Pac-Man </em>game that makes the <em>Secret Level </em>episode based on the original arcade superstar make a lot more sense. The side-scrolling action game <em>Shadow Labyrinth </em>includes some <em>Pac-Man </em>iconography, but is a wholly different beast. It’s launching in 2025 on Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div><div><p><em>Steel Paws</em> is a new mobile game from <em>OutRun </em>creator and&nbsp;<em>Shenmue </em>lead Yu Suzuki. We didn’t see any in-game footage, but it did have an animated trailer announcing it will only be available through Netflix’s app.</p></div><div><p>Next we got a new look at the upcoming <em>Lord of the Rings </em>management sim <em>Tales of the Shire</em>. The footage is narrated by streamer CozyK, and showcases some of the cooking and home decoration mechanics. The game will launch on March 25.</p></div><div><p>Following up cozy with chaos is a cinematic trailer for <em>Stalcraft X Operations</em>, which will launch in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Up next is <em>Midnight Murder Club</em>, a game seemingly about making rich people kill each other for sport? It has a crossplay beta going on between PlayStation 5 and PC, and will enter early access in February.</p></div><div><p><em>Kyora </em>is a multiplayer adventure game in which you and your friends go digging through mines and seemingly discover something frightening in the depths below. It’s coming to Steam early access.</p></div><div><p><em>Sifu </em>developer Sloclap premiered its next game <em>Rematch</em>, a soccer game that has a similar visual style to the martial arts game the studio released in 2022. It definitely looks more arcade-y and stylish than your more traditional football games like <em>FIFA</em>.</p></div><div><p>Wrapping up the pre-show is <em>Solasta II</em>. The tactical RPG will enter early access in 2025, and has a demo coming “soon.”</p></div><div><p>The first game of the show proper was <em>The Witcher IV</em>. The game stars Ciri, Geralt’s adopted daughter. CD Projekt Red revealed the game with a cinematic trailer showing Ciri save a woman from some horrible beast, only to send her home to a monster of a different kind. </p></div><div><p>Damn, they’re really frontloading the show this year. Next up is <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. It’s a co-op game set in the <em>Elden Ring </em>universe and is coming in 2025. There are some notable traversal elements like parkour and flight that make it look more fast-paced and fluid than some of the studio’s past work. </p></div><div><p>To bring us all back down to earth, we got an announcement that <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth </em>is coming to PC on January 23, just under a year after the game first launched on PlayStation 5.</p></div><div><p>After a trailer for <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, a game that is already out, we got a cinematic trailer for the cat lovers in the house. <em>Catly</em> is a Steam, Switch, and mobile game that features cats, and that’s about all I can tell you from that trailer. This was immediately followed by a trailer for <em>Path of Exile II</em>. I guess some of the ads are more overt than others.</p></div><div><p>Nevermind, there’s still cool things happening. Next is a new game from genDESIGN, led by Fumito Ueda, the lead behind <em>Ico</em>, <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, and <em>The Last Guardian</em>. It seems like he’s going the science fiction route this time. It doesn’t have a title yet. Alright, cool. I will be seated.</p></div><div><p>Obsidian showed up with a very cheeky, action-packed trailer for <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. The sequel will launch in 2025 and will have “everything that should have been in the first game.” Including “more action, more weapons, and more...graphics?”</p></div><div><p>Hazelight’s Josef Fares took the stage and said some things that would definitely have been bleeped out on live television in talking up the studio’s newest game, <em>Split Fiction</em>. Like previous releases from the studio, it’s a cooperative game, but its vibe is much different from <em>It Takes Two</em>, and it takes place in a virtual reality split between both a fantasy and science fiction world. It seems to follow the gameplay structure of <em>It Takes Two</em>, however, with each section centering a different gameplay mechanic. Like previous Hazelight games, you’ll only have to buy the game once to play it with a friend. It launches on March 6.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a2cb4e2b03d6b80469eef7dc8c5e0cb1" data-recommend-id="image://a2cb4e2b03d6b80469eef7dc8c5e0cb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Amir Satvat gives his speech while TGAs' hosts watch from the sidelines." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amir Satvat gives his speech while TGAs' hosts watch from the sidelines." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Game Awards / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a2cb4e2b03d6b80469eef7dc8c5e0cb1" data-recommend-id="image://a2cb4e2b03d6b80469eef7dc8c5e0cb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Amir Satvat gives his speech while TGAs' hosts watch from the sidelines." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Keighley surprisingly had an entire segment dedicated to addressing the widespread plague of video game industry layoffs in the past year. He also took the time to spotlight Amir Satvat, who gave a tearful speech discussing the state of the industry and his efforts to help people find work after losing their jobs over the past few years.</p></div><div><p>All right, well, that was heartwarming. Time to get back to blowing shit up. Next was <em>Steel Hunters</em>, a mech combat game which showed off some pretty sick gameplay. Its PC beta test is available now.</p></div><div><p>Following all that mayhem was a drastic shift in tone with <em>Blackfrost: The Long Dark II</em>. The melancholy trailer included an announcement that the game will launch in early access next year.</p></div><div><p>One of the announcements we knew about coming in was the first gameplay reveal for <em>Borderlands 4</em>. It started with a cinematic trailer and I thought they might be ditching the cel-shaded style of previous games, but when the actual gameplay started it looked much more like a <em>Borderlands </em>game. It’s gotta be better than the movie, am I right?</p></div><div><p>With apologies to the Tifa stans, <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s Clive Rosfield is coming to <em>Tekken 8</em>. A 72-hour early access period to play the character begins on December 16.</p></div><div><p>Next was a trailer for <em>Splitgate 2</em>, which is coming in 2025.</p></div><div><p>After an ad break and a musical performance, <em>Yakuza </em>developer RGG Studio revealed that a new <em>Virtua Fighter </em>is in the works, and more information will be coming during a stream on December 13 at midnight eastern time. So...in a few hours.</p></div><div><p>Next up is <em>Project Century</em>, a new game from RGG Studio set in 1915 Japan. We don’t know much about it yet, but it seems to bring in some of the beat-em-up antics of the <em>Yakuza </em>series.</p></div><div><p>After Hideo Kojima presented the award for best game direction to <em>Astro Bot</em>, we got a cinematic trailer for the new <em>Turok </em>game called <em>Turok Origins</em>. This was followed by a brief bit of gameplay showing off the shooting mechanics and dinosaur fights.</p></div><div><p><em>Helldivers 2 </em>got a new update called <em>Omens of Tyranny</em>, which shadow-dropped during the show. </p></div><div><p>Next was a trailer for <em>Warframe</em>’s upcoming <em>1999</em> expansion, which launches tomorrow.</p></div><div><p>I’m sorry, I’ll get to what was shown in a second. But does <em>Palworld</em>, a game that’s officially in legal trouble for copying <em>Pokémon</em>, seriously have what looks almost exactly like the Psychos from <em>Borderlands</em> running around the game, too? Anyway, it’s getting a new expansion called <em>Feybreak</em> on December 23.</p></div><div><p>We also got a new trailer for <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, though there was a brief question of whether or not it was for that game or <em>Genshin Impact</em> in the <em>Kotaku </em>Slack.</p></div><div><p>Capcom was up next with a reveal of a new <em>Onimusha </em>game called <em>Way of the Sword</em>. There wasn’t any gameplay, but it had a pretty dope cinematic trailer. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox Series X/S in 2026.</p></div><div><p>The Russo Brothers made an appearance to reveal a bloody cinematic trailer for <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em>. The game is set to launch on March 27.</p></div><div><p><em>Arad</em>, an open-world action RPG set in the <em>Dungeon &amp; Fighter </em>universe, was revealed with a cinematic trailer of pretty anime characters going on adventures, fighting monsters, and doing magic...all set to an Atomic Tom song, for some reason.</p></div><div><p>Next up we have a new look at <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, the upcoming entry in the open-world zombie series from Techland. Back is the series’ building-spanning parkour, as well as a whole lot of ways to violently kill zombies. The game is coming out in summer 2025.</p></div><div><p>Netflix showed up briefly to tease <em>Squid Game Unleashed</em>, a new game launching on December 17 based on the streaming service’s smash hit whose second season is coming soon.</p></div><div><p>Ghost Town Games, the developer behind <em>Overcooked</em>, revealed a new game called <em>Stage Fright</em> with a teaser trailer that ended up being a fourth-wall-breaking bit that extended into The Game Awards’ venue. It’s a cooperative game made in collaboration with <em>No Man’s Sky </em>developer Hello Games.</p></div><div><p>The new <em>Game of Thrones </em>RPG <em>Kingsroad</em> made an appearance at The Game Awards, and it includes the likenesses of several characters from HBO’s adaptation. The game is set to launch in 2025.</p></div><div><p>After another ad break (which included a look at&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>coming to PC on April 3), we got a new look at heist game <em>Den of Wolves</em>. The game will enter early access at some point, but the window they gave in the trailer was just “202...”</p></div><div><p>Hoyoverse showed up with a new trailer for <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>’s new character Astra. The team also showed a new trailer for <em>Honkai Star Rail</em>’s <em>The Eternal Land </em>update. </p></div><div><p>Keighley said “we are far from done” before bombarding us with a bunch of ads. But then we got a cool little tease of Shadow the Hedgehog in a car in a new entry of <em>Sonic Racing</em> called <em>CrossWorlds</em>. He seems to be driving into some kind of portal, which makes me wonder if this is going to be some kind of crossover game.</p></div><div><p>Another game we knew we’d see during the show was <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>. We saw a bit of the crime drama’s cinematics, but not much in the way of gameplay. The game will launch in the summer of 2025.</p></div><div><p>Aaron Paul and Laura Bailey took to the stage for an extremely awkward  interaction as they introduced&nbsp;<em>Dispatch</em>, an upcoming superhero management adventure game by ex-Telltale developers. It will launch in 2025.</p></div><div><p>The penultimate big announcement of the night was a surprise. Capcom announced a new sequel to <em>Okami</em>, its beloved 2006 <em>Zelda</em>-like. Hideki Kamiya is returning to direct, but it sounds like the game isn’t even in production yet,&nbsp;so we probably won’t see that for a few years.</p></div><div><p>The final announcement of the show was a new science fiction game from Naughty Dog, the developers of <em>The Last of Us</em>. After over a decade of alternating between <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em>, the studio is finally working on something new called <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>. The game is being directed by Neil Druckmann, stars <em>The Last of Us </em>show actor Tati Gabrielle, and will feature a score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Swedish studios 10 Chambers announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-payday-dev-reveals-sci-fi-heist-game-den-of-wolves/1100-6519810/" data-ref-id="1100-6519810">Den of Wolves</a> at last year's Game Awards, so it's only fitting that The Game Awards hosted the debut of the first gameplay trailer this year. As touted in the trailer below, Den of Wolves is being produced by Payday co-creator Ulf Andersson, and it already looks like a wild ride.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlKiBVO1GLE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RlKiBVO1GLE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This game is a co-op first-person shooter that doubles as a heist game. With your teammates in tow, Den of Wolves allows players to mount stealth operations and other "unauthorized errands" on behalf of their clients while navigating the futuristic Midway City. But sometimes, plans are just going to go off the rails and you'll have to shoot your way out of trouble.</p><p>Den of Wolves isn't an open-world game, but the the mythology and history of Midway City will drive the narrative. According to 10 Chambers' Simon Viklund, it's meant to be "a believable city of the near future where late-stage capitalism has gone rampant, and corporations set the rules." Players begin as a blank slate before diving into the criminal underworld and making alliances in addition to taking jobs on the black market.</p><p>The teaser stopped short of announcing when early access will arrive, but Den of Wolves is already available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818140/Den_of_Wolves/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to wishlist on Steam</a>.

            <p>A sequel to Okami is in the works, thanks to a partnership between Capcom and Hideki Kamiya's new studio, Clovers.</p>
<p>The news of a sequel was announced at this evening's Game Awards, with a rather beautiful teaser trailer. "Okami sequel project is underway," reads the short blurb. "Okami is a game critically acclaimed for its unique world, heartwarming story, and exciting adventures. Now, a new adventure in the same vein as Okami has been set in motion."</p>
<p>You can check out the teaser for Okami's sequel below, which is still a while away from release. "It will be some time before we greet you again, but we really hope you look forward to this project," reads <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/o-kami_newproject/en-us/">Capcom's page</a> on the Okami sequel.</p>

<p>Clovers with an s is not to be confused with Clover, the studio which developed Okami and which Kamiya was a part of. This studio was unfortunately shuttered not too long after Okami's debut. Earlier this year, Kamiya said Okami was a "huge failure" in terms of initial sales, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okamis-initial-sales-were-huge-failure-says-director-hideki-kamiya">had it been more successful, Clover "would have probably continued"</a>. Thankfully, though, the studio seems to be getting a bit of a revival with Clovers. Many of Okami's original staff members are returning for the sequel, which is also be worked on by M-TWO Inc. and Machine Head Works Inc.</p>
<p>After its initial launch in 2006, Okami was ported to the Wii with motion controls, before a HD version was released. We were full of praise for this version on its release.</p>
<p>"It's a classic game and an essential part of any collection, especially in this flawless, gorgeous reissue. And it casts you as a character like no other in a world like no other," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-hd-review">Eurogamer's Okami HD review</a>.</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

            <p>
A month after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-developing-another-virtua-fighter-game">casually dropping the bombshell</a> another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a>'s in the works, Sega has officially unveiled its long-awaited franchise revival to the world - all during a Game Awards blow-out that also saw it dusting off its Sonic Racing series for another dash around the track, plus a brand-new game from the studio behind Like a Dragon, this time set in 1915.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Virtua Fighter, it's fair to say a new instalment has been a long time coming. 18 years have now passed since the series' most recent numbered instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a> - with Sega having riffed on that particular entry across various remasters and revisions since then. But at long last, an all-new Virtua Fighter game is on the way. Details are limited at presented - other than the fact it's being developed by Like a Dragon's Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio - but more will be revealed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVRktI34LfU">special VF Direct</a> later today.

<p>
And speaking of Like a Dragon, Sega's also teased a new game from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio that bears some striking similarities with the hugely popular crime series. It's a third-person action game with real-time combat set in a open city, this one whisking players back to 1915. Again, there's not much more to report (Sega's just referring to it as Project Century right now), but at least we know there's more Like a Dragon-style action to look forward to once Pirate Yakuza arrives in February next year.

<p>
And as for Sega's final The Game Awards announcement, it's the return of knockabout karting series Sonic Racing, which is poised to receive its first new instalment since 2019's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a>. Unfortunately, there's not much to report about this one either, beyond the fact it's called Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, but Sega is promising "new roads await" and that it's "coming soon". So why not enjoy its 15 second trailer while we wait for more information?

		<p>Naughty Dog’s next new game and franchise is Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a game that will see the studio leap into the realms of science fiction with a setting thousands of years in the future.</p>
<p>The name might sound familiar, as a trademark that Sony registered a little while back. This game has been in development since 2020 and is expected to launch for PlayStation 5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o7TVPoxwi74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Intergalactic casts players as Jordan A. Mun (played by Tati Gabrielle), a bounty hunter stranded near Sempiria, a planet that was cut off from the rest of the galaxy hundreds of years ago. There’s a pretty simple goal here, it seems, to collect bounties, and to escape orbit and get out into the real galaxy once more.</p>
<p>“Beyond that, we’re keeping everything about the story under wraps,” Neil Druckmann said, revealing the game on the PlayStation Blog. He continued,&nbsp;“This will be the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we’ve ever done before.”</p>

<p>The focus will be just as much on characters and emotional storytelling as Naughty Dog’s last few games, with a broad ensemble cast that’s yet to be revealed – we’d put money on Troy Baker having some role, though. The soundtrack will come from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, as you can hear in the trailer.</p>
<p>The game leans in on retro-futuristic tech, with a snazzy Porsche space ship, featuring more than a few CRT screens, Sony multi-disc CD player, puffy Cyberpunk-y jackets, and all the rest. Plenty of familiar fodder, but we’re very keen to see how Naughty Dog can weave a rich tapestry around this – after all, The Last of Us is an all-time great game, but it’s built around a very zombie apocalypse adjacent world and setting.</p>

		<p>Adhoc Games had a reveal trailer for Dispatch at The Game Awards, a superhero workplace comedy from the writers and directors of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a>.</p>

<p>Starring Aaron Paul as a de-suited Robert Robertson, AKA Mecha Man, he has to adapt to life without powers, but still with a role to play. He joins the superhero dispatch center and ends up in charge of rehabilitating ex-supervillains back onto the straight and narrow. Also amongst the cast are Laura Bailey and Jeffrey Wright.</p>
<p>There will be segments where you manage sending out heroes to answer calls for help, as well as juggling the roster of heroes that you have, managing their particular skills and abilities as they unlock, but there’s also plenty of other points where you delve into office relationships and chat to people.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/okami-is-getting-a-sequel-with-hideki-kamiya-once-again-taking-the-reigns.1060398/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Late last year, Devil May Cry and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya made the surprising announcement that he was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-leaving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the studio he co-founded, PlatinumGames</a>. At the time, we didn’t know what Kamiya’s next step might be, but now we do. Tonight at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Awards</a> we got a first peek at a revival of another beloved Kamiya creation – Okami.</p>
<p>At present, the new game doesn’t have an official title, it’s simply being referred to as “Okami Sequel.” The brief teaser trailer shows Amaterasu running across a large open field, perhaps implying the new game’s world will be expanded compared to the original. While the visual style of the game has been updated somewhat, it still definitely has a “painted” look. And yes, at the end we get the words “Game Director Hideki Kamiya” so now we know why he left Platinum. The new game will be produced at Kamiya’s new studio Clovers, a revival of sort of Clover Studio, which created the original Okami. But enough of my preamble, check out the teaser for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Okami sequel - Project Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSoZgCCxyQc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Like most folks with good taste, I enjoyed Okami a lot, so I’m definitely excited to see a new one. Here’s hoping Kamiya has another classic in him. Here's a bit more information about the project, directly from Capcom...</p>
<p><em>"The Okami sequel project is underway!! Okami is a game critically acclaimed for its unique world, heartwarming story, and exciting adventures. Now, a new adventure in the same vein as Okami has been set in motion.</em></p>
<p><em>Hideki Kamiya, director of the original Okami, will be the director of this project, which is being co-developed between studios that include various staff members of the original Okami: M-TWO Inc., Machine Head Works Inc., and CLOVERS Inc., which Hideki Kamiya is a member of.</em></p>
<p><em>What will the new adventures of Amaterasu and company be like? It will be some time before we greet you again, but we really hope you look forward to this project."</em></p>
<p>Platforms and a release date for the Okami Sequel have yet to be announced. What do you think? Excited to break out the paintbrush again?</p>

            <p>Naughty Dog have announced their long-gestating new game, and their first in a long while that's not a sequel. Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is a science fiction bounty hunter game set on a mysterious isolated planet, and the first cinematic trailer is below.

<p>"Intergalactic stars our newest protagonist, Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," explains <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement">a Naughty Dog blog post</a>. "In fact, anyone who’s flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past was never heard from again. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit."
</p>
<p>Intergalactic has apparently been in development since 2020 and has a soundtrack by Atticus Ross. Otherwise, Naughty Dog are keeping a lot about the game secret for now, only say that they're aiming to make "an emotional, character-driven epic journey" with the "deepest gameplay" of any of their games so far. Maybe that means it's set in a hole.
</p><p>I like the appearance of recognisable brands in the trailer above - Porsche, Adidas, Sony of course. I imagine that can't continue once you touchdown on a strange, remote planet, but it never fails to tickle me when Person Be In Future, but Future Person Knows Things I Know. I'm a simple animal.
</p>
<p>I like less, of course, that this is currently only coming to PlayStation 5. I think it's a safe bet that we'll get it on PC eventually, but there's no guarantee as to when.

            <p>I'm a big fan of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</a>, which pit Sonic and pals against a stable of characters from Sega's other games, including Total War and Football Manager. I'm less of a fan of Sonic's other kart racing exploits, but I'm still cautiously interested to learn he's getting back behind the wheel. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was just announced.

<p>Well, that's brief. And doesn't show Sonic - it's current favourite Shadow that's getting behind the wheel in the short teaser trailer above. Apparently we'll learn more about the game in 2025.
</p>
<p>Perhaps that will include who is making it. There's no developer logo on the trailer above bar Sega themselves. The most recent game in the series, 2019's Team Sonic Racing, and its predecessor Racing Transformed, were both the work of Sumo Digital - although it's been a long time and the more recent wasn't well received, so I doubt it's the same folks doing it this time.
</p>
<p>In any case, the idea suggested by the title "CrossWorlds" gives me hope I'll be able to race against that weird headless Football Manager Man again.</p>
