			<p>Over the years, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have tried their hands – or flippers, I guess? – at numerous video game genres. There’s been Turtle inspired side-scrolling beat ‘em ups, one-on-one fighters, platformers, a light gun shooter, and a roguelike. Heck, even the pinball genre has been taken on by the awesome foursome. Now, with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, the brothers are giving turn-based strategy a go.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown: CONSOLE RELEASE TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aOjavINypzY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The brothers have fallen out and gone their separate ways, again, which is a popular and often regurgitated plot device for Turtles’ films, TV shows, and comics, but here it provides developer Strange Scaffold with the opportunity to teach the player the tactical idiosyncrasies for each solo ninja, before bringing them together for a bombastic finale. Each grid-based level sees a turtle nunchuck their way from one end to the other, bashing the hordes of bad guys they meet on their way.</p>


<p>In a neat touch, to avoid the potentially plodding pace of a TBS, a sense of dynamic urgency is created as each level begins to rapidly fall away as you progress through it, forcing you to keep moving forward at all times. Dilly-dally in one place too long and the ground will fall away beneath your Turtle’s shell, sending them plummeting into the void. Thankfully, there’s a pleasing tactical component provided by this, as each turtle has several attacks that knock enemies backwards. Get yourself into the right position with your limited number of action points and you can send packs of enemies to their demise in one satisfying scenery smashing moment.</p>


<p>And you’ll certainly need every strategic advantage you can get, as Tactical Takedown is a surprisingly challenging game. This game is based upon the Nickelodeon division of the Ninja Turtles empire, so it’s ostensibly aimed at kids. Well, that’s not the case for Tactical Takedown, which keeps the pressure on throughout, sending vast swathes of new enemies every turn, forcing you to use each of the Turtles’ abilities with precision to have any chance of success. One mistake and it’s game over.</p>
<p>In truth, things get rather grindy, the never-ending baddies popping into existence faster than you can clear the decks, turning proceedings into a real slog, particularly in the latter stages. Matters aren’t helped by the game doing a poor job of explaining its mechanics, likely leading to many players bouncing off the frequent difficulty spikes.</p>

<p>Stick with it through its runtime of a handful of hours, and you’ll discover a smart and ultimately satisfying strategy game. And when the gameplay mechanics click, and you have a perfect turn in which your turtle flips, hacks, slides, and dropkicks their way through a multitude of foot ninjas, you can’t help but have a good time. It’s just a shame that I could never quite get on with the visuals. Tactical Takedown is a digital recreation of a board game. As such, there is little to no animation, each character plonking around the place like a pawn on a chess board. This stylistic choice lessened the experience for me. Sure, the game is telling me that Michelangelo just ollied on his skateboard over the head of some goons, striking them as he went, but it doesn’t want to show me that. All I saw was one static piece leaping over another static piece. For some, this lack of animation and characterisation might be no big deal, but it left me cold.</p>

		With some unpleasant difficulty spikes and staid visuals, TMNT: Tactical Takedown won’t be for everyone. But for those willing to overlook its idiosyncrasies, Tactical Takedown offers a compelling, yet brief, strategic challenge.	</p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-free-story-update-the-lost-harvest-dlc-free-trial/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-dune-awakening-free-story-chapter-and-paid-dlc-the-lost-harvest-out-next-month-free-trial-on-now.1276989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/chapter-2-free-update-and-the-lost-harvest-dlc/">announced </a>that the first free story chapter for its massive multiplayer survival game, Dune: Awakening, will be out next month on September 10, 2025. Alongside the free update, Funcom is also releasing a paid DLC called The Lost Harvest, which has a standalone storyline separate from the free Chapter 2 update. And if you've yet to try Dune: Awakening but have been keen to check it out, you can do so now with a free trial on until August 24, 2025.</p>



<p>Chapter 2 of the story will be added as a free update for all owners of the game, and beyond more story content to dig through, it'll add a few highly-requested features, like being able to re-customize your player character, new hairstyles and tattoos, new contracts, more dynamic encounters, and new armor archetypes.</p>



<p>The Lost Harvest paid DLC is available separately for $12.99 USD, though if you've purchased the Season Pass, then you'll be getting The Lost Harvest as part of the pass. On top of everything else that comes in the free update, players who purchase The Lost Harvest DLC and/or purchase the Season Pass will get a new vehicle to explore Arrakis in with the Treadwheel. Three new Imperial Testing Stations to plunder, five new base decorations, four new weapon skins, two new armor skins, new Dune Man-themed building pieces for your base, and a thumper emote, on top of the separate story content that comes with The Lost Harvest.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the free trial, it's available for those wanting to test out a journey on Arrakis for themselves from now until August 24, and lets you spend 10 hours with the game running around Hagga Basin before the trial ends. There are a few areas that are unavailable in the trial, such as Harko Village, Arrakeen, and the Deep Desert, though in fairness, it would take you more than just 10 hours of gameplay to reach at least one of those areas.</p>



<p>You'll also be restricted to free trial servers, but if you do purchase the game, all your story progress, character level, skill and tech points, and the contents in your backpack will be carried over. The only things you'll need to rebuild are your base and vehicle, and if you managed to acquire more than 10,000 Solaris, you'll lose anything over that limit. You'll also get a few cosmetic items when you go from the free trial to the full game.</p>



<p>This is the first major content update for Dune: Awakening, and players who've been down on Arrakis since the game launched earlier this year will be happy for it, since anyone playing with some level of consistency has run through all the content that was included with the game at launch. What'll be more interesting for those players beyond the new content, is how Funcom re-balances the game with this new update, as there are surely going to be more tweaks coming on September 10th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/voidfighter-review-sci-fi-dogfights-done-right</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/voidfighter-review-sci-fi-dogfights-done-right.1276986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Laser fire blasts past your ship as an enemy fighter goes screaming off into the distance, disappearing with a small pock of red light as it explodes in the void of space. Hell of a way to go... but you've got no time to think about it as three nasty little snubfighters are hot on your tail.</p>

<p>Pull up, circle around, try to fire off your blasters in time to catch one of their wings... it's this kind of thrill that you'll get on the table faster than the speed of light when diving into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ospreypublishing.com/us/voidfighter-9781472866448/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Voidfighter</em></a>, a brand new miniatures-agnostic sci-fi dogfighting skirmish wargame from designer Casey Garske (with illustrations by Dimitris Martinos).</p>

<p>Publisher <a href="https://www.ospreypublishing.com/us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Osprey Games</a> sent us a review copy of <em>Voidfighter</em> to check out ahead of the games release - so follow along with us as we dive in!</p>

<h2>What Do I Need To Play&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>?</h2>

<p>All you really need to play&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>&nbsp;is the rulebook, three different sized measuring sticks, an assortment of classic RPG dice (two each of: d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, d12s, and a d20), markers to track which units have activated, and any like-sized spaceship models you can muster. Much like another of my favorite Osprey Games releases,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frostgrave-fireheart-and-blood-legacy-preview-new-rules-for-frozen-north" rel="nofollow">Frostgrave</a>,&nbsp;</em><em>Voidfighter&nbsp;</em>is miniature agnostic. This means you can field old <i>X-Wing&nbsp;</i>miniatures, kit-bash something cool from parts you have lying around, or even use cardboard cutouts. All that's needed is a uniform size across you and your opponent's models.</p>

<h2>Playing The Game</h2>

<p><em>Voidfighter'</em>s rules are meant to get miniatures onto the tabletop as quickly as possible, while still giving the player just enough to crunch on to not make it feel shallow by any means. Each round of the game consists of five phases: the Command phase, the Initiative phase, the Movement phase, the Gunnery phase, and the Maintenance phase.</p>

<p>In the Command and Initiative phases, players gain command points (which can be spent on daring maneuvers and upgrades) and roll to determine who activates their models first. In&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>, you definitely&nbsp;<em>don't</em>&nbsp;want to be activating first, as it gives your opponent more information.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-art-1.jpeg?itok=fMXsR_RM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-art-1.jpeg?itok=eDECkteU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the Movement phase, players will take turns activating chunks of their units (you'll activate a quarter of your units at once), and it's here that you can roll to pull off tricky maneuvers like a Roll or an Immelmann (where you change the ship's facing 180-degrees without moving). To do these maneuvers, you're usually rolling piloting rolls to which each have their own downside should you fail the roll!</p>

<p>In the Gunnery phase, blasters are unleashed as guns send streaks of light through the cold dark of space! With opposed rolls (that's how the whole game plays out, you roll two dice, as does your opponent to contest you) and easy determining of who's in your line of sight and who's in range, this has to be one of the snappiest dogfighting games I've ever tried.</p>

<p>The book goes on to cover rules for terrain and scenario-based models like Asteroids and space creatures, helps you design your squadron and individual ships in The Shipyard, shows off ships for various factions within the game, offers up 12 different scenarios, and has rules for extended campaign play... and it all adds layers to the game without bogging it down.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-photo-1.jpeg?itok=Ts7nNW9k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-photo-1.jpeg?itok=xhOLLCpd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Enjoying The Trip</h2>

<p>And that's what I love about these rules, and what makes reading this rulebook so fun. Everything is meant to be easy and intuitive, without feeling too simplistic. You'll find yourself zooming around the board, trying to outflank your opponents as you fire off round after round of guns, torpedoes, and more. It's fast and let's you chuck plenty of dice.</p>

<p>Of all the elements of&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>&nbsp;that most surprised me and kept me engaged throughout my read-through of the rules, the sense of humor and high-quality prose author Casey Garske most stood out. When cracking open a new rulebook for a sci-fi dogfighting skirmish game, I have to admit: I was expecting a pretty dry affair.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-art-2.jpg?itok=RDewXm6O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-art-2.jpg?itok=9JpGsETK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But Garske's writing - even when writing out the rules for movement - can't help but shine with its approachable, breezy tone. On top of that, he's created a world for this game that feels wonderfully fleshed out&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;bogging the reader down with heaps of lore. You get a few paragraphs about the universe at large, and then its off to the (space) races.</p>

<p>Another element that really serves the game is its treatment of reality, which it keeps at arm's length. There's a lot of gleeful hand-waving away of hard physics, which is a very good thing, as this wonderful little spark of a game would grind to a halt if it worried too much about things like g-force.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-photo-2.jpg?itok=pEd2Bppw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-photo-2.jpg?itok=-7N10pUP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Voidfighter&nbsp;</em>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is another grand-slam from publisher Osprey Games, and it shows just how wide open the field of miniature agnostic wargaming truly is. And in the practiced hands of a designer like Garske, there's truly no limit to the amount of creativity and ingenuity we can see from this type of wargame. Untethered by trying to sell their own lumbering miniature line,&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter&nbsp;</em>is allowed to feel nimble - like a snubfighter just dropping into orbit.</p>

<p>If you've got a stack of spaceship miniatures lying around and you're looking for something to do with them, or you want to get into the world of kit-bashing or 3D-printing, or the light and easy tone of this game sounds appealing to you - then I cannot recommend highly enough&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>. Jump in, pilot!</p>

<p>Elden Ring is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, and it reportedly struggles to run on the latest Nintendo console?</p>



<p>According to Nintendo Life’s Felix Sanchez, who spent time with the game while in Cologne for Gamescom the game has serious performance issues on the Switch 2 when playing in handheld mode.</p>



<p><strong>“Performance wise, here at that big first fight, as soon as you step outside, the framerate drops quite substantially,”</strong> Sanchez said while mentioning that it’s always locked at 30 frames per second</p>



<p>He then continued: <strong>“You get to the outside world, and the framerate just tanks. It’s really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this.</strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-gamescom-future-games-show-at-gamescom-2025-everything-announced">More Gamescom: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-games-show-gamescom-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Future Games Show at Gamescom 2025: Everything Announced</a></h6>



<p><strong>“It is terrible. Of course, you’re never going to see the light of this because—well, maybe it’ll release in that state, but I can’t imagine it will.”</strong></p>



<p>Sanchez said it felt like 20 frames per second and, sometimes, as low as 15. It would happen, he said, doing the “most simple stuff”.</p>



<p>As far as the positives, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hq3m8UwhGM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sanchez did say that</a> while it doesn’t look as good as PC or PlayStation—as should be expected—it did look “really good”. He also said the tutorial area of the game performed properly.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition is scheduled to release on Nintendo Switch 2 later this year. A firm release date, however, has yet to be announced. </p>

                <p>Glen Schofield, the director of 2022's The Callisto Protocol, has shared the one thing he would have changed for the game--and it was not delaying the game.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-and-dead-space-creator?utm_source=podcast-email&amp;publication_id=4150086&amp;post_id=171350369&amp;utm_campaign=email-play-on-substack&amp;utm_content=watch_now_gif&amp;r=1p281a&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Schofield said his bosses at Korean publisher Krafton mandated that The Callisto Protocol launch in December so it could release at a strategic time for its shareholders.</p>

<p>"I don't like when the politics get in the way, which they did with Krafton," he said. "There was no doubt about it. They told me that the game has to ship in December because of the Korean stock market. I should have just shut it down right there. I'm mad of myself on that one."</p><p>Schofield said the PC edition of The Callisto Protocol was a "sh** show."</p><p>The Callisto Protocol launched on December 2, 2022, and Schofield claims Krafton cut off communications with him on December 10. Krafton didn't engage with Schofield again until May 2023, he said.</p><p>The Callisto Protocol was originally envisioned as a horror game set inside the PUBG universe, but the connection to the battle royale game was later dropped. The team behind the game, Striking Distance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-dev-cuts-more-jobs-in-gamings-latest-layoffs/1100-6529696/" data-ref-id="1100-6529696">underwent layoffs after the game was released.</a></p><p>Schofield said The Callisto Protocol sold between 6-7 million copies and "made a lot of money" for a debut title from a new studio. Even if the number was actually 5 million, the game "made its money," Schofield said. For its part, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Krafton management said the game failed to reach sales expecations.</a></p><p>After leaving Striking Distance, Schofield <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-he-might-have-directed-his-last-game-in-the-industry/1100-6533481/" data-ref-id="1100-6533481">attempted to secure funding for multiple other games</a>, but nothing materialized. He's now focusing on his art and writing projects.</p>

                <p>Remember earlier this week when The Pokemon Company put out a teaser image for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-as-latest-teaser-might-make-you-think-its-switched-genres/1100-6534065/">looked like it could legitimately be from something like the Blair Witch Project</a>? Well, the full trailer is out now, and unsurprisingly it isn't actually all that scary--apart from that one bit with the Espurr. That thing still is terrifying. Still, the trailer is a fun riff on the found-footage genre, and it even revealed a completely new Mega Evolution Pokemon.</p><p dir="ltr">Titled The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident, the trailer follows a couple of people exploring an abandoned building as they come across more and more mysterious happenings. Surprising mirrors, mysterious purple sludge, that titular sweet scent, some Pokemon-oriented jump-scares--all of it builds towards the reveal of Mega Victreebel. And it's looking … large.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyfDz36JkkU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Victreebel's Mega form essentially looks like a giant water balloon with some leaves growing out of it, and it bounces around the place as it moves. Over on the official <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega-victreebel" rel="nofollow ">Pokemon Legends website</a>, a description explains, "It has so much acid that even closing its mouth tight isn’t enough to hold it in, so it contains the acid by wrapping its own vines around its throat." It certainly paints an uncomfortable picture.</p><p dir="ltr">According to a press release, Mega Victreebel's type stays as grass and poison when it evolves, but details like stat changes likely won't be shared until the game is out.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of which, Pokemon Legends: Z-A is releasing October 16 on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <p>When <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> popped up at Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> reveal, it was a promising sign of third-party games finding their way to the new console.</p>
<p>Yet reports from gamescom suggest Elden Ring runs poorly on Switch 2, particularly in handheld mode, citing low framerates in open world environments. Even publisher Bandai Namco seems to be aware of this, as footage capture has not been allowed, which seems particularly damning.</p>
<p>FromSoftware doesn't have a great track record with performance, though, and after three years Elden Ring still doesn't run perfectly on PS5, Xbox Series X, or PC. But this is the studio's first effort on Switch 2, and it's perhaps a worrying sign for next year's exclusive The Duskbloods.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-bWgUgYJGE">IGN</a> described Elden Ring on Switch 2 as a "disaster" in handheld mode, after Eurogamer's Ian Higton went hands-on at gamescom.</p>
<p>Ian was only able to play in handheld mode, but played the very start of the game. And while he was impressed with the lighting and resolution, the framerate dropped dramatically during both the Grafted Scion tutorial boss and when entering the open world. "As soon as I opened up those double doors and entered into Limgrave and you see the Erdtree in the background, it started to chug," said Ian.</p>
<p>Further, the demo only has a single graphics mode with HDR switched on, but this could potentially change in the final release.</p>
<p>Both Jon Cartwright from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDiSIezfsrw">GVG</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hq3m8UwhGM">Nintendo Life</a>'s Felix Sanchez reported similar feedback. Cartwright noted how fog in the distance caused the framerate to plummet and while the game runs at 30fps, it goes "well below when anything a little bit challenging comes up", including bosses. He was able to test docked mode, which was "better but not perfect".</p><p>Sanchez, meanwhile, was impressed by the graphics despite being not quite on par with current consoles, but in the open world "the framerate just tanks - it's really bad and I understand why they don't want you to see this because wowee zowee it is terrible".</p>
<p>It's certainly disappointing to hear, especially when Elden Ring does run perfectly fine on PS4 and Xbox One, not to mention the Steam Deck already provides a handheld mode with steady performance. Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1mvmoxw/elden_ring_on_switch_2_is_a_disaster_in_handheld/">reddit</a>, fans appear to be upset by the news, but not particularly surprised following FromSoftware's poor optimisation of games in the past.</p>
<p>Of course, the Switch 2 is weaker compared to PS5 or Xbox Series X, but it does have VRR capabilities - it's not clear if this has been implemented by the developers.</p>
<p>Perhaps this poor performance shouldn't come as a surprise. Two years after the base game launched, FromSoftware released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion. Yet, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-long-standing-tech-issues-have-been-ignored">Digital Foundry reported</a> last year, this still did not fix many underlying technical issues with the game, particularly its long-standing stuttering. Seeing issues with the Switch 2 version suggests FromSoftware just doesn't intend to fix them, with performance seemingly not a priority.</p><p>Digital Foundry also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTQXdP6sHfQ">examined the Elden Ring Switch 2 trailer</a> from its initial reveal, noting its seemingly poor performance, despite its impressive pixel count. It seems frame pacing issues from the trailer capture are present in the game itself. Still, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - an infamously more technically demanding game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-a-cutting-edge-game-translates-well-to-nintendos-console-hybrid">runs well on Switch 2</a>, it's disappointing to see FromSoftware struggling.</p>
<p>Elden Ring remains without a Switch 2 release date beyond this year, so there's still time for fixes to be implemented. It's the first FromSoftware-developed game to make it to Nintendo's Switch family (there's been no mention of an external team handling the port), as the previously released Dark Souls Remastered was handled by Virtuos. But it won't be the last. As revealed earlier this year, FromSoftware has the Switch 2 exclusive multiplayer game The Duskbloods on the way.</p>
<p>Will it suffer a similar fate? It's unclear what engine that game is being created in, but considering it's a Switch 2 exclusive from the ground up, you'd hope FromSoftware would optimise the game accordingly rather than shoehorning Elden Ring to make it fit. Yet the precedent of poor performance - and FromSoftware's seeming apathy towards it - has already been set.</p>

            <p>Mega Victreebel has been announced for Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>
<p>Debuting in a video with strong Blair Witch and urban-exploring-gone-wrong vibes, Mega Victreebel is the Mega Evolution for this classic Gen 1 Pokémon. Pokémon Legends: Z-A will be the first appearance of this form and it's the second new Mega Evolution to be announced for the upcoming game, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-dragonite-debuts-in-fresh-look-at-pokemon-legends-z-a">first being Mega Dragonite</a>.</p>
<p>For the non-Pokémon fans, Mega Evolutions are temporary transformations that certain Pokémon can undergo. Doing so makes them more powerful, while also changing their appearance and, occasionally, type.</p>

<p>Mega Victreebel's type remains Grass and Poison, but its appearance has certainly changed! Victreebel is inspired by pitcher plants, with the majority of its body being the tube where unsuspecting insects - or Pokémon in this case - find themselves devoured. Mega Evolution sees Victreebel looking incredibly well fed and surprisingly bouncy. Meanwhile, its vine has become wrapped around its head, making its mouth smaller. Yet I get the feeling that won't stop it from eating you…</p><p>Considering Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set in the Kalos region - the home of Gen 6 and where Mega Evolution first debuted in the Pokémon universe - there's a chance we'll see more new Mega Evolutions in the run-up to the game's release.

<p>With a particularly spooky reveal</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company has revealed yet another new Mega Evolution that will make its debut in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and it's Victreebel being put in the limelight this time.</p>
<p>This classic Grass / Poison Type has been a series mainstay throughout the generations, and its new Mega design looks particularly... sweet (<em>heh</em>).</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Mega-Evolution-of-the-Flycatcher-Pokemon-VictreebelMega-VictreebelAppe">The Pokémon Company</a>, Mega Victreel stands at 14'9" (4.5 m) and weighs in at 276.7 lbs. (125.5 kg). Yep, he <em>big</em>. The official description reads, "The volume of this Pokémon’s acid has increased due to Mega Evolution, filling its mouth. If it’s not careful, the acid will overflow and spill out". <em>Yikes</em>.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at Mega Victreel in-game. Relish in its goofy-smile glory:</p>

<p>The Mega was revealed in a particularly spooky little clip on TPC's official YouTube channel, titled 'The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident'. It shows two trainers making their way through a creepy house, following a trail of mysterious, sweet-smelling purple goo.</p>
<p>It might have given us our first look at Victreebell's new Mega form (not our first pick, but a nice addition), but our biggest takeaway is just how much a Pokémon horror game would <em>slap</em>.</p>
<p>If the above reveal was a little too spooky for your tastes, TPC also released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f79j5pSboEQ">in-game trailer</a>, which shows Mega Victreel hunting down 'mon in the wild. We'll be keeping an eye out for similar reveals in the coming months before Pokémon Legends: Z-A arrives on Switch 1 and 2 on 16th October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Poncle, the team behind the hit and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-dominates-bafta-games-awards-2023-with-five-wins/">award-winning auto-shooter</a> Vampire Survivors, has announced its next published title, Kill the Brickman, developed by Doonutsaur at Gamescom 2025, and it has also launched it on PC and Xbox at the same time.</p>



<p>The one-minute announcement and release trailer for Kill the Brickman mostly showed off gameplay of this Brick-Breaker-like game, before ending the presentation with a slew of Steam codes that, as far as we can tell, were quickly snatched up by anyone who was fast enough while watching the live stream.</p>



<p>Though, even if you missed grabbing a free code, Kill the Brickman is not an expensive game, and at the time of this writing you can grab it for only $4.49 USD with a 10% off launch sale that will end on August 28, 2025. It'll be back to $4.99 USD / EUR4.99 / £3.99 after the 28th.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="poncle presents | Kill the Brickman - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NHXV2qa9jE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>More than just a brick-breaker game, Kill the Brickman is described as a "<em>turn-based, rogue-like bullet builder from outer space</em>."</p>



<p>The collaboration between Poncle and Doonutsaur began when the game was sent to Poncle over email, and the studio's director, Luca Galante, became immediately enamored with it. "<em>Yes, this is true. I love Bricks</em>," Galante said in a press release. </p>



<p>"<em>Kill the Brickman is not only a brilliant deckbuilder, it's also one of the strangest ones I've ever played. And that's a good thing</em>."</p>



<p>Galante is right in that Kill the Brickman seems like a strange game in a positive way. And there's no waiting to test that theory, since for the price of an expensive coffee, you can play Kill the Brickman on your PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S console, right now. There was no mention of a PlayStation or Nintendo version, though there's always a possibility those could be added down the road. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed a brand new Mega Evolution for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>in the form of Mega Victreebel, and if you've ever felt like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>could stand a little more horror in its diet, then the new trailer is for you.</p>

<p>Two new videos have appeared on The Pokemon Company's official YouTube channel. The first is a fairly whimsical introduction to Mega Victreebel that shows off the 'mon's design in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, as well as some of its combat moves.</p>

<p>It's the second, however, that sparked my interest. "The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident" is an honest-to-god found-footage horror video in which Mega Victreebel plays a role, and I don't want to spoil it, but it's well worth a watch if you're into the creepier side of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mega-victreebel-pokemon-legends-z-a-the-case-of-the-sweet-scent-incident.jpg?itok=KI6-3B6N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mega-victreebel-pokemon-legends-z-a-the-case-of-the-sweet-scent-incident.jpg?itok=saskKvDp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, this still is from a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>video.</figcaption></figure><p>In essence, the new video short from the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>folks marries the warring worlds of the creature-collecting franchise and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7</em>, as two urban explorers investigate a building that's been giving off a sweet scent at night.</p>

<p>The conceit of the video is that the footage was discovered "on a video sharing website", so the creators are really leaning into the&nbsp;<em>Blair Witch</em>-style trappings of the genre. It's well worth a watch; you can check it out right here.</p>




<p>This has all been set up ahead of the launch of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is set for release on both Nintendo Switch 2 and the original Switch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">in October</a>.</p>

<p>Being set in the Kalos region's Lumiose City, the game will heavily feature Mega Evolution as a mechanic, and it'll introduce new Mega Evolved forms of existing Pokemon like Dragonite and Victreebel, as well as existing Mega Evolutions originally introduced back in Gen 6.</p>

<p>You'll be able to pick up&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>on the Switch family of consoles on October 16th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is adding several new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolution-timeline-hurts-houndoom-scizor-1850870401"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> when it comes to the Switch systems on October 16. We already knew Dragonite was getting one of these powerful alternate forms, and now another monster from the series’ first generation is getting an upgrade almost 30 years later. However, while Dragonite is a long-time favorite from the </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>games, Victreebel, the pitcher plant Pokémon, is a much more surprising pick.</span></p> <p><span>Mega Victreebel was first teased on Tuesday, August 19, through </span><a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1957790171216158990"><span>a social media post</span></a><span> on the official </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>social channels which showed a hand gripping onto a rusted gate, presumably somewhere in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s Lumiose City where the game takes place. The image looks pretty ominous, and if it weren’t posted by the official </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>account, you probably wouldn’t have known it was about </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. The text even says “Viewer discretion advised,” probably so parents don’t show it to their young children. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is no stranger to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-poltchageist-dlc-new-1850761666"><span>dark stories</span></a><span> in its promo material, and even the last </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game had </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-arceus-ghostly-new-pokemon-belong-to-a-special-1847938579"><span>some pretty spooky shit in its trailers</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The video is presented as found footage, showing two unsuspecting characters searching an abandoned building and finding a toxic purple substance and a bunch of scary Pokémon. At the end we see Mega Victreebel, whose destructive power scares the humans off. However, its trainer calms it down, and it turns out it’s not a terrifying monster; it’s just a goofy guy who doesn’t know its own strength. The official description on the <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega-victreebel">Pokémon website</a> says that it uses its own vines to keep all the acid it accumulates in its body by wrapping them around its throat. Mega Evolutions remain brutal.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Notably, Victreebel and Dragonite were both on the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>list of leaked Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> from back in March.

<p>Once Human’s next big update lands next week, it was announced at Gamescom, as the title continues to grow with more features and experiences.</p>



<p>First released in July 2024, Once Human has grown in the year since, including the launch of a PvP spin-off, RaidZone. Now, the base game itself is getting a big update.</p>



<p>Stellar Resonance is a new gameplay mode that lands in Once Human next week, introducing Gravity Integrators and a host of rewards.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Defend mode. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a press release sent to Insider Gaming, the Stellar Resonance update is said to “drastically change” gameplay and offer “all-new challenges” for players.</p>



<p>Further details were shared on the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20250821/40780_1255304.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, with the event period beginning August 28 and running to September 25. After the update is live, players will receive a Gravity Integrator blueprint when a Star Advent Loot Crate is opened for the first time, which can be used at an Intermediate or Advanced Supplies Workbench.</p>



<p>Once placed and activated, the Gravity Integrator will begin to ascend, constantly accumulating Stellar Core Gravity Samples and unlocking tiered rewards the higher it ascends. However, it will also attract Deviants and must be defended.</p>



<p>Global Research is also available in the update, with progress shared across all servers for the same region, unlocking new bonuses and additional reward claim chances. However, the mission is “extremely urgent”, and, if a new research phase is not within five days, bonuses will be lost and attacking Deviants will be stronger.</p>



<p>Additional optimizations were also deployed, including increased gliding and descending speed, improved airbone mechanics, and the ability to cancel aiming when performing a plunging melee attack.</p>



<p>Are far have you gotten in Once Human? Are you excited for the update? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>This week Steam made a small change to how it displays reviews and will now show a score for reviews in your language instead of an "all reviews" score. One game that has benefited from the change is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a>, which now shows Overwhelmingly Positive for all English reviews.</p><p>Palworld has been the source of some controversy since it first came to the public's attention, with some claiming the monster-collecting title is a direct rip-off of Pokemon--an opinion that seems to be shared by Nintendo, who eventually sued developer Pocketpair for patent infringement. The game has still proven popular with players, reaching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-25-million-players-in-one-month/1100-6521294/" data-ref-id="1100-6521294">huge player numbers</a> in its first month of release.</p><p>While Palworld used to show an all-time review rating of Very Positive on Steam, the reviews update has given the game a small boost in English, granting it the coveted Overwhelmingly Positive rating. The upgrade was celebrated by Pocketpair's communications director and publishing manager John "Bucky" Buckley, who posted to X about the milestone. Bucky clarified in the comments that Palworld isn't rated particularly low in any language--it "just happens to be higher in English," he said in a <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1958048265720524913" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reply</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/bucky_cm/status/1958045103588569460?s=46" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Due to the Steam review change (it now shows the overall score in your language), Palworld is Overwhelmingly Positive! <br>Thank you so much to our overseas fans who continue to support us and enjoy the game! ❤️<br>As always, we’re so incredibly grateful for your continued support!🙇 <a href="https://t.co/GswoERWfan" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/GswoERWfan</a></p>  — Bucky | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1958045103588569460?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Looking through the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Palworld reviews</a> by language, the survival-crafting game has by far the most reviews in English, which average out to Overwhelmingly Positive. The language with the second-largest number of reviews is Simplified Chinese, which have rated Palworld Very Positive -- making it likely that the Chinese reviews were dragging down the average when all review scores were collated. English and Chinese together make up over half of Palworld's total reviews, with all other languages also sporting a Very Positive or Overwhelmingly Positive score.</p><p>Palworld is well into its second year of early access, and continues to receive major updates.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158176/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>This review was originally published in November 2009. We're updating and republishing it in honour of the game's arrival on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> as part of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-online-games-list-every-nintendo-classics-retro-game-on-nso-plus-expansion-pack#nintendo-switch-online-switch-2-gamecube-games-3">the Nintendo Classics GameCube lineup</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Meet the Sandersons, your atypical, dysfunctional American family.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanderson is an out-of-work engineer-cum-manchild who lives on the lounge sofa playing with action figures and watching his favourite superhero program Space Ranger Drake Redcrest™ (apologies if that hits too close to the bone for some readers).</p>
<p>Mrs. Sanderson is trying to keep everything together in the wake of her husband's apparent disinterest in finding gainful employment and his habit of spending their meagre funds on toys.</p>
<p>And their daughter, Jenny, wears a frog costume and refuses to communicate in anything but frog language. She worries about her family's future now that Mom won't let Dad sleep in their bedroom, instead locking herself up at night to go over the family finances.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158173/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>In a move that infuriates Mrs. Sanderson, Mr. Sanderson brings home yet another new toy in the form of Chibi-Robo, a tiny robot whose mission in life is to become the number one Chibi-Robo in the world by giving happiness to the people in his new home. Thus is the stage set for one of the most charming and endearing games ever to grace a console as players assume the robotic role in order to restore harmony and happiness to the Sanderson home.</p>
<p>The game's sights and sounds are an immediate draw: the house is a bright and colourful mix of different eras, with a TV that looks vintage 1960s set amidst a timeless household decor filled with all manner of odd and lovable characters. The music is simple and light, punctuated by musical notes that play in time to Chibi-Robo's footsteps and change depending upon the surface he's walking on. The speech is an appealing musical gibberish that is commonplace nowadays, though the English subtitles are well-translated, conveying each character's own unique personality. Whilst this mid-2000s classic deals with serious issues like death and divorce, it doesn't get too heavy and being an active participant in the story's unfolding is one of the great joys of playing the game.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158175/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>It's a bit difficult to describe what kind of game Chibi-Robo! is. It's not really an action game, although Chibi-Robo can obtain a weapon (the Sonic Blaster) and destroy little enemy robots called Spydorz. It's not really an RPG, though he does gain larger battery capacity as he rises through the global Chibi-Robo rankings and you advance the story by talking with other characters. It's not really a platform game, either, though the game's setting in the Sanderson's family home does have ample platforms to traverse in Chibi's travels. Whatever the genre, it's definitely a fun game and that's what counts!</p>
<p>Chibi-Robo lives in a plugged-in house on the living room floor with his companion robo ("manager") Telly-Vision, who floats about giving advice and taking him home when the day is done, or if he fails to get to a plug in time and collapses on the floor with a spent battery. Initially, Chibi-Robo's out-and-about times last for 5 minutes, but this can be quickly upgraded to 10 or 15 minutes. You may also use Moolah to buy upgrades or other items. If you fight Spydorz and destroy them, you can pick up pieces of scrap metal for making Utility Bots that act as ladders or bridges in various rooms to reach high places.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158170/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Chibi-Robo's activities alternate between day and night periods. During the day the Sandersons are active and can be chatted to, whereas toys are inert. Everybody loves Chibi: Mr. Sanderson bought you and he likes gadgets, so he just thinks you're the best (changing the TV channel to his favourite show gets you some bonus Happy Points, although given that his slovenly behaviour is a big cause of strife in the house, this might not be the best choice); Jenny likes drawing pictures of you and if you bring her frog rings found scattered about the house she'll bestow you with kisses; Mrs. Sanderson enjoys having tea and being able to discuss her problems with you (though she hasn't gotten your name right and insists upon calling you "Cheebo"); and their dog, Tao, just growls at you (it's a shame you can't speak dog - yet).</p>
<p>At night, the Sanderson house takes a darker turn and not just because the lights are out. Mr. Sanderson sleeps on the sofa with the dog and can be heard muttering "Sorry, dear" in his sleep. You'll find Jenny outside of her mother's bedroom with a sorrowful look on her face, while mother herself can be heard inside the bedroom telling everyone outside to be quiet and muttering about the finances.</p>
<p>The household toys all come to life at night and they all have their own dramas to entangle Chibi-Robo in and provide windows into how the Sandersons got where they are now. Of course, with drama and strife comes the opportunity to make people happy - whether that person is a Sanderson, a doll, an action figure, or one of those novelty musical dancing flowerpot things.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158172/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The active inhabitants of the Sanderson house may be different day or night, but one thing never changes: the house is a mess. Chibi-Robo! is a great way to work out your obsessive-compulsive disorder as the start of every active period reveals more rubbish to pick up and stains to clean off the floors and carpets. This ends up being rather satisfying and a good way to ensure a steady flow of Happy Points and Moolah for your coffers.</p>
<p>Whilst Mrs. Sanderson may have opposed your presence initially, your helping out around the house is greatly appreciated, so she gives you a bonus of both Happy Points and Moolah after a certain number of stains are cleaned or bits of rubbish collected. You never know when these bonuses are assigned, so it pays to never leave a pawprint unscrubbed or crumpled paper uncollected.</p>
<p>This game was absolutely made for anyone who enjoys exploring virtual worlds. Chibi-Robo is less than 10 centimetres tall (much like a certain diminutive plant-loving space traveller), so the Sandersons' modest two-bedroom home is a massive world to navigate. The genius of the game's design is shown by the many ways this world can be navigated, not all of which are immediately apparent. Part of the fun is simply looking around for objects of note and then figuring out how to reach them using stacks of books or shimmying up shoelaces, electrical cables or purse straps.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158169/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Chibi-Vision gives you a first-person view through the robot's eyes, highlighting special items and enabling full camera control beyond what's present in the normal third-person view. Items for Chibi-Robo's use in cleaning make themselves known immediately, but the function of other items won't be clear until a conversation or some other event takes place.</p>
<p>If there's a criticism to be made, it's that the automatic camera will sometimes allow objects to block your view of Chibi or have trouble changing perspective when navigating a corner of the room. Thankfully, manual control with the C-stick is available and does a good job of moving around obstacles, though the camera won't pass through walls, so sometimes it can only be moved in one direction. That this minor issue is the only serious complaint shows how well-crafted this game truly is.</p>
<p>Throughout, you get the sense that developer Skip really did its best to bring this world to life and let players have fun exploring it. Rather than using a mission structure or outright telling you what to do, you're given the tools and then enticed into moving the central story along by dropping hints that something interesting could happen if you go somewhere or take a certain action. At any given time you can have multiple avenues of exploration open, with different storylines happening, so if you run into a dead end with one, you can focus on another.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158174/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The bite-sized gaming portions and ability to save anywhere you can plug in to recharge batteries also makes Chibi-Robo! well-suited if you don't have time for lengthy play sessions. Best of all, after the credits roll, the game doesn't stop; you can choose to continue and tie up loose ends or find more secrets.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Chibi-Robo is an oddity: a game with a simple goal but a great deal of freedom in making the journey. It's a game about tiny altruistic robots helping humans with real problems, told in a light-hearted manner that will appeal to a wide audience. This is a game that really defines where Nintendo is coming from as a company: focusing on making people happy and doing good deeds; on helping people rather than shooting them in the face.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rue-valley-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/time-loop-rpg-rue-valley-set-for-november-release-date.1276887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Owlcat Games and developer Emotion Spark Studio have announced the release date for their time loop RPG&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, and it's hitting PC and consoles in just a couple of months.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on November 11th. It'll serve as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/owlcat-publishing-rpgs" rel="nofollow">inaugural publishing project</a> for Owlcat; the studio is mainly known for developing CRPGs like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous" rel="nofollow">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>is one of two publishing projects currently in the works at Owlcat; the other,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, is a "turn-based RPG where feudal Japan meets magic and machine", although unfortunately, it doesn't have a release window yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rue-valley-release-date-corkboard.jpg?itok=AU3lrV79 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rue-valley-release-date-corkboard.jpg?itok=m1waU7zw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time loop RPG&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>arrives in November.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, it's a time loop RPG heavily inspired by&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>(and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">far</a> from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">only game</a> for which that description feels <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">appropriate</a>).</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>takes place during a time loop, you'll have the opportunity to shape the protagonist's personality as you see fit. You can, as Emotion Spark puts it, "be a cold-hearted loner who overthinks everything or a melodramatic loudmouth who always trusts their gut instinct".</p>

<p>As you play, you'll store your memories in a special graph, and you'll use those memories to inform your personality and skills. Just like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>de-emphasizes traditional combat in favor of a more psychological approach to the genre.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, which gives you a sense of what you're in for if you decide to pick it up in November, right here.</p>




<p>While Owlcat may be moving into publishing with&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, that doesn't mean the studio is abandoning development; it's currently hard at work on <i>Warhammer 40k: Dark Heresy</i>, another turn-based RPG set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p><em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126190/Rue_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/rue_valley" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/rue-valley-48a101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Store</a>, as well as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014770/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/rue-valley/9pjmhlrct0j2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch, on November 11th.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/vampire-survivors-balatro-kill-the-brickman-poncle-roguelike-2000619132</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-survivors-dev-publishes-surreal-roguelike-about-shooting-human-brick-heads-you-can-play-right-now.1276878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Kill the Brickman</em> takes the basic premise of the arcade classic <em>Breakout</em> and adapts it to a <em>Balatro</em>-style deckbuilder roguelike in which you shoot custom bullets to break bricks, win cash, collect upgrades, and extend your run. So far, so neat. But no small part of <em>Kill the Brickman</em>‘s staying power is in its surreal presentation that puts Blendo Games-looking faces on all the violence. The bricks you kill? Human. The bullets you shoot? Human. It all adds up to a punchy bite-sized arcade experience published by <em>Vampire Survivors</em> dev Poncle that’s just weird enough to keep me coming back.</p> <p>Revealed during the Microsoft Gamescom showcase on Thursday, <em>Kill the Brickman</em> is out August 21 on Xbox and PC. In keeping with its publishing partner’s tradition, the game is only $5. It’s made by Doonutsaur, a small U.S.-based team whose only other project on Steam is a similarly offbeat roguelike called <em>Meow Legion</em>. Poncle director&nbsp;Luca Galante apparently got an email about the game, immediately fell in love, and signed it just a few days later. “Imagine <em>Tetris</em>, but if the bricks had anger issues and a taste for human flesh,” reads the tagline in the press release.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="poncle presents | Kill the Brickman - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NHXV2qa9jE?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Kill the Brickman</em> has you control a revolver at the bottom of the screen that you load custom bullets into. Some do more damage. Some have more bounces. Others can deal corrosive damage, and so on. Think the original <em>Breakout</em>, or one of its many clones, but instead of bouncing a ball to break bricks like a spin-off of <em>Pong</em>, you’re playing a turn-based puzzle shooter infused with light <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> RPG elements.</p>

 <p>Why are you killing the Brickman? Well, if they get to close they will hurt you and deplete your health. Once all your hearts are gone the run is over. But like in any good roguelike, skill and intuition will only get you so far. You try to complete mini-objectives in each level to score extra cash, which compounds interest just like in <em>Balatro</em>, to purchase the sorts of upgrades that will make or break your run later on. There are relics to collect that provide special bonuses, and different gun chambers that will augment bullet effects based on the pattern you reload them in.</p> <p>I’ve only played a couple hours (Poncle provided <em>Kotaku</em> with access to an advance copy), but it’s one of those games I’ve been trying to make 10-15 minutes for at the end of each day and end up playing way longer than I expected. <em>Kill the Brickman</em> is a tight set of gameplay concepts wrapped up in a cool CRT pixel art aesthetic and a bizarre sense of humor, or is it horror? I’m excited to keep playing and see where it goes.</p>

The publisher has issued a takedown notice to Nexus Mods to remove a pair of custom nude mods that left the game's lead female character, Isabella Torrisi, without anything to wear.</p><p>Nexus Mods <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13520836-takedown-request-issued-by-take-two-interactive-software-inc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acknowledged the request from Take-Two</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/take-two-lawyers-give-mafia-nude-mods-the-cement-shoes-treatment-dmca-projects-that-had-the-dons-daughter-parading-in-the-buff/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), and complied by removing the Nude Isabella mod and the Extended Textures for Nude Isabella mod, both of which were created by a user known as <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/norskpl/mods" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">norskpl</a>. PC Gamer speculates norskpl may have used Isabella's model from her love scenes in the game. Norskpl's non-nude mods created for The Old Country appear to have been left intact. That includes a few mods that let players assume the role of other characters from the Mafia franchise.</p><p>In the context of the game, Isabella is the daughter of Don Torrisi, the boss of the player's character, Enzo Favara. Although the Don is fiercely protective of Isabella and has his own ideas about who she should marry, she and Enzo have a clandestine affair behind his back. That's the primary romantic relationship in the game, and the source of inevitable conflict.</p><p>Getting rid of the nude mods may keep them off of Nexus Mods, but there's always the possibility that someone can create new mods and post them somewhere else. This may only be a temporary solution for Take-Two, and it only brought the issue to the forefront.</p><p>The Old Country developer Hanger 13 recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-will-expand-with-free-ride-mode-in-future-update/1100-6533987/" data-ref-id="1100-6533987">a future update will introduce a Free Ride mode</a> that will let players escape from the linear narrative of the primary story and allow them to explore the countryside around them. The game already has a free-roam mode through the Chapter Replay menu, but the background characters and their surroundings aren't as compelling to see in that mode.</p><p>Mafia: The Old Country is out now for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, 2K Games acknowledged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-studio-laying-off-devs-as-diablo-boss-takes-over/1100-6534080/" data-ref-id="1100-6534080">a shake-up at Cloud Chamber</a>--the studio behind BioShock 4--following reports that the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-remake-cancelled-as-bioshock-4-reportedly-fails-a-review/1100-6533650/" data-ref-id="1100-6533650">failed an internal review</a>. Now, a new report suggests that the game could have come out as soon as next year if BioShock 4 had been more favorably received by the company.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, BioShock 4 was planned for a debut in either late 2026 or early 2027. However, the subsequent layoffs at Cloud Chamber will likely delay the next BioShock game even further. Bloomberg notes that 80 employees from Cloud Chamber were let go, leaving approximately 170 people remaining at the studio.</p><p>Studio head Kelley Gilmore was ousted from Cloud Chamber after the game's internal review, according to the report. In his place, 2K Games has hired Rod Fergusson to take over the studio following his own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-boss-departs-blizzard-after-five-years/1100-6533809/" data-ref-id="1100-6533809">departure from Blizzard</a>. In addition to leading the Diablo franchise for Blizzard, Fergusson previously worked on BioShock Infinite and helped get that game's production on track.</p><p>The initial reports about BioShock 4's status suggested that 2K Games was unsatisfied by the narrative. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-studio-laying-off-devs-as-diablo-boss-takes-over/1100-6534080/" data-ref-id="1100-6534080">a memo shared with GameSpot</a> by 2K Games, president David Ismailer said, "While we're excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we've made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game."</p><p>For now, there's no word about the release window of BioShock 4. Francis Lawrence is slated to direct a live-action BioShock movie at Netflix, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-tricky-bioshock-movie-is-not-dead-brings-on-a-new-writer/1100-6531560/" data-ref-id="1100-6531560">a new draft of the film has been written</a> by Terminator: Dark Fate scribe Justin Rhodes.</p>
