            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has released its financial results for the 2023-24 fiscal year, and things are looking a little grim for the company in profit terms.</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/24q4slides.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">results presentation</a>, Square Enix's profits are down a whopping 70% on last year, with the studio bringing in 14.91 billion yen in 2023-24 compared to the previous year's 49.26 billion figure.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/24q4earnings.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ancillary document</a>, the studio chalks this loss up to "the termination of development efforts for some key pieces of content in the Digital Entertainment segment", i.e. video game cancellations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/square-enix-financials-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.jpg?itok=MP2GBwHL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/square-enix-financials-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.jpg?itok=Xhz71FkN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="44d95bc5-3633-4143-b2a2-b3904d1452c4" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/square-enix-financials-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.jpg?itok=Xhz71FkN" alt="Aerith looking on in wonder as lanterns drift upwards in Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Square Enix's big releases last fiscal year included&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This likely includes the $140m (around 21.8 billion yen) loss <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-140m-loss-shakeup">declared by Square Enix earlier this year</a>; the company cited "content abandonment losses" in an earlier report, a cause which is also cited in today's presentation.</p>
<p>By way of explanation, Square Enix says the projects it canceled were "incompatible" with its "revised approach to the development of high-definition (HD) games", by which it means major PC and console releases as opposed to mobile or browser-based games.</p>
<p>No further information on these projects was released; it looks like the projects that were canceled hadn't been announced, so we may well never know what they were.</p>
<p>Another cause Square Enix cites for its lower profits this year is "a YoY (year-over-year) decline in MMO and Games for Smart Devices/PC browser sub-segment sales", a shortcoming the company probably hopes to rectify this summer with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-expansion-release-date-collectors-edition"><em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em></a>.</p>

<p>That plan is called "Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens", and it revolves around "consistently and regularly releasing [HD] titles that meet our customers' expectations", as well as "disruptive growth" in the mobile and browser spheres.</p>
<p>Rather sweetly (or concerningly, depending on your read), Square Enix says its new priority is "bringing smiles to our customers' faces", to which end it will "regularly releas[e] AAA titles" and "strive for a regular launch cadence".</p>
<p>The company declares its intention to "aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy" which includes not only PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, but also "Nintendo platforms", likely referencing both the Switch and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">hotly-anticipated upcoming successor</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if Square Enix's strategy pays dividends, but it's clear that the company has a long way to go if it wants to return to higher profits. Stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p><span>Another hero surrounded by scoundrels and traitors.</span></p>
		</div>
	<div>
		<p>This is probably a better topic for an episode of <em>The HOA </em>and maybe some of this will get recycled there but hey, it's my nickel so let me lead this week's email off with a grudge I'm holding.</p><p>I live in an old mill building. It's huge, the size of a city block, twelve stories tall, well over a hundred housing units contained within its thick brick walls and tar-black roof. I live near the top which, as I've mentioned before, means that it gets very hot up here even in the dead of winter.</p><p>The logic of buildings like this, which were designed before air conditioning and climate change and whose sheer scale would have made temperature control prohibitively expensive, is that in the warm months the building could be cooled by venting warm air out the upper-story windows while cool air was pulled in from the ground floor. In fact, unless the wind outside is both strong and pointing directly into the windows, it's hard to pull air <em>into </em>the upper floors from outside because there is so much air trying to get out.</p><p>Last year a neighbor and I both pooled our sets of extra window screens and opened the entire top floor up. During the few breaks we got in the heat we actually managed to make the heat break inside a little bit as well.</p><p>But the second the temperature started dropping below 45 overnight, someone decided it was too cold to have windows open and <em>stole every single window screen</em>. Now we are through the spring, the building is stifling all the time before we have had our first 80 degree day, and nobody has brought the screens back out.</p><p>The thing that I've spent the winter and spring stewing over is the mystery of <em>which </em>person in my building is the thief. Some ignoramus decided to swipe and <em>hide </em>all the stuff my neighbor and I had contributed to—why not just say it—the commonweal. The social contract? Rent to pieces! The milk of human kindness? Curdling in the tropical heat we have lived with since early March.</p><p>Who could it have been? I have my suspicions of course. There is the regrettably under-trained handyman, always put-upon by our aging building and who views the common spaces as his personal domain. There's the frail but crusty old bastard down the hall who is quick to provide a teasing but <em>extremely pointed </em>admonishment whenever he feels personally inconvenienced by another resident: "Wow that's almost enough for the freight elevator," he'll say as you maneuver a stack of cardboard on to the elevator to the basement to take to the lone recycling bin. The moment a cart or wagon squeaks in the hallway: "Sounds like someone needs some WD40." Reader, I am fain to tune this man up, except that he provided me an excellent recipe for Tom and Jerries one Christmas a couple years ago.</p><div><p>Whoever it is, their day is coming. I have most cleverly laid a trap, you see. It may take months for these seeds I plant—in the form of discreet little AirTags attached to the new screens that were just delivered—to bear their sweet fruit. But there will come a cool night when someone passing by those screens thinks, "I got away with it once, I'll do it again!" And at that moment they will be undone, for my screens will cry out for justice and lead me to the one who has done me this offense. They will find that I am Nemesis brought to their door. They will open it to find me standing before them in the night and they will hear me say:</p><p>"Hey, sorry to bother you but did you <em>by chance</em> take the screens out of the windows by the elevator? No it's not problem, it was pretty cold! But you know I'd just love to get them back and put them into storage for the winter. No no, it's perfectly okay. Yeah see they've got my name written on them. Right there, but it is kind of small and smudged now. I can see how you missed it. Anyway: thanks, and sorry about the cold."</p></div><figure><img src="https://remapradio.com/content/images/2024/05/05-13-2024.png" alt="The schedule for Remap this week, details in the article below" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://remapradio.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/05-13-2024.png 600w, https://remapradio.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/05-13-2024.png 1000w, https://remapradio.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/05-13-2024.png 1600w, https://remapradio.com/content/images/2024/05/05-13-2024.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul>

                <p>After a few generations without them, memory cards have made a big return in the last couple of years. Specifically, Xbox Series X|S plug-and-play expansion cards that give users an instant storage capacity upgrade. These were quite pricy at launch, but right now, you can get a nice discount on them through Amazon. For a quick upgrade, the 2TB Seagate expansion card is down from its standard price of $270 to <strong>$240 </strong>currently. Seagate's Xbox Series X|S expansion cards rarely--<em>very</em> rarely--receive discounts, so deals like this are worth keeping an eye open for.</p><h3>Seagate 2TB Xbox Expansion Card -- $230 ($<strike>270</strike>)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302167-seagate-2tb-card.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302167" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302167-seagate-2tb-card.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302167"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302167-seagate-2tb-card.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302167-seagate-2tb-card.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1601/16018044/4302167-seagate-2tb-card.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B09BJYXMDW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1812624298580769967%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fseagate-2tb-xbox-expansion-card-gets-big-discount%2F1100-6523378%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a></li></ul><p>As mentioned above, these expansion cards are very easy to use.

At this size, you can also install quite a few games on it, including modern titles infamous for their high storage demands, like Call of Duty or Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p>You also won't need to worry about sacrificing graphics, latency, load times, or frame rates on your favorite games and the Xbox Quick Resume function also works on these cards, allowing you to switch between multiple games almost instantly.</p><p>If you don't need that much extra space, you can also opt for a 1TB expansion card.

But even by the NES days, solo games were a rarity, and by the days of disk-based consoles the idea of a solo developer was completely dead. So, when indie games returned to the scene, the claim that "a single guy/gal made this game in their garage," was a total novelty.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But...indie games "returned" over a decade ago. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1942884/">Indie Game: The Movie</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> came out in 2012, documenting an already existent, albeit small, indie scene. Everything about indie games is now a regular part of the overall game industry, and they’ve flooded the market.

That is to say, it's business as usual.</span></p><p><img data-testid="content-image" data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt52af47d0347be6b6/663b93a09dbe5c7363019a36/solo_indiesearch.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt52af47d0347be6b6/663b93a09dbe5c7363019a36/solo_indiesearch.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="solo_indiesearch.jpg" title="solo_indiesearch.jpg"></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Surely, there's more to this claim than just novelty though?

Hundreds of devs, infinite budget, no deadlines, etc. Players would expect everything to be perfect: bleeding edge graphics, no bugs, instant fixes, and so on. It might even get review bombed for missing a feature the community expects to be there.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Knowing, however, that Manor Lords is made by one person, the perspective shifts from, "is that it?" to "they did all THIS?" The fact that the game looks good, plays well, and has lots of features is seen as miraculous. It's far more impressive than anyone expects from a single developer, to the point that some of its minor faults are even forgiven by players, which is a rarity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On that subject, players have asked Manor Lords solo-dev, Greg Styczeń, to hire some people to help fix the game faster. Seems that as you move from "solo dev" to "small dev team" you also move into a different bracket of expectations. A team is a group, and you can add more people to a group to fix any problems (from the public's perspective. As Styczeń and other developers know, throwing bodies at a problem usually isn't the best solution).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What does this all mean? That being a solo-dev these days bestows slight novelty value to your game, and a small degree of goodwill from players. Friends and family of a solo-dev are, naturally, extremely impressed by your efforts. However, players, who don't know or care about you, ultimately still want something that is interesting, and worth their time. Players don't search the "solo-dev" tag, on Steam, when they're hungry for new games. Look again at that Manor Lords picture above, there’s no mention of solo-dev in the main marketing capsule; it’s just not that important.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To boil it all down: being a "real" solo-dev doesn't much matter these days, one way or another.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Barely Standing on the Shoulders of Giants"><span>Barely Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that we know this topic isn't important, let's keep talking about it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As I mentioned above, I'm the self-proclaimed solo-dev of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941820/">Carceri</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a small (but hopefully interesting) game about all the prisons we throw ourselves in, and the various ways we try to escape them. Carceri is a first-person open-ish world exploration game made in Unreal 4, in which, I claim, I "made everything:" 3D art, writing, music, level design, scripting, and key art.

The Unreal Engine has been worked on by hundreds (thousands?) of devs since the 90s! There is NO WAY, in this world, or the multiverse, that Carceri exists without the Unreal Engine. And naturally, many other programs were involved as well: Blender, Ableton, Affinity Photo/Designer, GoldWave, and the list goes on.</span></p><p><img data-testid="content-image" data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt8465f99402a81b17/663b93d1b3e984cbbe838114/solo_programs.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt8465f99402a81b17/663b93d1b3e984cbbe838114/solo_programs.jpg?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="solo_programs.jpg" title="solo_programs.jpg"></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's not to mention the primary means of distributing Carceri to the world: Steam.

All of this is to say that I couldn't have made any of the tools/infrastructure-related parts of Carceri by myself. No tools, no game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Some Things are for Sale"><span>Some Things are for Sale</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Missing from my laundry list of creation claims above is sound effects. All the non-music audio in Carceri has been purchased from a variety of sources: the Unreal Marketplace, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.asoundeffect.com/">asoundeffect</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the biggest one by far, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/pm/polly/?trk=bb0b4a34-0609-448c-ac86-da48f93c0068&amp;sc_channel=ps&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!10!72018266416753!72018798321611&amp;ef_id=a4cacbb28cfd14f201f2ad8a52239ec9:G:s">Amazon Polly</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (the characters in Carceri are all programs, living right now in a digital world that co-exists with our own. Fictionally, THEY are the ones using Amazon Polly to generate a voice for themselves, not me). Maybe some of the SFX I could have made myself (poorly), but I certainly couldn't generate the voices, nor did I have the funds to hire human actors, (who fictionally wouldn't make sense anyhow).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that's comparatively small potatoes in light of the Unreal plugins I purchased to help construct the game.

Having built my previous game with no plugins, I knew there were certain pain-points of development that would either a) make me quit building the game or b) add months of misery. So, for $10 here, $40 there, I could skip the worst of these soul-crushing lulls.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One thing I didn’t do for Carceri is hire/contract other people, mostly because that’s expensive! But what if did? What if, instead of buying a SFX pack, I outsourced that work to a professional sound designer. Say I paid them a flat fee to make the sounds I needed, and also said “hey, feel free to release this as a sound pack for others to buy!” How is that situation different than me buying a sound pack, just with an alternate set of steps to get the same results?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, at some point this logic breaks down. Imagine if I were independently wealthy (as I do all the time), and I decided that the pain-points of development were…all points. And so, after designing my dream game, I paid contractors to build every single part. In this case, am I even a developer anymore, or just a publisher? Somewhere along this spectrum of getting outside help we must relinquish our solo-dev title, though where that line is drawn is subjective, and, as we’ve already pointed out, being a bona fide solo-dev isn’t all that important anyhow.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Some Things are Free"><span>Some Things are Free</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm an amateur Art history nerd, and I see videogames as part of that history.

After all, this IS the Art that programs produce right now, so it's absence would be fictionally bizarre. As such, there are a handful of generated images in Carceri (all clearly marked). I mostly used prompts that reference Art History: old masters, Delacroix, Hudson Valley School, etc. Even still, who knows where these AI models took their imagery from? So, I went ahead and photo-collaged many of the results together, creating images altered beyond their raw generative output. All that said, unlike prompters, I don't think of AI art as something I created.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Some Things are Priceless"><span>Some Things are Priceless</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Carceri contains a lot of dime-store philosophy. Much of it is delivered with jokes, or by cutesy characters, but even so, it’s plentiful. As with the real-world Art of the galleries, Carceri addresses real-world philosophies, with ideas taken from the last 2000+ years of western thought. Certainly, CERTAINLY, I didn't come up with this stuff by myself. While I'd like to think Carceri provides a unique spin on these subjects, and maybe, eventually, pushes into new territory, it is absolutely standing on the shoulders of titans.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Could I have generated a wholly new system of thought for a $7 indie game most will ignore?

Everyone (who's serious about game development) has people playtest their game. Carceri would be a mess if a few people didn't sit and get hopelessly lost in my questionably designed early levels. And if the world ever hears about Carceri, it certainly wasn't from me, a social media recluse. They heard about it from some form of influencer: game website, youtuber, streamer, and so on. Without these message amplifiers, the game might as well not exist, and then who cares how many people developed this lost work of Art?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And, of course, there's the people we thank if we ever win an award: parents, family, friends, teachers, and colleagues. People who supported us, pushed us, and didn't make us become lawyers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roger Ebert said videogames </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/video-games-can-never-be-art">are never, and will never, be Art</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> because they can’t be works of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-genders">true authorial intent</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, since players are free to do whatever they please. Of course, designers know that the choices given to players are PART of the authorial process, as we decide which actions are/aren’t available to them, and what those actions mean to the game’s narrative.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That aside, perhaps when we talk of solo-devs, we're talking about this fabled Author? After all, to the claims that Manor Lords wasn't a solo-dev game, Styczeń responded saying something to the effect of "fire me and the game dies. I am the game." And he's right. It was his vision, his design, his hard work that made it into the smash success it is today. Yes, they could fire him (not sure who "they" are), and simply maintain what's already there, but anything added after his departure would clearly be the work of a new author.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Think of how Star Wars has drifted since Lucas stepped away. Or, to bring it back to videogames, think of how stagnant Metal Gear has become since Hideo Kojima was rudely ejected. Even before Konami's intervention, Kojima kept trying to retire from Metal Gear, claiming each was his last. Yet he always returned, conceding that other directors simply didn't understand. And how could they? Metal Gear is Kojima's wild story to tell, much like Star Wars is Lucas's. Metal Gear Survive basically had no story, and now the Snake Eater remake is using the exact words of it's original; neither game daring to be the next chapter of what should, from a business perspective, be something you'd think Konami would milk to death. Guess they’re stranded.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><img data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blta73766b2b19adf86/663b94b338475cad7f9befc2/metalgear_chicken.jpg?width=NaN&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blta73766b2b19adf86/663b94b338475cad7f9befc2/metalgear_chicken.jpg?width=NaN&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="metalgear_chicken.jpg" title="metalgear_chicken.jpg"></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But now we've run into a curious problem: neither Star Wars, nor Metal Gear, were solo endeavors. Both were made with HUGE teams. Of course, Ebert recognized Star Wars as a work of art and authorship, but not Metal Gear (because, y’know, chicken hats in cutscenes, undermining the author; as if that option found its way into the game by accident). Maybe one of the benefits of claiming to be a solo-dev is to insinuate that your game is, by default, a work of authorship. Granted the author might suck (hi), but, in a way, "solo-dev" is making a promise to players that this game/work of Art hasn't been diluted, or compromised. For better or worse, it's the result of a single vision.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, authorship doesn't have to come from a sole person, which is why most games are rightly attributed to an entire team. Ultimately, whether authorship matters or not, for games, is a separate debate (though one would assume an "authorless" game to be a hollow shell with no identity). For now, this sole author talk is simply my way of feeling a bit justified for all my dev effort when I probably should have just become a lawyer. Or asked someone for help.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">[CarceriShot03 picture here]</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="So..."><span>So...</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">...did I make my game myself?

Notably, the company is also going all-in on multi-platform development to expand its consumer base.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Japanese publisher has ditched its previous medium-term plan after acknowledging that many titles, including some outsourced projects and triple-A releases, failed to live up to profit expectations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It cited other issues with its old plan, including the cannibalisation of newer releases due to a crowded launch schedule, gaps in management infrastructure, and aging legacy titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Broadly speaking, the company had previously hoped to find success by rebuilding its HD Game and Smart Devices/PC Browser portfolio, expanding its MMO business, and stabilizing its publishing business. It now feels that approach is no longer viable due to an "incomplete journey to better profitability in HD game development."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, the company's new corporate philosophy structure will focus on the creation of "unforgettable experiences." What does that mean in real terms? Square Enix has provided some semblance of an answer that may, or may not, provide clarity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The power of content is that of moving people's heart," wrote the company. "The experience that people are impressed is etched in my mind as 'unforgettable experiences' over time." It claimed those experiences will deliver "moral support" and "enrich" lives. It also said they must provide "ensured fun."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A new medium-term plan to usher in a new dawn for Square Enix">A new medium-term plan to usher in a new dawn for Square Enix</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To achieve that rather nebulous goal, the company is rebooting its business around four pillars and has dubbed the plan "Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those four pillars will see the firm attempt to enhance productivity by optimizing its development footprint, strike a balance between shareholder return and growth investment, and diversify earnings opportunities by strengthening customer contact points, and roll out initiatives to create additional foundational stability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><img data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/bltebcca867f35dd8e1/66420ad9efed0f44c98f182c/Screenshot_2024-05-13_at_13.26.48.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/bltebcca867f35dd8e1/66420ad9efed0f44c98f182c/Screenshot_2024-05-13_at_13.26.48.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot_2024-05-13_at_13.26.48.png" title="Screenshot_2024-05-13_at_13.26.48.png"></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Outlining how it will streamline production, Square explains it will shift from "quantity for quality" to ensure its releases are fun. In doing so, the company will retire its business unit-based organizational design to establish an "operationally integrated organization" with a focus on in-house development. It will also transition to a project management structure that keeps the balance between the "creativity of individual employees and the management centred on the organization."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To bolster the reach and performance of its triple-A slate, Square will now "aggressively pursue" a multiplatform strategy by extending more support to Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. "[We intend to] build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles," wrote the company. It will also device a platform strategy for smart device (SD) titles that includes platforms beyond the iOS and Android ecosystem."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Accelerating digital sales is another key focus area for the company, which believes attracting PC users could be a huge growth driver. Transmedia initiatives are expected to become another cornerstone of the business, with Square hoping to become an organization that makes "more active use of its IP by offing it across all media formats."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Square's overseas divisions will be rebuilt in line with the company's Japanese divisions, while the company is also hoping to better leverage its own internal talent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mergers and acquisitions are on the table, as well. Square explained it has earmarked a maximum of 100 billion yen ($640 million) for "total strategic investments" over the next three years, but said it must "exercise strict financial discipline" in deciding where to invest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can check out the pitch for yourself on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20240513_01_en.pdf">Square Enix investor relations website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p><a data-testid="contributor-summary-img-link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/author/chris-kerr"><img data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt1c7a117d71555292/650efbcad3423169a8871059/chris_kerr_headshot.jpg?width=400&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt1c7a117d71555292/650efbcad3423169a8871059/chris_kerr_headshot.jpg?width=400&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="Chris Kerr" title="Chris Kerr"></a></p><div><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="251" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For more than a decade, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a></em> has received a steady stream of updates. Now, developer Digital Extremes has settled into a fairly consistent schedule. The best part is that you can follow along with that schedule to keep up to date with everything. </p> <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="true">Digital Extremes holds regular <em>Warframe</em> Devstreams to keep fans up to date with what’s coming to the game, what the team is working on, the next major expansion, and any news around the game that might be pertinent. This includes TennoCon, the annual <em>Warframe</em> convention. While these Devstreams aren’t reliably regular at the time of writing, there is a vague pattern the developer tries to stick to so you don’t miss them. </p>
 <h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-warframe-devstream" data-injectable="false">When is the next <em>Warframe</em> Devstream?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Aoi.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="All platform releases of Warframe" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Aoi.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Aoi.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Aoi.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Aoi.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Digital Extremes</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">The next <em>Warframe</em> Devstream, which should be #180, should occur between <strong>May 13 to 19, 2024</strong>. The last one covered the upcoming <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warframe-jade-shadows-new-warframe-and-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jade Shadows update</a>, gave us a little glimpse at <em>Warframe: 1999</em>, and doled out some new details about TennoCon 2024. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Warframe Devstream 179: Jade Shadows Details, Status Reworks, New TennoGen, Nightwave &amp; More" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TexQjt_lUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="739" data-injectable="true"><em>Warframe</em> Devstream #180 should look deeper into <em>Jade Shadows</em> because it’s due out in June 2024. When we have a date for it, I’ll add it to this article. I’d also expect to hear more about TennoCon 2024 or the update that’ll follow <em>Jade Shadows</em>, too. Considering how close we are to this update dropping, Digital Extremes will likely want to share other news, even if it’s only the next Prime Access Warframe. </p>
 <p data-characters="127" data-current-count="127" data-injectable="false">To ensure you don’t miss it, you should subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Warframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warframe</em> YouTube channel</a> to catch every new video posted on it. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">All <em>Warframe</em> Devstreams for 2024</h2> <figure data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Screen.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="When did Warframe come out?" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Screen.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Screen.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Screen.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Screen.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Digital Extremes</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">Below, I’ve listed every <em>Warframe</em> Devstream for 2024 so far. This should give you an idea of everything that’s been shared to date. This year’s big focus is definitely <em>Warframe: 1999</em>, but there are always a few surprises, like <em>Whispers in the Walls</em>, lurking in the shadows to keep us on our toes. </p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gb0NnIQSk4&amp;t=0s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe Devstream #175 – Whispers in the Walls</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJbYyAMTTU0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe Devstream </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJbYyAMTTU0">#176 – Dante Unbound</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy_vtGx8vq8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe Devstream #177 – Dante gameplay reveal and more</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMTym46pDns&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe Devstream #178 – Live from PAX East</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TexQjt_lUY&amp;t=5s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe Devstream #179 – Jade Shadows details</a></strong></li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">So far, Digital Extremes has followed a pattern of roughly two Devstreams between updates. This allows the developer time to finalize what it’s working on and show off just a hint of what’s to come. The Devstream following an update also usually contains information about post-launch updates that sweeten the deal by adding something extra to whatever was just added to the game. </p>

            <p>What if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/scorn">Scorn</a>, but it's one that your mum got you for Christmas? That's easy, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/necrophosis">Necrophosis</a>, baby. Much like Scorn, Necrophosis is also part-inspired by the dystopian surrealist works of Zdzisław Beksiński, which means lots of plucking brains out of sinewy bodies and plopping them into fleshy receptacles. There's a demo out now and while it's not outstanding, it tickled my curiosity more than I thought it would.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Developed by Dragonis Ares and Adonis Brosteanu, Necrophosis is a first-person horror adventure whose demo kicks off in a similar way to Scorn, but sillier. You, a sundried anatomy model, awaken in a messed up desert following a recitation of William Blake's Auguries Of Innocence. "Blah blah, eternity in the palm of your nan", yeah cool cool - it definitely wants you to know it's very smart and reads lots of books.</p>
<p>Still, visually it's quite magnificent. Flayed corpses and ribs and towering statues that pray to fleshy sacks. One of the first things you've got to do in the demo is run around this arena and figure out what tendril or eyeball goes into what meat pocket, but it's not outrageously difficult - which is good. That was one of my gripes with Scorn, in that its puzzling was sometimes <em>very</em> obtuse. I know I've only played a bit of Necrophosis, but it seems far less intimidating off the bat.</p>
<p>And while I'm no sucker for these sorts of puzzles games, I found myself pressing on with the demo. Besides a bit too much of monsters speaking in riddles, I liked seeing the outcomes of my weird deeds. Like when I fired a bone cannon at a crucifix, then plugged the brain of the corpse into a bone crab.

            <p>Australia-based developer Mighty Kingdom has laid off 28% of its workforce, affecting at least 14 people.</p>
<p>The studio informed staff last week and posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/MightyKingdom/status/1789819762052116621/photo/1">statement</a> from CEO David Yin on social media this morning. Yin explained that the move had come as the company undergoes a "strategic rightsizing to streamline our operations" and restructure some roles.</p>
<p>"This decision is made with heavy hearts and we never wanted to find ourselves in this position," Yin continued. "We have exhausted all possible avenues to avert these changes."</p>
<p>The CEO described the layoffs as "the toughest chapter in our story."</p>
<p>Mighty Kingdom has <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-dITKRP_JpZr1THjsyGAJJZ7_lkQUbpMKMu1tScG370/edit#gid=0">shared a spreadsheet online</a> giving details for all the affected staff that were willing to be included, and the studio is calling on potential employers to bring those who have been laid off on board. At the time of writing, 14 people are listed in the document.</p>
<p>"We highly recommend each of the incredible professionals we've had to part ways with," Yin wrote. "They have contributed significantly to our success over the years. If you can assist or hire, please consider reaching out to them."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="251" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Warzone </em>players are always looking for the fastest ways to take down enemies, which is where this WSP Stinger loadout comes into its own. This pistol shreds players faster than anything else, but one specific attachment makes it difficult to control. </p> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">It’s rare to see players running pistols in <em>Warzone</em> these days, with most players opting to run two primary weapons in their loadout instead. Of course, there are always exceptions, like when the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-devs-confirm-nerf-for-overpowered-renetti/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Renetti was frying everyone</a>, but generally, they are a rare sight. </p> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">That may be about to change, however, as <em>Warzone</em> expert WhosImmortal just revealed that the WPS Stinger has the fastest time-to-kill in the game right now, but only if you use it as an akimbo weapon. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="WARZONE: Top 5 BEST TTK META LOADOUTS After Update! (WARZONE 3 Fastest TTK Weapons)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WPiJZD8o-SE?start=452&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">“On paper, it’s crazy, crazy busted,” the YouTuber explained. “Akimbo obviously means hipfire and that’s not 100% accurate. The TTK is going to vary here but up close this thing is nuts. At 11 meters, it’s got a 520 millisecond TTK which is the best available—pistols, SMGs, you name it.”</p>
 <p data-characters="82" data-current-count="82" data-injectable="false">If you want to try out WhosImmortals loadout, we’ve listed it for you below:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Breacher Device</li> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>HISS Short Light Barrel</li> <li><strong>Laser: </strong>XTEN Sidearm-L400</li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>32-Round Mag</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Akimbo WSP Stinger</li> </ul> <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="726" data-injectable="true">After seeing this, I tried putting the loadout together myself to see how it felt, and I have to say, he’s right about it shredding in close-quarters combat. When I ran into people inside buildings, I felt like I was melting them, and I didn’t find the hip fire too difficult to control. Obviously, it’s not going to be as accurate as aiming down a sight, but it’s useable and I didn’t feel like I was struggling. </p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">With any hip-fire weapon though, at distance, it is almost impossible to be accurate, so I would recommend running an assault rifle alongside it to give you a chance at longer ranges. </p>

            <p>Cheese and loyal pets (two important items on Maslow's hierarchy of needs) have been added to the co-op survival crafting game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a>. The dairy product manifests as various suspiciously coloured cheese wheels which you can cook and eat, while loyalty comes in the form of freakish pets that can now follow your every move. The pets themselves are technically not new to Abiotic Factor, but their player-tracking behaviour is. "There is, as far as we know, no limit to how many pets can follow you at once," say the devs. Hmmm. I wonder if any scientifically minded folks will test such a hypothesis. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>I say "headcrabs" in the headline because the game has a lot of Half-Life vibes. But really the pets are <a href="https://abioticfactor.wiki.gg/wiki/Pest">these creepy hedgehog critters</a> normally considered pests. You can tame them and enjoy them as companions for as long as they survive the hostile lab environment. The pets have "very small, adventurous brains," we are told. </p><p> A bunch of other small things have been added or altered, according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4170973472349895596">the recent update from developers Deep Field Games</a>, including some useful walkie talkies. 

</p><figure>

</figure>
<p>These walkie talkies will let players chat over greater distances, whereas before in-game chittering was limited to proximity chat. Not a huge change for anyone simply opting for Discord. But in co-op chaos like this it's often more fun to opt-in to the built-in communication of the game world. "For now, Walkie-Talkies will allow players to hear you all over the Facility -- and even beyond," say the creators. "Later on we have some more plans with these cool little communicators, and we may impose a few more sensible restrictions." Sounds ominous.</p>
<p>Abiotic Factor is basically "Half-Life but funnier and with friends" - a co-op survive-em-up with poo jokes and the ability to make "weird soup" from inedible items. It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-lifey-survival-game-abiotic-factor-is-out-now-in-early-access">in early access for the moment</a>, with staggered updates planned to bring jetpacks and new sectors of the lab to explore, all before the 1.0 version comes out sometime in winter. You can check the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/427410/discussions/7/4358998952353776588/?snr=1_2108_9__2107">full changelog for this update</a> but here are some highlights plucked out for you, because my hobby is reading patch notes freed from context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed Fatigue gain from pie slices</li>
<li>Food decay can no longer be repaired at the Repair Bench</li>
<li>Fixed an issue were Trams would destroy furniture above or below them, violating several laws of physics</li>
<li>Fixed Antepasta turning soup toxic</li>
<li>CAUTION: Security Robots are no longer intimidated by the presence of a Crafting Bench when attempting to exit their pod</li>
<li>Potatoes can now be planted</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't played Abiotic Factor yet but I have been looking at various YouTube japes longingly. I'm writing this news post as a way to get myself psyched up to actually try it. It certainly looks like my cup of bubbling radioactive ooze. </p>

            <p>There aren't many ways left to put a twist on Stardew Valley, but suffixing it with "in space!" oughta do it. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-known-galaxy/">Little-Known Galaxy</a> is out in a week, and currently has a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521600/LittleKnown_Galaxy/">Steam</a>, where you can sample many of the delights that you're used to from a Stardewlike when you're new in town: meeting the locals, growing potatoes, and tidying up the place. Also, raising alien pets, seeking out new life, and new civilisations... It all takes place on a spaceship, you see, and this has some ramifications to playing the game beyond reskinning everything to be shiny metal instead of picturesque mud. It's an intriguing proposition.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There is a reskin, though, and it's surprising how refreshing it is to the formula. The town is arranged on different decks of the ship, making it much easier to navigate than I had feared, and there are a couple of sweet plant aliens and characterful little robots running around. The schoolteacher is a well groomed robot named Max. A lot of people go to the plaza deck at dinner time to hang out at the restaurant, and the ship has seen a lot of captains come and go, so several crewmembers are quite curmudgeonly toward you, the new trainee captain. Generally, though, this seems to be the utopian ideal of Starfleet, with everyone getting along and doing their assigned jobs. It's sort of like if Picard got really into gardening <em>before</em> he retired.</p>
<p>But the space thing does shake up how you play. One small but impactful change is that you can't just till a convenient square of dirt outside your front door. To grow crops you need to craft a planter, and they run on power - so you also need to craft solar panels and whack them on the outside of your ship. If you don't have enough solar panels, your new planters will be useless lumps of showy metal, making Little-Known Galaxy the first Cybertrunk Owner Simulator (*snare*). This changes the whole loop of your crafting cycle! You need to gather soil samples and scrap metal as a priority, rather than the basis of your economy early on being quick-growing plants to turn a fast profit. </p>
<p>And yes, you visit planet surfaces (you start in orbit around a grey planet with a mysterious monolith on it) and can travel to <em>other</em> planets, too. There's a lot more going on with Little-Known Galaxy than I had anticipated. Have a poke around <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521600/LittleKnown_Galaxy/">the demo</a> yourself, and watch out for full release on May 20th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Most of us know playing the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a> with friends and family can be a great way to spend your free time. But what about turning to board games when you find yourself alone and looking for something to pass the time? It's not as strange as it may sound, because many board games these days are designed to be played solo, or at least have a fun solitaire mode. From <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy games</a> to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-roll-and-write-board-games">roll-and-write board games</a> and everything in between, there are many options available for solo play. Below, we'll take a look at some of the best board games that can be played alone, giving you a chance to relax and unwind while still engaging your mind.</p><h2>TL;DR: The Best Solo Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/x3bRY" target="_blank">Final Girl</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/qV657" target="_blank">Dune: Imperium</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/wKvrN" target="_blank">Hadrian's Wall</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5qROV" target="_blank">Imperium: Horizons</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/RVgAV" target="_blank">Frosthaven</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/6wMEq" target="_blank">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/AMZKw" target="_blank">Mage Knight</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/w2lqq" target="_blank">Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/mmDjN" target="_blank">Under Falling Skies</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/E34A2" target="_blank">Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/pPwYR" target="_blank">Dinosaur Island: Rawr 'n Write</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3qAxM" target="_blank">Arkham Horror: The Card Game</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/lngrR" target="_blank">Cascadia</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/kPNb5" target="_blank">Cartographers Heroes</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/YlPex" target="_blank">Terraforming Mars</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/KjPv3" target="_blank">Spirit Island</a></li></ul><h2>Final Girl</h2><div id="196835"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Final Girl" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/final-girl-1709150748483.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Final Girl</h3></p></div><p>If there’s a particular theme that excels for solo gaming, it’s horror. When it’s just you and the dice in a darkened room, board gaming gets the closest it can realistically manage to feeling unsettling. And whatever your particular fear is, one of Final Girl’s many, <a href="https://zdcs.link/bPgDJ" target="_blank">many expansion sets</a> will have you covered. It’s a modular game in which you play as the titular survivor at the end of a horror story, splitting time allocations between taking actions, playing cards and getting more cards, a split that gives the game its tension and strategic edge. But the core box isn’t enough to play on its own: you also need a <a href="https://zdcs.link/bPgDJ" target="_blank">Film Box</a>, which comes with two scenarios based on classic horror movies, so you can pick and choose between your favorite flicks and your worst fears. Whatever you choose, you’re guaranteed a thrill ride in this horribly unfair but narratively brilliant game.</p><h2>Dune: Imperium</h2><div id="155275"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Dune Imperium" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/10/19/dune-imperium-box-1634675346852.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Dune Imperium</h3></p></div><p>Despite it being one of the best strategy games of recent years, you might be surprised to find Dune: Imperium on this list since really it needs three or four players to shine. However, the need to also cater for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player board games</a> led the designer to include an automated opponent, House Hagal. Despite this being a fairly interactive game, House Hagal is simple to administer yet still manages to block out board space, steal resources and send in troops to contest territory, just like a real player. Solitaire you face two of them, with varying difficulty levels, which feels a lot more satisfying than just playing for a high score, as well as letting you experience this excellent game without roping in your friends.

It’s always been a solo-friendly genre, but this game really excels when played solitaire, not least because there’s now a <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/content/File%20Storage%20for%20site/HadriansWall-SoloCampaign.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downloadable campaign</a> for it. Your task is to construct walls and fortresses in Roman Britain to repel Pictish invasions at the end of each round. That sense of dynamism is one of the things that sets the game apart from its peers. The others are a satisfying array of crunchy combos to cross off on your sheet, for plenty of strategic depth, and a long-term commitment to resource management with actual tokens rather than box-checks. Between them, these three things push Hadrian’s Wall away from the abstract conventions of its genre and into the living, breathing realm of history.</p><h2>Imperium: Horizons</h2><div id="196837"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Imperium: Horizons" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/imperium-1709150914212.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Imperium: Horizons</h3></p></div><p>Civilization games have a long and storied history, but they’re not, on the whole, very solo-friendly. The Imperium series from Osprey games, of which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/imperium-horizons-board-game-review">Imperium: Horizons</a> is the latest and greatest entry, is a notable exception. It’s also a fascinating exercise in bringing the deck-building mechanic to the genre. Each player selects a civilization, which comes with a unique starting deck and set of cards they can add as the game progresses, and it’s this granting of a specific deck that makes it suitable for solo play. It’s on you to leverage the game’s complex mechanisms, which newly includes trading and economics, to build your civilization from scratch, without overextending yourself and collapsing into the ever-present threat of revolt. It’s a significant challenge with any one of the fourteen included civilizations, but when you realise each one requires a unique strategic approach, you’ll understand you’ve got a solitaire game of colossal replay value and depth.</p><h2>Gloomhaven / Frosthaven</h2><div><div id="155276"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Frosthaven" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/15/frosthaven-1686077923971-1708012440033.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Frosthaven</h3></p></div><div id="155277"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/02/10/gloomhaven-jaws-lion-1644509043015.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h3></p><div><p>Playable as a standalone game, or as an expansion to Gloomhaven.</p></div></div></div><p>Perhaps the largest and most involved game on this list, Frosthaven is ideal for those pining for a grand fantasy adventure on the tabletop. In this legacy-style undertaking, you’ll guide an adventurer across a sprawling fantasy world teeming with dungeons and monsters. Card-driven tactical combat is at the name of the game, and each turn you’ll have to carefully consider what to play from your hand. The fact that you can lose cards permanently gives each decision significant weight, and the persistent world makes your experience vastly different from others’. Frosthaven is a vast yet personal game that is just begging to be explored over several sessions. If the scale and price are too much for you to play alone, consider the cut-down but still excellent Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion. You can check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion review</a> for details on that standalone game.</p><h2>Mage Knight</h2><div id="158406"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Mage Knight: Ultimate Edition" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/mageknight-1709151453718.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Mage Knight: Ultimate Edition</h3></p></div><p>In the years since its 2011 release, Mage Knight has become synonymous with solo gaming. A sprawling fantasy epic from famed designer Vlaada Chvátil, Mage Knight was designed for 1-4 players, but it shines particularly well as a solitary experience. It’s a great choice when you’re in the mood for fighting monsters, upgrading your character, and exploring a fantasy setting. Make sure to set aside a large chunk of time, though, because games can last upwards of three hours, and each turn presents you with a puzzle-like series of actions that require a great deal of optimization.</p><h2>Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</h2><div id="157800"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/30/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-1648659069333.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</h3></p></div><p>Step into the shoes of literature’s greatest detective in this board game equivalent of a mystery novel. Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective includes a number of scenarios and fun props that really sell the experience. There’s a map of London, an address directory and a newspaper, each offering clues to hunt down and suspects to interview. Be warned, however, that this game does not hold your hand; each adventure presents a small amount of setup and exposition, and then sends you out into the city without much direction, leaving you to decide what locations to visit and who to accuse. This game gives you the chance to live up to Holmes’ reputation, which is a tall order given how though the mysteries can be.</p><p>You can check out more of our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-murder-mystery-board-games">best mystery board games</a> if you like this one.</p><h2>Under Falling Skies</h2><div id="158414"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Under Falling Skies" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/05/under-falling-skies-1649182830734.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Under Falling Skies</h3></p></div><p>While solo options are fairly standard on most games nowadays, they can’t quite match those rare titles that venture to be solo only, such as Under Falling Skies. It’s a riff on Space Invaders as alien ships descent ever closer to the base you’re trying to protect. Under the pressure of their advance, you’ll have to balance a limited pool of dice between shooting them down, building your base and researching a final end to the alien menace. But there’s a beautiful catch: the higher the dice you use, the better the effect and the faster the alien above descends. With a variety of scenarios that can be recombined into a campaign, like those of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">best campaign board games</a>, this is a simple concept that will keep you gaming for a very long time. </p><h2>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island</h2><div id="157792"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Robinson Crusoe Adventures on the Cursed Island" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/30/robinson-1648658698630.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Robinson Crusoe Adventures on the Cursed Island</h3></p></div><p>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island casts players as shipwreck survivors on an island that is actively trying to kill them. There are several different characters to play as, each with various strengths and weaknesses. You will find yourself scavenging for food, building and upgrading shelters, and exploring perilous locations on the island. The game includes rules for a solo variant, but the general consensus is that it’s easier for a single player to simply take on the role of more than one character. There is a lot going on in Robinson Crusoe and the ample iconography can be a bit overwhelming, but those that stick it out will find a rewarding adventure that begs for return trips.</p><h2>Dinosaur Island: Rawr N’ Write</h2><div id="158416"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Dinosaur Island: Rawr ‘n Write" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/05/dinosaur-island-rawr-1649183090562.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Dinosaur Island: Rawr ‘n Write</h3></p></div><p>Roll and write games, like co-op board games, often make very good solo fare because even multiplayer you’re all competing to make the best use of the same set of dice. Most, however, are too fast and simple for a compelling solitaire experience. Dinosaur Island: Rawr N’ Write is longer and more complex than its peers, but it pays off in a deeper, more satisfying game. Your dice rolls generate a wide variety of resources that you’ll need to balance carefully to build and run your Jurassic World style theme park. You even draw out the buildings on a grid and run tours through it but beware: if your security isn’t up to scratch, you may end up with fewer tourists than you started with.

The base game comes with a small handful of scenarios that send you directly into the jaws of cosmic mystery. You can use the suggested starter decks, or build a custom one centered around your chosen investigator’s special abilities. Gameplay sees you hopping from location to location to search for clues in order to advance the story while attempting to impede the deadly Mythos deck. Your investigator will inevitably take damage and acquire weaknesses over time that can affect future games in the campaign, making Arkham Horror: The Card Game one of the most thematic games on this list and one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">best horror board games</a> in general</p><h2>Cascadia</h2><div id="157128"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Cascadia" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/23/cascadia-1648059770674.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Cascadia</h3></p></div><p>While Cascadia is one of the very best <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a>, at first glance it doesn’t seem to offer much to a lone player. Sure the wildlife theme is appealing. And the simple yet addictive gameplay, where you choose pairs of random terrain tiles and animal tokens to add to your nature reserve to satisfy a range of scoring patterns, is fun enough. But what elevates it as a solitaire game is the list of achievements in the back of the rulebook. These task you to approach the game with different setups and rule tweaks, trying to reach particular score thresholds. Easy at first, the difficulty soon ramps up, giving you lots of varied challenges that are supremely satisfying to tick off, one by one.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cascadia-board-game-review"><em>review of Cascadia</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>Cartographers: Heroes</h2><div id="196838"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Cartographers: Heroes" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/28/cartographers-heroes-1709151138970.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Cartographers: Heroes</h3></p></div><p>A roll-and-write where the dice are replaced by cards, Cartographers: Heroes casts you as a royal surveyor seeking to map unexplored land in the name of your queen. Each turn, you’ll flip over a card that depicts both a terrain type and a Tetris-esque shape. You have to draw that shape and its terrain onto your grid map in a way that meets the random scoring conditions. The 16 possible goals include building a large contiguous village, completely filling out rows and columns of your grid, and drawing forest spaces on the edge of the map. Beware, though, because you may get ambushed by monsters at any time, and be forced to draw an inconvenient shape onto the map, forcing you to improvise in the future.</p><h2>Terraforming Mars</h2><div id="155280"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Terraforming Mars" src="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/10/09/terraforming-mars1570648127955.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Terraforming Mars</h3></p></div><p>In this heavy Euro-style game, you’ll help make the Martian surface hospitable to human life by increasing the oxygen levels in the atmosphere, raising the temperature from below freezing, and by building man-made oceans to sustain life. This is done through a combination of resource management and tableau building. You’ll take on the role of a mega corporation looking to profit off of humanity’s foray onto the red planet. add In the solo game, you’ll race against the clock to maximize each of the three end game parameters. Every turn, you play new cards from your hand, meaning your list of available actions will grow until you’ve assembled a sprawling tableau of action cards that can combo off of each other. It’s a very crunchy game experience, which is perfect for those who appreciate a good optimization puzzle. There are also a number of expansion scenarios available, making Terraforming Mars one of the best solo experiences available, as well as one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">best board games for adults</a>, too.</p><h2>Spirit Island</h2><div id="155274"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Spirit Island" src="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/12/12/spirit-island1576180843140.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Spirit Island</h3></p></div><p>By their nature, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board games</a> make for great solo experiences. Because of the players-versus-the-board structure, co-ops easily allow one person to control two or more players. One of the best co-op games in recent years is Spirit Island, a game about protecting your land from waves of vicious colonizers. You control island spirits, each with their own deck of power cards that help destroy settlements and repair land that’s been ravaged by agriculture. The strong theme and combo-heavy card play combine into one of the most robust cooperative experiences we’ve played. It just so happens to make an ideal solo game as well.</p><h2>Solitatire Board Game FAQS</h2><h2>Is it weird to play board games alone?</h2><p>Not at all! It's probably something that people have been doing for hundreds, maybe thousands of years. There's a 1697 French engraving that shows a woman at the King's court playing peg solitaire, and if it had reached the highest circles of nobility at that time, chances are it's a lot older. The solitaire card game that you've likely played on your computer at some point can be dated back to the late 1700s in northern Europe. Speaking of which, it's generally not thought odd for people to play video games like solitaire or far more complex fare alone, even in these internet-enabled times, so why should playing a board game by yourself be any different? In both cases, the enjoyment comes from trying to beat the challenge set by the game, and then trying again to see if you can better your own performance. Solo board games, much like their video counterparts, can also be enjoyed in part for the visual and tactile pleasures that they provide. It's no more peculiar than doing a jigsaw puzzle. </p><p>For more, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">best party board games</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">best deck-building card games</a>.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance board game and video game writer for IGN.

            <p>Despite the many difficulties the games industry faces around the world, Swedish developers are feeling somewhat optimistic as the local development scene continues to experience rapid growth.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, Dataspelsbranschen spokesperson Per Strömbäck says the general state of the Swedish games industry is "good", with the number of people working in the industry having grown from 2,500 to 8,500 people in the last decade.</p>
<p>He notes that while there are fewer vacancies at the moment due to the current global economic turmoil, there "aren't as many layoffs as in some other places, and the industry here is still growing."</p>
<p>Strömbäck says the current greatest strength in the Swedish games industry is the diversity in its titles, while the challenge will be to "ride out the economic downturn and retain investments."</p>
<p>"It is harder now for new studios to find funding and to rely on external investment," he explains. "But we have already seen a couple of really great releases such as Helldivers 2, and plenty of other titles still going strong. So we keep making great games, which is what we do best."</p>
<p>Strömbäck also expressed surprise at how quickly the Swedish games industry has "matured" within the last decade, and that it has struck the right balance between AAA, indie, and mobile studios in its ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The innovation and creative hunger is unmatched in such a small and concentrated location"</p>
<cite>Oskar Wolontis, Hazelight Studios</cite></blockquote>
<p>Two of its most successful developers include Hazelight Studios and Midjiwan, the creators of It Takes Two and The Battle of Polytopia respectively.</p>
<p>Hazelight Studios COO Oskar Wolontis agrees with Strömback's assessment of the Swedish games industry, adding that its rich history in gaming has solidified Sweden's place on the games industry radar – especially when it comes to talent.</p>
<p>"All this combined ensures Sweden has one of the best game development talent pools in the world," says Wolontis. "The experience, the innovation and creative hunger is unmatched in such a small and concentrated geographic location."</p>
<p>Midjiwan general manager Christian Lövstedt credits the culture that the industry has fostered over the years, as well as its ability to retain talent.</p>
<p>"The collaborative approach within [Swedish] studios has also proven effective in crafting innovative game titles," explains Lövstedt. "Moreover, Sweden's longstanding tradition of engineering has fostered an exceptionally high level of technical expertise within its game development community."</p>
<blockquote><p>"There is clear confidence from outside investors - we've collectively shown Sweden can release hit after hit on a global scale"</p>
<cite>Christian Lövstedt, Midjiwan</cite></blockquote>
<p>Lövstedt also notes the media attention from "major successes" such as Minecraft, which have contributed to the growth of the industry and have helped change perceptions and boost attention for smaller studios such as Midjiwan.</p>
<p>This growth has helped studios like Hazelight, which has utilised the local talent pool to expand its development team.</p>
<p>"The amount of raw talent in both the experienced developers but also the new graduates each year is mighty impressive," says Wolontis. "There is also clear confidence in the Swedish game development industry from outside investors – we’ve collectively shown we can release hit after hit on a global scale. This confidence in the local talent pool lowers the risk of investment and in turn fuels our ability to keep those hits coming."</p>
<p>He adds that developers from around the world have moved to Sweden, noting that the talent pool has become "much more diversified" and that for Hazelight, 10% of its studio is made up of game creators from other nationalities.</p>
<p>For Midjiwan, recruiting locally has been challenging because "the demand for talented game developers far exceeds supply," according to Lövstedt. The studio has a core team of Swedish developers based in Stockholm, with its community manager in California.</p>

<figcaption>Midjiwan’s The Battle of Polytopia is in its ninth year, and shows no signs of slowing down</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Wolontis agrees with this. Despite having made use of local talent to help grow Hazelight, it was a challenge for the studio to get to that point.</p>
<p>"The interest in investing in the Swedish game development industry in recent years has been higher than the local talent pool can reasonably support," he explains. 

</p><p>"Granted, the surge of remote work during the pandemic and afterwards have somewhat been able to mitigate this. Yet talent is still in high demand regardless."</p>
<p>And as a smaller studio, Midjiwan is facing similar issues, as Lövstedt adds: "As a smaller studio, we face extra difficulties in attracting the best local talent since people tend to gravitate towards the bigger studios, believing it's safer (which is incorrect in our case)."</p>
<p>Another challenge faced by Swedish studios is a lack of support from the government. Strömbäck explains there's no dedicated policy for the games industry there, such as tax breaks or subsidies.</p>
<p>"The general tax incentive programs on research and development and such are available also to the games companies, but are difficult to use," he says. "There are some very successful incubators, but they are funded and operated on the local or regional level.</p>
<p>"So in terms of public support, Sweden actually has very little compared to some other prominent countries such as Finland, Canada, and the UK. However, higher education is public funded and we have some world class game education here."</p>
<p>Lövstedt also highlights the government facilitating education for games development, but notes there are "too few graduate students to fill the industry's needs" and because there are little to no incentives provided – especially when it comes to employment –  it can be hard for small studios to find footing.</p>
<p>"If you are a new studio, it can be very tough to get the business to work," he explains. "There are no government financial instruments or subsidies for employing people to help you out in the beginning. Many smaller companies address this by taking on external consultancy work, which results in less time to work on your own game title, which can itself become a vicious circle."</p>
<p>So what needs to change? Wolontis says the Swedish government needs to recognise the contributions that the "economic behemoth of an industry" can provide.</p>
<p>"When that happens, it will hopefully open the doors for more productive talks with the powers that be. Any new support systems focusing on ease of business and talent pool growth would be most welcome."</p>
<p>One way for the government to take note is by looking at the success of homegrown games. Midjiwan's turn-based strategy title The Battle of Polytopia is currently in its ninth year, having launched in February 2016, and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>
<p>"Our goal is for the game to remain popular for many years to come," said Lövstedt.</p>
<p>"We can't say too much about our pipeline, but we continuously make improvements, introduce new features, and create content so that players will continue to play it and new players will discover it."</p>
<p>Another success for the Swedish games industry is Hazelight's co-op platformer It Takes Two, which released in 2021. The title <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-takes-two-picks-up-game-of-the-year-at-2022-dice-awards">picked up Game of the Year at the 2022 DICE Awards</a> among dozens of other awards, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-takes-two-moves-16m-units-news-in-brief">surpassed 16 million sales this March</a>.</p>
<p>"We've shown the world that Sweden can still produce games with a whole new level of innovation never seen before – I want to say a completely new genre, even," Wolontis adds.</p>
<p>"It shows how creatively diverse the talent can be here with the right creative guidance. It Takes Two also happened to become our country's first global Game of the Year winner – that must count for something, right?"</p>

            <p>
Fans of EA Sports FC have responded angrily after EA altered a perceived issue with FUT rewards providing "unintended results".
</p>
<p>
As part of the game's Weekend League, players have a chance to win special versions of certain players, which this past weekend included Kylian Mbappe who's considered the best player in the game.
</p>
<p>
EA doesn't release the odds of receiving specific players, but Mbappe and other top players appeared to be cropping up more often than usual at the start of the weekend.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>

The company then shared a message on Saturday stating it had "identified an issue where the Champions Player Pick rewards were providing unintended results", which was then "corrected in-game".
</p>
<p>
Following the change, players believe EA nerfed the likelihood of the best footballers appearing to force more in-game purchases.
</p>
<p>
A community note on EA's X (formerly Twitter) post reads: "There may have been a probability issue, but there is no evidence of 'unintended rewards' being given out. Mbappe and Dembele are part of Ligue 1 TOTS, so they fit the reward description. EA lowered their chance because it will force players to open packs with real currency."
</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have identified an issue where the Champions Player Pick rewards were providing unintended results. This has been corrected in-game.</p>— EA SPORTS FC Direct Communication (@EASFCDirect) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASFCDirect/status/1789111173847396598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Many angry replies to the post are requesting EA change it back, as early players receiving the top rewards before the change are now dominating online.
</p>
<p>
"Leave it as it was, everyone was happy. Mad, legit mad that you 'intend' to shaft people for playing your competitive game mode," reads one response.
</p>
<p>
"Leave it as it was. Don't fix it so half the community that weren't busy on Friday night get Red Dembele/Mbappe and we get shafted," reads another. "Most out of touch company on this planet."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted EA for further information.
</p>
<p>
EA has long had issues with controversial implementing of loot boxes, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-denies-its-pushing-fifa-players-to-spend-on-loot-boxes-after-insider-leaks-marketing-documents">company denying in 2021 it was "pushing" FIFA players to spend money in-game</a>.

</p>
<p>
Last week, EA's latest financial report revealed plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-has-teams-looking-at-thoughtful-implementations-of-ads-inside-its-game-experiences">potentially use in-game advertising to drive profits</a>.

            <p>The release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2</a> in early access last week has given the original game a nice little player boost.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the first Hades game managed to beat its own concurrent player record on Steam, with 54,240 taking on the mythological rogue-like dungeon crawler over the last 24 hours. </p>
<p>That's 16,491 more concurrent players than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-launch-on-steam-reaches-over-100k-concurrent-players-24-hours-after-launch">Hades' previous record of 37,749</a>, which it set four years ago.</p>

<p>Despite this boost, Hades is still a way off surpassing the sequel's player numbers, with Hades 2 currently holding a concurrent player record of 103,567. But, regardless, it is great to see Supergiant's original game getting more attention. </p>
<p>We here at Eurogamer are rather fond of Hades, and named it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is-hades-and-now-we-chat">our Game of the Year in 2020</a>. More specifically, our Christian Donlan was especially enamoured with the whole thing, calling it a "glittering headlong pelt through the underworld".</p>
<p>"Hades is a proper lark. I love it," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-review-of-myth-and-mayhem">Eurogamer's Hades review</a>. "This game comes from Hell, and it takes you back there, and it's <em>brilliant</em>. Get in."</p>
<p>It definitely isn't a game to be mythed!</p>

<p>And, its sequel Hades 2 ain't half bad either. For more, be sure to read Donlan's thoughts in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 early access review here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="378" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Whereas Capcom had a fantastic 2024 fiscal year <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/capcom-celebrates-record-high-profits-and-sales-for-seventh-year-in-a-row/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with record-high profits</a>, Square Enix has not enjoyed the same level of success. In fact, it’s reported its profits are down by nearly 70% (69.7% to be exact) compared to the previous fiscal year. As such, Square Enix is committing itself to a new business strategy, which includes a greater focus on multiplatform releases.</p> <p data-characters="661" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">In <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592661.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a presentation shared on May 13</a>, Square Enix outlined a plan it’s calling ‘Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens,’ with the goal of achieving long-term growth over the course of three years. Among its key pillars, it highlights shifting to a multiplatform strategy, something the company intends to “aggressively pursue” and will cover PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, and PC platforms. While Square Enix has launched plenty of multiplatform games in the past, it is known for limiting certain titles to specific platforms. In just the past 12 months, it launched <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-xvi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 16</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a></em> as PlayStation 5 exclusives.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Will-there-be-a-Final-Fantasy-16-sequel-in-the-works.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="793" data-injectable="true">It sounds like Square Enix has decided this approach isn’t in its best interests any more, and it would now rather get its games on as many platforms as it can. Some of its former platform exclusives have made the jump to other platforms after launch (for example, the first <em>Octopath Traveler</em> was a Nintendo Switch exclusive but was later ported to PC and Xbox), but Square Enix’s new strategy could also mean more simultaneous releases. So, no more time-limited exclusives either.</p>
 <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">Square Enix may also be considering bringing older titles to other platforms since it wants to “build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles.” It doesn’t provide any specific examples, but it’d be nice if this means the likes of <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em> and its predecessor, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-vii-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a></em>, can make the jump to Xbox.</p>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">Making games more widely available seems like a fairly obvious solution to making more money. However, Square Enix also mentions wanting to focus on quality over quantity, which suggests it’ll reduce its output. So, Square Enix games will come out less frequently, but they’ll ideally be of high quality and more readily available to a wide audience.</p> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="789" data-injectable="true">Square Enix certainly needs to do something different if its HD games division isn’t turning a profit. Net sales were overall up compared to the 2023 fiscal year thanks to <em>FF16</em> and <em>FF7 Rebirth</em>, as well as <em>Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince</em> and continued sales of the <em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em> collection, but operating losses grew due to “higher development cost amortization and advertising expenses.”</p>
 <p data-characters="550" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="false">In its <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fiscal report</a>, Square Enix also reconfirmed it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sounds-like-square-enix-has-scrapped-140-million-worth-of-console-and-pc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost nearly $141 million in cancelled projects</a>. It had said it expected this back in April, but Square Enix has now explained precisely why these projects were scrapped. Essentially, it found them to be “incompatible” with its new strategy for growth and how it intends to develop HD games going forward. Again, it didn’t name any of the cancelled projects, but it’s likely these were unannounced titles rather than anything Square Enix has listed on its release schedule.</p>

Amid positive feedback, it emerged that the contract that creators had to sign to gain access to the game included a number of clauses that prevented any disparaging comments.</p><p>As streamer and retired professional Overwatch player Brandon Larned, aka Seagull, revealed on X / Twitter, the non-disparagement clause in the contract prevented creators from posting negative reviews, or even comparing it to competitors, such as Blizzard’s Overwatch.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Extremely disappointed in <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MarvelRivals</a>. </p><p>Multiple creators asked for key codes to gain access to the playtest and are asked to sign a contract.</p><p>The contract signs away your right to negatively review the game.</p><p>Many streamers have signed without reading just to play</p><p>Insanity. <a href="https://t.co/c11BUDyka9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/c11BUDyka9</a></p></div>— Brandon Larned (@A_Seagull) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Seagull/status/1789468582281400792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Reaction to this clause was overwhelmingly negative, with developer NetEase coming under fire for its attempt to block even constructive criticism of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="315" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Every season, <em>Fortnite</em> players can spend their time playing matches and grinding Quests to earn enough XP to unlock every cosmetic in the Battle Pass. This season, however, players claim it’s “almost impossible” to do it without spending real money on Tier Skips, and they’re not impressed. </p> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">With <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-the-new-fortnite-season-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5, Season 3</a> now firmly on the horizon, players only have a couple of weeks to complete their Battle Pass before the new one launches, but as Awesomedogman3 stated on Reddit, it’s proving to be an extremely difficult task to accomplish. </p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">“XP this season is just downright awful,” they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1cq9jwi/xp_this_season_is_downright_awful_and_epic_made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. “For starters, doing the three daily match quests doesn’t even give you a full level. In fact, it only gives you 60,000 XP for doing them. Weekly Quests only give you 10,000 XP each… Last season they [were] 10,000 XP [too], but there was also a 30,000 XP one thrown in.”</p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">“Epic’s idea to give players more XP [is to] force them to play the other garbage modes, and even then they are as bad, if not worse, than [Battle Royale]’s Quests. They also nerfed playtime XP for all those modes. I am almost certain it is almost impossible to get to level 151 without having to buy levels.”</p> <figure data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Fortnite characters running towards the camera holding guns." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Getting XP these days is tough. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">This sentiment was echoed throughout the community, with 2tan2tame saying that “the inclusion of all the other game modes and the XP drop has made me just stop playing,” while Jimlad116 said that after having a baby with his wife, they had previously been able to get through the season pass together but are “not even close to finishing the base Battle Pass this season” and is “honestly considering just quitting the game altogether.”</p>
 <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">I personally have felt like the Battle Pass has made the game too grindy for a long time, and haven’t purchased one in a long time. Back in the days of Chapter 1 I could easily finish a Battle Pass in a season, but with more frequent seasonal updates, and the additional XP requirements, there’s just no way I’m going to get close. I already have a full-time job, and I can’t commit to playing four hours of <em>Fortnite</em> on top of that just to unlock some cosmetics. </p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">I understand that the idea of Battle Passes is to keep players hooked and coming back to your game, but there has to be a limit to this, otherwise, people will just give up and stop playing the game. It seems like <em>Fortnite</em> is about to reach that cliff edge, and they may need to pull back before it’s too late. </p>

            <p>Brass-blasting rhythm game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a> honked its way <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-deserves-to-toot-its-own-horn">into our hearts </a>when it released in 2022. Since then, it's garnered a dedicated fanbase that have kept its spit-valve full to bursting with creations like this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-final-fantasy-7-trombone-champ-mod-is-pitch-perfect">Final Fantasy 7 mod</a>. Trombone Champ mods are special among rhythm games for consisting of two elements: the button-tapping composition of the song itself, and the background visuals. You honk-tap away while unicorns or giant close-ups of full English breakfasts cavort in the background. Although, if your breakfast is cavorting, you probably want to cook it a bit longer.</p>

<p>One community member, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Gloomhonk/videos">Gloomhonk</a>, has risen to legend status for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-is-best-experienced-via-videos-by-its-creative-modders">creative and hilarious clips</a>, like <a href="https://youtu.be/Vn06ADuXDnQ">this take</a> on Don’t Stop Believin’ where you enrage the guitarist by bogarting all the solos.

<p>The championship - which is soon entering its finals - sees players compete for a crowdsourced prize pool. It’s currently sitting at 1000 USD - enough to buy five of the cheapest trombones I could find and declare sonic armageddon on your unsuspecting neighbours. Or maybe not, maybe they’re cool. Maybe they also own five trombones. Maybe they’ll join in. Maybe you could start the world’s most trombone-heavy ska band. Actually, don’t do that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A second remake of the original Resident Evil is apparently in the works, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1cqllq0/danielrpk_a_resident_evil_1_remake_is_in/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, DanielRPK, who proved to be somewhat reliable in the past, revealed on their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/resident-evil-104124284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> that a new remake of the first entry in the survival-horror series by CAPCOM powered by the RE Engine is now in development.</p>
<p>While DanielRPK did not reveal any additional information on the new Resident Evil remake, @PRE_Atarabiya revealed on X/Twitter that the game will be released in 2026 to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary. Additionally, the user revealed some additional information on the yet-to-be-revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-delayed/">ninth entry in the series</a>, saying that Leon Kennedy will be the main character in the game's introduction and will be 48 years old, as the game will be set in the Summer of 2025.</p>

<p>While a second remake of the original Resident Evil definitely makes a lot of sense, we have to take its existence with a grain of salt until an official confirmation comes in.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Square Enix has announced in its financial earnings call that it will be releasing its games as multiplatform moving forward rather than releasing exclusively on one console.</p>



<p>The move to multiplatform is a part of Enix’ new strategy, <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which states</a>, “the Group will aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs. Especially in regards to major franchises and AAA titles, including catalog titles, it will build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles.”</p>



<p>Under the same changes to strategy, also outlined is the publisher’s shift from “quantity to quality”.</p>



<p>“The Group will pursue a shift from quantity to quality as its medium- to long-term philosophy regarding the DE segment’s portfolio. To that end, it will first work to establish the optimal portfolio, striking a balance between a “product-out” approach that reflects the imaginations of its employees to the utmost, and a “market-in” approach that leverages customers’ voices and data to inform development efforts. It will strive for a regular launch cadence, focusing its development efforts and investments on titles with substantial potential to be loved by customers for years.”</p>



<p>The change in strategy has already seen several of its games canceled, which did not align with Square Enix’s new approach.</p>



<p>As the industry continues to consolidate and games become increasingly expensive, it isn’t hard to see why Square Enix would like to broaden the number of platforms it releases its games on. With consoles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> expected to launch in Spring 2025, too, it isn’t difficult to see where Square is going with its new strategy—and it’s a strategy that is likely to be followed across the industry.</p>

            <p>Square Enix has released its financials for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, with the results largely below what it had previously forecasted.</p>
<p>As a result, the firm is set to implement a brand new strategy going forward, hoping to achieve "stable profit generation" in its digital entertainment segment by 2027.</p>
<section>
<ul>
<li><a href="#section-1">The numbers</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-2">The financial highlights</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-3">Looking ahead: The new strategy</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<h2 id="section-1">The numbers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales</strong>: ¥356 billion ($2.28 billion, up 3.8% year-on-year from ¥343 billion)</li>
<li><strong>Digital entertainment sales</strong>: ¥248 billion ($1.59 billion, up 2.6% YoY from ¥245 billion)</li>
<li><strong>Operating income</strong>: ¥32.5 billion ($208 million, down 26.6% YoY from ¥44.3 billion)</li>
<li><strong>Profit attributable to owners of parent</strong>: ¥15 billion ($96.2 million, down 69.7% YoY from ¥49.2 billion)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-2">The financial highlights</h2>
<p>Square Enix's digital entertainment sales were ever so slightly up, mainly thanks to its HD Games sub-segment, the firm said. The solid performances of Final Fantasy 16, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster, Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince, and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth saw HD Games sales increase to ¥99.2 billion ($636 million) versus ¥78.5 billion ($503 million) the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>However, the firm's MMO and Games for Smart Devices/PC Browsers sub-segments both declined year-on-year (11% and 10%, respectively), with the latter in particular seeing new releases underperforming and unable to compensate for weak performances from Square's back catalogue.</p>
<p>The operating losses across its digital entertainment segment were due to higher development cost amortisation and advertising expenses, it continued, as well as "higher content valuation losses versus the previous fiscal year."</p>
<p>Square Enix's results for the year were largely below what it had previously forecasted (for instance, it expected an operating income reaching ¥55 billion and it did ¥32 billion). Back in April, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-takes-140-million-hit-on-cancelled-games">the company had warned investors that its results for the year would be taking a hit</a> due to cancelled projects.</p>
<p>"Operating income, ordinary income, and profit attributable to owners of the parent for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 were below the company’s forecasts primarily due to weaker HD games sales than expected in the Digital Entertainment segment and to the recognition of valuation and abandonment losses associated with its content production account following a close examination of the company’s development pipeline," the company said in its financial report.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Looking ahead: The new strategy</h2>
<p>As a result of this disappointing financial year, Square Enix will be implementing a new strategy going forward, it announced.</p>
<p>The company's previous strategy included a target to rebuild its portfolio across both the HD Games and Smart Devices segments, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-wants-to-slim-down-lineup">streamline said portfolios</a>, and expand its MMO business.</p>
<p>However, it said its journey to "better profitability in HD game development" has been "incomplete", adding: "[We] launched many titles but some failed to live up to profit expectations, especially outsourced titles and some AAA titles."</p>
<p>It also noted a slowdown in SD games, gaps in its management infrastructure, and "cannibalisation of our new titles due to the launch schedule's overlap."</p>
<p>Its new strategy to tackle these challenges is called "Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens" and is a three-year plan targeting long-term growth. The company wants to enhance its productivity and release titles more regularly by "by optimising [its] development footprint," it said. That will involve revamping its organisation, retiring its "business unit-based organisational design."</p>

<p>The company said it will also "aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs." For its SD segment too, Square said it'll be looking beyond iOS and Android, and at PC launches.</p>
<p>It also intends to step up digital sales in order to diversify its earnings opportunities, and further develop its IP across multiple media and markets.</p>
<p>The company is set to "rebuild its overseas business divisions from the ground up," it added. That will involve optimising costs across its European and American offices via "structural reforms."</p>
<p>Finally, the company said it'll be looking into making "strategic investments" to expand into "additional domains."</p>
<p>For the financial year 2025, Square Enix expects to increase its operating income to ¥40 billion ($256 millon), which would represent a 22.9% boost. However, the company forecast that its sales will continue to decline, down 13% to ¥310 billion ($1.98 billion).</p>
<p>It's also intending to achieve "stable profit generation from the overall DE segment and to generate a consolidated operating margin of 15% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027."</p>

            <p>
Square Enix is "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy, including "Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs".
</p>
<p>
The company's new medium-term business plan was shared today alongside its latest financial report, and follows news of both a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-reviewing-overall-game-development-to-improve-quality">review of its development system</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-abandons-112m-of-in-development-projects-in-an-effort-to-improve-quality">abandonment of £112m of in-development projects</a>.
</p>
<p>
The multiplatform strategy is part of a move to "diversify earnings opportunities" and aims to allow more customers to "enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalogue titles".
</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>
Square Enix's biggest releases in recent years have been console-exclusive to PlayStation, including the likes of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Final Fantasy 16, and Forspoken, with PC releases either alongside or in the pipeline.
</p>
<p>
While no specific games are identified here, it suggests that some of the company's biggest could make their way to Xbox in future - or perhaps Switch 2. At the least, Square Enix's biggest game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-14-new-series-xs-version-tested-vs-ps5">Final Fantasy 14 - made its way to Xbox recently</a>.
</p>
<p>
The strategy will "maximise digital sales of new titles" as well as "pursue initiatives designed to win over PC users" which the company sees as a growth opportunity.
</p>
<p>
The shift to multiplatform also includes mobile games, which will not only release on iOS and Android but potentially PC too. Mobile gacha game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-heading-to-steam">Final Fantasy Ever Crisis is already set for a Steam release</a>.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix will also "leverage IP across media formats", suggesting the likes of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest could be seen more outside of games.
</p>
<p>
The company's new development pipeline will shift from quantity to quality, balancing developer creativity with data from customers and the wider market. AAA releases will be released regularly, while "mid-class titles" will prioritise profitability. As such, it will be "bold" in creating new franchises, to prioritise "novel forms of excitement" balanced with earnings potential.
</p>
<p>
All of this is to focus on creating "unforgettable experiences", marketing talk for good games.
</p>
<p>
So why all this change? It's due to declining profits. The last financial year saw an increase in net sales of games of one percent, but a decrease in profit from games of 38 percent. 
</p>
<p>
Games like Final Fantasy 16, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and the Pixel Remasters boosted sales, but a year-on-year decline in MMO and mobile games plus high development costs accounted for the loss in profit. The £112m write-off also impacted profits.</p>
<p>
No specific sales are given, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has reportedly underperformed</a> despite being the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-fourth-top-selling-game-in-the-us-this-year-but-reportedly-remains-far-behind-remake">fourth biggest game in the US</a> so far this year.
</p>
<p>
Other sectors did fare better: merchandise profits, for instance, had a 51 percent increase in profit. 
</p>
<p>
So what's next for Square Enix? Most imminent is the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-everything-we-know-so-far">Final Fantasy 14 expansion Dawntrail</a>, which will likely provide a boost in profits. As previously reported, it's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">most profitable game in the series</a>, while previous expansion Endwalker was so popular the game had to be taken off sale.
</p>
<p>
After that, there is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-pc-version-in-final-stages-of-optimisation-director-says">PC release of Final Fantasy 16</a>, and a presumed PC release of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth following its Remake equivalent.

            <p>There is a Star Wars mod for Helldivers 2 out there and it looks brilliant.</p>
<p>The mod in question was shared over the weekend by ToastedShoes, whose name you may recognise from that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-already-has-a-pokemon-mod">PC Pokémon mod for Palworld</a>. And, while they say it brings Clone Wars to Arrowhead's shooter, there is something about it that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-battlefront-3-dead-as-dice-focuses-fully-on-battlefield-report">makes me think of Battlefront 3, and what that could have been</a>. Hmm...</p>
<p>Anyway, I will bring myself back to the present, and this mod. As you may already have assumed, it is utterly chaotic, with players in Star Wars skins fighting enemies from the franchise such as Droideka and B1 droids. Roger Roger!</p>

</figure>
<p>This marriage of bombastic Helldivers 2 gameplay with a Star Wars makeover honestly works so well. But, while I am itching to give this Helldivers 2 Star Wars mod a go for myself, it is currently not available publicly.</p>
<p>"Right now the mods don't work consistently across all planets and difficulties so we want to iron out the kinks before dropping them," ToastedShoes wrote in a post on social media platform X. However, the YouTuber did state the Star Wars mod will be made available "very shortly", so keep your eyes peeled.</p> <div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We will also be dropping the mod pack from this video in its entirety this week over on Nexus Helldivers 2 but ruined with mods<a href="https://t.co/40fmxqQGcW">https://t.co/40fmxqQGcW</a></p><p>Along with that we are planning on releasing the tools we built from the ground up, so you can all make your very own mods</p></div>— Toasted (@ToastedShoes) <a href="https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1789686363786485784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p>"Thanks again for all your support and love! I can't wait to see the entire community enjoying the mods with friends," they closed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can check out ToastedShoes taking the Helldivers 2 Star Wars mod out for a spin in the video below.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 has been immensely popular since it burst onto PlayStation and PC earlier this year, but that doesn't mean there hasn't been controversy. Earlier this month, publisher Sony announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">Helldivers 2 players on Steam would be required to link to a PlayStation Network account</a> - something it said this was always meant to be a requirement for players on PC.</p>
<p>The news was immediately met with intense backlash, which resulted in an influx of negative<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements"> reviews from Helldivers 2 players on Steam</a>. Many <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-players-secure-refunds-as-steam-waives-playtime-limit">asked for a refund</a> as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">Helldivers 2 was pulled from sale in 177 countries</a> where PSN is not available. All of this led Sony to ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">overturning plans to enforce mandatory PSN linking for Helldivers 2 players on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">That includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</h2></div><section><p>Square Enix has announced a significant company reboot amid tumbling profits.</p><p>Reporting its financial performance for the financial year ending March 31, 2024, sales in the Digital Entertainment segment, which includes video games, rose by 2.6% but profit fell by 15.8%. This despite the sale of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/foamstars">Foamstars</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>. Specifically on HD games, the subcategory Square Enix uses to encompass all the above games, the company saw a significant operating loss of ¥8.1 billion (approximately $51.9 million).</p><p>Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth both launched as PlayStation 5 exclusives, and while Square Enix <em>has</em> announced a sales figure for Final Fantasy 16, it has yet to do so for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the second game in the company’s trilogy of Final Fantasy 7 remakes. In its financial report, all Square Enix would say is it has suffered from an “incomplete journey to better profitability in HD game development”, and that it had “launched many titles but some failed to live up to profit expectations, especially outsourced titles and some AAA titles.” It seems likely Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, at least, is included in that.</p><p>In response to the tumbling profits, Square Enix announced what it calls “Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens”, a three-year plan for rebooting for long-term growth. This involves a rethink across all parts of the business, but the highlight is a “shift to a multiplatform strategy." Square Enix said it will “aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs.” Note the wording here of “Nintendo platforms”, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-nintendo-switch-2-before-april-2025">Nintendo set to announce its Switch successor console before April 2025</a>.</p><p>As part of this multiplatform push, Square Enix said it will "build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles." The suggestion in all this is mainline Final Fantasy games will ditch PlayStation exclusivity going forward, although Square Enix has yet to announce specifics beyond Final Fantasy 16's upcoming launch on PC.</p><p>There’s also a shift from quantity to quality, Square Enix said, and a bid to deliver “ensured fun.” Square Enix has been accused of pumping out too many Final Fantasy games in too short a timeframe, so perhaps this means the release of major Final Fantasy games will be spaced out a bit more.</p><p>Overall, it’s a tough time for Square Enix, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-maker-square-enix-takes-140-million-hit-in-content-abandonment-losses-as-it-revises-game-pipeline">which had already absorbed ¥22.1 billion (approx $140.9 million) in what it called “content abandonment losses” ahead of today’s financial report</a>. Square Enix did not name the canceled or rescoped in-development titles.</p><p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-dawntrail"><u>Dawntrail</u></a>, the expansion for ongoing MMO Final Fantasy 14, launches in late June. Square Enix also has <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a>, the third game in the Final Fantasy remake trilogy, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate"><u>Dragon Quest 12</u></a> in the works.</p><p>In February, Square Enix director and president Takashi Kiryu reportedly told analysts about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-reportedly-overhauling-how-it-makes-games"><u>plans to create a new company structure</u></a> following falling sales in its digital entertainment business, despite the release of Final Fantasy 16 in June. Square Enix said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-sold-3-million-copies-during-launch-week"><u>the PS5 exclusive sold three million copies</u></a> during launch week. A PC port is in the works. In January, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-producer-naoki-yoshida-says-it-may-be-time-for-the-younger-generation-to-handle-final-fantasy-17"><u>it might be time for a younger generation to lead the franchise and helm Final Fantasy 17</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New Call of Duty 2026 and Call of Duty 2027 details might have been leaked by a known leaker.</p>
<p>Although this year's and next year's Call of Duty entries have yet to be officially announced, we might already have some early details on the 2026 and 2027 installments. According to known Call of Duty leaker Tom Henderson, next year's <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoD will be a semi futuristic Black Ops 2 seque</a>l, and as now<a href="https://twitter.com/zvis_ceral/status/1789753516757524538" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted</a> on X by known leaker VISCERAL, Call of Duty 2026 will be a new CoD: Ghosts entry. According to the leaker, this new entry is being developed by Infinity Ward and is currently codenamed "Project Devilwood". In addition, CoD 2027, with codename "Project Anvil", is said to be a new Advanced Warfare title from Sledgehammer Games.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">CALL OF DUTY 2026<br>"Project Devilwood" in development at Infinity Ward and will be a Ghosts title.</p>
<p>CALL OF DUTY 2027<br>"Project Anvil" in development at Sledgehammer and will be an Advanced Warfare title.</p>
<p>In collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/Vondyispog?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Vondyispog</a> <a href="https://t.co/7FCRN0xe02">pic.twitter.com/7FCRN0xe02</a></p>
<p>— VISCERAL (@zvis_ceral) <a href="https://twitter.com/zvis_ceral/status/1789753516757524538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We haven't been able to verify these details, and as such, the information above should be taken with a pinch of salt for now. Since 2015, the Call of Duty series has had a three-year development cycle with Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer trading off development duties. "This fall's game will be Treyarch's first on the three-year development cycle," Activision Publishing former CEO Eric Hirshberg said about Black Ops III during an earnings call back in 2015. "It will be loaded with innovation, and we're excited to share more details with our community soon."</p>
<p>Last month, the leaker posted some additional details about the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Splinter Cell Remake</a> from Ubisoft. According to the leaker, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-stealth-ray-traced-reflections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the remake will feature ray-traced audio</a>, and enemies being able to detect the player based on ray-traced reflections.</p>
<p>More details about this year's Call of Duty entry will likely be revealed in the coming months. Late last year we <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered that the game might have a Gulf War settin</a>g.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this 'leak'? Will Call of Duty 2026 indeed be a new Ghosts entry? And what about CoD 2027? Hit the comments below.</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7190611686209249280/">LinkedIn</a>, former technical director Michael Anthony suggested that the studio is "working on an undisclosed IP".</p>
<p>"All the people I see working there that have signed up are top class developers," he wrote. "I hope that you can create a top class new IP with your studio that hopefully gives you all the time you need to create a quality product and not have to deal with the red tape of previous projects."</p>
<p>It would seem Deviation Games co-founder Jason Blundell is involved with the studio. As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-reportedly-forms-studio-with-former-deviation-games-devs/">VGC</a>, former employee JC Farmer shared on <a href="https://twitter.com/JCbackfire/status/1736852589927702938">social media</a> last December that they landed a job as a junior game designer at PlayStation, adding that they work for Blundell.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Sony for further clarification.</p>
<p>Deviation Games was founded in 2020 by Blundell and Dave Anthony, known for their work on the Call of Duty franchise.</p>
<p>The studio was working on a new IP for PlayStation, as announced at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-elden-ring-highlight-summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest in 2021</a>. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jason-blundell-exits-from-deviation-games">Blundell left the studio in September 2022</a>, with Anthony continuing to lead the studio as CEO and game director.</p>
<p>Deviation Games <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/deviation-studios-reportedly-lays-off-up-to-90-staff">went through a round of layoffs last May</a> in which up to 90 workers lost their jobs. The studio <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-backed-deviation-games-closes">announced its closure in March this year</a>.</p>

            <p>Some fresh astral god trivia from my accidental molar expedition a few weeks back: each of the Maw's teeth is different. Some form a fractal baleen network of crosshatched layers disappearing backward into the vanishing point; others are shaped like lockpicks, raccoon heads and semi-detached houses. This week's new game releases are no less motley and misshapen, though thankfully not quite as heavily varnished with plaque: there's something in the shop for everyone, I think. </p><!--more-->
<p>Today, the 13th May, we open with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/homeworld-3">Homeworld 3</a>, the long-awaited space strategy-me-do <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-review">which Nic has already reviewed and is broadly fond of</a>. It's gracefully accompanied by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2131010/The_Land_Beneath_Us/">The Land Beneath Us</a>, a turn-based rogue-lite dungeon crawler in which you tunnel into an underworld inspired by Welsh mythology. 14th May brings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671720/Athenian_Rhapsody/">Athenian Rhapsody</a>, which brazenly describes itself as "a souls-like platonic dating simulator with cooking-mama and WarioWare style battle mechanics". On the 15th, there's android-bisecting boomer shooting from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2131010/The_Land_Beneath_Us/">Mullet Madjack</a>, period RTSing from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128860/Men_of_War_II/">Men Of War 2</a>, and  Paper Mario-ish choose-your-own adventuring from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866320/Baladins/">Baladins</a>.</p>
<p>And then, on the 16th, a perfect singularity of little and large, eccentric and mainstream titles in the shape of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674590/Histera/">Histera</a>, a free-to-play PvP shooter in which the arena glitches between time periods, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293910/Read_Only_Memories_NEURODIVER/">Read Only Memories: Neurodiver</a>, sequel to the 2015 hit 2064: Read Only Memories, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/">Ghost Of Tsushima: Director's Cut</a>, the PC port of the open world samurai blockbuster, and Simogo's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2008920/Lorelei_and_the_Laser_Eyes/">Lorelei And The Laser Eyes</a>, which sounds a bit like an Agatha Christie story spliced with the Crystal Maze. For an intellectual end to the week on 17th May, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356150/Arcane_Assembly/">Arcane Assembly</a>, a metroidvania in which you program your own spells using a visual scripting language.</p>
<p>Not a bad showing, I reckon! I'll be off on an Exciting Press Trip from Thursday morning - amongst other things, I'm attending the latest Digital Dragons conference in Poland. As ever, you can follow our increasingly baffled and self-defeating attempts at journalism in the liveblog below, and we welcome suggestions in the comments about games or events we've missed.</p>

    Square Enix have published some <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf">financial results</a>, which includes a new "medium-term business plan" in which they will "pursue a shift from quantity to quality". Basically, the last couple of years led to some losses for the company, and they're changing tack. Presumably that means making fewer games. It's all in keeping with what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-announces-112m-in-content-abandonment-losses-as-it-seeks-to-be-more-selective">the company said recently about being "more selective"</a>.

"I wanted Helldivers 2 to be so perfect that I absolutely destroyed myself. I abandoned my friendships, I pulled all-nighters. The company wasn't asking me to do that, it was just I cared so much about making it good that it totally consumed me." I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that from everything we know of crunch, it's just as often an unspoken mandate as an explicit ask, but it does sound like a case of genuine passion here.

It included no-nos on:</p>
<p><em>a. Making disparaging or satirical comments about any game-related material, such as game features, characters, or music.</em></p>
<p><em>b. Engaging in malicious comparisons with competitors or belittling the gameplay or differences of "Marvel Rivals" or providing subjective negative reviews of the game.</em></p>
<p>While this is all ridiculous, the "satrical comments" part seems especially irksome. Trying to control the tone of coverage is one thing, but telling people they can't be anything but reverent towards your deriative hero shooter is something else. Anyway, at least they've apologised. For being caught. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Square Enix <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported financial results</a> for the fiscal year that ended on March 31. The results weren't great, as the Japanese publisher narrowly missed the revenue target and majorly missed the operating income target, with the latter also down 26.6% compared to last year.</p>
<p>However, Square Enix also announced today a brand new medium-term business plan that will last through March 31, 2027. The plan's title is Square Enix Reboots and Awakens – 3-years<br>
of Foundation-Laying for Long-term Growth. The key changes compared to the studio's previous plan are an aggressive multiplatform strategy and a focus on quality over quantity.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For HD titles, the Group will aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs. Especially in regards to major franchises and AAA titles, including catalog titles, it will build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles.</em><br>
<em>In addition, it will also devise a platform strategy for SD titles that includes not only iOS and Android, but also the possibility of PC launches. Furthermore, the Group will strive to maximize the acquisition of new users when launching a title and that of recurring users after starting management of game operation.</em></li>
<li><em>The Group will pursue a shift from quantity to quality as its medium- to long-term philosophy regarding the DE segment’s portfolio. To that end, it will first work to establish the optimal portfolio, striking a balance between a “product-out” approach that reflects the imaginations of its employees to the utmost, and a “market-in” approach that leverages customers’ voices and data to inform development efforts.</em><br>
<em>It will strive for a regular launch cadence, focusing its development efforts and investments on titles with substantial potential to be loved by customers for years.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As for the multiplatform strategy, it is likely that the commercially underwhelming launches of <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-fell-short-high-end-sales-goal-slow-ps5-adoption-blamed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy XVI</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ff7-rebirth-sales-ffxvi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> have finally pushed Square Enix to forego PlayStation exclusive debuts of its premiere franchise. Both games, despite strong critical reception (especially of FFVII Rebirth), failed to sell as much as the publisher wanted, having only been released for PS5. In the future, it's likely Square Enix will strive to launch games day and date on all available platforms.</p>

<p>For the period between FY 2025 and 2027, Square Enix has set the following financial targets:</p>
<ul>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Square Enix [5,253 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the establishment of a new medium-term business plan covering the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027, which it calls “Square Enix Reboots and Awakens: 3 Years of Foundation-Laying for Long-Term Growth.” <span id="more-882266"></span></p><p>The goal of this business plan is to overcome the challenges faced in its previous medium-term business plan, including low profitability of its high-definition games sub-segment, a slowdown in the games for smart devices and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,057 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> browsers sub-segment, insufficient franchise-by-franchise portfolio <a title="Genres > Management [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and some gaps in Square Enix’s management infrastructure.</p><p>The four pillars of its new business plan are as follows:</p><table><thead><tr><!-- AD: content -->
        <th>Pillar</th><th>Initiative</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>(1) <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a> productivity by optimizing the development footprint in the Digital Entertainment (DE) segment.</td><td>Focus on development of titles delivering “Fun” that only the Group can create and build the development structure.</td></tr><tr><td>(2) Diversify earnings opportunities by strengthening customer contact points.</td><td>Shift to a multiplatform strategy.

To that end, it will first work to establish the optimal portfolio, striking a balance between a “product-out” approach that reflects the imaginations of its employees to the utmost, and a “market-in” approach that leverages customers’ voices and data to inform development efforts. It will strive for a regular launch cadence, focusing its development efforts and investments on titles with substantial potential to be loved by customers for years.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Focus on development of titles delivering “Fun” that only the Group can create</strong><ul><li>With the goal of developing titles that deliver unforgettable experiences to customers and ensure excitement, the Group intends to focus on the following points. First, mindful of the need to launch HD titles that help attract additional fans to the Group, the Group will regularly release AAA titles in its major franchises to maintain and build upon its fan base. In addition, the Group will strive to increase its success rate in SD games by launching a carefully curated selection of titles. It will additionally explore ways to leverage its rich library of IP.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Establish an internal development footprint that brings “Fun” that only the Group can create</strong><ul><li>The Group will retire its business unit-based organizational design and strive to establish an operationally integrated organization with the goal of revamping its internal title development footprint and bringing more capabilities in-house. In addition, while keeping balance between the creativity of its individual employees and the management centered on the organization, the Group will transition to a project management structure. To that end, the Group will redefine the mission for producers and other related employees and organize its internal supporting structure. Also, the Group will improve its development investment efficiency, by reviewing the overall management process of title development.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>(2) Diversify earnings opportunities by strengthening customer contact points</strong></p><ul><li><ul><li><strong>Shift to a multiplatform strategy</strong><ul><li>For HD titles, the Group will aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> platforms, <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,019 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox [24,006 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>, and PCs. Especially, in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles, it will build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles. In addition, it will also devise a platform strategy for SD titles that includes not only iOS and Android, but also the possibility of PC launches. Furthermore, the Group will strive to maximize the acquisition of new users when launching a title and that of recurring users after starting management of game operation.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Building continuous customer contact points of our titles by stepping up digital sales</strong><ul><li>The Group will strengthen user flow of digital sales of new titles at the time of launch regarding the initiatives of promotion. In addition, it will generate the opportunity of generating revenue in our rich catalog titles’ line-up, which leads to strengthen its earnings base by expanding sales of catalog titles. Moreover, the Group will engage in initiatives which focus on the acquisition of PC users.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Create the interaction with customers by increasing sophistication of publishing function</strong><ul><li>The Group will pursue integrated sales &amp; marketing operations in Japan and make efficiency of publishing by consolidating the marketing functions that were previously spread across creative business units, expanding shared knowledge, and eliminating duplicate functions. Also, it creates a new reporting line in order to enhance collaboration between sales and marketing functions. It will also address the increasing sophistication of marketing by leveraging first-party data, including through the utilization of CRM solutions and data analytics, when developing an ad campaign for HD and SD titles.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Generating the opportunity of new revenue by offering IP across a range of entertainment experiences</strong><ul><li>The Group will pursue a cross-media strategy capable of approaching new markets. Specifically, it will expand area of license business by establishing a new department focusing on IP business development at global markets. In addition, it will build an organization which makes more active use of its IP by offering it across all media formats. The Group also hopes to generate synergies by integrating the organizations affiliated with its Merchandising segment.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>(3) Roll out initiatives that create greater foundational stability</strong></p><ul><li><ul><li><strong>Rebuild overseas business divisions from the ground up</strong><ul><li>The Group has begun optimizing costs at its European and American offices via structural reforms. It will also promote intra-Group collaboration in Japan and abroad and strengthen the functions of its London development site. For example, the Group intends to work to strengthen the close collaboration between its divisions in Japan (creative studios and publishing) and to enable greater mobility of talent between them and the Group’s publishing functions overseas.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Revamp policies on human resource allocation &amp; investment to balance both “creativity and productivity” in Japan</strong><ul><li>The Group will build its flat organization by increasing opportunities of promotion by selection in order to pursue a new talent at our company and streamlining the process of decision-making. Specifically, it will roll out a new human resources system in line with integrated management of development functions, building a new system for hiring, promotion, and appointment of management. Moreover, the Group will rebuild training system for new graduates and introduce internal education programs to enhance capabilities of junior and mid-level employees.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Enhance business infrastructure by implementing PDCA cycle in a timely and appropriate manner</strong><ul><li>The Group will pursue refining its management accounting system that enables greater visibility into business activities. In addition, the Group will not only make infrastructure enhancements that maximize the productivity of its employees under hybrid-working system, but also build its attractive office environment that helps unleash creativity for its development teams.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>(4) Allocate capital giving consideration to the balance between growth investments and shareholder returns</strong></p><p>The Group has formulated a capital allocation policy that gives consideration to the balance between growth investment and shareholder return, earmarking a maximum of ¥100 billion for total strategic investments (growth investments or shareholder returns) over a three-year period.</p><p>As regards growth investments, the Group will carefully select investment opportunities that contribute to the enhancement of corporate value and will utilize insights from its own businesses. It will explore the possibility of undertaking inorganic investments designed to expand its business domains and create greater stability.</p><p>Meanwhile, to reward its shareholders, the Group will issue regular dividends based on a basic policy of achieving a dividend payout ratio of 30%. In addition, in a change from its previous approach to capital allocation, the Group has set aside ¥20 billion for the funding of potential repurchases of its own shares to be executed flexibly between May 14, 2024 and May 13, 2025 based on consideration of factors including strategic investment opportunities, the Group’s financial position, and its share price. The firm has also revised the breakdown of its per-share dividends (interim dividend and year-end dividend).</p><p>Through these initiatives, the Group will strive to further enhance its corporate value.</p></blockquote><p>Further information is available via <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592661.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Square Enix’s medium-term business plan presentation</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
