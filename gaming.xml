		<p>Rockstar Games has announced that the original Red Dead Redemption is finally coming to PC this month on 29th October. The game will be available via Steam, Epic and the Rockstar Store, bundling the main game together with the Undead Nightmare for some perfectly timed zombie-horror action on Halloween.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare Coming to PC October 29" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mnvc6uC6xZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Red Dead Redemption’s port has been handled by Double Eleven – Rockstar themselves are <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">kind of busy</a> – with the studio working in some PC-specific enhancements to the game, including support for native 4K at up to 144Hz, Ultrawide (21:9) and Super Ultrawide (32:9) screen support, HDR10, and keyboard and mouse support.</p>
<p>Even though the game is 14 years old, you might like to have some graphics settings on PC, and so there’s things like adjustable draw distances, shadow quality settings and more. You’ve also got Nvidia DLSS 3.7 (with frame generation), and AMD FSR 3.0 for upscaling.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption’s PC port has been rumoured for as long as it’s been overdue, and even leaked on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/15/red-dead-redemption-pc-version-leaks-again/">a couple</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/13/red-dead-redemption-for-pc-leaked-by-the-playstation-store/">occasions</a>. Originally launching for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2010, it was a part of the last wave of Rockstar games that came out before GTA V saw all the global studios combine their efforts. Rockstar San Diego’s work was a big hit, though, and led to the 2018 prequel Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>

<p>Being stuck on Xbox 360 and PS3, the game remained playable on modern platforms for a good long while only thanks to the Xbox One backward compatibility program. However, it’s now enjoying a renaissance with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/07/red-dead-redemption-announced-for-switch-and-ps4/">a Nintendo Switch and PS4 port</a> coming along last year, the latter version <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/red-dead-redemption-patched-to-run-at-60fps-on-ps5/">eventually patched to enable 60FPS gameplay on PS5</a>.</p>
<p>In our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/05/19/review-red-dead-redemption/">Red Dead Redemption review</a> we scored the game a masterful 10/10, saying:</p>
<p>“Rockstar San Diego’s latest title is an unmissable game for any fan of the genre or great action adventures in general. We don’t often get masterpieces around here, but this is certainly one of those moments in time when gamers will look back more fondly on a dusty old six shooter than anything that involves jacking cars. The Wild West, then, is the new New York, and Rockstar have got their work cut out for them if they want Grand Theft Auto V to come anywhere near close to the majesty of Red Dead Redemption. A job we don’t envy.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-reaches-20-million-pre-registrations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A fully-fledged game is being made of the Nikki series, with this being the fifth installment in the franchise. Infinity Nikki is an upcoming RPG with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-announced-zelda-botw-designer-producing/">expansive open world</a> where players get to explore the platform and unlock new clothing to dress up Nikki and her cat, Momo. While the game doesn't have an official release yet, those excited about the dress-up game are able to pre-register for the game, which will give them access to pre-registration rewards and news once the game is officially released. Back in August 2024, Infinity Nikki had officially reached 12 million pre-registrations. Currently, <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game is sitting at 21,268,111 global pre-registrations</a> for the upcoming gacha game. Hitting 20 million pre-registrations globally is just a little way off of the next milestone for Infinity Nikki, with them aiming to get to 25 million pre-registrations at the least. By reaching this number, those who have pre-registered will get the fated rewards that are mentioned on the Infinity Nikki website.</p>
<p>The gacha game genre is already heavily saturated, with games like Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, and Zenless Zone Zero taking the top spots. Love Nikki-Dress UP Queen is one of the longest standing mobile gacha games in the Nikki series, and it's possible that Infinity Nikki will compete with games such as Genshin Impact when it comes out.</p>
<p>At the moment, Infinity Nikki doesn't have an official release date, but there are plenty of playtests taking place at the moment, with some of those who had pre-registered being able to participate. It has been confirmed by the developers that those who participate in the playtest will not be able to save their data, as it will be wiped after the playtest is concluded.</p>
<p>Infinity Nikki is set to release on iOS, Android, PlayStation 5 and PC via the Epic Games Store. It's unsaid at the moment whether this game will release on Xbox Series X|S in the future, or whether those who want to play it will have to resort to playing it on their phone instead.</p>
<p>Papergames is developing Infinity Nikki, which is the same company that is responsible for making all of the other Nikki games, such as Love Nikki and Shining Nikki. Players who join the 20 million pre-registrations globally will be able to get rewards such as Bling, Threads of Purity, Resonite Crystals and a 4-star outfit for when they sign up to the game, giving them some extra resources for when this Unreal Engine 5 game releases.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not the full-fledged remake powered by the Red Dead Redemption 2 engine that many fans had hoped for. While PC gamers have been waiting to play this installment for a very long time, there were ways to do that via emulators for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-red-dead-redemption-playable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 4</a>. Whether the unique PC features will be enough to entice many users remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Still, there's a chance modders may modernize the game's visuals in a number of ways, from texture packs to character model tweaks to the various ray traced ReShade mods. Rockstar Games has not shared pricing details yet for the PC version of Red Dead Redemption; as a reference point, the game is priced at $49.99 on consoles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Until Dawn Remake Apparently Has a Lower PS5 Player Count Than Concord]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-concord</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-until-dawn-remake-apparently-has-a-lower-ps5-player-count-than-concord.1003668/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-concord<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, the live-service disaster that limped out of the gate to a tiny player count and then was shut down just two weeks later? Well, the new&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake apparently has a lower player count than Firewalk's game on PS5.</p>
<p>Said <i>Until Dawn&nbsp;</i>remake <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date">launched just a few days ago</a>, and per a report by <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/until-dawn-ps5-player-count" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation trophy site TrueTrophies</a> (which, in turn, cites data from GameInsights), its player count was 28.6% lower than that of&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>on Sony's console.</p>
<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>performed so badly at launch that it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">shut down in early September</a>, with all players who bought it being offered full refunds. This, incidentally, caused some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-trophy-hunters-rivalry">pretty amusing trophy-hunting behavior</a> in the game's dying days.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-characters.jpg?itok=bm0BD_G0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-characters.jpg?itok=xGAOx-j9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>has apparently underperformed on PS5.</figcaption></figure><p>A couple of things are worth noting here. First, we don't know exactly how Sony was hoping the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake would perform (although we can guess that the company probably had higher hopes for its game than this).</p>
<p>Secondly,&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>does have a much higher <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2172010/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all-time Steam player count</a> than&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>achieved, with a peak of 2,607 on launch day as compared to&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">measly 697</a>.</p>
<p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>is also a single-player game as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s live-service slant, so its lower player count won't hurt it anywhere near as much as&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s did, and there's a chance that sales will slowly grow as well.</p>
<p>However, critical reception for the game has been <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17416/until-dawn-2024-" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decidedly mixed</a>, with many questioning the need for its existence at all given that the original is only nine years old, as well as criticizing performance and visual issues.</p>

<p>So, why haven't more people picked up&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>on PS5? TrueTrophies reckons it's because of a lack of marketing and promotion, as well as the chance that customers are baulking at the high asking price for what they may see as nothing more than a minor visual upgrade.</p>
<p>Frankly, the decision to remake&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>at all is a baffling one to me. The original is still widely available on PS4, after all (although that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb">isn't stopping</a> Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-part-2-remastered-leaked-and-releasing-for-ps5-in-january">elsewhere</a>), and it's not like the 2015 game looks ugly or plays horribly compared to the original.</p>
<p>In any case, you can check out the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/until-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

It was a deranged and conspiratorial collection of gibberish about demons and witches, a compendium of superstitions that had built up over the last century in Europe, and a book that suggested the only solution for all of these issues was torture and murder.<br></p><p>A few years earlier, <em>Malleus Maleficarum </em>might have been copied out a few times and shared among the local clergy, and—along with Kramer’s prolific preaching—presumably inflicted a lot of harm on those in Innsbruck and the surrounding areas. But instead the book appeared at the convergence of multiple factors, given the country in which it was written, and the religious unrest that was occurring all across Europe, and the contemporaneous establishment of a means of mass-producing books. <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em>, thanks to this serendipitous confluence, went on to become a phenomenon,  its renown spreading through the 16th century. And despite the initial cries of heresy from both within and without the Inquisition, the book ignited a widespread moral panic in both the church and the public, focusing broad fears about the dangers of witchcraft, and introducing the need to torture and kill all who were suspected.</p><div><h4>Buried Treasure</h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

Only six people remain in the village, and you must speak to them all to hear their accusations and defences, and after five days, identify who should be hanged for witchcraft.</p><p>This is an astonishing game, presented in a combination of scratchy, white-on-black drawings and hauntingly brilliant stop-motion animations, and written in old Scots English. There are four days of play, in which you speak to each of the locals to hear their beliefs and protestations and, should you want to hear more information, make use of the nonchalantly included option to crudely torture them. When you’ve unearthed four new pieces of information, night falls, and you have a prophetic stop-motion nightmare to guide you in your decisions. Normal stuff.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the game begins with a message explaining that it’s intended to be played in old Scots English, and while there’s an in-game glossary if needed, it also offers a version in modern English. If English is your first language, you don’t need the latter, believe me—it’s all easily understood, or inferred, and adds a great deal to the whole atmosphere of the game. </p><figure id="" data-id="e508f31c97508e2174a82cd7c9d1f704" data-recommend-id="image://e508f31c97508e2174a82cd7c9d1f704" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at the center of a spiral of stones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman sits at the center of a spiral of stones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Katanalevy / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e508f31c97508e2174a82cd7c9d1f704" data-recommend-id="image://e508f31c97508e2174a82cd7c9d1f704" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at the center of a spiral of stones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Among the villagers, there’s Maiden Lilias, who spends her time in the Ring O Stanes, a stone circle that the local priest believes is the site at which she kills babies. She, however, maintains that she’s an herbalist, like her mother before her, at the stones to meet her lover who is missing. Then there’s Blacksmith Oswain, in the Smiths Abode, whose jaw is held on by a wire cage after what he claims was a curse by the Shepherd Violet. She instead accuses Oswain of releasing a wolf among her flock, killing her sheep and her livelihood. Accusations fly.<br></p><p>I wondered if it might be possible to finish the game without using the “torture” option, given that didn’t seem a comfortable pick when the other choice was “Talk.” I’m not one prone to choosing to torture, as it happens. However, it is not, and that’s rather brilliant it turns out, given the unconscionably matter-of-fact tone the witch hunter, and in turn the game, takes throughout. Tortures play out as grotesque minigames, where you pull at a person’s tongue until it tears, or time mouse clicks to squeeze a person’s fingers until they’re crushed. They’re disgusting little things, like twisted versions of a golf game’s timed swings, that may cause a character to reveal information they were holding back, or even to confess.</p><p>There’s no joy in this. But there’s no expressed revulsion, either. It’s coldly delivered by the witchfinder, albeit with accompanying screams from his victims. It matches the aesthetic decision to have the stop-motion characters all appear with blank space where their faces should be—this is a game that entirely trusts <em>you </em>to have appropriate reactions to unjust horror, rather than needing to demonstrate it to you.</p><figure id="" data-id="289447ff30d5b97963d53e813c7b7fc4" data-recommend-id="image://289447ff30d5b97963d53e813c7b7fc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The witchfinder talks to another resident, in front of his cart." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The witchfinder talks to another resident, in front of his cart." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Katanalevy / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="289447ff30d5b97963d53e813c7b7fc4" data-recommend-id="image://289447ff30d5b97963d53e813c7b7fc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The witchfinder talks to another resident, in front of his cart." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Then, come the fifth day, you make your accusation and that person—again in the incredible, black-and-white stop-motion film—is hanged.

And there’s the small matter of those unnerving, sometimes horrifying stop-motion nightmares.

<p>Red Dead Redemption is officially coming to PC. Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o3314a19koo147/red-dead-redemption-and-undead-nightmare-coming-to-pc-october-29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced that the game</a> will make its way to PC on October 29.</p>



<p>The launch 14 years after its initial release for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare Coming to PC October 29" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mnvc6uC6xZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“For the first time in its storied legacy, John Marston’s beloved journey can be experienced on PC in stunning, new detail, with both&nbsp;<strong>Red </strong>Dead Redemption&nbsp;and its iconic zombie-horror companion story,&nbsp;Undead Nightmare, arriving to PC on October 29,” Rockstar said.</p>



<p>The release on PC comes with PC-specific enhancements for players. Those updates include native 4K resolution at 144Hz, Ultrawide and Super Ultrawide support, HDR10, and full mouse and keyboard functionality. There will also be support for AMD FSR 3.0 and Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>The game will be available on Steam, Epic Games Story, and the Rockstar Store. The game is also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-release-isn-t-unexpected">The Release Isn’t Unexpected</h2>



<p>The announcement of Red Dead Redemption on PC comes as no surprise. There had been rumors, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-release-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teases</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-could-coming-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other signs</a> signaling that the release could happen. The most telling one was when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-metadata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metadata for the game</a> was found in a recent launcher update. Now, three weeks later, the reveal is official.</p>



<p>As far as the future of the series is concerned, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rdr3-in-development-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors have claimed</a> that Red Dead Redemption 3 is in the works at Rockstar. It was also said by the actor who plays Arthur Morgan, Roger Clark, that he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-3-is-likely-says-lead-role-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believes a third game</a> is the plan. Right now, however, the focus of Rockstar Games is the development of Grand Theft Auto 5, which is scheduled to release in 2025.</p>

In June, Paradox scrapped </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Life by You</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-shuts-tectonic-studio-and-cancels-life-by-you">shuttered developer Paradox Tectonic</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, resulting in a write down of roughly $20 million.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prior to that, it said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Lamplighters League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-writes-off-i-the-lamplighters-league-i-as-commercial-failure">failed to meet sales expectations</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and parted ways with developer Harebrained Schemes shortly after launch. Highly anticipated sequel </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also floundered at launch due to a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-sets-new-revenue-record-says-it-needs-to-address-quality-issues">number of performance issues</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that left players reeling. Paradox's attempts to rehabilitate the title alongside developer Colossal Order also </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/the-rushed-attempt-to-rehabilitate-cities-skylines-ii-is-becoming-a-cautionary-tale">proved challenging</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer about how Paradox intends to course correct and why its production efforts have stalled, deputy CEO Mattias Lilja and chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeuz say the company perhaps took too many risks after becoming a victim of its own success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We had a period a couple of years ago where we invested a lot of money—and quite a lot of it into [projects] we were not very used to doing," says Lilja when asked where it all started going wrong. "We had this idea that we could go fairly big early on and still be successful. I think we've been proven wrong on several of those counts."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lilja feels Paradox was bitten by the "curse of success," which resulted in the studio taking risks on projects well outside of its comfort zone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think in some sense we grew fast because we were successful and we wanted to try things. We wanted to experiment and we had cash on hand. We were probably a bit undisciplined in some of our decisions early on, especially in trusting that a larger team would mean less risk [...] rather than realizing that it's the opposite. Smaller teams are better."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He claims there wasn't a sense of "pressure" surrounding those moves because Paradox hadn't borrowed money to finance its projects. "We ran with good profits," adds Lilja, before acknowledging that enabled the company to take some "unnecessary risks."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Paradox says ">Paradox says <span>Life by You</span> was scrapped because it wouldn't have dethroned <span>The Sims 4</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When those risks didn't pay off, Paradox began making cuts. As we mentioned earlier, ambitious life simulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Life by You</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and developer Paradox Tectonic were&nbsp;placed on the chopping block in June, but Lilja reiterates the decision to torch both project and studio wasn't made lightly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Expanding on why the project was kicked to the curb, Paradox chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeuz explains "key issues" started to rear their head early on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company wasn't impressed with how the project looked, and felt graphical improvements were an absolute must. Fåhraeuz recalls thinking "we can't release with characters looking like this" when seeing an early iteration of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Life by You</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but that wasn't the only area of concern.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There were a lot of other issues identified," he says, noting how gameplay also lacked flavor, "but we tended to look at each issue and how much progress had been made in that [specific] area, so I think we got blind to the big picture in terms of what the gameplay was like really and how it would stand up to [competitors] like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims 4"</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fåhraeuz says Paradox asked itself whether </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims 4 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">players would be "satisfied" with any of the features in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Life by You</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The brutal answer was 'no.'</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It didn't shine in any particular area. It wasn't really better than</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> The Sims 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in any way. You can talk about customization options and so on, which are great, but they're not really gameplay. Even though it was planned to be an early access game—I think with early access you need to release something that is actually very, very fun and quite polished," he adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It can be thin in terms of content and late game options, but it needs to be really fun to begin with and we were far from that point unfortunately." Lilja agrees there were "many issues" with the project, and notes Paradox conducted extensive peer reviews with subject matter experts before eventually pulling the plug.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for those titles Paradox did bring to market, Lilja explains </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Lamplighters League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was met with positive reviews but struggled to "meet a player fantasy" in order to keep them engaged. He adds that developer Harebrained Schemes wanted to continue making similar titles, while Paradox had no intention of doubling down. As a result, he says it was "logical" for the two to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/harebrained-schemes-splits-off-from-paradox-will-be-independent-again-in-2024">part ways</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Weighing in on the contentious launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Lilja concedes the project "had issues that should not have been in the game at release." The current plan is to avoid commercializing the title while Colossal Order stabilizes the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He feels the game is in a "pretty good place" at the moment, but says the dev team are treading carefully when it comes to rolling out updates. Why, though, did Paradox and Colossal Order release such a high-profile project before it was ready? Lilja says both companies had agreed it was time to launch—but only if they emphasized players would need to meet high system requirements. That was a mistake.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What we missed—which is absolutely on our end as publishers—is there were certain combinations of higher-level performance hardware that did not work [with the game]. That's really bad," says Lilja.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think Henrik can probably talk about the value of player feedback and going to market as early as you can, because a game is a painting in a sense. When is the painting done? Well, when you stop painting it—and you get feedback on it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The game needs to be good enough. The key features need to be good enough. Then we can work on the game for a long time. We misunderstood that by quite a wide margin on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Fortunately, now we're trying to work with the fans to fix it. I would also argue that since [the project] is closer to our core, as a failure, it wasn't catastrophic. I'm not saying it didn't have problems. Im saying we're in a position where we can fix it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fåhraeuz states Paradox is in the habit of making games for the "long haul," which is perhaps why some of the studio's recent fumbles have surprised onlookers. He states that developing video games with longevity in mind requires deep collaboration with players, and says Paradox will be looking to start those conversations much earlier as it moves forward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The trick is to bring players in earlier, perhaps even before release," he says. "We do that a lot with our DLCs and major patches, because you can have an open beta branch on Steam. We used to be quite good at it actually, because we used to run huge closed beta testa and had dedicated fans coming in much earlier. Somehow we haven't done this correctly recently, and we need to get back to bring really good at that."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Smaller titles and extensive prototyping will be key to Paradox rebuild">Smaller titles and extensive prototyping will be key to Paradox rebuild</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fåhraeuz says those costly slip-ups are the result of Paradox losing its "knowledge share." He also believes the company needs to get much better at prototyping projects. "Pre-production needs to be longer and better executed, honestly, because it's much better to fail early than late," adds Fåhraeuz. "In terms of the teams, they'll probably survive such a scenario because they can move on to another idea instead."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lilja feels the company's predicament is also the result of "overconfidence," and wonders if Paradox has forgotten "what is really hard [about making games]" after years of success. Both agree a reset is needed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Paradox now intends to focus on smaller projects that fit nearly into its portfolio. "[We'll be] starting smaller, investing not as much," says Lilja. "If there are a lot of people on [a project] it's hard to move them. A large team is probably not the most efficient if you have issues with the core of a game. It's hard to move them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"So, starting small so you don't have so much of an impact when you realize that you're heading in the wrong direction. You also have time to review [those projects], so that's what we're trying to do now."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By pursuing projects that are more familiar, Lilja believes Paradox will be able to more effectively predict how they'll shape up. He notes there will still be room for Paradox to take some risks through its Paradox Arc publishing label, but reiterates those more left field pursuits will still prioritize smaller teams and low budgets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's a much better way of doing it, rather than trying to build a big team and then realizing quite late that we're actually lost. Then we have few options left—which is horrible for teams and studios," says Lilja.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's what I mean when I say go back to the core. Stay more where we are competent. Start small. Build from there. That's sort of the lesson here. It sounds obvious when you say it, but we weren't in that headspace a couple of years ago."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Lilja, it's about approaching production with a sense of calm and patience. He notes that Paradox will now very likely only pursue larger projects if they're "fairly close" to the studio's core competencies. It will also lean more heavily on peer reviews and user research in a bid to tip the scales of success in its favor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says Paradox is still intent on becoming the "world's best publisher and developer of strategic simulations." Only time will tell if the company can turn that vision into reality.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p>The game will be available on the Rockstar Store, Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Rumours of a Red Dead Redemption PC release have long been swirling: this year alone a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-1-finally-heading-to-pc-new-datamine-suggests">datamine in May</a> suggested the release was on the way, while in August a PlayStation Store page for the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-pc-version-detailed-via-playstation-store-page">detailed the PC version</a>.</p>

<p>"For the first time in its storied legacy, John Marston's beloved journey can be experienced on PC in stunning, new detail, with both Red Dead Redemption and its iconic zombie-horror companion story, Undead Nightmare, arriving to PC on 29th October," reads the description for the announcement on YouTube, above.</p><p>"In collaboration with Double Eleven, this new version adds PC-specific enhancements including native 4K resolution at up to 144hz on compatible hardware, monitor support for both Ultrawide (21:9) and Super Ultrawide (32:9), HDR10 support, and full keyboard and mouse functionality.</p>
<p>"There’s also support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0 upscaling technologies, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, adjustable draw distances, shadow quality settings, and more."</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption was first released back in 2010 across PS3 and Xbox 360, but was re-released on PS4 and Switch in 2023. It's this version, from Double Eleven, making its way to PC.</p>
<p>Double Eleven has also worked on the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft-dungeons">Minecraft Dungeons</a>, Grounded, and the Prison Architect series (until it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">parted ways with publisher Paradox</a>).</p>

			<p>The latest NVIDIA DLSS 3 additions roundup reveals two new games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943650/FragPunk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fragpunk</a> and Simulakros, that will support DLSS Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>
<p>The first is a 5v5 free-to-play hero-based competitive first-person shooter game developed by Bad Guitar Studio. According to the developers, no two rounds of FragPunk are ever the same. Players may discover more than 70 Shard Cards with an active selection that changes each round, creating new and unique combinations that offer virtually endless possibilities. Card examples include increases in jump height, reversing the roles of attacker and defender, engulfing your bullets in flame or turning them into chain lightning, and even resurrecting the player's character and their team.</p>
<p>FragPunk is described as a highly fast-paced experience with low TTK and quick rounds of two and a half minutes. Players can choose from ten heroes with different abilities, customize their weapon combo, and select their cards before entering the battle. Fifteen weapons are&nbsp;available, some of which have special abilities such as shooting faster over time, bursts, and more.</p>
<p>FragPunk's Closed Beta goes live on October 10, and NVIDIA DLSS 3 will already be implemented to offer an average performance boost of 2.8X at 4K resolution with all settings pushed to the max and ray tracing enabled. The RTX 4090 can push well over 200 frames per second on average, while the RTX 4080 SUPER is nearly at 160 frames per second, the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER runs the game at 140FPS, and the RTX 4070 SUPER is almost at 120.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The second game is a single-player third-person shooter with roguelike elements set in a futuristic world. Developed by Sirio Games and published by Dear Villagers, Simulakros will see players try to disrupt the nefarious plans of an evil megacorporation with the help of a mysterious hacker. The game launches on October 10, although there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2621010/Simulakros_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo</a> in case you want to check it out immediately. NVIDIA DLSS 3 is also included in Starship Troopers: Extermination, Offworld's 16-player coop first-person shooter that will <a href="https://wccftech.com/starship-troopers-extermination-1-0-launches-on-october-11-adding-single-player-mode-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exit early access</a> on October 11.</p>
<p>Today marks the official release date of the highly anticipated Silent Hill 2 remake. The game offers NVIDIA DLSS 2 (Super Resolution), although users have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-fsr-3-frame-generation-nvidia-dlss-ray-reconstruction-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> a workaround to activate AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation and NVIDIA Ray Reconstruction (NVIDIA DLSS 3.5).</p>

			<p>GreedFall 2: The Dying World has officially entered Early Access, and with it, players will get to dive into a familiar world as a Teer Fradeen native, where there are also foreigners living on your land, which is causing trouble for a lot of the natives. In this game, you have to try and figure out why the world is dying while completing quests, partaking in combat, and romancing companions that you find along the way. Now that the game is in Early Access, only some of these features are available or are not available in its completed form. Here is everything you can expect from GreedFall 2: The Dying World's Early Access period.</p>
<h2>What To Expect From GreedFall 2 Early Access</h2>
<p>While plenty of games offer up an experience that has most of the gameplay available from the outset, GreedFall 2 is still in very early stages and there are only a couple of areas that players are able to explore from the outset. All of this information is listed on the Steam page, with the developers also listed what players can expect to be released over the Early Access period.</p>
<p>If you're unsure about whether you want to sink money into the GreedFall 2: The Dying World Early Access, we have <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world/">a preview available</a> that lists some of our impressions of the RPG. Right now, for players who are considering purchasing the Early Access of GreedFall 2, keep in mind that the price is set to change once the game is fully released. The game is relatively pricy at the moment already, with it costing $39.99 with only a few beginning areas being available to explore at the moment. Spiders' has confirmed that the price is set to change as the game becomes fully developed.</p>
<p>Granted, GreedFall 2: The Dying World only entered Early Access as of Tuesday, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1997660?emclan=103582791471926029&amp;emgid=4686647673445136560" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the developers have already started making huge changes</a>. Here are some of the things you can expect from the Early Access period:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start of main Questline</li>
<li>6 Companions</li>
<li>6 Skill Trees</li>
<li>Teer Fradee, Thynia, and Uxantis exploration</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>This is just the start of the Early Access period, and as time goes on, they have more features planned, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Companions</li>
<li>New Companion Quests</li>
<li>Main story extension</li>
<li>New Region</li>
<li>Hub becomes available</li>
<li>Two new Skill Trees</li>
<li>Crafting System</li>
<li>Teer Fradee and Uxantis local questlines</li>
<li>Photomode</li>
<li>Factions</li>
<li>Max level extension</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the features planned for GreedFall 2: The Dying World's Early Access period. Spiders have also answered some of the most Frequently Asked Questions, so players know what they're getting into.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-fishing-kiryu<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>was originally intended to be a fishing spinoff starring longtime series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama has revealed.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/08/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-interview/?sf274964865=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new interview on the PlayStation Blog</a>, Yokoyama says that for "quite some time", he's been wanting to make a game titled&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Tuna</em>, which would star the Dragon of Dojima himself as a tuna fisherman.</p>
<p>Yokoyama says this game would revolve around Kiryu "fight[ing] against fishing boats" at sea. His dream (that's Yokoyama's, not Kiryu's) never saw the light of day, but ideas from it evolved into the piratical story of <i>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</i>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-majima-guns.jpg?itok=lqnjKv4S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-majima-guns.jpg?itok=HQjZUqVM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>was, at one stage, a fishing game starring Kazuma Kiryu.</figcaption></figure><p>In the interview, Yokoyama also reveals that the ideas for&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>were percolating as early as last summer, long before latest mainline installment&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-gets-release-date-rpg-gameplay-confirmed"><em>Infinite Wealth&nbsp;</em>was released</a>.</p>
<p>He says spinoffs are "perfect in size for adults", comparing the mainline series to "an all-you-can-eat restaurant" in which you can gorge yourself on whatever you like. Spinoffs, by contrast, are "well-balanced, good-proportion meals", according to Yokoyama.</p>
<p>We also learn how Yokoyama is dealing with Majima's "unpredictability" as a character; he says that's the reason behind the ex-yakuza's amnesia.</p>
<p>Maijma's unpredictability makes him "intriguing", Yokoyama says, but it also creates a disconnect between players' emotions and Majima's emotions. To transform him into a more conventional protagonist, Yokoyama says, it was either amnesia or time travel. I guess the series isn't quite that ridiculous...yet.</p>

<p>When it comes to combat, Yokoyama says the new jump move was introduced "because the character Majima looks good while jumping". That's right; it wasn't for any concrete gameplay reason, but just because the devs thought it looked cool.</p>
<p><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced">launches on February 28th</a>&nbsp;across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3061810/Like_a_Dragon_Pirate_Yakuza_in_Hawaii/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii/9ns00hqcz0cj" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

To make switching between those platforms a little easier, both the layout and the labels of the controller’s face buttons can be changed.</p><p>The $69.99 Tarantula Pro addresses a common problem experienced by gamers with multiple consoles. The Nintendo Switch uses a clockwise button layout of X, A, B, and Y, while the Xbox, Steam Deck, and mobile controllers for Apple and Android devices use a Y, B, A, and X layout.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Tarantula Pro’s action button labels change using a motorized mechanism.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: GameSir</cite></p></div><p>The GameSir Connect mobile app can swap the functional layout of the Tarantula Pro’s face buttons back and forth (between Switch and Xbox modes according to user preference or game compatibility, even though this won’t work as an Xbox controller), while pressing a combination of buttons on the controller itself activates a motorized mechanism that rearranges the face buttons’ labels. </p><p>The controller can’t change any muscle memory you’ve built up for one layout or the other, but the labels will at least provide a reminder of which buttons you should be pressing.</p><p>The Tarantula Pro isn’t just a one-trick pony — or arachnid. It can connect to gaming devices over Bluetooth, a USB cable, or using an included 2.4GHz dongle for reduced lag.

            <p>
Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lamplighters-league-review">liked</a>, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios</a>. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skyline-2-devs-considered-release-delay-to-boost-performance-but-decided-its-not-a-dealbreaker">launched with severe bugs and performance issues</a>. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-delays-prison-architect-2-and-cancels-preorders-improving-the-performance-has-proven-to-be-a-task-that-will-take-time">delayed indefinitely</a>, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-been-delayed-again-this-time-until-the-first-half-of-2025">delayed for the umpteenth time</a> into 2025.</p>
<p>And then there's the abrupt cancellation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-by-you">Life By You</a>, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You <a href="file:///C:/Users/cex/Downloads/Interim%20report%20January%20%E2%80%93%20June%202024%20(correction).pdf">cost</a> Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Paradox recently invited journalists to a Media Day in London, seeking to reset perceptions and explore what they've learned from this run of disasters. I have a few stories from that event, which we'll run over the next week or two, but above all, I wanted to ask about Life By You. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-reveal-life-by-you-a-competitor-to-the-sims-from-former-ea-boss">Announced barely a year before cancellation in March 2023</a> with a former EA boss at the helm, it was an undisguised attempt to usurp The Sims, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-you-has-grand-designs-on-the-sims-life-sim-throne">a host of ambitious elements</a> such as context-sensitive generated dialogue. I thought it made a lot of sense for Paradox to try its hand at a life sim - a genre that can be as system-led as grand strategy, but with a lighter, more approachable format that might have lured in players who aren't massive history buffs.
</p>
<p>In an interview at the event, Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja agreed that Life By You was a "strategically sensible project" for Paradox, adding that the company haven't given up on the life sim genre. "It makes sense to us strategically, finding that core team who want to do that game for us is a really good idea, and I think we should try again, if we have a similar opportunity," he told me.
</p><p>
Next time, however, Paradox need to make smaller investments at the outset and be prepared for a longer spell in prototyping, Lilja went on. "We need to do it a different way. We need to start with a smaller team. We need to do pre-production longer. We need to prototype a lot, before we go into big production, because when you have a full game team, quite honestly, it costs a lot, so any pivot is going to cost all of that."
</p>
<p>
The game's relative expense meant it had to show significant progress faster than the developers could manage, Lilja said. "We were not getting the game we wanted, and the burn rate and cost was really high at that point, which is on us as a publisher. The devs did everything they could, but there were lots of them, so any major change would just put us more into [debt]. We were digging a hole that was just getting deeper. That's why we had to stop it, and we didn't really see any other option. It's not like you can change dev team - we have to stop now." 
</p>
<p>The game's problems were too fundamental to iron out in early access, Lilja added. "If we thought people would be happy, we would have released it, but we certain, they wouldn't. So we had to stop."
</p>
<p>
Paradox's chief creator officer Henrik Fåhraeus echoed much of this in a separate interview at the event. "The thing with that game is we saw a lot of problems for a long time," he said of Life By You. Fåhraeus touched briefly on the game's graphics being "not good enough" for Paradox leadership, but added that Life By You's issues were more "big picture". 
</p><p>
"What is the player experience going to be like, is it going to be better than Sims 4 in some way, at least?" he said. "And the unfortunate answer to that is that I didn't feel it would be, and the other people who tested it were of sort of the same opinion. 
</p>
<p>
"So, it's not about single points of failure, if you will, it's more the big picture experience of playing the game, and even in early access, you need to have a really solid experience that is fun and bug-free. It can be a little thin on content, sure, that's not the big problem. It's having that really fun experience playing. The game needs to be there."
</p>
<p>
Like Lilja, Fåhraeus thinks Paradox have a future in the life sim genre. "The greenlighting of Life By You was perfectly reasonable, I think," he said. "It does kind of fit our pillars in many ways." While Fåhraeus acknowledges that life sims are "less challenging" than the grand strategy sims Paradox have a reputation for, he argues they rely on a similar mix of the "cerebral" and "creativity". "So a life sim made sense, and perhaps still make sense," he concluded.
</p>
<p>All this will likely make sour reading for people who used to work at Paradox Tectonic. Some of the laid-off developers have spoken out publicly against the cancellation, insisting that the game was in better shape than advertised. In June this year, a few months after Life By You was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-contender-life-by-you-gets-delayed-once-again-this-time-indefinitely">delayed indefinitely</a>, game designer Willem Delventhal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-screenshots-from-canceled-paradox-sim-life-by-you-show-off-all-the-fits-well-never-get">aired his frustrations</a> on LinkedIn, claiming that development was going "extremely well" before Paradox suspended launch for the final time.
</p><p>
"I cannot share specific numbers, but I can say that we had an internal metric we were aiming for that had been approved, and that we exceeded that number by a significant portion," he wrote. "We also got a thumbs up a few weeks before launch." 
</p>
<p>
According to Delventhal, the developers "spent a month in purgatory" after release was postponed indefinitely, during which "we did everything we could to prove to them we were worth launching, including things like finding potential buyers or suggesting cutting ties and going indie. We heard virtually nothing back."</p>
<p>When I asked Lilja what he thought of these comments, he declined to go into much depth. "I'm going to try and not get into that," he said. "I'm going to own up to what we as publishers did, and try not to comment too much on the dev side. I understand that they have their view, and I might agree or not, but it's mostly because I don't want to get into a fight, throwing stuff between us and devs. I don't think that's helpful for anyone. 
</p>
<p>
"But I can tell you that the game was not what we needed it to be. The promise that they talked about, that people got excited about, was not the game that we were looking at. And there were many different reasons, and I'm going to own up that we did not control or help them steer that in a good way - that's on us."

<p>After two years of waiting, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla finally gets Steam Achievements. The change comes following Ubisoft’s recent announcement that its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-will-release-games-on-steam-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games will return to Steam on Day 1</a>.</p>



<p>The update hit Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s&nbsp;<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2208920/history/">SteamDB</a>&nbsp;page last night, leading many to speculate about what could be the next Ubisoft game to receive Steam Achievements.</p>



<p>The recent change is yet another piece of information for the Assassin’s Creed franchise in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Ubisoft announced an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows delay</a>, pushing the game back from its scheduled October release date to February 2025.  In addition, we also reported a slew of Assassin’s Creed news, including that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Flag Remake is likely closer to release than you think</a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, we also reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows will get a co-op mode post-launch</a>. </p>



<p>All the information comes following a tough time for Ubisoft, including rumors that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-rise-30-amid-buyout-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company is considering a buyout with Tencent</a>. While just a rumor, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-buyouts-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft acknowledged the report</a>, stating that “Ubisoft has noted recent press speculation regarding potential interests around the Company. It regularly reviews all its strategic options in the interest of its stakeholders and will inform the market if and when appropriate.”</p>

                <p>The newest Nintendo Switch firmware update has arrived, and while one expert said this is a "major" update given what's under the hood, it doesn't necessarily provide any clues about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>.</p><p>Version 19.0.0 arrived on October 7, adding "general system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience," Nintendo said in the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one-line patch notes.</a></p><h3><strong>Ver. 19.0.0 (Released October 7, 2024</strong></h3><ul><li>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</li></ul><p>Internet super-sleuth <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">OatmealDome</a>, who is known to deeply examine new Switch updates to discover undisclosed changes, said this update is substantial because "pretty much every system component was updated."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Rime&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale&nbsp;</em>developer Tequila Works has announced that it's laying off an unspecified number of staff and cancelling an unannounced game.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tequilaworks_with-deep-regret-we-must-inform-activity-7249379290159452160-vRKo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on LinkedIn</a>, the studio says it's "restructuring" (which is a pretty common refrain when it comes to layoffs), and that this restructuring operation will "impact...a small number of roles at the studio".</p>
<p>Additionally, Tequila says it's made "the decision to cancel an unannounced game", although naturally, the studio doesn't specify exactly what the game was, so we don't know whether it was a sequel to an existing Tequila Works game or a new IP.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tequila-works-layoffs-cancellation-the-sexy-brutale.jpg?itok=zME4DD0B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tequila-works-layoffs-cancellation-the-sexy-brutale.jpg?itok=7E8iz1cm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tequila Works is known for games like&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rime</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Tequila Works closes its brief statement on LinkedIn by saying that it intends to "provide support and guidance to those affected" in what it describes as an "incredibly difficult time".</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with Tequila Works, it's a studio that was founded back in 2009 in Madrid. Its debut game was the side-scrolling zombie cinematic platformer&nbsp;<em>Deadlight</em>, and it followed this up with time loop murder mystery&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale&nbsp;</em>and <i>Ico</i>-style adventure game&nbsp;<em>Rime</em>&nbsp;in 2017.</p>
<p>Following these games, the studio released&nbsp;<em>Gylt&nbsp;</em>in 2020. It was initially a Google Stadia exclusive, but following the untimely (or perhaps that should be timely) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/google-stadia-shutting-down-in-january">demise of that platform</a>,&nbsp;<em>Gylt&nbsp;</em>eventually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gylt-pc-console-release-date">found its way to other platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Tequila's most recent game is the puzzle adventure&nbsp;<em>Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story</em>, released under the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-developer-riot-games-laying-off-530-employees-riot-forge-will-cease">now-sadly-defunct Riot Forge label</a>. It's still got one project in the works; in fact, one of the goals of today's layoffs and cancellation was to "concentrate on the development of only one game".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/song-of-nunu-tequila-works.jpg?itok=j11mN4To 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/song-of-nunu-tequila-works.jpg?itok=V9Ezaj5Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also know Tequila Works' name from&nbsp;<em>Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>News of these Tequila Works layoffs comes at a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">particularly brutal time</a> for the industry, with many studios experiencing layoffs, project cancellations, and studio closures.</p>
<p>Studios as big as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">Take-Two</a> have laid off hundreds of staff in recent months, and smaller indie outfits like&nbsp;<em>Palia</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-developer-singularity-6-layoffs">Singularity 6</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs">ZA/UM</a> have also been affected.</p>
<p>Of course, this hasn't prevented C-suite execs at companies like EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">raking in huge amounts of cash</a>, nor has it stopped certain ex-industry personnel from making some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-sony-boss-chris-deering-comments">pretty silly-sounding suggestions</a>.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ever since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/disney-buys-lucasfilm-star-wars-episode-7-coming-in-20-5957508&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/disney-buys-lucasfilm-star-wars-episode-7-coming-in-20-5957508">Disney bought Lucasfilm</a></span> back in 2012, there’s been a steady drip feed of <em>Star Wars</em> television shows airing on Disney+. Before that, we had a few shows set in George Lucas’ space opera universe, but they were only animated series (mostly) geared towards children. Since the Disney deluge, Disney has released 15 different <em>Star Wars</em> series, one a continuation of <em>The Clone Wars </em>animated show; the rest all brand-new.</p><p> Some of them, like 2022’s brilliant <em>Star Wars</em> spy thriller <em>Andor</em> (a prequel to <em>Rogue One</em> starring Diego Luna) are excellent. Some, like <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>, a limited series that tried to make an exciting show out of everyone’s favorite mostly-silent bounty hunter, feel more like Disney taking action figures and smashing them together on a soundstage. When <em>Star Wars</em> TV is good, it’s whip-smart and inspiring, but when it’s bad it’s like that muck at the bottom of the trash compactor in <em>A New Hope</em>.</p><p>So, we ranked the 15 <em>Star Wars</em> TV shows (not including the ‘80s animated series, sorry), from worst to best. Click through to see how everything shook out. </p></div></div><div><p>The pitch for <em>The Book of Boba Fett </em>was incredible: a big-budget live-action spin-off of <em>The Mandalorian</em> starring Boba Fett as he takes over Tatooine and becomes a powerful criminal kingpin following the death of Jabba the Hutt. That sounds amazing. Sadly, there wasn’t much story to tell, and the show meandered around for a few hours while tossing in some fan service to hide how empty it was. It’s telling that the best part of <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> is the two <em>Mandalorian </em>episodes shoved in the middle of the short season.—Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Unfortunately, <em>Young Jedi Adventures</em> is so far down on this list because of ageism—kind of. This series is the most geared-towards-children of any <em>Star Wars</em> show—it’s on Disney Junior, which means it’s aimed at really young kids (like 2-7 young), so it’s pretty tough to watch if you’re a childless 34-year-old woman. It’s a weird little kids show that I’d guess is easy to throw on when your toddler is pitching a fit so they can be distracted by whooshing lightsabers and spaceship sounds, and the animation is pretty cute, but there’s not much else to be said about a show that none of us here are the target audience for. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>Poor<em> Star Wars: Resistance</em>. It could have been something special, but instead, it got saddled with the unfortunate task of trying to exist within the, at the time, still-being-developed sequel trilogy timeline. So it felt like it could never push too far or take too many big swings with its cast of lovable hotshot pilots living on a giant oil rig-like platform. Poe Dameron, voiced by Oscar Isaac, shows up a few times and that’s cool. But it’s not enough to make <em>Resistance </em>more than a colorful but empty side-story that feels even less important in 2024 than it did back in 2018. — ZZ<br></p></div><div><p>I desperately wanted the <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> series to be good, as it promised to reunite actors Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor and to bridge a gap that was, for nearly two decades, only ever broached by the<em> Clone Wars</em> animated series. I had hoped that <em>Kenobi</em> would flesh out the Anakin/Obi-Wan dynamic in live-action and show us how their relationship was much more akin to that of brothers, rather than just merely master and apprentice, and that it would give Christensen a chance to enjoy some proper <em>Star Wars</em> love after he’d been the subject of so much ire as the prequels were released in the late ‘90s/early aughts.<br></p><p>But, alas, <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi </em>focused far too much on a young Leia and her relationship with Obi-Wan, bizarrely retreading tired characters and tropes while also trying to create new problems and plot points when there’s been a good story to be told sitting right there (Anakin and Obi-Wan’s bond during the Clone Wars), waiting patiently, for years.<br></p><p>Though McGregor deftly portrays an Obi-Wan so destroyed by the events of Episode 3 that he’s fully withdrawn from society, so scarred by the loss of his “brother” and his fellow Jedi that he can’t successfully keep his emotions from overwhelming him, we just don’t get enough of that. The show incessantly trots out child Leia (Vivien Lyra Blair, who is great) like a prized pony. “Look, remember her? She’s a kid now!” Yawn.<br></p><p>The brief scenes of Anakin and Obi-Wan together start to paint a clearer picture of their dynamic, but we never get a chance to see the finished painting. Instead we are repeatedly pulled back to young Leia and to a new Inquisitor struggling under the weight of Sith pressure (Reva, played by Moses Ingram), and told we should care about this, not that.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-obi-wan-season-2-clone-wars-armor-ewan-1851666770&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-obi-wan-season-2-clone-wars-armor-ewan-1851666770">McGregor’s recent comments gave me some hope</a></span> that a potential second season of the series could provide the live-action <em>Clone Wars </em>we’ve been searching for, but I won’t hold my breath. — AM<br></p></div><div><p><em>Ahsoka </em>has potential. It picks up where animated series <em>Star Wars: Rebels</em> left off and switches over to live-action to give us our first-ever look at beloved characters in a different medium (Rosario Dawson as Ashoka Tano, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Hera Syndulla, Natasha Liu Borduzzo as Sabine Wren, Eman Esfandi as Ezra Bridger). But that potential, like so many <em>Star Wars</em> projects, is only half-realized. </p><p>There are shining moments in the first season, like when Ahsoka meets Anakin (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-anakin-skywalker-hayden-christensen-ahsoka-1850403820&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-anakin-skywalker-hayden-christensen-ahsoka-1850403820">the Hayden renaissance is upon us</a></span>) in the World Between Worlds, or whenever Shin Hati (Ivanna Sakhno) is on-screen. There are some great lightsaber fights, too, and David Tennant’s return as a sarcastic droid is perfection. But <em>Ahsoka</em> eventually falls victim to the persistent <em>Star Wars</em> curse, curling in on itself and the franchise’s established lore like a big nostalgia ouroboros. There are moments of delicious nostalgia for us <em>Clone Wars</em> and <em>Rebels</em> sickos, don’t get me wrong, but by the end of the first season it feels like <em>Ahsoka</em> is running on fumes.</p><p>A second season unburdened by the connective threads of <em>Rebels</em> could propel this series higher up the list. Stay tuned. — AM</p></div><div><p>Genndy Tartakovsky’s<em> Clone Wars</em> is just plain cool. I wasn’t actually a S<em>tar Wars</em> fan for a large chunk of my youth and found the milieu of the prequels pretty off-putting and boring. I didn’t want to hear about blockades or embargoes, and the inner workings of the galactic senate put me to sleep. </p><p>I wanted more action, more style, more <em>flair</em>, and I only really got that in the brief, 2D-animated minisodes of Tartakovsky’s <em>Clone Wars </em>that aired between shows on Cartoon Network. There was no better creative force to stick on the job either, considering Tartakovsky’s work on <em>Samurai Jack</em> had already impressed and enraptured me. This <em>Clone Wars</em> series is action-packed, stylish, and economic in its storytelling, and that is largely thanks to the vision of Tartakovsky.</p><p><em>Clone Wars</em> still kind of feels like the template for some of <em>Star Wars’ </em>best material. The mainline film saga has always painted in broad strokes, rarely affording time to dig into characters and moments across its vast timeline. This <em>Clone Wars </em>show was one of the first times I could remember the franchise carving out the time to make a bigger deal of the actual war that is supposed to be raging in the background of the prequels. It’s intimate in a way the movies rarely are—when <em>Star Wars</em> narrows its focus to hone in on a set of characters for an extended amount of time, rather than treat them like a cog in a big-ass storytelling machine, you get stuff like <em>Andor</em>, <em>The Acolyte</em>, or even the follow-up <em>Clone Wars</em> show that is now championed as some of the best work in the whole franchise. </p><p>I simply don’t believe we would have much of <em>Star Wars</em>’ best stuff if this early animated series hadn’t shown the value in the series pumping the brakes on the larger movements of its sweeping epic and taking its time to focus on some key players and a handful of pivotal moments. — Moises Tavares</p></div><div><p>As the first live-action <em>Star Wars</em> show,<em> </em>there was a lot of hype and eyeballs on <em>The Mandalorian. </em>And thankfully, it mostly succeeds at taking the big, campy adventurous spirit of live-action <em>Star Wars</em> films and squeezing it into weekly episodes of a TV show. It also introduced Grogu aka Baby Yoda, a small child-like example of the alien race known only as Yoda’s species. Grogu became an overnight pop culture icon and helped make <em>The Mandalorian </em>even bigger. </p><p>The show is pure <em>Star Wars </em>fan service, but it’s big-budgeted and fun fan service delivered in a weekly package with guest stars like Jack Black and interesting bits of post-<em>Return of the Jedi</em> lore sprinkled in to keep super fans excited. It’s not high art, but it’s entertaining sci-fi and that’s really all <em>Star Wars </em>needs to be most of the time to work. — ZZ<br></p></div><div><p>The <em>Tales of the Jedi </em>anthology<em>&nbsp;</em>is very good (you’ll see why on the next slide), so it makes sense that Disney would try and milk the cash cow some more with <em>Tales of the Empire</em>. Though it <em>looks</em> just as good as its benevolent predecessor, <em>Empire</em> is less consistent, with really good episodes (the first and third episodes in each arc) and some bad ones (the middle episodes in each arc). Morgan Elsbeth and fan-favorite Barriss Offee are the central characters in <em>Empire</em>, and their stories are solid—it’s just both of their damn middle episodes, which feel like unnecessary filler thrown in to make sure <em>Empire</em> wasn’t a shorter series. Gotta love Disney logic. — AM </p></div><div><p>Any series that features <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/it-took-you-cowards-long-enough-to-add-yaddle-to-a-vide-1843245709&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/it-took-you-cowards-long-enough-to-add-yaddle-to-a-vide-1843245709">Yaddle</a></span> is good in my book. But even without Jedi Master Yaddle, <em>Tales of the Jedi</em> is some wonderful <em>Star Wars</em> storytelling. It follows Ahsoka Tano and Count Dooku, showing us previously unseen moments from their lives. With Ahsoka, we see her as a baby, a teenager fighting in the Clone Wars, and an adult living out on her own after leaving the Order. Meanwhile, we watch how a noble and trusted Jedi, Dooku, could become disillusioned with the Jedi order and fall to the Dark Side. </p><p>While Ahsoka’s episodes are great—the highlight being an episode that shows her training endlessly against the Clone Troopers, which gave her the skills to survive the Purge—the real highlight of<em> Tales of the Jedi</em> is Dooku.<br></p><p>We get to see how he fell to darkness and joined up with the Emperor, and witness the big revelation that the Emperor didn’t have to promise him power or money or anything like that. Instead, Dooku watched people suffer and die while the Jedi, in his opinion, didn’t do enough to stop it or investigate. After that, all it took was a bit of a push to convince him to turn on the Jedi and the Republic. Watching him kill Yaddle (RIP) makes it clear that he’s conflicted, but convinced that this is the right path. A sad end for a once-noble Jedi, but a hell of an anthology series. — ZZ</p></div><div><p>When it was announced back in 2021 I was very excited for <em>Star Wars: Visions</em>, an anime anthology of original stories from iconic animation studios. The two seasons we’ve gotten so far have more than lived up to expectations, offering up beautifully realized, endlessly creative, and fantastically hopeful <em>Star Wars</em> stories across its 18 episodes. <em>Visions </em>is proof of the creative potential of opening up major IPs like <em>Star Wars</em> as a sandbox for more people to play in, and not setting restrictions on what those new visitors create.<br></p><p>From<em> “</em>Screecher’s Reach,” a beautiful retelling of Irish folklore in which the banshee is instead a Sith Mother, to “The Village Bride,” a fascinating, Kurosawa-esque tale of a Jedi on the run who is pulled into the bizarre but beautiful ways of a remote village’s wedding preparations, <em>Visions</em> is, well, visionary. Disney and Lucasfilm should aim for more <em>Star Wars</em> media to be like this, not less. — AM</p></div><div><p>Oh, <em>The Acolyte</em>, you were too pure for this world. How dare you tell a brand-new <em>Star Wars</em> story during a never-before-seen-in-live-action era starring several actors of color that lambasts the small-mindedness of the Jedi Order and has an enemies-to-lovers plot point? Notoriously close-minded sects of the <em>Star Wars</em> community hated <em>The Acolyte</em> before it even aired, and relished in its cancellation. But <em>The Acolyte</em> isn’t a bad <em>Star Wars</em> show, it’s just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-canceled-season-2-1851627217&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-canceled-season-2-1851627217">a victim of modern television and ballooning budgets</a></span>. </p><p>Though it tripped on its own two feet midway through the first (and now seemingly only) season, <em>The Acolyte</em> gave us the best live-action lightsaber fight since Duel of the Fates, a deliciously deviant villain in Manny Jacinto’s Qimir, a pointed critique of the pointless rigidity of the Jedi Order, and new characters who immediately endeared themselves to us. It’s an inspiring show that’s fresher than drinking Bantha milk out of the damn bucket, with great performances from Jacinto, Lee Jung-jae, Amandla Stenberg, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Dafne Keen. It has a tactility to its set and costume design reminiscent of old-school <em>Star Wars</em>. It lovingly embraces what makes the franchise special while turning its back on what makes it reductive.</p><p>Perhaps <em>Star Wars</em> didn’t deserve <em>The Acolyte</em>, but <em>The Acolyte</em> deserved better. — AM</p></div><div><p><em>Star Wars </em>has long been about ragtag groups coming together to form found families as they fight back forces more powerful than themselves in a desperate effort to save the galaxy, or at least survive for one more day. And <em>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</em>, a spin-off of<em> Clone Wars</em> starring a squad of “defective” elite troopers, follows that classic <em>Star Wars</em> playbook perfectly.</p><p>At first I was worried the series, set shortly after the events of <em>Episode III</em>, would feel too by the numbers. But as it progresses, <em>Bad Batch</em> uses the<em> Star Wars</em> formula to tell a story of loyal soldiers now faced with the fact that their side is the bad side and the galaxy is a worse place because of them. It’s a dark time in <em>Star Wars</em>, and <em>Bad Batch</em> doesn’t shy away from sad or mature moments. It’s not quite <em>Andor</em>, but this is a series that’s not afraid to kill characters or show how defeated the galaxy is post-<em>Episode III’</em>s Jedi Purge and the rise of the Empire.</p><p>What could have been a silly show about weird Clone Troopers getting into random adventures each week is actually a series about betrayal, destruction, hope, and perseverance that also helps fill in some lore gaps in this era of the franchise. In other words, you should probably watch <em>Bad Batch</em>! — ZZ</p></div><div><p>I remember when <em>Rebels </em>was first announced and the reaction from <em>Star Wars</em> fans was, unsurprisingly, very negative. People complained that it didn’t look good, they were upset that it seemingly killed <em>The Clone Wars</em>, and as the first new <em>Star Wars</em> series from Disney, a subset of fans assumed it would be a terrible thing designed to rewrite lore and erase past<em> Star Wars</em> adventures. </p><p>All of these complaints and fears would end up being completely wrong. For one thing, <em>Rebels’ </em>art style was directly inspired by original concept art for the old <em>Star Wars</em> movies and as the series continued, its animation got better. It’s now considered one of the best-looking <em>Star Wars</em> shows around. It also didn’t kill <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Clone Wars</em>; instead, it was a sequel to that series. But before revealing that to fans, it introduces a new cast of plucky-but-flawed scoundrels, including a former Jedi, and slowly turns them into fan-favorites as they take on Thrawn, a character from the EU brought into canon via <em>Rebels</em>.<br></p><p>Then, once series supervising director Dave Filoni and Lucasfilm had introduced new characters and developed them into fully fleshed-out heroes worth caring about on their own, they revealed that <em>Rebels </em>was a continuation of <em>Clone Wars</em>. Ashoka and Rex were back. Hondo was here. Darth Maul returned. Story threads and lore first featured in <em>Clone Wars</em> got picked up in <em>Rebels</em>, like the Dark Saber and the fate of Mandalore. And then Lucasfilm ended the series on a cliffhanger, and all those fans who complained about <em>Rebels </em>were begging for a resolution that wouldn’t come until the live-action <em>Ahsoka </em>series in 2023. Now that’s how you run a large franchise TV series. — ZZ</p></div><div><p>Maybe my most successful tweet ever was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/carolynmichelle/status/1577808668254507009&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/carolynmichelle/status/1577808668254507009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a></span>, four images from episode five of <em>Andor </em>accompanied by my reaction: “Whoa.” In those images, young Karis Nemik, the most intellectually engaged member of the small band on Aldhani planning a massive heist of Imperial wealth, passionately imparts some of his ideas to Cassian Andor, who is undergoing his own reluctant political awakening. “So much going wrong,” Karis says, “so much to say, and all of it happening so quickly. The pace of repression outstrips our ability to understand it. And that is the real trick of the Imperial thought machine. It’s easier to hide behind 40 atrocities than a single incident.” </p><p>My hair stood on end upon hearing those words, a clear, truthful insight into how systems of oppression maintain their dominance, not just in that galaxy far, far away, but here in our world, too. For me, this conversation marked one of the most exciting moments in all of <em>Star Wars</em>, more thrilling than many of the franchise’s space battles and lightsaber clashes: here was a bold, unapologetic staking of ideological ground, a dazzling reminder that <em>Star Wars </em>could be, and should be, <em>about </em>something.</p><p>And this isn’t, as some may claim, <em>Andor </em>coming along and needlessly making <em>Star Wars </em>political. It’s a bold reclaiming of the political heart that was always there. Just watch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/fv9Jq_mCJEo?si=rc8T1j-l-vDlkvvs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/fv9Jq_mCJEo?si=rc8T1j-l-vDlkvvs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this excerpt from an interview</a></span> between George Lucas and James Cameron, in which Lucas asserts that his focus, as a student of anthropology, is “social systems.” Cameron then observes how interesting it is that in <em>Star Wars</em>, “the good guys are the Rebels, they’re using asymmetric warfare against a highly organized Empire. I think we call those guys terrorists today.” Lucas responds, “When I did it, they were Viet Cong,” which makes the Empire of the original 1977 film—dun dun DUN!!!!!!!—the good ol’ U.S. of A. </p><p>Of course, over the decades, there have been many real-life Empires and many real-life Rebellions, and sadly, those core political themes of oppression and resistance at the heart of <em>Star Wars </em>have never been made obsolete. If anything, they feel more urgently relevant today than ever. But what makes <em>Andor </em>so extraordinary isn’t just the fact that it unabashedly and explicitly reclaims this radical, anti-fascist political ground for the colossal franchise. Of course it’s possible to write a story with radical politics that’s clunky and boring, that feels more driven by ideology than by characters with real desires and convictions. But <em>Andor </em>is extraordinarily successful on this level, too. In the hands of showrunner Tony Gilroy, who also wrote and directed the exceptionally smart and thrilling 2007 film <em>Michael Clayton</em>, <em>Andor</em>’s characters and themes are organically fused, with its fascists as complex and believable as its anti-fascists, and with every rousing speech—like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/GQMDmb3mOY8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/GQMDmb3mOY8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the one Stellan Skarsgård stirringly delivers</a></span> as Luthen Rael, revealing all the things he has sacrificed in pursuit of liberation, and<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/TaKrm5txGCQ?si=fXTyR-Yu0LslXcvb&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/TaKrm5txGCQ?si=fXTyR-Yu0LslXcvb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the one Fiona Shaw’s Maarva Andor delivers</a></span> from beyond the grave, urging those she’s left behind to “fight the Empire!”—feeling not like a bad writer heavy-handedly working some ideological message into a story where it doesn’t belong, but rather like a wholly believable and necessary expression of that character’s convictions.<br></p><p>Every day now—every tragic, horrible day—it feels more and more plainly true that Karis was right: there’s so much going wrong, and all of it’s happening so quickly, and that the sheer number of atrocities being funded and committed only makes it easier for the governments doing so to hide behind them. <em>Andor </em>is full of thrilling action and wonderful characters, all of the things we’ve always come to <em>Star Wars </em>for. But it’s also an urgent reminder of what <em>Star Wars </em>has always really been about. Know an evil empire when you see one. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p>The animated <em>Clone Wars</em> series started off as an okay-but-not-great show that filled in the gap between the prequel movies of <em>Episode II</em> and <em>Episode III</em>. But as the series continued, it quickly became  fantastic, not only filling in the gaps left by the films, but providing us something they didn’t: Chemistry between Anakin and Obi-Wan.</p><p>If you just watch the prequels, Anakin and Obi-Wan barely seem close, let alone like brothers, and the actual Clone Wars are a background detail that feels far away and weirdly not all that dangerous. The animated series fixes this, providing us with an action-packed and well-written series of arcs that not only show us what happened during the Clone Wars but also how Anakin slowly moves toward the dark side, the things that push him there (the Jedi, mostly), and his inevitable fall to Darth Vader.</p><p>Most of <em>Star Wars</em> outside the movies can be skipped unless you love the franchise and want more of it. <em>Clone Wars</em> is the big exception. So much of <em>Clone Wars</em> has continued to appear in books, comics, games, movies, and other TV shows. Ahsoka’s arc starts here. It’s where we meet Hondo Ohnaka. And it’s the series that <em>Rebels </em>builds off of which itself has become a backbone of modern <em>Star Wars</em>. <em>Clone Wars</em> is a key piece in all of this and essential viewing if you want to understand the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. And lucky for you, (most  of) the show is really good. — ZZ</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Other single-player PlayStation games performed much better when making the jump to PC, with Ghost of Tsushima reaching 77,154 concurrent players, God of War reaching 73,529, and Spider-Man reaching 66,436 on Valve's platform. Until Dawn's Steam launch is the worst Sony debut on Steam since the ill-fated <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/sackboy-a-big-adventure">Sackboy: A Big Adventure</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This small player base is reporting myriad issues too. Until Dawn currently has a "mixed" user review rating on Steam with just 69% of reviews being positive. The review deemed most helpful recommends the game but complains about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pc-gamers-in-countries-without-psn-hit-out-at-sony-for-blocking-sale-of-single-player-games-god-of-war-ragnarok-and-until-dawn-on-steam">the required PlayStation Network account</a>, poor optimisation, music changes from the original, bugs, and poor controls at times.</p><p>Other reviews also comment on ray tracing and DLSS not working alongside graphical issues which "destroy immersion." Others comment on the full price tag for the originally nine-year-old game and it still launching with issues.</p><p>Developer Ballistic Moon, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-lays-off-several-staff">suffered a "significant" round of lay-offs</a> even before the Until Dawn remake launched, has acknowledged the problems in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> released today, October 8. "We understand that some of you may have encountered some technical issues or bugs, and we’d love to hear from you so we can address these concerns," it said.</p><p>"We are also aware of a couple of recurring issues, such as HDR and AMD FSR frame generation settings not functioning as intended, and issues with save/load. We hear you and we're actively testing fixes for these issues (and more). We will provide further information with our next patch update."</p><p>Issues are not exclusive to the PC version of the game, however. The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxwB2f5s850?autoplay=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> noted that the PS5 version has frame pacing or frame ordering issues, 30 frames per second and 1440p output with significant aliasing on high contrast edges, and break up when there's motion on-screen.</p><p>Ballistic Moon has at least said updates are coming, but these may be too little, too late for those who've already spent $59.99 on the remake. No release dates or windows have been shared for these fixes.</p><p>Until Dawn fans otherwise got a kick out of story changes in the remake (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-remake-leak-reveals-revamped-intro-in-3-hours-of-ps5-gameplay">when it all leaked ahead of launch</a>) with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-until-dawn-ps5-and-pc-remake-leaks-have-sparked-until-dawn-2-speculation">some even thinking a sequel is on the way</a>. The universe is expanding elsewhere too, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-until-dawn-film-has-already-wrapped-filming">filming wrapped on the Until Dawn movie adaptation</a> earlier in October.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
