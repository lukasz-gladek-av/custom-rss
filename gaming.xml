			<p>Japanese streamer 2RBO. livestreamed 90 minutes of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, which Bloober Team is developing with a release date of October 8, 2024. The live stream showed off the early area gameplay, introducing the players to James Sunderland, a man looking for his wife in Silent Hill. In this livestream, fans get to watch the livestreamer travel through the city, comparing the sights of the new game to the original, expressing their excitement (as read via translated captions) at the differences made with new graphics.</p>
<p><iframe title="【リメイク版を世界最速配信!?】弟者,おついちの「サイレントヒル２(2024) | SILENT HILL 2 (2024)」【2BRO.】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZTxhiokIUxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Silent Hill 2's remake features ray-tracing and new technical enhancements to add to the thick atmosphere of Silent Hill 2, with new immersive soundscapes, as well as the option to turn on a filter that gives the game the 90's feel, making it noisy and even foggier than before.</p>
<p>As seen in the live stream, there is a stark difference between the camera of the original Silent Hill 2 and the remake. In the remake, the camera is now over the shoulder so that you are closer to the character, providing more immersion when fighting off enemies and being jump-scared. When picking up items and spotting secrets, the high-quality graphics and the over-the-shoulder camera will make things significantly more accessible, and James will look over at essential items to nudge players in the right direction.</p>
<p>The original Silent Hill 2 featured many inaccessible buildings and locations, but the remake has sought to open up those areas, allowing players to explore more thoroughly and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-completionist-route-will-take-more-than-20-hours/">access new puzzles and items</a> to aid them on their journey through the game. In the livestream, some of these areas are shown off, with the streamer also stating that they remember being unable to access certain areas in the original. The buildings don't necessarily hold items of interest, with some of them just being an extra way to jumpscare the player.</p>
<p>In the livestream, players also get a first glance at the updated combat system, which was severely clunky in the original. Players will get to use iconic weapons from the original such as the Steel Pipe and Handgun. Still, the combat system will make it easier to attack enemies, while having to perfect your dodges to avoid taking damage. Combining the new combat system with the new camera system makes for a terrifying experience showcased in the livestream, with the streamer coming up against many enemies in plain sight or waiting in ambush.</p>

I’m also curious to hear more about these gross grenades, which are giving me visions of the piss bombs from <em>Death Stranding</em>.  </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>recently got to see a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-bethesda-horror-1851628323&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-bethesda-horror-1851628323">behind closed-doors, hands-off preview</a></span> of <em>Shattered Space</em>. “While you can leave the planet any time you wish, given <em>Starfield</em>’s open nature, the plot here is entirely self-contained, and exploration of the planet and the city will lead to uncovering exactly what happened here, and, we’re told, becoming ‘entangled in the political feud between the minor houses,’” wrote John Walker in response to what was shown. “This refocusing of how <em>Starfield</em> is played and experienced could be a boon for the ailing project.”</p><p>I certainly hope the strong sense of mood and much more confined storytelling creates a denser feeling of possibilities to explore and secrets to uncover in <em>Shattered Space</em>. My favorite moments from the base game weren’t firing up my ship’s engines and pondering all the places I could go, but rather navigating strained loyalties and menacing deceptions in individual cities and questlines. We’ll find out if it’s worked when the expansion arrives on Xbox and PC later this month. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To make this possible, NBA 2K25 features a new dribble engine which is also powered by ProPLAY, which gives dynamic motion from real NBA footage to the animations to give players a more immersive experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="NBA 2K25 | World of 2K" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G1Qo0mYKDEc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The City, a feature that has appeared in many of the NBA games has been reworked after receiving player feedback, bringing players to a new interactive City which allows players to feel more connected to the game. This includes a competitive hub on the Boulevard of the Stars and a ranked mode in the Proving Grounds. The City also sees the return of MyCOURT and MyPARKS, as well as some extra features to make it as immersive as possible.</p>
<p>"NBA 2K25 has finally arrived, building off community feedback and bringing the ultimate basketball proving grounds where they can showcase their skills and Ball Over Everything. With the debut of thrilling new competitive modes in The City and MyTEAM, alongside enhanced features and tutorials for beginners, NBA 2K25 offers an unparalleled experience for both seasoned veterans and newcomers," says Greg Thomas, the President at Visual Concepts.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-will-start-sharing-more-revenue-with-creators.974304/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237039/roblox-share-revenue-creators-paid-experiences-rdc-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As Roblox marches toward its ultimate goal of 1 billion users, the company is finding new ways to share revenue with the developers who have made millions of games on the platform.</p><p>During the company’s annual developers conference in San Francisco on Friday, CEO David Baszucki announced that creators of these games, which Roblox calls experiences, will be able to keep between 50 and 70 percent of revenue from their paid titles when they’re purchased in real currency on desktop computers. That’s significantly more than the roughly 30 percent revenue split Roblox<em> </em>gives developers for purchases made with its native Robux currency inside freemium experiences. </p><p>The move could help incentivize the creation of more premium games as Roblox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23775268/roblox-ceo-david-baszucki-gaming-metaverse-robux-virtual-reality">looks to attract older users</a>. Baszucki says the intention is to also bring these new economics to paid experiences bought on other devices, including mobile phones and consoles, though app store fees will likely get in the way on iOS and Android. He declined to share specifics.</p><div><figcaption><em>A breakdown of Roblox’s revenue sharing for paid experiences on desktop.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Roblox</cite></p></div><p>“We believe we’re setting the groundwork for a more expansive range of type of content on the platform,” Baszucki tells me with regard to paid experiences. In addition, he says there’s “a huge effort within the company to support 100-plus-player open-world sports or battle royale-type experiences on low-end devices.” Though he doesn’t say it, that strategy is seemingly aimed at competing more directly with Epic Games’ <em>Fortnite</em>, which Roblox<em> </em>still doesn’t have a viable alternative to on its platform.</p><p>Another way Roblox is sharing money with creators is via a new affiliate link program. Those who are accepted into it will be able to earn up to 50 percent (capped at $100) of Robux purchases a new user makes within six months after joining from their sign-up link. “I think it’s going to make it a lot easier for creators to be comfortable leaning into heavy social marketing” for the platform, says Baszucki of the new program.</p><div><figcaption>Roblox<em>’s new Party mode.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Roblox</cite></p></div><p>Roblox’s<em> </em>other big announcements at this year’s developer conference include a new “Party” mode that lets up to six people communicate and move between experiences as a group. Starting early next year, it’s<em> </em>also partnering with Shopify to let developers sell real-world items through the platform. Revenue sharing terms of that arrangement haven’t been disclosed yet. </p><p>While Roblox’s daily user base continued to steadily grow to 79.5 million last quarter, the company has come under fire in a recent <em>Bloomberg </em>investigation titled <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">“Roblox’s<em> </em>Pedophile Problem.”</a> After that story was published this summer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216300/turkey-blocks-roblox-instagram">the government of Turkey banned <em>Roblox</em></a>, citing its hosting of “virtual sex parties” and “violent games” played by children. Roblox<em> </em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-04/roblox-turkey-ban-tied-to-kids-access-to-virtual-sex-parties">this week appealed the ban</a>, and Baszucki tells me, “We’re optimistic and working with their government and their courts.”</p><p>He says that “any incident on our platform is unacceptable” and that trust and safety is the “top priority” inside the company. “Our AI gets better all the time. Our human review gets better all the time. So, from my standpoint, the quality of our safety systems has constantly been improving.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After watching the announcement trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/whispers-of-the-eyeless">Whispers of the Eyeless</a>, I have one request: please, do not have that voiceover in the full game. It is hammier than a hamster eating a ham sandwich in Hamburg during a performance of Hamlet. It starts with "The Whispers [of the Eyeless] call to me!!!" and does not improve from there. Beyond that, colour me fairly enthused.

Created by Evil Gingerbread Studios and Venris, the dev behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> mod SFO, Whispers Of The Eyeless is about growing a terrible cult beneath a pretty awful city, so as to resurrect three dead gods: Wrath, Desire, and Madness. It's a strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with grim storybook art reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon</a>, a turn-based combat system and a splash of base and army-building. Other inspirations include Loop Hero, Children Of Morta and Polish folklore at large. 
</p>
<p>
"Assume the role of the last descendent of the Old Faith and First Prophet of the New Age in the city of Aranthor where new and old gods vie for power," proclaims <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523890/Whispers_of_the_Eyeless/">the Steam blurb</a>. "Defeated, exiled and nearly forgotten, the Dead Gods have been silent for generations. But finally... the Whispers have returned. The 'Dead' Gods were not dead, and it is up to you to reinstate them to their full glory."
</p>
<p>
The aforesaid city is presided over by various upstart Living Gods, and broken into districts with distinct enemies, local culture and histories. Each district is home to a "branching web of events". You'll seemingly visit them on your lonesome as cult leader - there isn't any party-based combat in the trailer - but you can recruit people as cultists and ordain them as disciples, who can be sent on missions. 
</p>
<p>
There's also the question of which particular Dead God you favour, with consequences including different decorations for your underground den of cosmic villainy. "Upgrade your base, enact divine Benedictions, and make Sacrifices to the Dead Gods to strengthen the cult and increase your power in the city as Prophet," the blurb goes on. "The God you favor will impact your Sanctum's appearance, which can be customized to your liking."
</p>
<p>
Whispers Of The Eyeless is in the "very late stages of development", according to publishers Camlann Games, and will enter Steam early access in either Q4 2024 or Q1 2025 - in other words, later this winter or early next spring. You can expect a demo in one of Valve's forthcoming Steam Next Fests - either October 2024 or February 2025. Here's hoping the launch trailer narration is a fading memory by then.

                <p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/astro-bot/" data-ref-id="5000-630892">Astro Bot</a>, there are 300 bots to find, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/astro-bot-all-cameo-bots-and-secret-characters-list/2900-5754/" data-ref-id="2900-5754">169 cameo bots</a>, as well as dozens of puzzle pieces and several secret Void levels hidden within the game. Normally, a game like this would be quite a chore for players seeking to polish off all of its optional items to 100% completion, but Astro Bot offers a special tool that makes this process much faster and more enjoyable. Here's what you need to know.</p><h2>Astro Bot - All secrets and collectible locations</h2><p>Astro Bot's lengthy list of optional secrets to find is made incredibly easy--hopefully in a way that transforms the genre--thanks to its robot bird companion.Each time you complete a level and have collectibles like hidden bots or puzzle pieces still undiscovered, jump back into the level whenever you'd like to.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4361206-img_6712.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361206" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4361206-img_6712.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361206"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4361206-img_6712.jpg"></figure><p>There, you'll find right at the start of a level a peculiar item that wasn't there before: a birdhouse encased in domed glass. It reads 200 on the bottom, which means it'll cost you 200 coins to open it. This is only available when you're replaying a level you already completed.</p><p>Pay the 200-coin fee, then pull on the wires to reveal a robot bird. This bird, which seems to be nameless, actually pings any remaining collectibles in the level. This includes all undiscovered bots, puzzle pieces, and Void levels, which are the secret levels found within other levels (as opposed to those found in the space map). The bird pings collectibles from quite far away, and the pinging intensifies as you get closer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4361207-img_6715.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361207" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4361207-img_6715.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361207"></a><figcaption>Follow the bird's ping to find every collectible in the game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4361207-img_6715.jpg"></figure><p>Simply put, this feature makes collecting all bots and other secrets in the game trivially easy. It's a lovely idea, and we hope it finds its way into other games that could use it similarly in years to come.</p><p>If you'd like to take a peek at the secret character bots specifically, we've arranged a gallery of all the Astro Bot hidden cameo bots.

With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s Shattered Space expansion just weeks away from release, Bethesda has been teasing some of the things players can expect to find when House Va'ruun's homeward of Va'ruun'kai opens for business on 30th September.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you to the millions of players who have made the Settled Systems their home and helped make this an incredible first year for Starfield", Bethesda wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1832055921758867842">post on social media</a>, before turning its attention to those pre-launch teases.
</p>
<p>
First up is the reveal Shattered Space's new planet of Va'ruun'kai will be something for explorers to get stuck into, featuring "over 50 locations to discover" - one of which, as we learned during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, will be House Va'ruun's capital city of Dazra.

<p>
Elsewhere, Shattered Space introduces a "gross" new grenade that can be crafted from organic material, as well as "formidable" enemies, including the Redeemed and Vortex Horrors. Additionally, Bethesda warns players "haven't seen the last of Zealots, Spacers, or the Crimson Fleet", who all just might be looking to take advantage of the "situation" on Va'ruun'kai.
</p>
<p>
That situation, as Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-warps-bethesdas-final-frontier-into-full-on-horror">recently discovered</a>, is a vortex that's consumed much of Dazra, and whose effects are now bleeding out across the whole of the planet to create a Starfield expansion focusing on "pure space horror".
</p>
<p>
"Creatures are emerging from the other side of the vortex and they're certainly not happy to be on an unfamiliar planet," Lottie wrote. "Not to forget about the planet's terrain itself which includes gravity anomalies." Oh, and it'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-gets-release-date">have space buggies</a> too.

I was relieved to find that while there are two versions of the game, both options have the same release date of September 6. When later that day someone asked me when does<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span><em> </em>come out, I could answer simply: Tomorrow.

Buying a video game was already a complicated mess, with pre-order bonuses, various editions, and timed exclusivity windows. Now, when talking about new games, I also have to think “Wait, is this out for everyone or just people who pre-ordered some fancy $100 edition?” </p><p>At least one game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-gold-edition/9PD4PSZW2Q9Z/0010/B1GM6CW2358Z&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-gold-edition/9PD4PSZW2Q9Z/0010/B1GM6CW2358Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown</em></a></span>, has even made things more frustrating by offering two different early access options. Pay a bit more and you can play the game two days ahead of launch. Pay even more and you can play 7 days before launch. If you’re quiet, you can literally hear a greedy publisher somewhere counting money, looking at <em>Solar Crown</em>’s nonsense, and thinking “Maybe we can offer <em>three </em>tiers of early access!” </p><p>So that all makes me want to declare just how happy I am that <em>Astro Bot </em>has one release date. It’s weird that in 2024 having a single release date is something worthy of praise, yet here we are. The video game industry has become so addicted to “number go up” and endless growth that a single release date (you know how things have worked for <em>decade</em>) is becoming a rarity and something worth celebrating</p><p>And look, in six months, none of this will matter. The games will all be playable and their early access periods will be a distant memory. (Another reason to not pay extra for this shit.) But it does mean that for most games, the first week or so after launch has become a weird dance online as people try to talk about something that might not be out for everyone.<br></p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>will get to sidestep all of this by not being forcing gamers to pay a ransom fee to play a finished game a few days before others. How nice and just one more reason to love Sony’s new PS5 platformer. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

                <p>Resident Evil director Shinji Mikami founded Tango Gameworks in 2010 before leaving the company last year. Around the time of Mikami's departure, Tango Gameworks' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hi-fi-rush-review-good-vibes-only/1900-6418023/" data-ref-id="1900-6418023">Hi-Fi Rush</a> became a critically acclaimed hit. Now, Mikami has revealed that he thought Hi-Fi Rush had secured Tango Gameworks' future before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">Microsoft shut down the studio</a> earlier this year.</p><p>"I had thought the studio would be safe as long as they continued to make Hi-Fi Rush games," explained Mikami during an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shinji-mikami-and-goichi-interview-tango-gameworks-shadows-of-the-damned" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "That's one of the reasons I left Tango Gameworks. So I was surprised when the studio was closed down."</p><p>The good news is that Tango Gameworks' demise was short-lived. A few months after Microsoft made its decision, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">Tango Gameworks was purchased by Krafton</a>, which retained the rights for Hi-Fi Rush and any future games in the franchise. Krafton also retained at least half of Tango Gameworks' employees who hadn't already secured other jobs. That gave Mikami a greater sense of hope for his former company.</p><p>"Now Krafton has taken over the business, so I feel like it worked out well in the end," said Mikami. "I was reminded that if you make a good game, someone will pick it up. The hard work of the Hi-Fi Rush development team led to a new chapter for the company."</p><p>There's currently no word about when a Hi-Fi Rush sequel or follow-up may arrive, but Limited Run Games has previously confirmed that the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-is-still-getting-a-physical-edition-by-limited-run/1100-6523334/" data-ref-id="1100-6523334">Hi-Fi Rush will still get a physical release</a>. There's just no timetable for that at the moment.</p>

			<p>Today, Bethesda Game Studios celebrates the one-year anniversary since the release of Starfield, its first new intellectual property in 25 years, as well as its first-ever sci-fi franchise. On Twitter/X, the team thanked all the millions of players (14, last we <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> in June) that made this first year 'incredible' for Bethesda. At the same time, they said there's much more on the way, starting with the Shattered Space expansion set for a debut on September 30.</p>
<p>They then took the opportunity to share a few new tidbits about what will be in Starfield Shattered Space:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>🪐 Over 50 new locations to discover and explore across Va'ruun'kai.</em></li>
<li><em>🔥 New grenades to craft that stem from organic material you gather (and it's gross).</em></li>
<li><em>👾 Formidable new enemies - be on your guard for Redeemed and Vortex Horrors...</em></li>
<li><em>⚔️ You haven't seen the last of Zealots, Spacers, or the Crimson Fleet... As you explore the planet, be on the lookout for those taking advantage of the situation.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-adds-new-gameplay-mechanics-has-a-lot-of-densely-packed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> from Bethesda that Shattered Space is adding new zero-gravity combat scenarios that reportedly change how players approach fights, adding a new layer of strategy. The developers also introduced new ship customization options, allowing players to really tailor their vessels to their play style, and on the exploration front, some new tools and gadgets will help players interact with the environment in deeper, more meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Overall, Shattered Space returns to the old style of Bethesda exploration simply because most of the expansion will be set on a single planet. It will feature densely packed content like hidden quests and unique encounters, as fans have been used to with Elder Scrolls and Fallout.</p>
<p>It won't be long before we check it out for ourselves and discover whether it will be better received by the community than the base Starfield game. Stay tuned!</p>

            <p>I'll admit it, I downloaded the free prologue for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Baby Blues Nightmares mostly because I couldn't stop giggling at the offer to "utilize the unique abilities of a toddler", encompassing "stealth gameplay", "survival elements" and "upgradeable abilities". It's as though a toddler were actually an undersung class of special operator from a Tom Clancy shooter, rather than a wailing, hyperactive ball of tears and poop. Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the game doesn't lean into the stealth-survival premise as much as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836820/Baby_Blues_Nightmares__Toddler_Horror_Game/">the Steam page</a> suggests. When it talks about "upgradeable abilities" it means tricking out your toy tricycle, which you can use to ferry smaller, non-demonic toys around the house. When it talks about "survival elements", it's talking about soothing yourself with collectible chocolate bars, so you don't burst into tears and alert the monsters (there are also apples, which restore health but don't make you stop crying - what a judgement upon modern Western lifestyles, eh). And when it talks about "the unique abilities of a toddler", it's mostly referring to your size, which transforms the dowdy setting into a grotesque, ogreish playground, with tables to crawl under and playstools to yank around for platforming purposes.</p>
<p>Baby Blue Nightmares isn't the first game to do this - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/among-the-sleep-review-horror-pc">Among The Sleep</a> sent us tottering among gargantuan domestic fixtures back in 2014, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> does the same from a side-on perspective. But Baby Blue Nightmares does have some nice ideas of its own, not least letting you draw on walls using crayons. This is nifty partly because the game is "semi-open world" - you might want to mark up doors and the like to help you navigate and solve puzzles. But it's also cool because I have been waiting for a game that lets me live the swiftly curtailed life of a horror game NPC and cover every available surface with ranty graffiti and unexpectedly practical advice. Here's one of my contributions from the prologue. Sorry about the low brightness - I had the gamma turned up on the other monitor.</p>

<p>There's a lot of this playfulness in Baby Blue Nightmares. You can fanny around with the toys you find, bouncing rubber balls off the playroom TV, even as it blares Ominous Backstory at you, and stamping on the squeaky toys, even as they give away your position. You can drag and drop scissor-toothed, Blumhousey teddy bears to form a scissor-toothed, Blumhousey teddy bear's tea party. I'm hoping this element of whimsy will take priority over the stealth stuff, which feels quite routine, and possibly grating - you run away from things and hide under other things until the first things move on. The experience of inhabiting a small, pudgy body with zero dodge-roll capability obviously creates some suspense, but the monster designs are familiar from any number of Dead Silence clones, and so far, the game seems to hurl them at you in a familiar way.</p>
<p>The toddler is possibly the biggest monster of all. As you learn in the opening cinematic, he favours scary dolls over non-scary ones, and look, I just don't trust a two-year-old who knows how to accessorise a tricycle - it goes against Nature. There don't appear to be any grown-ups tangibly present in the world, which seems a shame, because as everybody knows, one of the most important functions of children in horror stories is traumatising their parents.</p>
<p>If mum and dad were still about in Baby Blue Nightmares, we could scare the hell out of them by handing over ghastly doodles of, oh, let's say Sam Fisher again. Mr Splinter doesn't like it when you laugh, Mommy! He gets <em>awful mad</em>, and when Mr Splinter gets mad, he does the splits over the kitchen door with his friend, Mrs Karambits.</p>
<p>The full version of Baby Blue Nightmares is out on 16th September - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836820/Baby_Blues_Nightmares__Toddler_Horror_Game/">download the prologue here</a>. It's the work of Steelkrill Studio, a solo developer who has a thing for horror setups with a twist - take <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2276850/The_Voidness__Lidar_Horror_Survival_Game/">The Voidless</a>, in which you must use a LIDAR device to see.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But choosing not to find all of these extra collectibles will stop you from revealing all of the secret levels and mean you miss out on a bunch of extra content.</p><p>If you want to collect everything in <em>Astro Bot</em> and complete its fun trophy list, you’ll be looking at closer to <strong>12 to 15 hours</strong>, depending on how much trouble you have with its most challenging levels.</p><h2 id="h93354"><a id=""></a><strong>How many levels are there in Astro Bot?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="146b20ae45bbd221fb20f04204ca871f" data-recommend-id="image://146b20ae45bbd221fb20f04204ca871f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro stands on a chimney above some houses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro stands on a chimney above some houses." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="146b20ae45bbd221fb20f04204ca871f" data-recommend-id="image://146b20ae45bbd221fb20f04204ca871f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro stands on a chimney above some houses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a whopping <strong>80 levels</strong> in <em>Astro Bot</em> across six galaxies. However, it’s important to note that they’re not all full-blown levels in the traditional sense—various smaller challenge levels breaking up the larger, more sizable planets. But despite their size, the challenge levels live up to that description, providing some of the game’s most difficult gauntlets and combat encounters. There’s something here for even the most seasoned platformer fans.</p><h2 id="h93355"><a id=""></a><strong>Can you customize Astro?</strong></h2><p><strong>Yes, you can customize how Astro looks!</strong> After collecting enough puzzle pieces, you’ll unlock a place in the game’s hub where you can change your outfit to look like various PlayStation icons. We won’t spoil them all here, but rest assured there’s likely to be one of your favorites included!</p><h2 id="h93356"><a id=""></a><strong>Does Astro Bot have New Game Plus?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="64650ff8bbd4b91da1ba48c436f21350" data-recommend-id="image://64650ff8bbd4b91da1ba48c436f21350" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro collects a golden egg atop a tower above some ruins and water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro collects a golden egg atop a tower above some ruins and water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="64650ff8bbd4b91da1ba48c436f21350" data-recommend-id="image://64650ff8bbd4b91da1ba48c436f21350" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro collects a golden egg atop a tower above some ruins and water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Astro Bot</em> does not have a NG+ mode at this time. That being said, you can replay levels as many times as you’d like, or you can start a new save file to experience the adventure all over again. And when there are so many hidden secrets, it’s worth returning.</p><h2 id="h93357"><a id=""></a><strong>What is Astro Bot’s trophy list like?</strong></h2><p>Trophy hunters will be excited to hear that <em>Astro Bot’s</em> trophy list is both manageable and fun to complete. There are no difficulty settings, but you will need to fully complete the game by finding every bot, puzzle piece, and secret exit. You’ll also need to complete a variety of random tasks in the game’s hub, usually requiring you to interact with specific characters (such as Kratos or Crash Bandicoot) in humorous ways. It’s all very fun and whimsical, making for an enjoyable path to its lovely Platinum trophy.</p><hr><p>So take your time! This isn’t a race, it’s a whimsical place of exploration and surprises. There’s a bunch of secrets to find, secret exits hidden all over, and puzzle pieces to hunt that unlock extras. Have fun!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Bethesda has put out more details about Starfield's first story expansion: Shattered Space. The frightful DLC  will add a new world, new craftable grenades, and new enemies to fight alongside a new set of story missions.</p><p>The DLC will take place on one new planet, Va'ruun'kai, but there will be over 50 new locations to explore there. The DLC appears to have a distinct cosmic horror flavor. As such, you'll encounter new horrific enemies called Redeemed/Vortex horrors. You'll be able to craft new "organic" grenades from material you find on Va'runn'kai. Other factions, such as Zealots, Spacers, and the Crimson Fleet, will also appear on the planet.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1832055921758867842" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Thank you to the millions of players who have made the Settled Systems their home and helped make this an incredible first year for <a href="https://twitter.com/StarfieldGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@StarfieldGame</a>.</p><p>We have much more coming, beginning with our first story expansion, Shattered Space, releasing September 30.

Before Shattered Space, the location of the cult's homeworld was unknown. In the base game, you got only flickers of what House Va'runn was up to, though Constellation member Andreja was a former cultist.</p><p>More news about the Shattered Space DLC will be arriving ahead of its September 30 release date. You can pre-order it now for $30 and it is included in the Starfield Premium Edition and the Premium Edition upgrade. In August, a free update added a moon-buggy-like vehicle: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-adds-vehicles-tonight-shattered-space-dlc-launches-in-september/1100-6525991/" data-ref-id="1100-6525991">the Rev-8</a>. The game simultaneously got performance upgrades like 60fps support on Xbox Series S. Back in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-massive-may-update-is-finally-here-check-out-the-patch-notes/1100-6523488/" data-ref-id="1100-6523488">the game got its biggest update to date</a>, adding more robust difficult settings, fixing a multitude of bugs and revamping the planet maps.</p>

		<p><em>The writing seemed to be on the wall for Concord the moment it launched, but it took just about everyone by surprise when Sony announced earlier this week that it would be formally shutting down the game just weeks after it launched. Furthermore, it wouldn't even be selling the game anymore, and started issuing refunds. We just haven't seen a flop and about-face at this scale...maybe ever?</em></p><p><em>But trying who to "blame" for Concord is tough. Game companies are in hot pursuit of establishing their own forever game, like Fortnite. It's a near impossible task, but the reward is fountain of money. Did Concord developer Firewalk simply make the video game Sony asked them to, as part of a misguided live service initiative? Or did Firewalk pitch Sony on their ability to make an inventive one of these types of games and missed the mark? It's probably some version of both, the truth of which we won't know until Jason Schreier tells us.</em></p><p><em>It's given us a lot to think about, though. We talked in-depth about Concord's implosion on this week's episode of Remap Radio, but Patrick and Rob found they still had more to work through about how all this happened and what's next.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Overwatch was not the first popular team-based game, but it did set a template many companies have chased since. Credit: Blizzard</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>When we were talking last week about <em>Concord </em>and how swiftly a live-service game can be labeled “dead on arrival”, I sure didn’t think Sony <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/447033/concord-ps5-pc-pulled-refunds-sony-firewalk?ref=remapradio.com"><u>would be turning out the lights</u></a> in just a few days. So that is a hero shooter that arrived August 23, and then by September 3rd it’s studio announced it was desliting the game, now by the sixth it is going offline entirely.</p><p>Now it’s premature to say that this is the end for <em>Concord</em>. The studio released <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the usual statement</u></a> about how they’re evaluating options and deciding on the best path forward, and I hope they manage to come up with a rework and a model for this game that enjoys some success. However, it’s also remarkable the speed at which this launch unraveled and how thoroughly Sony is not just halting it, but throwing the entire thing in reverse.</p><p>We spoke at length about how much harder the “live service” model is than major publishers thought. But I also wonder if the entire way these projects are conceived, developed, and brought to market is increasing the odds of a game launching straight into a death-spiral. After all, when we were talking about <em>Concord </em>we were arguing that once a game misses the mark this badly, players will avoid investing in it because they <em>know </em>it’s going to be abandoned and shut down as quickly as humanly possible. We didn’t imagine it would be anything like this fast, and I suppose Sony gets some credit for issuing refunds rather than slinking away from it in a year, but it also serves to demonstrate the core point: players know that publishers and developers are not going to stand behind these games.</p><p>Now maybe <em>Concord </em>is a unique case where the initial reaction was <em>so </em>indifferent that it was clear that nothing was going to save the game from having an unsustainably small player base that would never generate enough positive word-of-mouth to turn the game into being a small cult success. Sometimes a bomb is just a bomb.</p><p>But I also wonder to what degree live service games supported by major publishers can’t be affordably supported unless they come out of the gate as something approaching a hit. I don’t know what the budget for <em>Concord </em>was, nor do I know what amount of monthly spending is required to maintain Firewalk Studios staff and infrastructure (the “burn” rate of the studio). Just judging from how quickly <em>Concord </em>has been abandoned, it suggests that there’s no way for a publisher to wait out the long process of building the community and identity of a multiplayer game.</p><p>The thing is… how many games like this don’t need an exceedingly long runway? You could point to <em>Overwatch </em>and say that was an instant hit, but you could just as easily argue that it was capitalizing on the Blizzard brand (built over decades) and then occupying a genre space that people had come to understand thanks to, again, decades of <em>Team Fortress 2</em> and MOBAs. <em>Fortnite </em>had to be retooled to become a battle royale. <em>Apex Legends </em>might be an exception but even there… I’m not sure you can pretend it would have emerged fully formed had two <em>Titanfall </em>games not come and gone.</p><p>It takes a long time to get people on board with a new multiplayer-focused game. Way longer than the development cycle of a game. If it has truly new and distinctive ideas, it will take a while for people to warm up to those ideas and for them to be refined and made accessible and appealing to a broader audience. And if it’s an exercise on a genre that’s already popular, well, that just means not many people have a reason to play a new one.</p><p>Something that concerns me about this trend toward “grand opening, grand closing” live service launches is the way they suggest the people who hold the purse strings at studios fundamentally do not grasp this reality. Almost every major success they are pursuing is built on years of foundational work done in modding communities, or as part of a major ongoing franchise that predates the live-service era.</p><p>I suspect a lot of publishers dream of owning the next <em>Warframe </em>but let me tell you, I think every single major publisher would have abandoned <em>Warframe </em>in its infancy, or forced Digital Extremes to undergo debilitating cuts that would have made it impossible to grow and sustain the game.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Some of gaming's live service success stories come from the least likely places, like Warframe. Credit: Digital Extremes</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:<em> </em></strong>I know that Digital Extremes is largely known for <em>Warframe </em>these days, but in my mind, they’re actually the studio that helped Epic Games build <em>Unreal</em>. Seriously! They were co-developers on Unreal, Unreal Tournament—they were even co-developers on <em>Unreal Tournament 2004</em>, one of the GOATs. It’s also funny you break up <em>Warframe</em>, because <em>Warframe </em>itself was a free-to-play desperation play by Digital Extremes in the wake of the studio struggling to sign projects, which leveraged its messy 2008 action game <em>Dark Sector</em>. Digital Extremes was a shooter-focused company that’d been in the genre since 1993. Is it any wonder someone like Digital Extremes was able to, at some point, strike gold with that expertise?</p><p>What’s interesting about the <em>Concord </em>case is that it’s shocking to the world we’re most intimately familiar with, but absolutely standard practice in mobile games. In mobile, it’s called a “soft launch,” where a game is released in a select number of countries and nowhere else. If things go well, the game might launch elsewhere, country by country, until it’s “properly” released. But it’s also common for a game’s “soft launch” to be the only light of day a game sees before deletion. The modern free-to-play movement was born out of mobile, where competition is vicious, cruel, and unyielding. Those lessons haven’t been learned in AAA, or else I doubt Sony would’ve actually spent money on expensive motion capture for a game like Concord.</p><p>Supercell, one of the most popular mobile creators, <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/03/14/all-games-killed-by-supercell-everdale-hay-day-pop-clash-mini?ref=remapradio.com"><u>has canceled dozens of games that it’s “launched.”</u></a>&nbsp;</p><p>Is that <em>good</em>? Is that <em>sustainable</em>? I can’t speak to the specifics of mobile economics, but it’s likely only possible because the ecosystem of budgeting and staffing is built around aggressively accepting failure.</p>

The discount lasts until Monday, September 9, and the 2023 RPG is a whopping twenty percent off, bringing the price down from $59.99 to $47.99. If you’re at all a fan of RPGs, you’ll find something to love in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. The game, which takes place within the iconic <em>D&amp;D</em> setting that is the Forgotten Realms, is full of compelling characters, incredible writing, deep systems, and an unrivaled sense of player freedom. Seriously, if you even think you can do something, the game will likely give you a way to execute it. It’s also a worthwhile investment for how much time you’ll spend playing it, as just the main story will take you nearly 100 hours to complete, which doesn’t account for multiple playthroughs and all the wacky hijinks you can get up to between major narrative beats.</p><figure id="" data-id="8032a79b341a1cf73e1b7f2a2b8666a0" data-recommend-id="image://8032a79b341a1cf73e1b7f2a2b8666a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A party of adventurers stand outside a small cottage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A party of adventurers stand outside a small cottage" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8032a79b341a1cf73e1b7f2a2b8666a0" data-recommend-id="image://8032a79b341a1cf73e1b7f2a2b8666a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A party of adventurers stand outside a small cottage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And even if you do already own <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, there are other great Larian games on sale as well. Before <em>BG3</em>, the studio already had a reputation for creating wonderful RPG worlds with loads of deep, highly reactive systems. If you want to try these out you should go straight for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-2-the-kotaku-review-1818817232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-2-the-kotaku-review-1818817232"><em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em></a></span>, the game that immediately preceded <em>BG3</em>. Many will call <em>BG3 </em>Larian’s masterpiece but for my money, <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> represents the studio at their most inventive.<br></p><p>At first glance there isn’t much differentiating the two: they both have complex companion characters, expansive epic narratives, and interactive TTRPG-inspired systems. However, <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> has the advantage of not being based on the existing <em>D&amp;D</em> world and rule set, which allowed Larian to create a more compelling world of their own, both in terms of narrative and combat rules. Much like a TTRPG player may tell you <em>D&amp;D</em> isn’t the be-all, end-all of the medium, and in fact has a number of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/baldurs-gate-3-rpg-dungeons-dragons-5e-flaws&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/baldurs-gate-3-rpg-dungeons-dragons-5e-flaws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-running issues</a></span>, I’m here to argue that <em>BG3 </em>falls short in some ways, and that <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> outshines it<em> </em>because it lacks the drawbacks inherent to <em>D&amp;D</em>. If you want to see what Larian can do in a sandbox of its own, grab <em>Divinity: Original Sin II.</em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
