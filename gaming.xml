		<p>EA and Battlefield Studios have launched the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/14/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-but-theres-a-bonus-bit-of-season-1-to-fill-the-gap/">delayed</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> Season 2, bringing a new map, reams of new cosmetics and unlocks through the Battle Pass, and promise of limited-time events and match effects. </p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Season 2 Intro Cinematic" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_Ih_1bWR3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new map is a large scale battle set around a German airbase, catering to all combat sizes and the main game modes of Conquest, Breakthrough and Escalation, and featuring both land vehicles and helicopters. It’s another pleasing step towards the kind of large scale maps that were largely missing for Battlefield 6’s launch.</p>
<p>It’s the first of two maps that will be included in Battlefield Season 2, when fans have been clamouring for more variety. Why aren’t they making more, when that’s what people want?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r87tes/battlefield_studios_says_they_dont_have_the_time/">DICE’s Producer Alexia Christofi says</a> “In terms of cadence, we would love to create way more maps. But we’re just trying to kind of bring things to players as we can and as quickly as we can build them.”</p>
<p>They’re balancing map making with running limited time events, in other words. This will see a limited time mode added to multiplayer and REDSEC in season 2 with the VL-7 Strike meaning that psychoactive smoke will drop onto the map, forcing you to quickly put on a gas mask and manage your filters to avoid being affected. The battle royale map has been modified with smoke engulfing Fort Lyndon, and the Gauntlet mode has returned, also with this smoke affecting the fights.</p>


<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Battlefield 6 Update 1.2.1.0 and Season 2’s launch:</p>
<p><strong>New Map: Contaminated</strong></p>
<p>A large-scale European mountainside battlefield set around a strategic German airbase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports all combat sizes</li>
<li>Includes land vehicles and helicopters</li>
<li>Available across Conquest, Breakthrough, Escalation, Squad Death Match, and Strikepoint</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Limited-Time Modes</strong></p>
<p>Season 2 introduces a set of limited-time experiences built around VL-7, a new psychoactive smoke weapon spreading across multiple battlefields. As contaminated zones emerge, squads must adapt their tactics, manage masks and filters, and fight for control in increasingly hostile environments across multiplayer, Battle Royale, and Gauntlet.</p>
<p><strong>VL-7 Strike:</strong> A limited-time mode where the psychoactive smoke VL-7 spreads across select areas in multiplayer and REDSEC. Players must use masks and manage their filters carefully, as running out will leave them exposed to VL-7’s disorienting effects.</p>
<p><strong>Battle Royale – Synthesis:</strong> Smoke engulfs Fort Lyndon, transforming the battleground. Fight and loot within contaminated zones while securing masks and filters to survive the smoke’s effects.</p>
<p><strong>Gauntlet: Altered State:</strong> Gauntlet returns with a new twist. Squads compete in a knockout-style elimination format while navigating psychoactive smoke and racing to complete missions under pressure.</p>
<p><strong>New Vehicle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AH-6 Little Bird:</strong> The iconic attack helicopter returns for NATO forces, offering high mobility and lethal firepower in skilled hands.</li>

<li><strong>GRT-CPS:</strong> A semi-automatic designated marksman rifle designed for mid- to long-range engagements, featuring a high-capacity magazine for sustained fire.</li>
<li><strong>VCR-2:</strong> A short-range assault rifle with a rapid rate of fire, built for intense close-quarters combat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Gadgets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>9K38 IGLA:</strong> A lock-on, anti-air missile launcher that requires active guidance from engineers to stay on target. Provides&nbsp; superior missile maneuverability to adept users.</li>
<li><strong>HTI-Mk2:</strong> A short- to medium-range Recon device that can detect and reveal enemy gadgets, overload recon drones, and neutralise incoming rockets.</li>
<li><strong>Protective Mask:</strong> Essential equipment for contaminated zones, protecting players from psychoactive smoke. Additional filters can be acquired and equipped to extend protection time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Battle Pass &amp; Progression</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Season 2 Battle Pass:</strong> Instantly unlock 6 rewards and progress through 4 themed paths featuring new hardware, weapon packages, soldier skins, XP boosts, and more. Complete all paths to unlock the Ultimate Path.</li>
<li><strong>BF Pro:</strong> In addition to the regular Battle Pass, BF Pro includes 6 instant unlocks, 25 tier skips, BF Radio, Portal Server Hosting, and access to an exclusive bonus path with additional tactical rewards</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT</strong></p>
<p>As part of Update <a href="http://1.2.1.0/">1.2.1.0</a>, we’ve made improvements to both how recoil behaves at a system level and how recoil is used to balance automatic weapons.</p>
<p>Since launch, recoil compensation could feel inconsistent in certain situations. In some cases, the amount of aim input required to counter recoil did not reliably match the recoil being applied, which could make weapons feel harder to control than expected. While improvements were made during Season 1 to reduce the most extreme cases, some inconsistency could still be noticeable during regular gameplay. With this update, recoil compensation has been made fully consistent, ensuring that the aim input required to counter recoil now correctly matches the recoil applied. This results in more predictable and reliable weapon handling.</p>
<p>Separately from this systemic fix, we’ve also made a broad recoil tuning pass across automatic weapons. Recoil is one of the main ways we balance weapons across different engagement distances: higher-damage weapons are intentionally harder to control, while lighter weapons trade raw power for ease of use and consistency. Over time, we saw this balance starting to drift once we looked at how these weapons were actually being used in live matches across common combat ranges.</p>
<p>This tuning pass brings recoil behaviour back in line with each weapon’s intended role. You should expect automatic weapons to feel more consistent and better differentiated across ranges, with higher-impact weapons demanding more control and positioning, while others remain reliable and forgiving in closer engagements.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has flattened hope for a major <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> overhaul by stating that the long-awaited update in development "is not Starfield 2.0".</p>
<p>This, to recap, is the update the Starfield community has been speculating about for roughly a year, ever after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remember-starfield-bethesda-reassures-fans-it-has-exciting-things-planned-for-2025-as-wait-continues-for-news-on-whats-next">Bethesda assured players it had "a lot of exciting things planned"</a>. This was a comment made in the silence following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-review">the somewhat anticlimactic release of Starfield's major Shattered Space add-on</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">the Kinda Funny podcast</a> yesterday, Howard said: "Obviously we've been working on a lot of Starfield content [...] You've seen it and I can tell everyone we're going to be talking about it really soon. We're moving into a phase where we're ready to talk about Starfield and really show that in the right way and what's coming to the game. We've been doing a lot of work that we like a lot.</p>

"So for expectation-setting, it's the kind of thing where if you love Starfield, we think you're going to love this. It's updates and things that change the game, not in an isolated way, but [in a] sort of meta [way] - using outer space and things in ways that we haven't.</p>
<blockquote><em>"If Starfield is something that didn't connect with you right away [...] I don't think this is going to change that fundamentally"</em></blockquote>
<p>"But look, if Starfield is something that didn't connect with you right away, or you bounced off it or found it boring in places, I don't think this is going to change that fundamentally."</p>
<p>Podcast host Greg Miller later asked Howard whether the update was imminent, to which Howard replied: "It's soonish. I don't want to spoil the day but it is coming soon." Miller also asked whether the update was a final update for the game, a sort of bow-tying closure, to which Howard said no. "No, we're doing more Starfield stuff coming up - we've been laying that out. It's something we see continuing for a while."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-review">Starfield was released in 2023 to middling reviews</a>, leading to a general sense that it wasn't the post-Skyrim and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> homerun Bethesda had hoped to hit. But it still seems to have a healthy audience. In this interview, Howard referred to Starfield as a "Game Pass hours beast". "We have such a big audience on the game," he said.</p>

<p>Bethesda Game Studio's attention has more recently been on Fallout, following the launch of a second TV series that seemed to be received very well. I haven't finished it yet but Alex Donaldson was very positive, writing in an article that: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">Fallout Season 2 has made me excited for the future of the games - is there anything better a TV tie-in can do?</a>"</p>
<p>As far as game development goes, the majority of Bethesda Game Studios' 500-person workforce (Howard shared this number in the podcast) is concentrating on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">the sixth Elder Scrolls game</a>. (Note that BGS fairly openly uses external development partners - outsourcers - so the actual number of people working on its games is likely significantly higher). Howard referenced this new Elder Scrolls game in the podcast as well, explaining that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-majority-of-people-who-made-skyrim-are-still-here-bethesda-boss-on-why-the-elder-scrolls-6-will-be-more-like-skyrim-or-oblivion-than-starfield">The Elder Scrolls 6 marks a return to a more "classic" style of game for the studio</a> - think Skyrim or Oblivion - rather than the "creative detour" represented by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and Starfield.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“There’s Simply No Way Around Key Cards in Certain Respects” – FFVII Remake Dev Explains Why GKCs Were Necessary on Nintendo Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ffvii-remake-dev-explains-game-key-cards-nintendo-switch-2/</link>
            <guid>1440136</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>FFVII Remake Intergrade</strong> launched last month on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> (and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong>). Overall, it was a solid port, though <strong>the Xbox Series S version <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offers better texture quality than the Switch 2 version</a></strong>, despite having less RAM available.</p>



<p>However, Nintendo Switch 2 players have been slightly disappointed to see that <strong>FFVII Remake Intergrade is only available on Game Key Cards rather than regular cartridges</strong>. Game Key Cards were introduced with the new Nintendo console and offer a hybrid format: they are physical cards that users must insert into their console, but they don't actually contain any data. Instead, <strong>they serve only as proof of ownership and require users to download the game data to their console's storage</strong>. </p>



<p>Now, Automaton <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remakes-nintendo-switch-2-release-was-from-a-technical-standpoint-only-possible-with-game-key-cards-director-naoki-hamaguchi-explains-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was able to ask the question directly to Square Enix's Game Director</a>, <strong>Naoki Hamaguchi</strong>, who shared a very frank response: <strong>game key cards load roughly twice as fast as cartridges</strong>, so <strong>there was no other viable option for the game developers</strong>.</p>



<p><em>There’s simply no way around key cards in certain respects. If you compare loading directly from a game cartridge (containing all game data) to loading from the Nintendo Switch 2’s internal storage,<strong> the load speed difference is roughly double</strong>. Some have expressed concern that multiplatform development may impose constraints not only on graphics, but even on game design itself. However, this is precisely why we didn’t choose a cartridge.</em></p>



<p><em>Our game design isn’t built around loading all data upfront, with nothing further being loaded afterward. Even during gameplay, data is constantly swapped in and out, and given that premise, <strong>the loading speed from a game card would inevitably be insufficient</strong>, leading to stress for the player. In addition, with currently available cartridge capacity, <strong>there is the practical limitation that the full game data simply wouldn’t fit in the first place</strong>.</em></p>



<p><em>However, as long as we can secure the high-speed storage read speeds such as SSD or UFS (on Switch 2), the design we’re aiming for becomes achievable within the scope of optimization for each platform. For the third game in the trilogy, we’re proceeding with development with the goal of delivering a large-scale experience similar to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, so please rest assured on that point.</em></p>



<p><em>In the past, when faced with practical issues related to load speed and storage capacity we couldn’t resolve, we had to decide not to release on Nintendo systems. However, <strong>Nintendo Switch 2’s performance is impressive, and with a key card format like FFVII Remake, releasing the games became possible</strong>.</em></p>



<p>We've heard the same argument before from <strong>Ubisoft Massive</strong> when they <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-forced-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained why they chose Game Key Cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 version of <strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong></a>: <strong>the cartridges simply did not have the performance needed to run the game smoothly</strong>.</p>



<p>As for FFVII Remake, Hamaguchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-multiplatform-lower-quality-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this week</a>, as part of the Automaton interview, that <strong>switching to a full multiplatform strategy for Part 3 won't lead to lower quality visuals</strong> because they are targeting the best version (PC) and then scaling down, not the other way around. We should learn more about Part 3 in the coming months; stay tuned. </p>

            <p>"I mean, look, I think everybody knows why we announced it that way then." Stay calm, I've got to get my dinner first. "We know some things we're doing." Please stop trying to jump on the bench. "It's going to be a while yet." Some of these are things I often have to say to my cat when the clock ticks to within an hour of feeding time. Some of them are things Todd Howard has said about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> in his latest bout of interview chatter about the RPG. He's confirmed it's running on a new version of the Creation Engine, but will also be a return to Bethesda's "classic style".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I think in many ways <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> are a little bit of a creative detour from that classic Elder Scrolls, Fallout, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> or a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> or a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>, Oblivion, where you're exploring a world in a certain way," Todd the bod told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">Kinda Funny Games</a>. "As we come back to Elder Scrolls 6 that we're doing now, we're coming back to that classic style that we've missed, that we know really really well.</p>
<p>"We've spent the last, you know, several years bringing Creation Engine 2, which powers Starfield, up to Creation Engine 3. that's going to power Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond," he continued. "Obviously we do all the rendering things. We're really happy with the new stuff that we're doing, but also [in terms of] world systems loading, how we bring things into the world, how we get that detail close to the camera immediately." He added that there's also still "a lot of innovation to be done" in terms of making the game's world "feel like you are experiencing it for the first time" when you fire it up.</p>
<p>That last part I'm taking to mean that the game feels like a big leap compared to its predecessors and competition when you first fire it up, in the same way you could argue a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 did. What, I'd never seen horse balls rendered in such detail before, it was natural to feel a bit blown away. Describing Fallout 76 and Starfield as detours is also - fittingly - kinda funny, since it makes them sound a lot less like huge projects which have taken up the majority of the studio's past decade. There's also the fact plenty of folks view both games as navigational miscalculations which have sapped confidence in Bethesda's ability to not only do what they did best with games like Skyrim again, but to take that formula forwards in a fashion that can compete with today's top RPGs.</p><p>To be fair, The Elder Scrolls 6 ending up as a bit of a polarising game wouldn't be too out of step with its beloved predecessors. Skyrim's often criticised for having taken the simplifying of RPG elements too far in an undeniably successful pursuit of mass accessibility. Fallout 4 and Fallout 3 attract similar flak. Even Obsidian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> is viewed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-fallout-new-vegas">some people</a> - who are wrong - as overhyped and far too buggy. Basically what I'm saying is that not even a return to this "classic style" with some technical advancement under the bonnet may be enough not to leave TES VI an unquestionable return to form of Bethesda when it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-progressing-really-well-bethesda-shout-from-the-kitchen-as-they-baste-a-gta-shaped-turkey">comes out of the oven</a> in the year 3027.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is right around the corner, and there is a great demand for spoilers for the main story, so Insider Gaming can whet your appetite.</p>



<p>Releasing on February 27, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is the ninth mainline entry in the beloved series, putting players in control of Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy.</p>



<p>Anticipation is high for Resident Evil Requiem, but while some players are frantically trying to avoid every spoiler they can, others are actively seeking them out. If you’ve stumbled across this article, you’re probably in the latter group.</p>



<p><strong>Warning: This article contains a wealth of spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem. If you don’t want spoilers for the main story and the ending, check out some of the other articles you can read on Insider Gaming.</strong></p>







<h2 id="h-big-resident-evil-requiem-spoilers">Big Resident Evil Requiem Spoilers</h2>

<p><strong>This is the final warning before a slew of Resident Evil Requiem spoilers, so this is your last chance to look away!</strong></p>



<p>Alyssa Ashcroft’s fate is cleared up with a full death scene, showing she has been killed by Victor Gideon. As shown in the trailers, he is the main villain of the story, alongside Zeno, who is a clone of Wesker.</p>



<p>The set-up for future games is significant, however, as Spencer makes a return. It’s revealed that Grace is actually Spencer’s daughter. While not officially stated that Alyssa was forced to adopt Grace, it’s implied, and Alyssa was put in charge of Grace’s care after his death.</p>



<p>Despite Spencer’s previous death, it’s made clear he was pulling the strings throughout Requiem, and the release of the cure to the virus was all part of his masterplan.</p>



<p>For completionists, there are two unlockable outfits, one for each character, and 12 unlockable weapons to find.</p>



<p>The majority of the major leaks come from <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-spoiler-thread.1438951/page-13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dusk Golem on the ResetEra forums</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-9-ending-spoilers-explained">Resident Evil 9 Ending Spoilers, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Resident Evil 9 has two possible endings, based on your approach in-game, with a ‘good’ ending, which is canon, and a non-canon ‘bad’ ending.</strong></p>



<p>In the good ending, Elpis, a cure for the infection, is released, resulting in both Grace and Leon surviving. The bad ending, where Elpis is destroyed, leads to Leon’s death.</p>



<p>Crucially, the good ending that cures Leon of his infection leads to him de-ageing and becoming younger, following in the footsteps of Jill. In this ending, Victor Gideon kills Zeno, preventing him from killing Leon.</p>



<p>In the bad ending, Gideon doesn’t appear at the end, and Zeno explodes Leon’s head. However, he also dies as the platform where they are standing collapses.</p>



<p>As mentioned, the ‘bad’ ending with Leon’s death is not <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630">Capcom</a>‘s ‘canon’ ending, and thus leaves the door open for the character to return in future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon Company International is supposedly set to reveal the fourth English Mega Evolution set soon, as <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2026/02/chaos-rising-english-set-releasing-in-may" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked production schedules suggest that it will be called Chaos Rising</a> - rumored to be the Western release of Japan’s Ninja Spinner set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, Mega Greninja ex will be officially stepping into the spotlight for the next expansion. Here’s everything we know so far, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-full-release-schedule-2026">release date</a>, expected card lists, and when preorders should go live.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Pokémon TCG Chaos Rising Release Date</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Supposedly, Pokémon TCG's next Mega Evolution expansion, Chaos Rising, will release on May 22, 2026. According to the report at <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2026/02/chaos-rising-english-set-releasing-in-may" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Pokébeach</u></a>, this also means that pre-releases will take place from 9th to 17th May. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that if you attend a <a href="https://events.pokemon.com/EventLocator/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>local tournament</u></a> during this window, you can get an early access "Build &amp; Battle Box". This includes a 40-card ready-to-play deck and four Chaos Rising booster packs. This pre-release window would be the first time we’ll see Mega Greninja ex in the wild as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Chaos Rising Card List Expectations</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/ninjaspinner/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Serebii</u></a> claims that Ninja Spinner has 83 cards in its main set. While it still doesn’t have an official card list in Japan, we can guess, based on previous sets, it’ll have about 40 secret rares, totalling about 120 cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We expect the Ninja Spinner card list to be officially revealed in the next few weeks, which will give us a hint as to what we can expect in the Western release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do know that the set includes all the Kalos starter Pokémon - Chespin, Fennekin and Froakie. Unsurprising, given its cover star! </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What Impact Will This Have on Pokémon TCG's Meta?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mega_Greninja_ex_(Ninja_Spinner_22)" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese translation of Mega Greninja ex</u></a> from Bulbapedia talks about a "Mortal Shuriken" ability - “Once per turn, if this Pokémon is Active, you can discard a Water Energy to place 6 damage counters on any 1 of your opponent's Pokémon.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This pairs perfectly with its "Ninja Spinner" attack (120+ damage). The card states: “You may return a Water Energy from this Pokémon to your hand to do 80 more damage.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a total of 260 damage, including the 60 from its ability. Very ninja-like of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a little scared about the impact the rumored Supporter card <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/ninjaspinner/075.shtml" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>AZ’s Tranquility</u></a> will have on the meta. This card lets you switch your Active Pokémon and heal 80 damage - a potential life-saver for high-HP Mega Evolutions. It just so happens that Mega Greninja ex has 350 HP, making it one of the highest HP Pokémon cards ever released. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early rumors from the Japanese printing suggest the artwork features Greninja riding its own water shuriken. Considering the popularity of Greninja and its ridiculous stats, it wouldn’t surprise me to see this chase card reach $500+ on the secondary market.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>When Will Chaos Rising Preorders Go Live?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">At the moment, preorders for Chaos Rising are not available, as we're still waiting for an official announcement from The Pokémon Company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, once they are available, you’ll be able to find them in all your usual retailers - if you’re quick! We don’t expect these to stick around for long, especially at MSRP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re in the US, set your alerts for Pokémon Center US, Amazon, Target, Best Buy and Walmart. If you’re in the UK, keep your eyes on Pokémon Center UK, Smyths and Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also dedicated TCG resellers like TCGPlayer or Magic Madhouse, but, as third party sellers, we can’t predict the prices we’ll see. We expect to learn more information about Chaos Rising in the next few weeks, so check back to see the latest updates, and follow <a href="https://x.com/IGNDeals" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN Deals</u></a> for live stock information. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's Next for Pokemon TCG?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before Chaos Rising lands on May 22, there's plenty more for fans to get excited about. For starters, Pokémon’s 30th anniversary celebrations are on February 27, but you’ll be able to celebrate early as the commemorative <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-day-2026-tcg-collection-is-back-in-stock-with-a-major-new-discount-at-amazon">Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</a> dropped on January 30, alongside Ascended Heroes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced back in December 2025, this is a very small release with one confirmed card: a unique stamped foil promo card of Pikachu looking cute as standard, along with a logo’d metallic coin, and a trio of TCG booster packs from different sets. </p><div id="234519"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234519" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Available imagery seems to show the packs being a mixture of one Phantasmal Flames and two Mega Evolution, but we like to warn that the contents may always differ from unit to unit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon Day 2026 Collection is currently marked as “Coming Soon” at <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gXe2D?object_uuid=7113b5e0-d0f4-4eb6-8ce1-21915627ebe5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Best Buy</u></a>, but it can be bought now at <a href="https://zdcs.link/av8rDo?object_uuid=7113b5e0-d0f4-4eb6-8ce1-21915627ebe5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Amazon</u></a> for around $37, or from around $27 on <a href="https://zdcs.link/zE8lLG?object_uuid=7113b5e0-d0f4-4eb6-8ce1-21915627ebe5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGplayer</u></a> at current market rates.</p></div><p id="2026-release-calendar-at-a-glance"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="2026 Release Calendar – At a Glance"><strong>Pokémon TCG: 2026 Release Calendar – At a Glance</strong></h3></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QOjX3M?object_uuid=7113b5e0-d0f4-4eb6-8ce1-21915627ebe5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Ascended Heroes</strong></a> – Jan. 30, 2026 (Out Now)</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3OkEE?object_uuid=7113b5e0-d0f4-4eb6-8ce1-21915627ebe5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</strong></a> – Jan. 30, 2026 (Out Now)</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zE834X?object_uuid=7113b5e0-d0f4-4eb6-8ce1-21915627ebe5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Perfect Order</strong></a> – Mar. 27, 2026 (Preorders Live)</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX4DbW?object_uuid=7113b5e0-d0f4-4eb6-8ce1-21915627ebe5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Chaos Rising</strong></a> – May. 22, 2026</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking ahead, as Ascended Heroes has already set the foundation of what the Mega Evolution set’s expansions are going to look like, Perfect Order’s going to kick things up a notch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just announced earlier this year, and arriving on March 27, 2026, Perfect Order is going to be honing in on many of the Pokémon featured in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a"><u>Legends: Z-A game</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the cards announced from the 120-card set so far, we know we’re going to be seeing many of the game’s starring Mega Pokémon; Mega Zygarde ex, Mega Starmie ex, and Mega Clefable ex; but also some surprising extra additions like Meowth ex. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the moment, the only place to <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qd8YjK?object_uuid=7113b5e0-d0f4-4eb6-8ce1-21915627ebe5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder Perfect Order is via TCGplayer</a> and other resale markets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on celebrating Pokémon's 30th anniversary this year, I'd also highly recommend checking out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/time-magazine-is-celebrating-pokmons-30th-anniversary-with-three-exclusive-covers">TIME magazine exclusive celebration covers</a>, all of which feature in the top of the best seller Amazon charts this week, and can be bought for just <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB8Z5V?object_uuid=7113b5e0-d0f4-4eb6-8ce1-21915627ebe5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$14.99 each</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sara Heritage is a freelance contributor at IGN.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-next-mega-evolution-expansion-is-expected-to-be-called-chaos-rising-focusing-on-mega-greninja]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda boss Todd Howard has confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield"><u>Starfield</u></a> is <em>not</em> getting a huge 2.0-type update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/temper-expectations-bethesda-reportedly-prepping-starfield-improvements-though-suggestion-is-this-isnt-a-cyberpunk-20-scale-update">a cluster of Starfield fans said they'd gained an early glimpse at improvements coming to Bethesda's sci-fi role-player</a>. One saying they were "stoked" by what they saw, while another suggested they were "excited for the future of Starfield." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, another fan tempered expectation by stressing that the changes are relatively modest in scope, adding that this "probably isn't a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077"><u>Cyberpunk 2.0-scale update</u></a>," referencing the major additions that helped improved CD Projekt's RPG.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And now Howard, too, is dampening anticipation by similarly stressing this is "not Starfield 2.0."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously, we’ve been working on a lot of Starfield content. I can tell everybody we are going to be talking about [the new content] really soon,” Howard told <a href="https://youtu.be/sX4rKpB97L4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kinda Funny</u></a>, as transcribed by <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfields-next-big-update-isnt-a-2-0-reboot-its-for-people-who-already-love-the-game-2000670749" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a>. “We’re moving into a phase where we’re ready to talk about Starfield. And really show that in the right way, and what’s coming to the game. We’ve been doing a lot of work that we like a lot.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Howard added: "You know, I’ve seen some of that, so for expectation-setting, I think it’s the kind of thing where if you love Starfield, we think you’re going to love this. It’s updates and things that change the game, not in an isolated way, but sort of meta. Using outer space and things in ways that we haven’t."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, he also candidly stressed that ​​"if Starfield is something that didn’t connect with you right away, or you bounced off it, or found it boring in places, I don’t think this is going to change that fundamentally."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Howard was coy about timelines, he did say we may find out more "soonish."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-reportedly-set-for-ps5-release-during-spring-2026-alongside-new-expansion"><u>reported that Bethesda had delayed Starfield's second expansion</u></a> due to "weak sales" of its first, Shattered Space, which launched in September 2024 to a 'Mostly Negative' Steam user rating. Todd Howard had <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>previously talked of Starfield expansions releasing annually</u></a>.

            <p>Do you have a sense of deja vu? Because dataminers believe they've discovered more evidence that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> could be coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> - a sentence we've already typed out here at Eurogamer in the year 2026.</p>
<p>That's right, we're back on familiar ground following the release of a massive update for Capcom's latest action-RPG this week, in which the Japanese publisher unleashed a flood of new content into the game to tide us all over until the next big DLC drop comes (which we're apparently going to hear more about in the summer). </p>
<p>As part of this big, final update, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1r8c00w/tempered_gogmazios_and_zoh_shia_sw2_version/">sleuths digging through the game</a>'s newly-updated code think that they have unearthed more evidence that the game has a Switch 2 version in the works (hat tip, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fans-uncover-strongest-evidence-yet-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), in the form of a tutorial image depicting Switch 2 local multiplayer. The image was apparently hidden away in the files, and isn't supposed to be seen in any current front-end version of the game, but is nestled neatly in the update files. Uh-oh!
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>An images supposedly data-mined from the newest Monster Hunter Wilds patch. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Capcom</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This follows on from data strings found in the backend of Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 4, in which a group of Chinese dataminers believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-even-more-proof-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">they found references to a Switch 2 port</a>, including information about wireless multiplayer, graphical presets, and reportedly "300 detailed parameters across four platforms: PS5, PC, Xbox Series, and Switch 2".
</p><p>The latest Wilds update, though, removed these older text strings. The lord giveth, the lord taketh away, it seems. At least we know from these earlier leaks that a potential Switch 2 version of Wilds will contain "a shadow quality preset for the Switch 2's docked 'Graphics Mode' that is higher than the PC's 'Very Low' preset" and that, in docked mode, the "'Graphics Mode' outputs at 1080p". Given the performance issues Wilds has suffered on PC to date, that's pretty impressive. If it works.</p>
<p>Right now, there's no formal word from Capcom that the game could be making the jump to Switch 2, but Capcom has long been a supporter of Nintendo's platform: we're even getting Resident Evil Requiem at launch on the handheld, and that runs on the same engine as Monster Hunter Wilds, so... stranger things have happened.</p>
<p>It'll be nice for Monster Hunter Wilds to have <em>a bit of a win</em>: since it launched in February 2025, the game suffered <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">review bombing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">under-performing sales with a fall-off post-launch</a>, and even contributed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">a dip in Capcom's share price</a>. Here's hoping that, with a second bite of the apple, Monster Hunter Wilds can rehabilitate its image to some degree.</p>

            <p>Bungie is uploading four tracks from the Marathon official sound track to major music streaming platforms later today, in the build-up to the game's launch on the 5th March.</p>
<p>These tracks are Rhythm of Writhing Constellations, Focused Erasures and Sub-Routine Resets, We Stole a Moon, and Code Race [Extended]. Alongside this announcement, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2024295371095363688">a 20 second snippet of one of the songs was uploaded to X</a>.</p>
<p>The soundtrack, composed by Ryan Lott of Son Lux, has been sprinkled throughout pre-release trailers for the game. It's already garnered attention from fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-there-such-a-bustling-community-around-marathons-soundtrack-when-the-game-isnt-even-out-yet-one-producer-tells-us-why">who have begun making remixes of their own</a> in preparation for the full release.</p>
<p>Marathon,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too"> which is due to host a server slam public test in later February</a>, seems to be well-positioned for its launch. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">soared to the top of Steam's Top Sellers page</a> when pre-orders were made available, and it got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">a new trailer during this month's Sony State of Play</a>. Those picking it up on PlayStation will be able to unlock a selection of PlayStation charms, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too">though similar cosmetics will be available on PC and Xbox</a>.</p><p>This, after a rough patch of stumbles for the game. Bungie had to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">overhaul many aspects of the gameplay</a> following the mixed reception to a previous closed play test, and visually the game came under fire <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-plagiarism-scandal-resolved-satisfaction-of-artist">after it was discovered plagiarised art assets were present</a> in an earlier version of the game.</p>
<p>Are you excited for the Marathon soundtrack?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Christopher Judge (Kratos) briefly talks about God of War remakes and his next game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/19/christopher-judge-kratos-god-of-war-remakes-next-game/</link>
            <guid>1440109</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Christopher Judge, the actor who has played Kratos in the most recent God of War games, seems to have leaked information about both the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war/">God of War</a> remakes, and whatever Sony Santa Monica are working on.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://streamable.com/baiuju"> video</a> seems to show him confirming something we already knew, that TC Carson will be returning to the role of Kratos in the remakes, but he also adds that there will be “new technology and new fighting systems”.</p>


<p>He then goes on to say that “then you will be hearing what we’re doing probably late summer”.&nbsp; He does not specifically say that it’s a new God of War game, but the “we” he refers to is presumably Sony Santa Monica, who have not released a game since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/">God of War Ragnarok</a> in 2022.</p>
<p>The video is now longer on the YouTube channel it seems to have been ripped from, and it really does not look like AI, but you can never be 100% sure these days.</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War Trilogy Remake - Announcement Teaser | PS5 Games" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_tq12WisX8?feature=oembed" width="780" height="439" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>In God of War (2005), Kratos serves Ares, the God of War, after pledging himself in desperation during battle. Manipulated by Ares into slaughtering his own wife and daughter, he eventualy ends up killin Ares and taking the title for himself.</p>

<p>The second game has Kratos stripped of all his powers by Zeus, killed, and banished to the underworld. He eventually teams up with the Titans, rewinds time and attacks Mount Olympus. Clearly not learning his lesson from the first time, Zeus then kills him again in the third game.</p>
<p>Judge will not be playing Kratos in the upcoming Amazon TV show, that honour goes to Ryan Hurst&nbsp; who has previously voiced Thor in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/">God of War Ragnarok.&nbsp;</a>Ryan Hurst is best known for playing Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy and will be seen on the big screen later this year in Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey.</p>
<p>The show has had two seasons ordered before the first scene has been filmed, with pre-production currently underway. The series will be skipping the Greek games and beginning in Norse mythology, but one would assume they are going to have explain why Kratos is covered in white ash and has giant chains wrapped around his forearms.</p>

            <p>It feels like we've heard a lot about Bethesda's mysterious, upcoming RPG, The Elder Scrolls 6, lately. The publisher has been very tight-lipped about the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-todd-howard-and-team-have-settled-on-a-region-for-the-elder-scrolls-6">which we first started hearing about in 2018</a>, for the past eight years. We once got a title card, and that's about it. It was only recently we started learning more litle nuggets of information about the game after Bethesda's long silence on the project - whether it's how an old designer thought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-could-have-been-like-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back">it was going to be like The Empire Strikes Back</a>, or how Bethesda boss man <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">Todd Howard wishes development "went a little faster"</a>, we've heard more in the past few months than the past few years combined.</p>
<p>Not wanting to disappoint us with this relatively break-neck dripfeed of information, Bethesda director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has given a surprisingly candid interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">KindaFunny</a>. The veteran Bethesda creative gives us a few interesting tidbits, noting that he wishes the team didn't reveal the game so early - not for the first time - and that after a meandering "creative detour" in the form of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, the team is looking back to its classic formula for The Elder Scrolls 6.</p>
<p>"We do have a certain style that we like and that our fans like that we want to get better and better at," Howard said in the interview. "I think in some ways Fallout 76 and Starfield are a little bit of a creative detour from that classic Elder Scrolls, Fallout, a Skyrim or a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> or a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>, Oblivion, where you're exploring a world in a certain way. And as we come back to Elder Scrolls 6 that we're doing now, we're coming back to that classic style that we've missed, that we know really really well."
</p>
<p>If you were dubious about the capabilities of the engine that powered Starfield living up to current-gen expectations, fret not: Howard also noted that Bethesda has been deep in research and development over the past few years, and the resulting Creation Engine 3 is a marked step up from the Creation Engine 2 that powered 2023's divisive space-faring RPG. The Creation Engine 3 will be the bast for "Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond." (Let's all agree nobody's to say "Fallout 5" yet.)
</p><p>Finally, if you need a bit of confidence in the team working on The Elder SCrolls 6, Howard teases "the majority of people who made Skyrim are still here," alongside a wave of new talent in the studio, too. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">The game is still a long way off,</a> though, so don't get too excited about that just yet. Even if some fans think we're going to get some sort of teaser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-bethesda-just-drop-an-elder-scrolls-6-2027-release-date-tease-fans-think-so">sooner, rather than later</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[God of War Trilogy Remake Will Feature New Combat System, Says Christopher Judge; Cory Barlog’s Game to Be Revealed in Late Summer]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-trilogy-remake-new-combat-system-cory-barlog-game-late-summer/</link>
            <guid>1440094</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The news that <strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is working on a <strong>God of War Trilogy remake</strong></a> certainly hyped fans, though it will likely be a long while until we get new information from the developer. </p>



<p>Thankfully, actor <strong>Christopher Judge</strong>, who plays <strong>Kratos</strong> in 2018's God of War and 2022's God of War Ragnarök, has kindly shared a few details <a href="https://streamable.com/baiuju" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while speaking to YouTuber Fuzhpuzy</a> at Fan Expo Vancouver this past weekend.</p>



<p>When asked if he would be featured in the God of War Trilogy remake, he predictably replied no, adding that the original actor who played Kratos in those games, <strong>TC Carson</strong>, would reprise the role. That part had already been clarified from the studio, but Judge went on to say that, while not a reboot, <strong>the remakes would feature new technology and a new fighting system</strong>.</p>



<p>Judge also seemingly teased <strong>the reveal of Cory Barlog's next game</strong>:</p>



<p><em>And then you'll be hearing about what we're doing, probably in late Summer.</em></p>



<p>This info lines up perfectly with what two major insiders, <strong>NatetheHate</strong> and <strong>Shinobi602</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-creators-next-game-targeting-2027-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have just shared a few days ago</a>: Sony Santa Monica's next title, directed by Cory Barlog, will be revealed in the Summer for a targeted 2027 launch.</p>



<p>Given that Christopher Judge mentioned late Summer, we can probably exclude Summer Game Fest. Potential candidates include <strong>Gamescom</strong> and <strong>PAX Prime</strong>, although the most likely scenario remains <strong>a dedicated State of Play</strong>.</p>



<p>As for what it's going to be, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-60#post-151517563" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to another insider</a>, Ashhong from the ResetEra board (who was legitimized by Bloomberg's <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>), <strong>this won't be another God of War entry</strong>. However, if you've been following the rumors on Cory Barlog's next game, this shouldn't surprise you; Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported last year</a> that while not based on a new franchise, it would "feel like it", and that definition certainly does not fit the God of War IP.</p>

<p>A new post teases a focus on Generation 9 for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s next set. </p>



<p>We learned something about Pokémon TCG Pocket recently, with the devs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-has-no-plans-for-tcg-pocket-to-become-a-major-competitive-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirming to Insider Gaming</a> that there are no immediate plans for it to become a competitive game and that it will remain a side event at tournaments. Sticking to their guns, the developers have now teased the next set for the title. </p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-s-next-set-may-focus-on-gen-9">Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Next Set May Focus on Gen 9</h2>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/2024197224645660880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) of Pokémon TCG Pocket has posted a new video teasing Gen 9 for the next set. The video features people in costumes of the Gen 9 starters, including Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. Towards the end of the video, we are flashed with a date and time, February 19, 14:00 UTC. Many players in the comments section are theorising what this tease could be, while others are asking for other upgrades and features.  </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gen 9 Pokémon are primarily found in the Paldea Region, which was introduced in Scarlet and Violet. TCG Pocket currently features some Gen 9 Pokémon with a line for Sprigatito. However, we are yet to receive the Fuecoco and Quaxly lines. Players will have to wait for the official announcement to know for sure what this tease means for the game. </p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/19/interview-a-whole-new-style-of-horror-beckons-in-abide-from-the-team-behind-judero/</link>
            <guid>1440076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The stop-motion aesthetics of previous games by two-man dev team Talha and Jack have always been uniquely striking, with 2024’s Judero being the title that really gained critics’ and players’ attention. Judero’s take on Scottish folklore combined the handcrafted art of Jack King-Spooner with the coding prowess of Talha Kaya to produce a title that was brimming with humour and style. The duo followed this up with the fun mining game, Mashina, last year, and are now back with a Kickstarter campaign for a surreal and disturbing horror game called Abide. I had the opportunity to sit down and share a virtual coffee and conversation with the pair to find out more.</p>
<p><iframe title="ABIDE KickStarter Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtqJPwQ4fvg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>TSA – Thanks for talking to us. I’m not used to these virtual interviews, but how are you doing?</strong></p>


<p><strong>Talha – </strong>Good, good, very excited, very anxious (all of the things) about our new game.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – How is the Kickstarter going so far?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jack – </strong>It’s tracking very closely with the timelimit. Midway point we were midway, and now 64% through we’re 64% funded so it’s going to be tight. It’s different every time; there tends to be a slight flurry towards the end as people who have wishlisted it will get notifications towards the end ‘hey this is finishing’, but it’s not something I want to bank on or anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Is the Kickstarter an all or nothing situation for the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>It’s all or nothing basically. The other options are work on it part-time and get a zero-hour contract job or try getting a publisher but there’s a whole kind of smorgasbord of things that go along with that and a lot of publishers would just not consider this kind of game at all.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – That’s the problem with being actually original in a way. Also some of the more challenging aspects of the game given the current climate with titles like Horses and Vile: Exhumed</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>Yeah, with both of those games it’s kind of baffling that they should be deplatformed from marketplaces.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – What’s your background interest in horror, Jack? I see your dissertation was on extreme horror?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>It was on Kristeva’s idea of the abject and how it ties to visual media and also lots of Lacanian writing about the cinema screen.</p><p>
[Jack and I went on for quite a while about these psycho-analytical approaches to horror which I’ll spare you here!]
</p><p>I’ve always had this thing about storytelling and horror and what that says about the present culture and how it can be seen in retrospect. Violence was so in vogue with things like Saw and Hostel.&nbsp; Does this media desensitise you? Are people trying to be desensitised?</p>

<p><strong>TSA – That all tracks with the tangible nature of your art and games. It’s uncanny as it’s very unreal but also uses real handmade materials. With Judero I’m constantly moving between appreciating the beauty of the models and being repulsed by some of the more grotesque aspects. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Kickstarter highlights that you’ve consulted with clinical therapists to make sure that the difficult topics you’re including are treated correctly. This speaks to wanting to engage with horror more deeply rather than use it just as an aesthetic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>I think this is a conversation to be had, an aspect of shock is the unexpected but there’s another type of shock that Abide is about, like the splash of cold water. The horror of the truth which is getting parsed through some of the conversations I’m having with psychologists who have worked with offenders and people who have been in controversial situations. Sometime being honest to these things can amplify the horror.</p><p>
[Jack and I now went on another long tangent about the history of psychology…]
</p><p>Lots of horror is just big men with knives are scary – oooh but one of the ways that Abide feels so fresh is that it has a really strong metatext that is coming through as I’m researching it and writing it.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – It’s interesting to hear that you’re digging deeper than the basic jumpscare tropes of so much horror gaming.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>I wouldn’t dismiss the importance of jumpscares though. They are an important tool and can be really interesting in the way they build up with the music and atmosphere etc.</p>
<p><strong>Talha – </strong>When it comes to the whole mechanical game design of a horror game there is a lot of stuff that is very animalistic. This whole conversation is making me think that when there is an intellectual base to it than that jumpscare can have more meaning behind it. But when you’re making the game it is just a tool, to keep the player entertained.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;TSA –</strong> <strong>I’m interested in your creative process. Do you make the models etc first or do you have the game outline in mind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack – </strong>The game idea comes first and then the artstyle doesn’t necessarily make the game better or worse, it’s just the artstyle. There’s an interpretable element to the art – I mean, with a horror game it’s really fun to make it out of dolls because that’s a trope. Spooky dolls. When you’re making it, everything kind of feeds into itself and becomes part of the creative practice.</p>
<p><strong>Talha – </strong>It is trickier to prototype this game because you already need a really well made and decorated house and you need the characters so there is a huge time budget for art and assets.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – This has been a fascinating and wide-ranging conversation. Thank you both for taking the time to talk to me about all of this. Good luck with the Kickstarter and I can’t wait to get hands on with Abide!</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637042083/abide?ref=discovery&amp;term=abide&amp;total_hits=72&amp;category_id=35">Kickstarter for Abide</a> runs until the 28<sup>th</sup> February with digital copies of the game being available from the £12 pledge. Speaking to Jack and Talha highlights to me just how crucial these kinds of genuine artistic approaches to gaming and horror are in a world that is becoming increasingly commodified and handed over to Generative AI. I would urge you to check out the Kickstarter and pledge if you are able.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite players across the world are locked out of the game on February 19 as Epic Games deploys the latest update to the title, meaning players are impatiently waiting for the Fortnite servers to return.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/epic-games/" id="87655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games</a> drops consistent updates to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battle-royale/" id="127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth seeing maintenance take place every few weeks, on average, and the latest update is expected to be the penultimate drop before Fortnite transitions into Chapter 7 Season 2 next month.</p>



<p>For all the details on when to expect Fortnite servers to be back up and everything coming in the February 19 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New additions. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite servers are down for several hours for the February 19 update, with no set time for a return. However, previous updates offer an indication of how long players need to wait.</strong></p>



<p>Mid-season updates to Fortnite typically result in downtime lasting for three to four hours, so Fortnite servers should be back online after the v39.50 update somewhere between 2 AM PT and 2 AM ET.</p>



<p>However, the exact duration of the downtime is variable, and it can be significantly longer if issues are discovered or if there is a larger patch to deploy.</p>



<p>Don’t worry, though, downtime definitely won’t be as long as The Blackout in 2019, where the game was completely unavailable for two days.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-february-19-update">What’s In The Fortnite February 19 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The major addition to Fortnite in the February 19 update is the start of the Lantern Fest event and new map in Reload, coinciding with the Chinese New Year.</strong></p>



<p>The new Reload map features teams of up to eight players, and the ranks for Reload will also be reset. Alongside these drops, expectr new cosmetic items and rewards to be distributed during the Lantern Fest.</p>



<p>Additional collabs are also on the horizon, with the expected debut of Solo Leveling, alongside further details on the upcoming Honkai: Star Rail and Looney Tunes collabs.</p>



<p>In the main Battle Royale, the return of the Delorean has already been revealed, and there should be a slew of details ahead of the imminent return of The Seven. Additionally, expect further hints on what to expect when Chapter 7 Season 2 kicks off next month.</p>

What you once knew as the International Space Station is now the International Space Port—a gateway for aliens coming to Earth. Crushed by a massive, unexplained debt, you’re forced into a job you never asked for: Chief Xeno Inspector.</p><p>Seems simple enough, just wave in the friendly aliens and turn away the dangerous ones. However, make the wrong call and Earth could be destroyed. No pressure though, right?</p><p><strong>The Year 2206</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Problems left unresolved in the 21st century have spiraled out of humanity’s control. Earth now seeks help from technologically advanced aliens to solve these crises. On the very day you awaken, diplomatic relations with other planets officially begin.</p><p>Aliens enter under many pretenses: tourism, studies, and more. But their claims are not always what they seem. As an Chief Xeno Inspector, you must see through their deception and uncover their true intentions.</p><p><strong>Chief Xeno Inspector’s Daily Routine</strong></p><p>Your work begins by checking the news. Then, you must interview the aliens and decide whether to grant or deny them entry. Fulfill your duties, repay your debt, and aim to one day set foot on Earth again yourself.</p><p>Whether Earth still exists by then… depends entirely on you.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1027691"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>System Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Group-Based Screening</strong> – Examine a group of up to eight aliens.

They lack any sense of social filters and are incapable of lying.

<p>Bandai Namco's fighting game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</a> made its way across to the Switch and Switch 2 late last year, and this week, it receives a new update for these platforms.</p>
<p>The Japanese company has outlined what to expect on its official website. This update includes multiple changes and adjustments to game modes - starting with a new "limited-time mode" called Extreme Warrior Attack. In this mode, players will battle characters with "significantly increased strength".</p>
<p>Apart from this, in the "Battle Together" Versus mode, all stages can now be selected. Just make sure you're playing on Switch 2 to access this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>All stages become selectable only when either the Nintendo Switch™ 2 version or the Nintendo Switch™ version is played on a Nintendo Switch™ 2 console with the update data applied.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also some other changes and adjustments in this update. This includes new selectable scenarios, cut scenes, and text options in the Custom Battle mode. And last, but not least, Bandai Namco says this update has apparently "improved usability and overall system stability" when playing on Nintendo's platforms.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, a new "major" DLC for Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO was announced last month. It will add more playable characters, new stages, and a new single-player mode. More details about the Switch 2 and Switch versions of this DLC (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/bandai-namco-announces-new-dragon-ball-game-project-age-1000">and other planned content</a>) will be shared in the future. For now, here's a look, and below this is the roadmap for 2026, outlining what else is on the way.</p>

<h2 id="block-e2995432-719e-4ed6-8fad-a1db37670203">How To Play Strands</h2>



<p id="block-da980997-0420-4527-946e-b66c49bf3d07">Strands is a daily word search that challenges you to find words with a common theme. There’s also a Spanagram that reveals the deeper theme behind the words.</p>



<ul id="block-d0bea02d-4b9f-4991-b9db-3b35778ff3bf">
<li>Words that are three letters and under do not count.</li>



<li>Words that reveal the correct theme appear in blue.</li>



<li>The Spanagram turns yellow when found.</li>



<li>Finding three words that don’t fit the theme will reveal a hint to help you find the proper words.</li>
</ul>



<p id="block-5e597b53-af1c-4c06-a00c-6c5a4694e9e0">The goal is to string together as many words as possible. Every letter on the grid gets used! Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>



<p id="block-cd7aaa7f-9491-4ad0-b994-72d0102c5bed">Strands can only be played on the New York Times website. You can also play on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NYT Games app.</a></p>

Tracy Bennett serves as the puzzle editor for Strands, overseeing the creation and curation of daily puzzles since its launch.</p>

<p>Bethesda has surprised <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> fans on the Switch 2 this week with a new update, which adds a "60Hz mode" and allows players to prioritise either the game's visuals or performance. The frame rate has also been locked to 30Hz in the visual mode, and the patch improves other aspects, such as the FPS performance drops in certain areas of the game.</p>
<p>The tech comparison <a href="https://youtu.be/Op5s6dTuod4">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> has now taken a look at Update 1.2 - sharing a side-by-side video of the visual mode running alongside the game's performance mode. In some scenes, it's also shared footage of the existing update (Version 1.1, which was limited to 30fps).</p>
<p>While it might not look quite as impressive as it does in the visual mode, as you can see, the performance mode makes the experience smoother. According to this same video comparison, the game aims for 60fps in this mode, and while there is a solid frame rate in some segments, it can also be seen slightly dipping from time to time.</p>

<p>In terms of the compromises in performance mode, there appears to be less detail in terms of shadows and foliage. Other more noticeable things include more pop-in. Still, if you haven't already tried out this mode, it is worth a look, and might just end up being the mode you prefer playing on.</p>
<p>If you're still not sure if now is a good time to revisit (or jump into this title) on the Switch 2, we've shared our own <a href="https://youtu.be/0oU8yjp-m2Y">comparison video on Nintendo Life</a>, which you can see in our previous story covering the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/bethesda-releases-skyrim-update-1-2-for-switch-2-includes-60hz-mode-and-much-more">patch notes for Skyrim's Update 1.2</a> (or just scroll down).</p>

<p>It addresses multiple issues and makes some adjustments on both the Switch and Switch 2. There are also some updates specific to the Switch 2 version of the game. This includes an issue with clouds that's now been resolved, and also an update to the controller vibration intensity.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Version 3.0.1 (18th February 2026)</h3>
<h4>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch:</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where the game would run slower than normal after exiting the island hotel to an outdoor area.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where, when asking Resetti to clean up the island, fences that were put away or in storage could change into different customizations or be duplicated, and some cleaned-up items could disappear.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where Timmy and Tommy would sometimes stop following the player inside Nook’s Cranny.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where items could pop out of a rock before the shovel made contact when hitting it.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where, after playing with another player on a slumber island, home remodeling or relocation could become unavailable on the slumber island.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where the Camera app installation sequence could play when redeeming the Island Designer license at Nook Stop.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where some items were displayed in incorrect positions in the catalog used for photo studios and hotel decorating.</em></li>
<li><em>Other adjustments and corrections were made to improve the game play experience.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</h4>

</ul>

<p>Once again, this follows the release of the Switch 2 Edition last month. If you haven't already got it, it's a paid upgrade for existing Animal Crossing Switch owners. Here's a sample of what we had to say about it in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Life review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is perfectly fine. It makes things a bit prettier, has a few more options to take advantage of the console’s new features, but all in all, it’s not an especially exciting upgrade."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was also a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/animal-crossing-new-horizons-free-3-0-update-2026-and-nintendo-switch-2-edition-everything-included">free 3.0 update</a> released alongside the Switch 2 release, which added new content and features to both versions of the game.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo also updated the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> this week.</p>

<p>The game's creator has also provided an update on the European and Japanese release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>. These locations will apparently receive the game and upgrade on their respective eShops in "a few weeks". The bug fix patch above will also be included.</p>

<p>If you are eager to jump into the Switch 2 Edition right now but aren't located in North America, you can still access the free Switch 2 upgrade for the Switch version from the US eShop. You'll just need a Nintendo account for this region.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/destiny-2/" id="52052">Destiny 2</a>’s next major update has been officially delayed until June 9, 2026.</p>



<p>Destiny 2: Shadow and Order will not be released at the expected time. The game’s development team announced the delay on social media. They explained that the delay is due to “large revisions” and sizable quality-of-life updates.</p>



<p>It was noted that additional details would be disclosed closer to the release, including the previously announced weapons-tier upgrade and other updates. </p>



<p>It was also stated that routine fixes and stability improvements will continue throughout June. There will also be continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games in March, and the return of a more frequent Iron Bar Cadence in April.</p>



<p>The team has also clarified that they will continue to provide updates on live game content, community activations, and general news on their social media channels.</p>

<h2 id="h-destiny-2-shadow-and-order-delay-was-previously-rumored">Destiny 2: Shadow and Order Delay Was Previously Rumored</h2>



<p>In January, it was reported that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-shadow-and-order-has-reportedly-been-delayed/" id="170645">expected to be delayed</a> to avoid interfering with the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99">Bungie’s </a>Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Speaking of Marathon, there will be crossovers between the two games. Pre-ordering Bungie’s new game rewards Destiny players with new cosmetics, Sparrows, and Ships. There are also new shaders, emotes, and more to celebrate the upcoming release.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to provide updates on the forthcoming DLC closer to release.</p>







<p>For more on the Marathon, see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/limited-edition-marathon-dualsense-and-headset-revealed/" id="170619">the limited-edition PS5 DualSense controller</a> being sold to promote the game.</p>

With all that remained of <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>playhighguard.com</u></a> being a “site unavailable” message and social media links, many believed the full experience, which launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S just weeks ago, would soon be taken offline for good.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As concerns that Highguard could soon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">go the way of Concord</a> boiled, Wildlight finally stepped in (via <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2024081430674800915?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CharlieIntel</u></a>). Discord server admin and moderator WL_Coronach replied to one fan’s question about the website’s status earlier today, assuring them and others it would eventually come back online – even if it’s currently a “low priority” issue. Instead, the developer has put most of its focus on “updates and content.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not sure on the timeframe, but basically needs to be transferred and simplified,” the full message says. “Low priority [at the moment] ( reputational damage already done ).

While an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-episode-2-is-here-with-a-new-warden-map-ranked-mode-and-more"><u>early February content update</u></a> proved that work on post-launch features was indeed underway, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-studio-wildlight-hit-with-layoffs"><u>layoffs</u></a> affecting much of the studio’s staff immediately called both its future, as well as the future of its new game, into question.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Wildlight facing drastic changes in the last week alone, it’s unclear what a new Highguard update would look like. Still, those who have stuck by the free-to-play game seem to be satisfied with any additional content at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once we lock in the patch date I’ll see if we can get a patch preview up for you guys a bit beforehand,” WL_Coronach added in a follow-up reply.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Highguard Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-highguard-developer-reflects-on-disastrous-announcement-and-launch-we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-1"><u>Highguard’s woes</u></a> began the moment Geoff Keighley showed it as the one-last-thing announcement at The Game Awards 2025.

Here's the full quote from Howard:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We do have a certain style that we like and that our fans like that we want to get better and better at. I think in some ways Fallout 76 and Starfield are a little bit of a creative detour from that classic Elder Scrolls, Fallout, a Skyrim or a Fallout 3 or a Fallout 4, Oblivion, where you're exploring a world in a certain way. And as we come back to Elder Scrolls 6 that we're doing now, we're coming back to that classic style that we've missed, that we know really really well."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Howard goes on, confirming that the studio has spent the last several years improving on Creation Engine 2, which is the game engine behind Starfield, and bringing it up to Creation Engine 3, which will power "Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the interview, he adds that "the majority of people who made Skyrim are still here," while new faces have also joined the studio, bringing experiences from other studios to lend to The Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a long, agonizing wait for The Elder Scrolls 6 since it was first announced – wow, okay, <em>almost eight years ago.</em> It has in fact been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced">longer between the announcement and now</a> than it was between The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and the announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6. Howard has warned eager fans as recently as last November that the game is "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop">still a long way off</a>" and has even teased that he may just shadow drop it, something he alluded to again today with KindaFunny. He reiterated today that "it's gonna be a while yet," and confirmed that, "We're able to play it, we're about to pass a big milestone internally, the majority of the studio is on the game and some of our partners."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Howard also claims all this waiting is necessary for the game to be great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What do fans really want?” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-dev-says-were-going-to-take-our-time-and-as-long-as-it-needs-to-be-great-points-to-gta-6-delay-as-the-smartest-thing-they-could-do">he said in December of last year</a>. “Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That’s what I think people are going to want. So, we’re going to take our time and as long as it needs to be great.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bungie have announced that their next large update to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>,&nbsp; titled Shadow and Order, has been delayed.<br>
<em><br>
“Our next Major Update, Destiny 2: Shadow and Order, is undergoing large revisions and will be delayed. This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed. This update will now launch on June 9, 2026. </em></p>
<p><em>We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more. Through June, we will continue to have routine bug fixes and stability improvements, continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games (March), and the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence</em></p>


<p><em>In terms of communications, we will be focusing on providing you with updates about our live game content, community activations, and general upkeep through the TWID and our Destiny social channels. Thank you for your continued patience and support. We will have more information on our next major update and future plans for Destiny 2 closer to launch.</em></p>
<p><em>See You Starside.”</em></p>
<p>The Shadow and Order update had been due to arrive just after the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/the-marathon-server-slam-takes-place-a-week-before-launch/">Marathon Server Slam</a> and just before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/19/marathon-gets-a-march-5th-release-date/">Marathon itself launched,</a> so it seemed inevitable that it would be moved to allow Bungie some space for that.</p>

<p>Bungie have not released a roadmap for future updates but if Shadow and Order – or whatever it gets called – is delayed by three months then there is a very good chance that the next expansion, Shattered Cycle, will also get pushed back.</p>
<p>Bungie are clearly prioritising Marathon, and they really have to as they need another big hit. Destiny 2 is a shadow(keep) of its former self, and delaying big updates for months on end is not going to incentivise the players left.</p>
