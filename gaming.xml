		<p>FromSoftware are back with a new spin off from The Elden Ring and this time you can bring your friends. The Elden Ring: Nightreign looks to take the setting and combat from the original title but allow you to team up with two co-op&nbsp; friends and battle in a map based on Elden Ring’s Limgrave area.</p>
<p>Technically Elden Ring also has multiplayer, this just looks like it’s making it more important</p>


<p>The game will have random enemies and features that will change with every game, and it will be coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC at some point in 2025.</p>

<p>FromSoftware<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/no-plans-for-elden-ring-2-say-fromsoftware/"> have said that they are not working on Elden Ring 2</a> . “We’re not really considering developments such as an Elden Ring 2,” said Miyazaki, but then acknowledge that they may work on the sequel in the future. He also suggested the franchise could continue in another form such as a movie or animated series.</p>

<p>Well, now we know what they were working on!</p>

		<p>CD Projekt Red has revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> with the very first trailer for the game, featuring Ciri as the protagonist.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher IV — Cinematic Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54dabgZJ5YA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A gorgeously rendered story trailer, it depicts a girl who is being dressed and prepared for sacrifice to the evils of the world to save the village. Except there’s a Witcher in town to fight the evil for them instead, and that Witcher is…. Ciri!</p>
<p>Here’s CDPR’s blurb:</p>
<p>“The Witcher IV is a single-player, open-world RPG from CD PROJEKT RED. At the start of a new saga, players take on the role of Ciri, a professional monster slayer, and embark on a journey through a brutal dark-fantasy world. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, it aims to be the most immersive and ambitious open-world Witcher game to date.”</p>

<p>We are still many years away from the release of The Witcher 4, with CDPR confirming just a couple weeks ago that the game had now entered full production.</p>
<p>This trailer is also a showcase for what CDPR is shooting for with the new game engine.&nbsp;CDPR has made the jump away from their own in-house game engine to using Unreal Engine 5. That, as we’ve even seen from studios coming over from Unreal Engine 4, has a significant impact on the production pipeline, as developers and artists look to integrate features like Nanite textures and Lumen global illumination into the game.</p>

			<p>The first world premiere trailer shown at The Game Awards 2024 was CD Projekt RED's first look at The Witcher IV. We watched a pre-rendered cinematics running on an unreleased GeForce RTX graphics card (likely the RTX 5090 that's rumored to launch next month) featuring the familiar progression of a The Witcher quest. A young woman is pushed to sacrifice herself to a cursed monster who lives in a nearby forest, only for Cirilla Fiona Riannon to step in and kill the monster first to save the girl... or so she thought.</p>
<p>Once Ciri goes back to the village, she finds the girl dead after being stabbed for not going through the supposedly protective ritual. That's when she utters that monsters, as in humans, not gods, are here.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher IV — Cinematic Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54dabgZJ5YA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's about as The Witcher as you could hope for. There's no release window, of course, but the press release does share a few details on the game. Sebastian Kalemba, Game Director on The Witcher IV, stated:</p>
<p><em>We're kicking off a brand-new Witcher saga, this time with Ciri as the heart of the story! It feels so good to finally be able to say those words — for the longest time we knew that we wanted Ciri to be the protagonist of The Witcher IV; it just felt natural to us and we believe that Ciri deserves it. In this game we want to explore what it means to truly become a witcher by following Ciri on her Path. This trailer is a taste of both that, and just how dark and grounded the world of The Witcher can be.</em></p>
<p>Powered by the same tech that The Witcher IV is built on, using assets and models from the game itself, the trailer aims to provide players with a cinematic look at the kind of experience the game aspires to provide.</p>
<p>The game is<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;in full production</a>, and we might be able to play it within the next couple of years.</p>

			<p>The world of Elden Ring is getting expanded next year with Elden Ring Nightreign, a new action game by FromSoftware launching on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The game, which was revealed with a trailer shown during this year's The Game Awards show, will be a co-op action game featuring characters and locations seen in the original game. Unfortunately, not much else has been said about the game, but it definitely looks like the game will feature the natural evolution of the multiplayer mechanics of the Souls series.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN – REVEAL GAMEPLAY TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Djtsw5k_DNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given how successful the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">original Elden Ring</a> was, it's not surprising to see FromSoftware capitalizing on it to offer a new experience set in The Lands Between. Earlier this year, the Japanese developer released the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, which is every bit as good as the base game, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches sometime during Summer 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

It’s called <em>The Witcher 4</em>, and was revealed via a lengthy cinematic trailer that starred Ciri in place of Geralt, who led the original trilogy. There aren’t many details yet, but CD Projekt Red says that in the new game “Ciri takes center stage as the protagonist, embarking on her own journey to become a professional monster slayer.” It will be a single-player, open-world RPG.</p><p>It doesn’t sound like the trailer will necessarily be representative of the final game, however. Here’s how CD Projekt Red explains it:</p><div><blockquote><p>In the nearly six-minute trailer, viewers were introduced to Ciri, the adopted daughter of Geralt of Rivia, as she takes on a witcher contract in a remote village that has been terrorized for generations by a fearsome monster demanding human sacrifices. Framed as a short, self-contained&nbsp;<em>Witcher</em>&nbsp;story, the trailer showcases Ciri’s new abilities and tools, including a chain and advanced magic powers.</p><p>At the heart of the trailer is Ciri’s perspective as an outsider to the village. As the villagers say goodbye to one of their own — a young girl they are preparing for a traditional ritual sacrifice — Ciri chooses to intervene. Aiming to slay the beast and save the girl at the same time, Ciri finds herself at odds with the prejudices and superstitions of the people she tries to protect, leading her to confront a painful witcher lesson: that monsters come in all forms.</p></blockquote></div><p>We’ve known for some time that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23387206/cyberpunk-witcher-new-games-cd-projekt-red-cdpr-franchise-hadar-multiplayer">CD Projekt Red was working on a follow up</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/12/23505545/the-witcher-3-next-gen-update-ps5-xbox-pc-hands-on"><em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></a>, which is meant to kick off a new saga for the fantasy franchise. In November <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306590/the-witcher-keeps-on-witching">the studio revealed</a> that the game, previously codenamed “Polaris,” was in the “full-scale production phase” of development.” It’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23424463/witcher-remake-cd-projekt-red-unreal-engine-5">being built using Unreal Engine 5</a>, which the studio shifted to following the troubled launch of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. When it comes to the cinematics shown off today, the studio says that “the cinematic trailer is pre-rendered in a custom build of Unreal Engine 5 on an unannounced NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU.”</p><p>No word yet on platforms or release timing.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318444/google-gemini-2-0-flash-ai-model"><h2>Google launched Gemini 2.0, its new AI model for practically everything</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319585/youtube-tv-2024-subscription-price-increase-82-99"><h2>YouTube TV’s monthly cost soars to $82.99</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24318840/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji-image-playground"><h2>With iOS 18.2, Apple completes its AI starter kit</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319498/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-release-date"><h2>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new expansion drops next week</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319528/google-android-xr-samsung-project-moohan-smart-glasses"><h2>I saw Google’s plan to put Android on your face</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></main><div><h2>More from this stream<!-- --> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319637/the-game-awards-2024-trailers-annoucements">The Game Awards 2024: all of the biggest trailers and announcements</a></h2><ul><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320097/elden-ring-sequel-nightreign-the-game-awards-trailer">FromSoftware debuts a new Elden Ring game</a></h3><p><time datetime="2024-12-13T01:44:49.236Z"> <!-- -->Dec 13, 2024, 1:44 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320105/some-outer-worlds-2-gameplay">Some Outer Worlds 2 gameplay.</a></h3><p><time datetime="2024-12-13T01:40:40.894Z"> <!-- -->Dec 13, 2024, 1:40 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320078/fumito-ueda-is-back">Fumito Ueda is back.</a></h3><p><time datetime="2024-12-13T01:34:14.383Z"> <!-- -->Dec 13, 2024, 1:34 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/12/12/24320102/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-formerly-a-ps5-timed-exclusive-is-coming-to-pc">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, formerly a PS5 timed exclusive, is coming to PC.</a></h3><p><time datetime="2024-12-13T01:31:07.654Z"> <!-- -->Dec 13, 2024, 1:31 AM UTC</time></p></li></ul><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319637/the-game-awards-2024-trailers-annoucements">See all <!-- -->13<!-- --> stories</a> </div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remember when From Software’s Hidetaka Miyazaki said <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-2-isnt-in-development-right-now-but-from-software-do-have-several-other-games-in-the-works">they weren’t thinking about Elden Ring 2</a>, but they were thinking about the continuation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> in general? Well, who had “three player co-op musou” on their bingo card?</p><!--more-->
<p>Announced at the annual winter Geoff Awards just now, Elden Ring: Nightreign is a multiplayer-focussed spin-off that pits a trio of Elden Ringers against tides of foes in a world that reshuffles every time you play. It's out in 2025. Here’s a trailer.</p>

<p>It looks to be a faster, more agile experience than Elden Ring, with characters scuttling up walls like ninja and taking to the air with the help of summonable bird creatures. There's a touch of horde-clearing, but the trailer features plenty of bosses, and it looks like you'll need to divide and conquer to defeat them. "Divide and conquer", here, means "let yourself get eaten so your mate can nail a dragon with their bow".</p><p>The aesthetics and character designs are familiar, to the point that this could easily be DLC. It’s all in keeping with Miyazaki’s suggestion that Elden Ring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-is-the-limit-for-from-software-project-scale-says-miyazaki-multiple-smaller-games-may-be-the-next-stage%E2%80%9D">represents the upper limit for project scale</a> at From Software, and that smaller projects may be the “next stage”.</p>
<p>There may be even bigger From Software news in store: Sony are in talks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-is-in-talks-to-buy-dark-souls-and-elden-ring-parent-company-kadokawa%E2%80%9D">buy their parent company Kadokawa</a>.</p>

(According to the trailer’s description on YouTube all footage was captured on a PC.)</p><p>The game is being developed by genDESIGN. In the trailer we can see a person climbing aboard a giant mech and then seemingly taking off in the head of the mech because its actually a giant spaceship... thing. I don’t know what’s going on, but it looks cool!</p><p> Fumito Ueda is famous for directing and creating beloved PS2 games Ico and <em>Shadow of the Colossus.</em> He then helped lead development on <em>The Last Guardian</em> via his own studio, genDESIGN. While that game wasn’t as popular as <em>Ico </em>or <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, it still maintined the same vibes as the Ueda’s previous titles. </p><p>It still seems like this is very early and probably a couple years away. I mean, it doesn’t even have a title yet! Still, I’m excited to check it out because Ueda’s past work is awesome and him making a sci-fi game has me very, as the kids say, hyped. Hopefully it has a less rocky development timeline than Ueda’s last game, <em>The Last Guardian,</em> and we get to play it sooner than later. For now, we wait and think about that giant mech head. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Outer Worlds 2 has received a new trailer from Obsidian, which debuted tonight at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>In the trailer, and in true Outer Worlds fashion, the narrator makes plenty of quips, including a neat reference to Fallout: New Vegas basically being Fallout 3: Part 2.</p>



<p>The trailer doesn’t reveal a release date but offers a reiteration that The Outer Worlds 2 is dropping in 2025. It also gives us a nice preview of what’s to come in terms of the scope of the game.</p>



<p>Check out the new trailer below.</p>

<h2 id="h-more-action-more-weapons-more-graphics">More Action, More Weapons, More Graphics</h2>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 promises to be much bigger, broader, and more ambitious than the first game, which was released in 2019. The sequel is long overdue, but the wait seems like it will have been worthwhile by the time the game is released next year.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The Outer Worlds (2019) is a solid Obsidian RPG, and it was dubbed ‘Fallout: New Vegas in space’ by many. It offers plenty of freedom, a branching narrative, and the ability to go anywhere and do whatever you like, often with hilarious and chaotic results. </p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is a standalone game that acts as a spin-off to the original Elden Ring as opposed to a sequel. The game lets players play with up to two other players on a smaller map based on the Limgrave region of the Elden Ring map. Each enemy will be randomized at the beginning of your playthrough.</p>

    <p><span>Platforms and release date not announced.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > CD Projekt RED [201 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt RED</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > The Witcher IV" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher IV</a></em>, the start of a brand-new <em>The Witcher</em> saga. Platforms and a release date were not announced <span id="more-933819"></span></p><p>“We’re kicking off a brand-new <em>Witcher</em> saga, this time with Ciri as the heart of the story!” said Sebastian Kalemba, Game Director. “It feels so good to finally be able to say those words—for the longest time we knew that we wanted Ciri to be the protagonist of <em>The Witcher IV</em>; it just felt natural to us and we believe that Ciri deserves it. In this game we want to explore what it means to truly become a witcher by following Ciri on her Path. This trailer is a taste of both that, and just how dark and grounded the world of <em>The Witcher</em> can be.”</p><p>Get the first details below.</p><blockquote><p>During this year’s The Game Awards, CD PROJEKT RED offered a first look at The Witcher IV, previously known by its codename <a title="Games > Polaris [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/polaris">Polaris</a>. The game, a successor to <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>—considered one of the most acclaimed games of all time—marks the beginning of a new <em>Witcher</em> saga with Ciri stepping into the role of the protagonist.</p><p>In the nearly six-minute trailer, viewers were introduced to Ciri, the adopted daughter of Geralt of Rivia, as she takes on a witcher contract in a remote village that has been terrorized for generations by a fearsome monster demanding human sacrifices. Framed as a short, self-contained <em>Witcher</em> story, the trailer showcases Ciri’s new abilities and tools, including a chain and advanced magic powers.</p><p>At the heart of the trailer is Ciri’s perspective as an outsider to the village. As the villagers say goodbye to one of their own — a young girl they are preparing for a traditional ritual sacrifice—Ciri chooses to intervene. <a title="Companies > Aiming [29 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/aiming">Aiming</a> to slay the beast and save the girl at the same time, Ciri finds herself at odds with the prejudices and superstitions of the people she tries to protect, leading her to confront a painful witcher lesson: that monsters come in all forms.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The trailer is pre-rendered in a custom build of Unreal Engine 5 on an unannounced NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU. Powered by the same tech that <em>The Witcher IV</em> is built on, using assets and models from the game itself, it aims to provide players with a cinematic look at the kind of experience the game is aspiring to provide. The trailer was created through a close collaboration between CD PROJEKT RED and Platige Image, who are no strangers to The Witcher universe, having been responsible for intro cinematics in the previous installments of the series.</p><p><em>The Witcher IV</em> is a single-player, <a title="Genres > Open-World [532 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [16,865 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> from CD Projekt RED. At the start of a new saga, players take on the role of Ciri and embark on a journey through a brutal dark fantasy world. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, it aims to be the most immersive and ambitious open-world <em>Witcher</em> game to date.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="The Witcher IV — Cinematic Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54dabgZJ5YA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Revealed at The Game Awards 2024, the first trailer for The Witcher 4 sees former protagonist Geralt's adopted daughter Ciri take the lead. The studio has yet to announce a release date, but based on The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley prefacing the trailer by stating it offered a look at "the next decade of gaming," it seems likely we'll be waiting quite awhile.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54dabgZJ5YA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/54dabgZJ5YA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

FromSoftware is working on a new standalone game set in the world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.
</p>
<p>
Revealed at tonight's The Game Awards, Elden Ring: Night Reign features plenty of familiar elements like sites of grace and Evergaols, but with an emphasis on co-op.
</p>
<p>
So while FromSoftware boss Hidetaki Miyazaki stated last week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-2-is-not-in-development-says-fromsoftwares-miyazaki">Elden Ring 2 isn't in development</a>, this standalone spin-off is expanding the franchise.

<p>
Elden Ring players will notice plenty of recognisable enemies, but thankfully there look to be some new terrifying bosses: a lightning-wielder on a dragon, a cerberus with a huge whip, and a hovering goat yoga master (?!).
</p>
<p>
It looks like movement has a faster pace too and, presumably, the challenge has been balanced for co-op play - the trailer shows three players battling at once.
</p>
<p>
As for story, the narrator mentions the Night Lord who I'm sure we can assume is responsible for the titular reign.
</p>
<p>
Elden Ring: Night Reign is set for release next year across PS4, PS5, Xbox consoles, and PC (Steam).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Two and a half years after announcing it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">started work</a> on the "next instalment in The Witcher series", CD Projekt has formally unveiled the project - now officially titled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> - with a first teaser trailer during this year's The Game Awards.
</p>
<p>
Excitement around CD Projekt's next Witcher game has been steadily increasing for some time now, as the project has shifted from vague concept to something considerably more tangible. The studio confirmed The Witcher 4 had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">entered "full-scale production" back in November</a>, and a first look is now finally here.
</p>
<p>
Details remain scant at this early juncture in CD Projekt's marketing plans, but The Witcher 4's reveal trailer does at least confirm one persistent rumour to be true. This new saga will shift its focus away from Geralt of Rivia and toward a new (albeit familiar) protagonist - with everybody's favourite time-traveling dimension-hopper Ciri now taking the lead. And she got to go bit on the action in a surprisingly lengthy cinematic teaser, battling a monster deep in the woods to save a village maiden.

<p>
And CD Projekt's trailer also confirmed another lingering question. Speaking in August, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle hinted the character <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">would be "part of" the new Witcher game</a>, adding, "We just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt." After his chatter earned a slapped wrist from CD Projekt, however, he's started insisting he was just going off "a rumour" - but Cocker gravelling tones at the end of today's reveal trailer confirm that Geralt will indeed be back in some form.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, beyond the fact it's being developed in Unreal Engine, there are countless questions to be answered around the new game. Still, it's nice to finally get an official name for CD Projekt's next Witcher outing, and equally nice to be able to put a face to that name. And while we wait for more details, you can always read what Eurogamer learned about The Witcher 4 - including CD Projekt's technical ambition, optimism, and timeframes - when we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red">spoke to the studio</a> earlier this year.

I was planning to do so again this year, but my research yielded some interesting results. At the extreme edges of the time-honored tradition of SEO bait – where intrigue lives – the game has changed.&nbsp;</p><p>As I began Googling “how to watch The Game Awards” like some kind of idiot who doesn’t already know how to watch The Game Awards, I noticed that last year’s earliest birds seemed uninterested in this year’s worm. Sites like Marca and ScreenRant, which in 2023 posted Game Awards start time guides as early as February, waited until November 2024 to get their headstart on the competition. Almost unanimously, sites posted their variations on the theme three weeks ago, yesterday, or today. And that’s if they posted at all! A few of last year’s top contenders didn’t. That doesn’t make for the most interesting roundup, sadly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But why have things changed? It’s not entirely clear. I asked a couple friends at larger gaming sites, both of whom referred to Google’s algorithm for this kind of thing specifically as “voodoo.” However, we can make some educated guesses as to what happened here. For one, between AI and carousels at the top of the page, Google has turned this kind of a post into less of a surefire hit. Admittedly, I’m not seeing an AI summary when I search for Game Awards info, but I do get a series of modules before I reach regular search results. If you’re not in those modules, you’re functionally invisible to most people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"My guess is that this kind of post is no longer worth it because of the featured snippets,” Veronica de Souza, current executive digital director at Inc and veteran audience development head, told Aftermath. “If I’m looking for how to watch the snippet answers it for me without having to click."</p><p>The news module does cycle stories, so it behooves sites to publish near the event in question and then hope for the best.</p><p>There’s also Google search-related conventional wisdom that sites might be wising up to, according to an SEO expert with whom Aftermath spoke: A <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&amp;geo=US&amp;q=the%20game%20awards&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quick look at Google Trends</a> shows that most people search for information about when The Game Awards start on the day of the show or just before. They tend to search for The Game Awards more broadly, meanwhile, right after major announcements concerning the show – for example, November 18, the day Keighley announced this year’s nominees. So sites’ best bet is to take advantage of those traffic spikes when they inevitably happen – not to toss a lure out months in advance and wait for readers to bite.</p><p>Some publications have also gotten creative about capitalizing on general interest in The Game Awards as an entity. Polygon has spent the past handful of months – dating <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all the way back to August</a> – running a multi-story package about which game might win game of the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out the Geoff Keighley-fication of video game announcements in general. Once upon a time, The Game Awards was Keighley’s main event, and to some extent it still is, but he also hosts Summer Game Fest and Gamescom Opening Night Live, both of which sites can build “how to watch” guides around long before The Game Awards. In previous years, we were all still figuring out how to acclimate to this relatively-new reality. Now it’s a well-oiled machine, and we’re all cogs in it. Hooray.&nbsp;</p><p>So there you go. Now you know what happened to “What Time Does ‘What Time Do The Game Awards Start?’ Start?” Come back next year for “What Happened To ‘What Happened To ‘What Time Does ‘What Time Do The Game Awards Start?’ Start?” &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking"><h3>Objects To Hit Fascists With In Indiana Jones, Ranked</h3></a><p>I've been playing Indiana Jones and The Great Circle and have constructed a ranking internally.</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Sloclap has revealed Rematch, bringing the style of animation and martial artistry honed through the making of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sifu">Sifu</a> to create an online football game!</p>
<p><iframe title="REMATCH | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4q2qdTSuOaw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This isn’t 11v11, but rather a 5v5 game with a bit of the style and flair of Rocket League to it. Here’s some blurb from the trailer:</p>
<p>“Rematch brings a fresh take on football with immersive third-person action, skill-based gameplay, and intense online competition. Team up with your friends and tackle, dribble, aim, and shoot your way to victory in fast-paced 5v5 matches where every move matters.”</p>
<p>Rematch is coming in summer 2025 to PC, Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. If you want to play it earlier, you can sign up to the pre-release beta tests. Beta periods are invite-only and spots will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/beta-environment">head here to sign up</a>.</p>

		<p>Legendary immersive sim developer Warren Spector has given a first look at the next game that he and the team at OtherSide Entertainment are working on: Thick as Thieves.</p>
<p><iframe title="Thick As Thieves - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fg_EZZgGH5U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Thick as Thieves is steeped in immersive sims, but has been given a dash of multiplayer to it. Set in a fantasy city, you’ll seemingly take on jobs to perform heists and crimes, only to discover that you’re actually in a race with rival criminals to pull off the same job.</p>
<p>Here’s some trailer blurb:</p>
<p>“A PvPvE multiplayer stealth game set in a 1910s metropolis filled with magic and intrigue. Hide, sneak, and steal your way through the ranks as you match your cunning against rival thieves in an immersive living world of stories and shadows.”</p>

<p>Previously announced earlier this year, this is the first look that we have at Thick as Thieves. It looks rather intriguing, and will be fascinating to see how they can blend together a traditionally solitary subgenre with more competitive multiplayer.</p>
<p>Thick as Thieves is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

			<p>The Ninja Gaiden series is coming back next year on PC and consoles with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, a game that pays tribute to the series' roots.</p>
<p>The new game, which is being developed by The Game Kitchen as revealed by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16cO1alUFkE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement trailer</a> below, the studio behind Blasphemous, will combine the series' classic role and gameplay from the first 2D entries in the series with the depth and intensity of the modern 3D entries in the series, bringing the best of both areas to modern audiences.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16cO1alUFkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Our story begins when Ryu Hayabusa journeys to America to honor his father's will. While he is away, the barrier between the human and the demon worlds suddenly shatters, unleashing a terrifying army upon the Hayabusa Village, which now faces an unprecedented threat in Ryu's absence. To stand against this new threat, Kenji Mozu, a young ninja from the Hayabusa Village, rises to the challenge!</em></p>

<p>While this may not have been the comeback some fans may have expected, there's no denying that Ninja Gaiden Ragebound is looking quite good. Hopefully, the game will be successful enough to spearhead a resurgence of the franchise, which has been dormant for some time, with developer Team NINJA focusing on other games such as the Nioh series, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, and this year's Rise of the Ronin.</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden Ragebound launches sometime during Summer 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320009/nvidia-lan-party-comeback-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been 13 years since Nvidia hosted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NVIDIA/search?query=geforce%20lan%206">its last LAN party</a>, inviting hundreds of people to physically haul their gaming PCs onto a decommissioned aircraft carrier and jack them in for networked gaming bliss. Now, the GeForce LAN is finally coming back — and you’re theoretically invited, should you manage to reserve one of the 400 available spaces <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgeforce-lan-50%2F">right here</a> on December 16th at 6AM PT / 9AM ET.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgeforce-lan-50%2F">The GeForce LAN 50</a> will run January 4th through January 6th, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada, with satellite events in Berlin, Taipei, and Beijing, and it promises to be a “online &amp; in-person 50 hour gaming marathon” with contests, tournaments, raffles, and swag. </p><p>It’ll kick off 4:30PM PT on January 4th, and you’ll need to provide a fully refundable $125 deposit to sign up. Nvidia tells me those 400 slots are for everyday gamers, and do not count the influencers who may also show up.</p><p>If you can’t or don’t want to make it, Nvidia says it’ll offer one small set of rewards online — if you stream <em>Diablo IV</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fallout 76</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Finals</em>, or<em>&nbsp;WoW</em>&nbsp;from its GeForce Now cloud gaming service “continuously for 50 minutes,” there’ll be some kind of in-game reward. Nvidia will also be offering prizes in a marketing celebration <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgeforce-greats%2F">it’s calling “GeForce Greats”.</a></p><p>The LAN party is happening right before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264418/nvidia-ces-2025-keynote-rtx-5090-rumors">Nvidia’s CES 2025 keynote in Las Vegas</a>, where we’re expecting the company to announce the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266052/nvidia-rtx-5070-ces-rumor-specs">RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and possibly the RTX 5070</a> as well, and the fact that this is the “GeForce LAN 50” is probably a tease for those 50-series cards — the last LAN that Nvidia hosted was the “GeForce LAN 6,” not “GeForce LAN 49” or anything like that. </p><p>Starting in 2004, the GPU company began to host major LAN parties almost every year until it stopped in 2011. Here’s one of my minor claims to nerd fame: I helped set <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/69990/lan-party-at-nvision-08-sets-world-record">a Guinness World Record for the largest, longest LAN party</a> at one in 2008.</p><div><figcaption><em>Record scratch, freeze frame, yep that’s me (on the left)...</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sean Hollister</cite></p></div><p>That Nvidia LAN wasn’t held on an aircraft carrier, but rather the San Jose Convention Center, as part an event that Nvidia called “NVISION 08.” The company never held another NVISION, but it rebooted its event the very next year, at the very same location, as the GPU Technology Conference (GTC). <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/19/~/getting-nvidia-to-sponsor-a-lan-party%2Fevent">There was a time</a> Nvidia would sponsor third-party LANs as well. </p><p>Apparently Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a soft spot for LANs, making <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/18e879x/mr_jensen_huang_came_to_a_nvidia_lan_party_in/">a surprise visit to a small one</a> in Vietnam last year. While gamers have largely moved online for multiplayer games, the LAN party subculture has been getting a bit of nostalgic attention as of late — there’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LAN-Party-Inside-Multiplayer-Revolution/dp/0500026955?tag=theverge02-20">even a coffee table book now</a> documenting the era.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You don’t seem to control Pac-Man in Shadow Labyrinth. You play a lanky human warrior instead, with Pac-Man floating along behind like a Chinese lantern. It appears that if you feed him up, he’ll do the black hole routine and devour your foes. I can think of no more dreadful way to die than to be eaten by Pac-Man. He doesn’t even chew.</p>
<p>Some blurb from the developers: “As Swordsman No. 8, awoken by a floating yellow orb, PUCK, on a mysterious planet amidst relics of wars past, you are chosen to become the instrument of its will. To survive you will discover many secrets, consume your enemies, and grow from prey to the apex predator as you embrace your true purpose.”</p>
<p>This probably isn't the first "dark" Pac-Man game, but they've certainly pulled out the stops. It's definitely teetering on the edge of unintentional comedy, though. Do Kirby next, games industry, he's appalling.</p>

<p>Here are a few ninja secrets for you: </p>
<blockquote><p>From the acclaimed team behind Blasphemous, NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound successfully unites the classic lore and gameplay of the Tecmo-developed (now KOEI TECMO GAMES) NINJA GAIDEN series from the 8-bit era with the depth and intensity of the modern 3D entries. The best of both eras come together to create an epic and thrilling adventure.</p>
<p>Our story begins when Ryu Hayabusa journeys to America to honor his father's will. While he is away, the barrier between the human and the demon worlds suddenly shatters, unleashing a terrifying army upon the Hayabusa Village, which now faces an unprecedented threat in Ryu's absence. To stand against this new threat, Kenji Mozu, a young ninja from the Hayabusa Village, rises to the challenge!</p></blockquote>
<p>The trailer itself looks rather good, packing in lots of lovely blade swinging effects, wall running, a cheeky aerial disembowel or two, large men with big shields that look like demons, and actual very large demon, and sumptuous pixel art backgrounds. Much like Blasphemous, looking at it makes me want to play at immediately. And, just like Blasphemous, I will undoubtedly be terrible at it. Here’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2542120/NINJA_GAIDEN_Ragebound/">Steam link</a>.</p>

<p>CD Projekt has given Witcher fans everywhere their first look at The Witcher 4 in the form of an all-new trailer. The footage was dropped today during The Game Awards in Los Angeles, sending fans of the open-world fantasy series giddy with excitement.</p>



<p>Recently, it was suggested by the CD Projekt team that The Witcher 4 will be released before the end of 2027. It has been almost a decade since the last brand-new Witcher game, so it’s nice to know that fans don’t have <strong>that much longer </strong>left to wait.</p>



<p>Check out the new trailer for The Witcher 4 below.</p>

<p>The Witcher has gone from strength to strength in the last decade or so. From a multi-award-winning game in The Wild Hunt to a successful live-action adaptation, The Witcher has won over millions of fans worldwide. It has been a boon for CDPR, and even today, it’s at the top of many gamers’ top titles lists.</p>



<p>The Witcher 4 first surfaced as ‘Polaris’, one of the many codenames that CD Projekt divulged during a series of company updates a year or two ago. It was revealed first in 2022, but since then, almost nothing has been said about the game.</p>



<p>That was, until a while ago when Doug Cockle, the iconic voice actor behind The Witcher’s Geralt of Rivia, dropped a tasty tidbit of information that earned him a slapped wrist from CDPR. The actor said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/geralt-va-got-slapped-by-cdpr-for-witcher-4-comment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geralt is in The Witcher 4</a> but he’s not the main character – and that was enough to set the community ablaze.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer that debuted today at The Game Awards:</p>

<p>The trailer showcases a dark and mysterious title with Ciri at the forefront, which is what people fully expected following the end of Blood and Wine, the final DLC for 2015’s The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p>



<p>In the trailer, we see new elemental attacks, a new terrifying creature, and Ciri’s full abilities as a Witcher realised.</p>
