            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modiphius Entertainment has announced an official <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em>. The tabletop publisher behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-fallout-wasteland-warfare-second-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</em></a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mass-effect-board-game-review-back-to-reaper-war" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em> board game</a> will be bringing the hyperviolence of the seminal shooter series to gaming tables.</p>

<h2>The Doom Arena Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius has announced that two versions of the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> will be available later this year via a Kickstarter campaign.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-classic-gameplay-screenshot.jpg?itok=NWOi4-YP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-classic-gameplay-screenshot.jpg?itok=HqHkUcYw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first one, simply called <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em>, is based on the 1993 original. The simple, but effective narrative of Doom Guy trapped on a Mars outpost surrounded by demonic enemies.</p>

<p>The second game, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages Arena Board Game</em>, is based on the 2025 release of "New Doom," an era packed with cosmic factions of demons, angels, cosmic horrors, and a superpowered hero called The Doom Slayer.</p>

<p>Regardless of which game you pick, both will feature a quick-to-learn competitive experience. Players face off as either Doom Guy or the demonic hordes as they navigate different battlefields, uncovering weapons and hidden power-ups straight from the series. These battles will escalate across three rounds. Last one standing wins. Of course, no matter who wins, the arenas are going to have a new crimson paint job.</p>

<p>Both versions of the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> will share the same ruleset. Additionally, the Kickstarter campaign will feature optional expansions, covering various enemies found in each franchise. Enemies such as the Atlan mech and the Mecha Dragon from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-dark-ages" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chris Birch, co-founder of Modiphius, said: “DOOM has been that game that hard-core FPS players have loved since the original, and it brings back so many memories. We’re so excited to bring that frantic action, combined with our awesome miniatures, to the tabletop!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is unclear at the time of writing who the developers of the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> are or when the game is expected to ship. However, there is a good chance the base price may be more than expected due to recent current events.</p>

That there won’t be a long-standing drought of Nintendo Switch 2 availability after all. The console has been easy to buy online from several retailers this week, including <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fswitch-2-system-nintendo-switch-2%2F6614313.p%3F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-2-console%2F-%2FA-94693225" rel="sponsored">Target</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-System%2F15949610846%3F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-2-System/dp/B0F3GWXLTS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which didn’t sell the Switch 2 at launch, is currently selling it by invitation only.</p><p>The console’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems">messy preorder process</a> and spotty launch availability made it feel a little like late 2020 all over again, when the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Nvidia RTX 30-series GPUs launched in extremely limited quantities due to component shortages. However, Nintendo appears to have adjusted the right dials to boost production quickly enough to meet US demand. The company reportedly delayed the Switch 2’s planned late-2024 launch to build up stock, according to <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF196OV0Z10C24A2000000/"><em>Nikkei</em></a> (translated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-is-targeting-march-2025-and-was-delayed-to-avoid-shortages-new-report-claims/"><em>VGC</em></a>). If that’s true, that decision seems to have paid off for customers.</p><p>The increased flow of consoles seemed to coincide with the launch of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em>, Nintendo’s latest Switch 2 exclusive. By then, the Switch 2 had already set sales records, becoming the fastest selling game hardware in US history, according to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37i6gok2k">details from marketing firm Circana</a>. Nintendo sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712362/nintendo-switch-2-june-2025-sales">1.6 million units</a> within its first month in the US alone (it sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">a record 3.5 million consoles</a> globally in its first four days). That’s impressive, considering how much skepticism there was about whether <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/650982/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-price-fair">its high $449.99 price</a> ($499.99 if you want a bundle with <em>Mario Kart World</em>) would turn away would-be buyers<em>.</em></p><p>If stock were still tough to come by, we’d be anticipating some kind of update on the matter during Nintendo’s upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/schedule/index.html">August 1st earning’s call</a>. But, thankfully, people across the country can now just buy one online without stressing about it.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/713828/nintendo-switch-in-stock-best-buy-amazon-target-walmart]]></content:encoded>

Although no specific plot details are ready to be shared, the team behind the Wolfenstein series shared an official logline that makes things nice and simple: “The story of killing Nazis is evergreen.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The foundation for a TV series adaptation based on the classic alternate history video game franchise is about as solid as any fan could hope for. The Leftovers writer and Station Eleven creator Patrick Somerville is currently attached as creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the Wolfenstein show via his chaoticgood.tv banner. Variety adds that Somerville has been a fan of Wolfenstein “since he was a child.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Amazon is re-teaming with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series"><u>Fallout series</u></a> production company Kilter Films for the new project, with Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy, and Athena Wickham all on board as executive producers. Keyframe Films’ James Altman, as well as MachineGames’ Jerk Gustafsson, have also joined as executive producers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Wolfenstein works to bring its first-person shooter story to television screens, it’s clear Bethesda and Amazon are more than happy to continue working together. Fallout premiered to acclaim from fans and critics alike when its first season made its debut on Prime Video last year (we gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-1-review-amazon-prime-video"><u>a 9/10</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Work on Fallout Season 2 is well underway, too, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-has-wrapped-production-walton-goggins-sheds-his-ghoul-skin-in-delight"><u>production wrapped all the way back in May</u></a>.

Numerous entries have arrived in the years since, with its most recent storyline, beginning with Wolfenstein: The New Order in 2014, following the nigh-unkillable William B.J. Blazkowicz. Although it received a sequel, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, in 2017, and two standalone spinoffs in 2019, the series has gone without a mainline entry for a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Amazon, Kilter, Bethesda, and the rest of the team keep their heads down to focus on the Wolfenstein series, you can read about some of the other video game adaptations Amazon has in the works.

<p>We haven't had a big annual sports title yet — nothing like the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a> — to really dig into the performance prospects with, and so <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> is, thus far, one of the bigger tests of the real-world differences early adopters can expect. And it's very good news. Amazing news, really. As soon as you boot into this year's action, which comes after the fiasco that was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wwe_2k18">WWE 2K18</a> and the disappointing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wwe_2k_battlegrounds">2K Battlegrounds</a>, you can tell things have changed in a very meaningful way.</p>
<p>It's in the responsive menus, in how flicking through modes on the game's home screen is slick and smooth, with accompanying artwork, photos, and videos showing up without stuttering, slow-loading, or other issues. Before you've even dug into a practice bout, you can just tell this is a handheld version of the game that's gonna stand shoulder to shoulder with its other console counterparts in ways that Switch 1 never could.</p>

<p>No more wading through sluggish menus or waiting for assets to load in as you select a mode, then, no more switching off in frustration because stuff is missing or the online is a bust. Indeed, this port (of one of the overall best wrestling games we've been treated to in a few years on <em>any</em> platform) has plenty in common with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/wwe_2k25">its PS5 sibling</a> in terms of how it looks and plays in action. Bar slightly less detail on textures, it's really hard to tell the difference in action, and for the first time it feels like Switch WWE fans get the little bells and whistles in terms of volumetric effects and all that nice stuff.</p>
<p>A banger of a port, then. And it's a strange sensation, to not immediately have to list all the concessions in terms of graphics, resolution, and frame rate required to get it running on a Nintendo console. What we've got is a fully-featured version of a 2025 sports game that's running at 60fps at all times as far as I can see, with the only fly in the ointment of note being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/wwe-2k25-on-switch-2-is-missing-certain-cross-platform-benefits">the lack of integration with regards to uploading images</a>, which is a shame.</p>
<p>Indeed, this customisation aspect is huge within the community. I'm not sure what can be done, and it's probably an impossible thing to police all images, I should imagine, if that's what the problem is. For me personally, this is a non-issue, which is reflected in how I'm scoring it, but for others it may be a very big deal.</p>
<figure><a title="WWE 2K25 Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157605/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Moving on, what about the game itself, now that we know there are no performance issues, even when playing a Royal Rumble? Well, it's the best time I've had with a 2K wrestling game in absolutely ages, and given the paucity of wrestling games on Switch in the first place (sorry, I'm just angry we don't have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_fire_pro_wrestling">Fire Pro Wrestling</a> yet), this really is pretty much as good as it gets for Switch 2 grappling fans.</p>
<p>This year's outing continues to refine the overall feel of the series' mechanics. Timings on button presses for various moves, attacks, dodges, and all that jazz are all really responsive this time out, so it's just a very slick thing to play at its core.</p>
<p>We've also got lots of really solid modes to dig into, with all the usuals returning — your WWE Universe, MyGM, MyRise and so on — with plenty of improvements to presentation and options that see MyRise and Showcase the strongest they've been in recent memory. I'm not sure anyone has time to play all these modes in a 12-month period, but they're here anyway.</p>
<figure><a title="WWE 2K25 Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157604/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Barring some very OTT cutscenes, which I'm always down for, new mode The Island feels like a bit of a mess. Think of the city setting in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nba_2k25">NBA 2K25</a>, except not nearly as good. Hmm...maybe more in line with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6's</a> open world, but yet again not as good. Anyway, it's not great, and doesn't hold your attention enough to keep you invested. The story, involving Roman Reigns and a mystery island, is amusingly performed, I'll give it that, but alongside MyFaction and its tricksy, show-me-your-wallet ways, this mode seems to exist to get you to start spending all your actual cash.</p>
<p>On the flip side, one really nice addition worth a shoutout this year is that you can now have intergender matchups. I'm actually surprised this hasn't been in the game earlier, as I've skipped quite a few years in a row and just assumed they'd added it, but it's here and opens up lots of fun new match-ups and roleplaying possibilities. It also let me pit The Rock against Glasgow's very own Isla Dawn (she smashed his face in and stole what he was cooking), so I'm very happy right now, thanks.</p>
<p>Wrestling games, as far as I'm concerned, have always been a bit confusing for newcomers because you're not perhaps expecting the actual scrapping to be so reliant on so many timed button presses and QTE-styled shenanigans. It can be off-putting, even disappointing if you aren't expecting it. And I say this because WWE 2K25 has a fantastic set of tutorials and, more importantly, it beckons you to get stuck in when you load up for the first time.</p>
<figure><a title="WWE 2K25 Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157612/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Give it some time in this mode and all the tricks will be at your disposal quicker than you'd expect. Honestly, once you know the ropes, so to speak, this little genre-within-a-genre can be a real surprise for people who've never engaged with it, so kudos for ensuring that this side of things feels much improved.</p>
<p>Indeed, out on the magic blood mat of sweat and death (as I believe it's known), things have never been better for this franchise. In terms of how it looks and plays, it's a proper good time that gives solo players, online nomads, and pals who want to party together loads of ways to throw down in local and online modes. There's an absolutely enormous roster of wrestlers here, too. It's stacked full of modern and retro favourites, and a whole ton of further unlockable characters to pick up as you play.</p>
<p>The 2025 entry also sees the return of the chain wrestling mechanic that was axed in 2022's version. This little minigame pops up during early stages of a bout as a test of quickness in how you choose a move and then try to find the rumbling spot on your thumbstick before your opponent, all in order to advance to another, more complex hold and so on. It enables you to pull off some really fancy stuff! It does take a bit of getting used to, mind, but fans should mostly be happy, I'm sure, to see this reintroduced, because it's the sort of thing that shows a bit of creativity, rather than just dead-eyed retreading of the same mechanics.</p>
<figure><a title="WWE 2K25 Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157602/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>I should also give a shoutout to MyRise mode, where I'll be spending 100% of my time going forward, and in particular to its insanely flexible character creator. Again, this sort of thing just wasn't enjoyable on Switch 1. There wasn't the draw that there is when it loads properly and looks as it should, but here it all looks and feels great to interact with, so you've got this great big creative timesink in your lap, too - even without the option to upload images that I've already mentioned.</p>
<p>Other changes of note see MyGM gain an online mode, so you can now play with pals. Honestly, there's just so many ways to play this game, both online and off, in terms of rulesets, characters, locations, designs...it's a wrestling fan's paradise. And it all runs beautifully on Switch 2, it looks nearly as good as the version I have on PS5, and this one I can play in my lap. Have that! In docked mode — where the graphical shortcomings of a Switch port are usually laid bare — this game looks fab, and even more so when you're pummeling on the go, as is so often the case round my bit.</p>
<figure><a title="WWE 2K25 Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157601/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>So, overall then, is WWE 2K25 the best wrestling game on a Switch console? Yes, it is. It's also one of the best big-budget grappling efforts we've been treated to on any platform in aeons, and this port brings it all home in fine form.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>WWE 2K25 powerbombs onto Switch 2 in an excellent port that holds its own against the likes of the PS5 version, and keeps the action smooth and silky, even when you start piling on the wrestlers in a Royal Rumble.</p>
<p>With great looks, best-in-class core mechanics, a ton of online, local, and solo modes, and an enormous roster, this one will keep all you Switch 2 wrasslin' fans busy for a good long time. Intergender matches, improved MyRise and Showcase, in-depth tutorials, and the return of chain wrestling are all just icing on top.</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wolfenstein-tv-show-coming-from-amazon-mgm-studios-with-fallout-producer-patrick-somerville-as-showrunner.1253622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/">Variety</a> reveals that a television series adaptation of Wolfenstein is in the works at Amazon MGM Studios, with Fallout producer Patrick Somerville signed on as the show's creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner.</p>



<p>While Variety notes that there aren't any details being given out yet regarding what the show's story will be, the tagline for the show is "<em>The story of killing Nazis is evergreen</em>."</p>



<p>Jerk Gustafsson, who is currently an executive producer at <a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-might-have-canceled-an-unannounced-project/">MachineGames</a> and has worked as either a game designer, writer, producer, or managing director on all of MachineGames' Wolfenstein titles, is also attached to the show as an executive producer. </p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what shape this show takes. Variety's report adds that Somerville has been a fan of the Wolfenstein series since he was a kid, but with the series spanning 14 games, that doesn't necessarily mean he adores or even prefers MachineGames' take on the series.</p>



<p>That said, Somerville coming from Amazon's successful adaptation of Fallout does inspire a great deal of confidence. And hopefully for game fans, the potential success of the show is part of a plan to go along with MachineGames returning to the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Netflix seems to have finally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/711575/netflix-games-apple-arcade-mobile-games">settled on something resembling a strategy</a> for its gaming efforts, and one of the key pillars is games tied to its shows and movies. That’s how we got the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645952/black-mirror-game-thronglets-season-7-netflix"><em>Black Mirror</em>’s <em>Thronglets</em></a>. Now, as <em>Happy Gilmore 2</em> hits the streaming service, it’s accompanied by a pair of games that show just how promotional Netflix can be.</p><p>The first game is actually pretty fun, though it’s not really a <em>whole</em> game. It’s called <em>Happy Gilmore: Golf Mayhem ’98 Demo</em>, and it’s exactly what it sounds like: a fictional long-lost demo of a golf game starring Happy that exists in the film’s universe. It plays and looks like an old-school golf game at first. The twist is that you run over to your ball in between each swing, and there are things to do along the way, like collectibles to pick up or golf kart combat tournaments to partake in.</p><p>It’s all rendered with a very ‘90s layer of polygonal polish and ends in a fistfight with Bob Barker that plays like a simplified <em>Street Fighter</em>. It’s pretty short, with only one available hole to play, but the “demo” really nails the <em>Happy Gilmore</em> tone. It’s available on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Fgames%2F82071014" rel="sponsored">the web</a> and select TVs as part of a beta at Netflix. (<a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/132197">Here are some details</a> on how and where you can play these games.)</p><p>The other game leans much more toward the advertisement end of the spectrum. It’s called <em>The Happy Gilmore 2 Tournament,</em> and it’s basically a little Flash-style golf game with three holes that, when you beat it, unlocks… a trailer for <em>Happy Gilmore 2</em>. The most interesting thing about the game is where you play it: it’s available through <a href="https://open.spotify.com/presents/happygilmore2">Spotify’s mobile app</a>.</p><p>Netflix’s plan for games hasn’t always been clear. But earlier this year, Alain Tascan, the streamer’s president of games, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">told me that it was going to focus on a handful specific pillars</a> going forward. The idea was to “readjust and focus on fewer areas with more intention,” like multiplayer games and kid-friendly experiences, rather than just trying everything to see what works. Another one of those focus areas was games based on Netflix’s movie and TV properties, which is where the <em>Happy Gilmore</em> experiences come in.</p><p>These tie-in games are increasingly becoming straight-up promotional vehicles. When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/694353/squid-game-season-3-review-netflix">the third and final season of <em>Squid Game</em></a> hit Netflix, for instance, <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> got a big update that included characters and other elements from the new season. It’s not unlike Superman appearing in <em>Fortnite</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/movie-reviews/701362/superman-dc-studios-james-gunn-review">just as his movie hits theaters</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707075/roblox-creators-licensing-netflix-stranger-things-lionsgate-twilight">or Roblox creators making their own <em>Stranger Things</em> games</a> — except, in this case, Netflix manages the whole process and tailors the games and updates to the related property. Instead of making a regular <em>Black Mirror</em> game, for instance, Netflix turned a fictional game from a recent episode into something you could actually play. Often, these experiences are much smaller than what a typical licensed game would be, sort of like a digital version of a McDonald’s Happy Meal toy.</p><p>We’re likely to see more of these. <em>Happy Gilmore 2</em> may not have the same global appeal as <em>Squid Game</em>, but it is a movie that people have been waiting for since 1996, and it’s arguably Netflix’s biggest film release of the summer, which makes it a good candidate for trying something different. There are plenty of opportunities on the way, from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707540/stranger-things-5-teaser-trailer-netflix">the end of <em>Stranger Things</em></a> to boxing matches and other live events, so it’s unlikely the experimental tie-ins are done — though they might not be as weird as a fist fight with Bob Barker.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/713886/netflix-happy-gilmore-2-games]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Troy Baker has voiced some of the greatest video game characters of all time. Not even including taking over Harrison Ford's role as Indy in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, he also has played Sam Drake in Uncharted, Booker DeWitt in Bioshock: Infinite, Higgs in Death Stranding, and of course, Joel Miller in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-i-ps5-and-pc-review-desolation-row/1900-6417949/" data-ref-id="1900-6417949">The Last of Us</a>.</p><p>During a panel at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdm_82mN-HA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GalaxyCon New Orleans</a> earlier this month, Baker was asked if playing Joel had affected him personally. He said it had actually affected him "deeply" in many different ways, including feeling "woefully unprepared" for the part.</p><p>"There's nothing worse, and I hope that no one ever feels this, but do you ever show up to something and go 'I am so woefully unprepared for this'? And, it's not impostor syndrome, it's a fact," he said. "You are not equipped to do the thing that you are about to do. You could be like, 'let's go bungee jumping!', and then you get on the platform and you go, 'I can't do this'. That was The Last of Us for me. You get the gig, and then you go, 'oh no, I have to deliver this'."</p><p>Baker remembered at one point talking with co-star Ashley Johnson, who plays Ellie in the games, and coming to an almost frightening realization. He turned to Johnson and said: "'Do you realize that if this thing sucks, it's our fault?'"</p><p>He gave credit to Naughty Dog, who already had great success with its Uncharted series, and knew the type of story it wanted to tell next. "We knew that what they were going to make was going to be good," he said, adding that level of storytelling taught him how to be a better actor.</p><p>"It taught me how to stop trying to convince people that I could act, and just realize that Joel has no idea that he's in a game, and he's just in a moment in his life. And, I took that lesson, and I applied it all the way across."</p><p>Most recently, Baker reprised the role of Higgs in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2</a>, which was released this month. July also saw the announcement that Baker will voice Jack Pepper, the protagonist of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mouse-p-i-for-hire-casts-video-game-legend-in-the-lead-role/1100-6532205/" data-ref-id="1100-6532205">Mouse: P.I. for Hire</a>.</p>

In Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, you play one of the hazmat-sporting goons at a government checkpoint during a zombie apocalypse. Your job is to let refugees through the gate one by one, and appraise them for evidence of infection. You know the kind of thing: hidden bite marks, weird heartbeats, high temperatures, people ripping your face off without showing appropriate documentation, etcetera. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can pop vagrants who are looking a bit oozy in glass-walled cells, but do bear in mind that not every illness is a case of the Romeros. That groaning woman might just have indigestion. Still, best keep her in the same pen as the guy whose arms have mysteriously rotted off, just to be safe. When not working out whether pink-eyed civvies are potential shamblers, you'll set up military defences and fend off hordes of 100% confirmed zombies. It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/papers-please">Papers Please</a> with base-building and wave survival elements, in short.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/">The Steam demo</a> has been very popular, attracting 1.8 million players in two months and garnering one million Steam wishlists. Like a stack of meat strategically left out in the baking midday sun, that popularity has attracted the hideous ghouls of Devolver Digital, who have signed on as publishers. To mark the occasion, here are some Key Features.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Immersive Inspection Mechanics: Use tools like UV flashlights, thermometers, and manual scanners to uncover signs of infection or contraband in people and their belongings.
</p>
<p>
- Resource Management: Balance limited supplies of test kits and inspection tools while maintaining order and ensuring your checkpoint remains secure.
</p>
<p>
- Dynamic Threats: Face an evolving queue of refugees--some healthy, some carrying ordinary illnesses, and others harboring deadly zombie pathogens.
</p>
<p>
- Intense Decision-Making: Choose whether to admit, quarantine, or liquidate individuals based on visual clues, document verification, and medical tests.
</p>
<p>
- Strategic Progression: Manage daily routines, from morning base reports to nighttime defenses, as the stakes rise with each passing day.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I think this has the makings of an engrossing sim, but also a very bleak one. I'm interested to know whether there's any accompanying commentary on real-life border politics, or whether all of this is just yucking about with well-known movie tropes. In the absence of anything more substantial to say about the mechanics and supporting fiction, I would like to propose a more wholesome variation in which you try to work out whether every person at the checkpoint is secretly Buster Keaton or Barney the Dinosaur. 
</p>
<p>
Is this <em>the</em> Barney the Dinosaur or is it just a regular dinosaur called Barney or is it Buster Keaton dressed as Barney the Dinosaur? "I love you," you growl, caressing the barrel of your flamethrower. "Do <em>you</em> love <em>me</em>?<em> Are we a happy family?</em>"</p>
<p>If the subject remains silent, that's surefire evidence you've got a Keaton on your hands, and you should on no account permit him access or he'll start doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nkkUZ6e3jM">comical things with ladders</a> and reduce your crack squad of grizzled exterminators to a laughing stock. Actually, that sounds great, let him in already. Anyway, Quarantine Zone is out in November.

For one, it emboldened rich people to exploit the legal system to settle scores with media members they didn’t like over unflattering or embarrassing coverage.

One clip from it circulating around this week following Bollea’s death shows him trying to explain to a jury <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/davidbix.bsky.social/post/3lupztnlmlc2g&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidbix.bsky.social/post/3lupztnlmlc2g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why Hulk Hogan had a 10-inch penis but Bollea himself did not</a></span>. There was the moment when the judge in the case allowed one of the jurors to ask the then-Editor-in-Chief of <em>Jezebel </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/civil/ex-gawker-editor-hulk-hogan-had-limited-privacy-right-on-sex-tape/2269326/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/civil/ex-gawker-editor-hulk-hogan-had-limited-privacy-right-on-sex-tape/2269326/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether she had slept with<em> Gawker </em>owner Nick Denton</a></span> to get the job. It was unclear what bearing that would have had on the case. Also, Denton is gay. Every day in our political life is now this stupid, and with way more at stake for everyone involved.</p><p>Then there’s the bizarre trajectory the whole circus ultimately sent <em>Kotaku</em> itself on. It was sold at auction along with its non-Gawker sister sites to Univision, the Spanish-language broadcasting company that was then mounting a confused and ill-timed foray into digital media. Left mostly to its own devices, <em>Kotaku</em> briefly reached its highest headcount ever in 2018. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/univision-taps-vincent-sadusky-as-ceo-succeeding-randy-falco-1527026754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/univision-taps-vincent-sadusky-as-ceo-succeeding-randy-falco-1527026754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thanks to the shifting whims of distant CEOs</a></span>, the relative honeymoon was short-lived.

The new company was called G/O Media, short for Gizmodo/The Onion. Spanfeller told us in his very first meeting that he came up with it on a napkin just before the deal was finalized.</p><p>That anecdote proved a harbinger for how carelessly the websites themselves would be treated (“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/opinion/deadspin-sports.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/opinion/deadspin-sports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stick to sports</a></span>”) over the subsequent years. I can tell you from experience that Spanfeller’s management style was an unusually disqualifying mix of ignorance, pettiness, bullying, gaslighting, and perversely ill-informed micro-management. I cannot, despite the dozens of hours I’ve wasted contemplating it, tell you what the logic behind any of it was.</p><p>What it achieved, however, was the slow, painstaking disfigurement of <em>Kotaku</em> amid an unceasing exodus of beloved colleagues, cuts to resources, and interference in its day-to-day operations (“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stick to guides</a></span>”), which have served millions of readers year-in-and-year-out for over two decades now. Some find it is easy to blame COVID, unions, and the hollowing out of the internet by tech monopolies for all of these things. Funny how the ruler-of-your-own-destiny crowd turns to systemic explanations when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.megangreenwell.com/the-adults-in-the-room&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.megangreenwell.com/the-adults-in-the-room" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their failures start piling up all around them</a></span>.</p><p>Who knows what exactly the future might have held if Bollea had lost the 2016 sex tape trial? But I would be willing to bet the house we would never have been sold to fucking Jim Spanfeller. Bollea’s death will mean <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/razzball.bsky.social/post/3lusblxfbss2b&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/razzball.bsky.social/post/3lusblxfbss2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different things</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/society/hulk-hogan-racist-liar-scab-obit/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/hulk-hogan-racist-liar-scab-obit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to different people</a></span>. To me, it will mark the end of one of the most idiotic storms <em>Kotaku</em> has ever weathered, which is saying something. July is also the month the site was sold to new owners Keleops, reuniting it with at least one of the other old Gawker sites, <em>Gizmodo</em>. I don’t like to piss on people’s graves, but I do like to toast the future, and <em>Kotaku</em>’s is finally one I’m looking forward to again. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000]]></content:encoded>

		<p>11 bit studios has announced that Frostpunk 2 will launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 18th September, bringing the city management sequel to consoles almost a year to the day after the PC release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 2 | Console Release Date Trailer." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffDlQ5RsF4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frostpunk 2’s console release was expected for this summer, having been included on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/frostpunk-2-is-coming-to-consoles-this-summer/">the game’s roadmap updates from 11 bit</a>. The next stop after the console launch is the Spectrum DLC, which they cryptically described as being able to “help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one…” More expansions are then planned for 2026.</p>
<p>Another project for 11 bit is a remake of the frigid cult classic original, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/frostpunk-1886-has-been-announced-by-11-bit-studios/">Frostpunk 1886 announced at the game’s 7th anniversary</a> in April, promising to rebuild the game within Unreal Engine 5 and introduce some game mechanics from its sequel.</p>
<p>We didn’t review Frostpunk 2 for its PC release, though will look to catch up on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/frostpunk-2-wins-polish-game-of-the-year-at-digital-dragons/">Polish Game of the Year</a> game when it hits consoles, but looking back at that original game, Jason wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk review,</a> “Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolfenstein-tv-series</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-production-for-prime-video.1253547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, a TV show based on id Software and Bethesda's legendary&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>franchise is currently in development, and it's set to air on Prime Video.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, the show will be produced by&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>studio Kilter Films, with executive producer duties being handled by Keyframe Films' James Altman and MachineGames' Jerk Gustafsson, the latter of whom served as director on&nbsp;2014's&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: The New Order&nbsp;</em>and 2019's&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em>.</p>

<p>We don't yet know what the story of the series will be, but as Variety points out, the logline for the series is simply this: "the story of killing Nazis is evergreen". It's hard to argue with that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-colossus.jpg?itok=JWPaEvZx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-colossus.jpg?itok=p6g4rqpr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>TV series is in development for Amazon.</figcaption></figure><p>Although story details are being kept under wraps, if it were me, I'd probably adapt the narrative of&nbsp;<em>The New Order</em>; it's almost certainly the strongest the series has to offer.</p>

<p>Casting also hasn't been revealed yet, but if you ask me,&nbsp;<em>Reacher</em>'s Alan Ritchson was essentially born to play swole hero B.J. Blazkowicz, so if he doesn't end up in the lead role, something's gone seriously wrong.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Station Eleven&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Maniac&nbsp;</em>creator Patrick Somerville will serve as the showrunner for&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein</em>, so it'll essentially be up to him and Amazon what direction the show decides to take.</p>

<p>No third mainline game in MachineGames' rebooted&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>series has been revealed yet (I'm very much trying to ignore&nbsp;<em>Youngblood</em>); while&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/indiana-jones-and-great-circle" rel="nofollow">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>&nbsp;</em>had more than its fair share of Nazi-punching, this might be the closest you're going to get to more&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>for some time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-order.jpg?itok=y72U415q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-order.jpg?itok=WBlJYOG4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>games might not be on the way for a while, so the TV show could be the best you're going to get.</figcaption></figure><p>This&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>series is the latest in a string of video game-to-TV-series adaptations in recent years. Other successes on that front include <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-tv-show-proves-last-of-us-wasnt-fluke" rel="nofollow">Fallout</a>&nbsp;</i>(also made for Amazon), HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, and&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' <i>Arcane</i>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow">won't be the only&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>show soon enough</a>.</p>

<p>As well as these shows, plenty of as-yet-unadapted games are getting their own TV adaptations as well, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clash-of-clans-tv-show" rel="nofollow"><em>Clash of Clans</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-two-souls-tv-series" rel="nofollow"><em>Beyond: Two Souls</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-soon" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed</em></a>.</p>

And it <em>is</em> a big reason I enjoy Donkey Kong’s latest 3D adventure. However, I was surprised by just how charming the loading screen artwork is in the game. </p><figure id="" data-id="6f0c25af272cb73f6b5b6476646e9d3b" data-recommend-id="image://6f0c25af272cb73f6b5b6476646e9d3b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f0c25af272cb73f6b5b6476646e9d3b" data-recommend-id="image://6f0c25af272cb73f6b5b6476646e9d3b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It immediately stood out to me. It looked like it was imitating the kind of artwork Nintendo would produce <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://i.pinimg.com/564x/05/b8/38/05b838d49b6cf186737969a8b1165192.jpg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/05/b8/38/05b838d49b6cf186737969a8b1165192.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back in the ‘80s and early ‘90s</a></span>.

It’s close enough in the best way possible. </p><p>The loading screen art is so good in <em>Bananza </em>that I started to get frustrated at how quickly the Switch 2 loads the game up. I’d sometimes look away for a moment, look back, and only catch a glimpse of some cool-looking art before the game was ready to play. At the very least, I wish there were a gallery where I could see all this art in-game.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mariowiki.com/Gallery:Donkey_Kong_Bananza#Loading_screen_artwork&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Gallery:Donkey_Kong_Bananza#Loading_screen_artwork" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Thankfully, Nintendo fans have done a great job documenting the artwork online</a></span>, though beware some late-game spoilers if you scroll around that useful database of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>loading screen art.</p><p>I hope that if <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>gets a future expansion, Nintendo adds even more wonderful loading screen artwork to the game. And maybe, add an option to leave the loading screen up until I hit a button to make it go away. Sometimes, you just want to linger and enjoy some damn good art.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-art-work-loading-screen-switch-2-1851786938]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty Season 5 arrives to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> next month, and Activision has confirmed the season will launch with the final map for Zombies. Treyarch has since released a series of teaser clips, showing what players can expect for this major story conclusion. This includes the map's Pack-a-Punch location and possible new enemy type with the "Mechaklaus."</p><p dir="ltr">Following the events of Season 3's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shattered-veil-story-easter-egg-guide-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/2900-6418/" data-ref-id="2900-6418">Shattered Veil</a>, the setting of the final map takes place in Janus Towers. Three short teaser clips have been released so far, and they all feature the perspective of Janus Tower security cameras with the grainy look of a '90s-style found footage film.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1948058077296722249" rel="nofollow ">first Zombies teaser</a> shows Janus Towers in chaos with fires inside the building and a glimpse of the undead. The <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1948378886670356717" rel="nofollow ">second teaser</a> seemingly reveals that one of the towers was being used to manufacture robots. It also gives a first look at the map's Pack-a-Pack machine, which is located by a large circular device that could be some sort of teleporter. Janus Towers is a set of three large towers in Liberty Falls, so the teleporter could be a way for players to navigate the separate locations.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1948741274833461339" rel="nofollow ">latest Zombies teaser</a> is even more intriguing, as it gives us the first look at what could be the map's elite enemy type or some other sort of miniboss threat. This likely foe is a bulky mech suit similar to the Panzers from previous Call of Duty Zombies games. This mech suit is already being dubbed the "Mechaklaus," as this was an enemy type previously leaked in the game files. The character inside the suit also looks and sounds like Klaus from Black Ops Cold War.</p><p dir="ltr">Klaus was a robot ally featured on the Mauer der Toten Zombies map, where he helped the main characters save the day and eventually sacrificed himself by walking into the Dark Aether. It's possible Treyarch is teasing that Klaus has returned from the Dark Aether with a mech-suit upgrade, or it could be a completely different Klaus manufactured by Richtofen in Janus Towers.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll likely get a full trailer and learn more details in the coming days, as Season 5 should launch on or around August 7. Here we highlight all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-5-release-date-and-details/1100-6533306/" data-ref-id="1100-6533306">rumors and announcements for Call of Duty Season 5</a> so far.</p>

As for the physical editions, they will come in two different versions. One, the Icebreaker Edition, includes the game, a digital novella, digital artbook, and a pop-up diorama of the game's New London. A pricier Whiteout Edition includes all of the goodies from the Icebreaker version but also includes access to three of Frostpunk 2's upcoming DLC releases as well as more physical goodies in the form of a keychain, New London postcards, stickers, and a faction patch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffDlQ5RsF4s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ffDlQ5RsF4s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a press release, 11 bit studios production coordinator Igor Skibinski said the goal with the console version of the post-apocalyptic strategy game was to make its controls seamless. After the console version's release, an update will come to the PC version that will enable the console version's UI when using a controller.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our ambition is to once again prove that even complex strategy games can feel intuitive and satisfying on consoles," Skibinski said.</p><p dir="ltr">When Frostpunk 2 does arrive on consoles (it first released on PC in September 2024), it will join the console version of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/frostpunk/" data-ref-id="5000-457521">Frostpunk</a>, which is also playable on Game Pass. The survival-focused city-building franchise revolves around making hard choices to ensure civilization's survival amidst an endless winter, with players needing to manage not only essentials to survival like food and heat but also contend with social upheaval.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4538412-frostpunk2whiteoutedittion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538412" data-ratio="0.56234567901235" data-width="1620" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4538412-frostpunk2whiteoutedittion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538412"></a><figcaption>Everything included in the new physical Whiteout Edition of Frostpunk 2 for consoles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4538412-frostpunk2whiteoutedittion.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">11 bit studios announced earlier this year it would be remaking the original Frostpunk in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/frostpunk-is-getting-an-unreal-engine-5-remake-with-new-content-and-mod-support/1100-6531113/" data-ref-id="1100-6531113">Unreal Engine 5 under the new name Frostpunk 1886</a>, its name a reference to a pivotal year in the game's lore. The game won't just be a visual update, but will add new content, mechanics, and laws, while also allowing for official mod support, something not possible due to limitations with the original game's engine.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Frostpunk 2, 11 bit studios made clear it will continue to support it with new updates and content, and that development on Frostpunk 2 and Frostpunk 1886 will "evolve side by side." According to a Frostpunk 2 roadmap, the game will receive multiple free major content updates and paid DLCs, a few of which will arrive in 2025 with more to come in 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Game Pass news, Xbox is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-these-8-games-in-july/2900-5561/" data-ref-id="2900-5561">adding eight games to Game Pass soon</a>, while it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-is-losing-these-three-games-pretty-soon/2900-6767/" data-ref-id="2900-6767">remove three games</a>, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/" data-ref-id="5000-590945">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, on July 31.</p>
