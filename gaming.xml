Like every fest before it, there are hundreds (probably thousands) of great games to check out free demos for, most of them indies, too. We’re doing our best to wade through these demos and check out games we’re excited for, ones to watch, and ones we had never heard of before playing during Steam Next Fest.</p><p>Below, we have a selection of the best Steam Next Fest demos we’ve played so far, and as the week rolls on, we’ll continue to update it with new games we want to surface to our readers. The current Steam Next Fest started yesterday, Monday, June 9, and will run through Monday, June 16, so keep this page bookmarked as we’ll be updating it daily with demos you need to check out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> is due to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on August 8, 2025, and in the lead up to its launch, developer Hangar 13 is doing everything it can to showcase how improved this prequel entry to the series is since we last checked in with the Mafia franchise.</p>
<p>The latest of those efforts is a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwkvXUiG8do">developer diary video</a>, "<em>Art Meets Technology,</em>" which digs into how much better looking Mafia: The Old Country is compared to the rest of the series thanks to the new technologies available in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>"<em>It allows us to tell that story in a way that we just wouldn't be able to, with other technologies,</em>" said art director Steve Noake. He continued, "<em>F</em><em>rom Metahuman, to Nanite, to Lumen. These are all different technologies which we are pushing to the max, to be honest. It's allowing us to grasp the intricacies of a performance, it's allowing us to automate some parts of the process, to be able to get to a point where we can really start to put our human thumbprints on some of these assets.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Breaking Omertà: &quot;Art Meets Technology&quot; | Mafia: The Old Country" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gwkvXUiG8do?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lead character artist Ivan Rylka added that there's a "<em>notable improvement</em>" in what's possible with Unreal Engine 5 versus what Hangar 13 was capable of doing prior to UE5, and confidently claimed "<em>I have no hesitation that this will be the best looking Mafia game in the franchise.</em>"</p>
<p>It's clear that Hangar 13 is putting in every effort to make Mafia: The Old Country look and feel as good as possible. It'll be interesting to see if it's more than just looks by the time it arrives this coming August.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-4%E2%80%99s-gory-combat-hides-a-goofy-center.1214892/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/684438/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-xbox-showcase-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350352/ninja-gaiden-4-xbox"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a> was one of several games that Xbox showed off in its games showcase over the weekend. And during its Summer Game Fest-adjacent in-person preview event, I got the chance to play it for myself. I’ve never played <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> before and was skeptical that the game’s generic dark aesthetic, which feels straight out of 2012, could capture my interest. But after a short hands-on demo and an interview with the game’s developers, I’m less wary and powerfully intrigued. </p><p>Despite the “4” in the title, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> represents a soft reset for the franchise. You play as Yakumo, a ninja of the Raven Clan, who must save Tokyo from corruption. The game feels like a hack-and-slash beat ‘em up with extreme emphasis on the hacking and slashing. Yakumo uses a number of weapons and abilities at his disposal, including swords, throwing knives, and an ability that briefly transforms him into a demonic raven for an extra burst of power. </p><p>My time with the demo was short, consisting of Yakumo ninja-flipping through ruined city streets, fighting packs of cybernetic demons. In combat, you can string together attacks, producing visually impressive combos. One of the things that I most appreciated about the combat system was that it included one of my favorite moves in any action game — an air recovery ability. If you’re hit into the air, you can quickly tap a button to right yourself and get back into the fight rather than get knocked away. Whoever at Team Ninja / PlatinumGames is a <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> fan, I see you.</p><p>Also, along the way, I encountered a number of Yakumo’s allies (including one voiced by Brandon “<a href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Garrus_Vakarian">Garrus Vakarian</a>” Keener, whose voice I’d know anywhere) who introduced me to the world, giving me power-ups and combat advice.</p><p>This game is bloody, cartoonishly so. Once I’ve whittled down my enemies’ health, I can dismember them in a number of increasingly brutal ways. It was so over the top that it veered into absurd territory, and I found myself laughing out loud in an otherwise quiet demo room. I wondered if the tension between the hardcore seriousness of Yakumo and his friends versus the goofy violence was intentional, but according to the developers, the game is working as intended.</p><p>“<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> has always been known as a very violent game, but we didn’t want to just make it grotesque,” says Yuji Nakao, game producer and director at PlatinumGames, speaking through a translator. “Because if we did that, you’d get tired of it.”</p><p>Team Ninja partnered with PlatinumGames to develop the title, and the inclusion of the studio that made <em>Bayonetta</em> informs a bit of that tonal dissonance. <em>Bayonetta </em>is campy and fun, and I can see elements of that camp in <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>.</p><p>“When we were working with PlatinumGames,” says Masakazu Hirayama, the producer and director at Team Ninja. “We wanted to bring their unique style approach to the action genre and inject that into the series.”</p><p>Unless you count ports, remasters, or spinoffs, it’s been more than 12 years since the last original title in the <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> series. In that time, a new crop of gamers, who are probably more familiar with <em>Bayonetta</em>, have come up. Meanwhile, there’s still an older generation running around with memories of Ryu Hayabusa and <em>Ninja Gaiden Black</em>. The result of the partnership between PlatinumGames and Team Ninja is a game that has elements that’ll appeal to different generations of players.</p><p>“<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> is about having a very diverse tool set that allows you to feel like that ultimate super ninja,” says Hirayama. “And I think you’ll see that the new protagonist and his new tool set opens up a lot of new possibilities.”</p><p>The new game may not seem like the most exciting of titles if you’re not a long-time fan of the series. But my skepticism of the game was slashed away in the face of an over-the-top gorefest that seems to take itself seriously but is hiding a soft, goofy center that wound up being really fun to play. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> comes out on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on October 21st.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You gotta nail that snappy, arcadey, precise, but still fun and exaggerated skateboarding feel that people have loved since the first game launched back in 1999. And <em>THPS 3+4</em> feels wonderful.</p><p>It definitely helps that developer Iron Galaxy has built this new remake on top of the old <em>THPS 1+2</em> foundation. But if it ain’t broke (and <em>THPS 1+2 </em>wasn’t), don’t fix it. Within ten minutes, I had my <em>THPS</em> legs back under me and was effortlessly flipping, grinding, manualing, and hopping around the two maps included in the demo.

I want to play the whole thing right now.</p><p>Meanwhile, much better digital skaters than I are already pulling off sick high-score combos in the demo’s levels. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/iBIAJuGn51U&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/iBIAJuGn51U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s someone nailing an insane 219 million point combo in Foundry</a></span>. </p><p>And here’s another person pulling off a sick 105 million combo in College. In both cases, the players are using lines and tricks that worked back in the original games, a testament to how perfectly <em>THPS 3+4</em> has nailed the feel of the old games, as well as making sure the fancy-looking levels still play (mostly) like you remember. </p><p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 </em>launches July 11 on <em>*deep breath* </em>PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Switch 2, and PC.<br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Got it? Now replace it with the Illuminate Stingray. When these pesky flying headaches spawn, they zoom in from the edge of the map, slowing down momentarily to launch a barrage of lasers in your direction, then speed off into the sunset. If you’re quick enough, when they slow down, you can hit them with a high-powered weapon, likely a support weapon, to take one down.</p><p>While they’re speedy, Stingrays don’t have much in the way of armor. The moment they stop, swap to your heavy weapon and unleash hell. Even if all you have is your primary, you can still take one down, but it’ll take longer and likely a more concerted effort from the team.</p><h2 id="h92794"><a id="2"></a>Best weapons to use against Interlopers</h2><figure id="" data-id="09dd28d2c6fd1e0d98e9a980d78dfc3d" data-recommend-id="image://09dd28d2c6fd1e0d98e9a980d78dfc3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Recoilless Rifle in Helldivers 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Recoilless Rifle in Helldivers 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Arrowhead Game Studios / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="09dd28d2c6fd1e0d98e9a980d78dfc3d" data-recommend-id="image://09dd28d2c6fd1e0d98e9a980d78dfc3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Recoilless Rifle in Helldivers 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As previously mentioned, your primary weapon would suffice in a pinch, but you’ll want to rely on your heavy support weapon more often than not.

This expansion—the largest one for the open-world RPG—features a land of madness under the unyielding control of Sheogorath. It’s a beautiful world, yet so immensely wrong. But that’s why this DLC is one of the best in the franchise, so no matter how many hours you may have already put into the main story and the main world, you don’t want to miss this expansion. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

In a statement on social media, the studio said it's partnered with Aston Martin, Coca-Cola, Orlebar Brown, HermanMillerGaming, Jaguar, Range Rover Defender, Omega, Nvidia, and Leica.</p><p>The James Bond movie series is known for its product placement, and 007: First Light will have some, too. The reveal trailer showed an Aston Martin DBS and some flashy Omega watches. A Triumph motorcycle was in the trailer, too, but Triumph is not listed as a partner. A Range Rover Defender was in the trailer, too. Walther, the gun company that makes Bond's iconic PPK, is not listed as a partner.</p><p>The financial terms of the deals to include these brands in First Light are unknown.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-the-official-option-is-a-solid-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Carry Case 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e8139320c8ea3/review-nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-2-cases-to-carry-and-protect-your-console">carry cases</a>, many people swear by 'official' options, and with good reason; when Nintendo is tasked with making a case for its own console, you'd assume the company would produce a decent product.</p>
<p>That's certainly true of the official Nintendo Switch 2 Carry Case ($39.99 / £20.99), which is one of the two options currently being offered by Nintendo itself (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-gives-us-a-closer-look-at-switch-2s-all-in-one-carrying-case">the second is a larger, all-in-one option that costs a bit more</a>).</p>
<p>Described by Nintendo as "stylish and sturdy", this case is certainly robust enough to prevent your shiny new console from bumps and scratches on the road, but it's not in the same league as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects">Genki Sleeper Case</a> with its "virtually indestructible" shell.</p>
<p>It also loses out to Genki's offering by only having space for six Game Cards inside (the Sleeper Case has 18 slots), although the official NS2 case has a small compartment for storing items like the Joy-Con 2 wrist straps, which is a bonus.</p>

<p>It's also smaller than the Genki Sleeper Case, and provides a snugger fit for your Switch 2, thanks to the fact that Nintendo isn't expecting you to have an additional case (like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Genki Attack Vector</a>) installed. Oh, and the zipper mechanism is <em>much</em> easier to use, too, but it doesn't provide water resistance, like on Genki's case.</p>
<p>While Nintendo claims this is a stylish option, I'd argue it's rather understated—which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as many people don't want to broadcast that they're carrying a game console around with them. The front of the case has the Switch 2 logo, while Nintendo's iconic logo is found on the back. The only other design element of note is the blue and orange zipper handles, which mimic the colour accents of the left and right Joy-Con 2 controllers.</p>
<p>You also get a screen protector bundled with this case, the installation of which is totally optional. I don't tend to bother with screen protectors as I'm super careful with my tech, but it's a handy bonus item if you find you don't feel comfortable without having one fitted.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there's not a lot more to add here. This is a slimline, strong and reasonably attractive case which won't totally break the bank, and I'd imagine Nintendo will sell plenty of them—but if you're looking for something that provides best-in-class protection, you might want to seek out alternative options.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-switch-2-pro-controller-is-pro-enough-for-me.1214844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The new $84.99 Pro Controller for the Switch 2 may not be your idea of a pro-grade controller — perhaps not by a long shot. But it’s certainly more of one than Nintendo’s $69.99 last-gen controller. It has two extra buttons embedded into its grips (one on each side), which can be programmed on a per-game basis, a 3.5mm headphone jack for listening to games or GameChat chatter, and a more premium look and feel. It’s no <a href="http://l/">DualSense Edge</a>, but it’s pro enough for me.</p><p>I like that Nintendo kept almost everything the same from its predecessor, except the semi-transparent smoke black shell that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/6/14825944/nintendo-thank-you-message-switch-pro-controller">hid a secret message</a>: the Fisher Price-sized face buttons, the snappy directional pad, and the compact form factor are all here. I don’t want to generalize, but its size might be perfect for the same crowd who yearns for small phones, those who typically experience hand pain from using the controllers that Sony or Microsoft put out. It has the other trappings that made the last-gen Pro controller worth buying, like Amiibo NFC support and motion controls.</p><p>In terms of what’s new in the Switch 2-edition of the Pro Controller, I hope you weren’t holding your breath for eight years waiting for Hall effect or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR</a> joysticks because they aren’t here. Instead, we have drift-prone potentiometer joysticks again, albeit some of the smoothest and quietest ones that I’ve ever used. There’s so little resistance required to move them, yet they don’t easily register unintentional inputs. We’ll see how well they fare over time. For what it’s worth, my original Pro Controller from 2017 is still kicking.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->84</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Small and comfortable to use</li><li>Great rear button implementation</li><li>Audio via 3.5mm jack…finally</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>No drift-proof joysticks</li></ul></div></div></div><p>This controller, like the Switch 2’s right Joy-Con, features a dedicated GameChat button. This button launches the namesake feature, which is free for all Switch 2 owners to use through March 31st, 2026, when it will be gated behind the Nintendo Switch Online paywall. The good news for this controller is, whether you want to use GameChat now or ever, you can reprogram the “C” button to do whatever you’d like it to do. You won’t lose out on GameChat functionality, as there’s a dedicated home menu option for the feature.</p><p>The new controller offers some conveniences not found in the predecessor, which may tempt you into upgrading. As mentioned, the Switch 2 Pro Controller has a 3.5mm headphone jack, from which it can output game and GameChat audio to wired headphones or a headset. The ability to stream audio wirelessly from the console to the controller is a big deal for Nintendo, even though it already figured it out in the Wii U Gamepad. <strong>Note</strong>: the LED player indicator has been moved to the top of the Switch 2 Pro Controller to make room for the 3.5mm jack. </p><p>Another, albeit smaller, feature is the ability to wake up the Switch 2 console from sleep with the new Pro Controller. This seems like a sneaky way for Nintendo to bait players into upgrading their last-gen controllers. Wake from sleep is a basic feature, one that shouldn’t be limited to this controller. It’s handy if you typically play your Switch while it’s docked to your TV. Wake from sleep wasn’t utilized in most third-party controllers during the original Switch era, but 8BitDo figured out a way to enable it by shaking some of its controllers. So, it’s always possible that there will soon be cheaper solutions that figure a way around this annoying issue.</p><div><div><p id="yes-your-dualsense-can-work-on-a-switch-2"><h2>Yes, your DualSense can work on a Switch 2</h2></p></div><p>If you buy the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Adapter-Controller-USB-Wireless/dp/B09ZQN76PC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">8BitDo USB Adapter 2</a>, update it via the <a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/firmware-updater.html">company’s app</a>, and plug it into your Switch 2, you can wirelessly connect a DualSense, a new Xbox controller, or a number of <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/usb-wireless-adapter-2/#:~:text=PS5%2C%20PS4%2C%20PS4%20Pro%2C%20PS3%20controllers">older models</a> to it. It’s a cheaper alternative to buying a new controller that gets you 75 percent of the functionality of a Switch Pro controller. There’s rumble, gyroscopic controls in games that support it (on DualSense, not the Xbox controller), and remappable controls. You’ll only be missing out on Amiibo support, 3.5mm audio passthrough, and the wake to sleep feature.</p></div><p>Both this controller and the new Joy-Con 2 feature what Nintendo calls HD Rumble 2, an improved version of the tactile rumble introduced with the original Switch. I already thought HD Rumble was nifty in some use cases, and my opinion hasn’t changed as I’ve played <em>Mario Kart World</em> and Switch 2 Edition of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. HD Rumble seemed novel, if not a bit gimmicky, until the introduction of the DualSense and its brilliant haptics in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537067/astros-playroom-ps5-dualsense-hands-on-preview"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a> and in several other titles since. The new Switch 2 haptics aren’t on the same level, at least in the launch games.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The GL and GR buttons are arguably my favorite implementation of rear paddles in a controller. While most companies put them on the backside of the gamepad, a place where I rarely rest my fingers, these are curved, wrapping around the grips where my middle fingers naturally rest. Pressing them requires essentially no effort — you don’t even need to arch your fingers to tap the buttons. It’s easy enough to press them in with the meat of my second knuckle by applying some downward pressure. It rules.</p><p>If any of the aforementioned additions sound appealing to you, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is probably worth its cost. Yes, I wish it had more futureproof joysticks, and perhaps another feature or two to justify its tariff-boosted price (it was originally $79.99). It’s very likely that third-party controller manufacturers like 8BitDo, GameSir, GuliKit, and others will make options with most, if not all, of the same features at a lower price – so while the Switch 2 Pro Controller is the best option right now, that might not always be the case. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It also features a cryptocurrency token that can be bought with real money and spent on in-game purchases. (EVE Online has had the ability to buy its subscription token, PLEX, with real money and sell it for in-game money for a while now, so that specific aspect isn't new.) I am highly skeptical, personally, of these kinds of rotating Silicon Valley hype words, and nothing CCP has said to me so far has made me less so, as a rule.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">EVE Frontier - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But I do believe, based on the conversations I've had with these devs, that they are genuinely interested in the tech primarily on the basis of the gameplay features it might enable. I asked a lot of hard questions, and don't think they're trying to drum up investment capital by invoking magic words or cash in on some kind of crypto rug-pull. Their faith in this tech might be misplaced, in my opinion. But I think their desire to leverage it is generally in good faith.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I do believe, based on the conversations I've had with these devs, that they are genuinely interested in the tech primarily on the basis of the gameplay features it might enable.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">CEO Hilmar Pétursson told me that the intent with putting Frontier on the chain was that if, for instance, a meteor were to hit their offices in Reykjavik, the universe they, and we, created could persist without them. It also opens the door for CCP to step back from being active administrators some day and simply be another organization within the decentralized EVE Frontier ecosystem. On the topic of environmental concerns, I was assured repeatedly that using "proof of stake" verification, it was possible to run Frontier's blockchain elements using about the same amount of energy as the traditional EVE Online servers that have been up for years. I don't know enough about the tech involved to independently verify this, but it's what I was told.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the day, it is what it is. So let's move on to how Frontier actually plays.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>A DARK FOREST</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While EVE Online started with large areas of high security space populated by NPC factions with their own laws and police, Frontier is exactly what it says in the name: an entirely fresh canvas of wild space with no rules but the ones we make and enforce as players. We're still controlling spaceships in third person, making jumps between star systems to collect resources and craft industrial stations, consumables, and equipment, and shooting at NPC baddies or other players with lasers and rockets. It feels very familiar, moment-to-moment, as a long-time EVE player. One big exception is that combat is a bit more intuitive and complex now with obstacles like asteroids being able to block weapon fire realistically based on their precise shapes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone starts out in your own dark corner of the galaxy with a single ship and a home base, beginning a journey to tame the stellar wilderness from square one. When I asked the devs if they thought players would eventually build their own permanent civilizations, maybe up to and including something like EVE Online's Concord, they told me the potential is definitely there. But there is a certain level of added attrition in Frontier, partly in the form of terrifying, wandering world bosses that take the shape of rogue AI – hulking, almost Lovecraftian metallic beasts in the black with unknown motives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Frontier also aims to be a moddable MMO, which might sound like a strange prospect. Initially, much of what you build in the 3D world will be restricted to remixing premade assets. You won't be able to import your own meshes from Blender, for instance, though that restriction may not last forever. But we were shown a lot of ways players could push the boundaries of the genre and their own imaginations.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>HIGHWAY TO SPACE HELL</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One way this manifests is in the gate network, which will be entirely player-built. You could set up your own interstellar highway connecting what will initially be isolated star systems, and even charge in-game resources or crypto tokens to use them. Of course, there's nothing necessarily stopping another player from building their own bypass right next to yours with lower tolls or even for free. You also don't have to ask for resources at all. You could make other players solve a riddle or follow you on social media to use your gates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously I can imagine many dystopian permutations of this kind of libertarian space sandbox. More than anything, it kind of reminds me of Minecraft anarchy servers like the infamous 2b2t. And when I asked Pétursson if CCP's lawyers thought he was crazy, he very matter-of-factly confirmed that they do. But CCP is trusting that the players will be the ones to self-police the worst excesses.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If McDonalds were to come in and try to establish a stargate network that required you to watch a commercial for their new combo meal every five jumps, they would also need to provide their own around-the-clock security or anti-corpo player federations could simply come in and blow it all up. To what extent these brands might find it's worth hiring mercenaries in a video game to protect their ad buys remains to be seen. And there is something fascinating about that, I have to admit.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The one thing CCP will not ever allow modification of, the bedrock upon which this universe sits, is its laws of physics.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The one thing CCP will not ever allow modification of, the bedrock upon which this universe sits, is its laws of physics. A ship still has mass and will behave like something with mass would, even if you make it look like pregnant Sonic the Hedgehog. And anything you build will still ultimately require a supply chain that can be traced back to mining matter from black hole clusters. If you want to use your real-world riches to buy a bunch of tokens and bootstrap an in-game empire, you'll still need to buy those finite resources from players who took the time to gather them, at market rates. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. There's no way of bypassing that.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>SEE YOU ON THE FRONTIER</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">EVE Frontier is, if nothing else, an intriguing experiment in the making. It could be an absolute trash fire, and I remain actively wary of its blockchain and cryptocurrency elements. But I did have fun playing the small bit of it we got access to, and it is an enticing invitation to settle and develop fresh empires in a blank slate galaxy with no major NPC factions to work around. But if you don't want to take my word for it, you can try it out yourself with one of Frontier's paid Founder packages right now.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's a big day for Rainbow Six Siege, as the game's "largest and most transformative" update in the game's 10-year history is out now, free for everyone on all platforms.</p><p>The update, Siege X, includes a new onboarding experience to help newcomers familiarize themselves with the game. It also introduces improved graphics and sound designs, along with updated features like new destructible items such as gas pipes and fire extinguishers. The Siege X update also "modernizes" the Clubhouse, Chalet, Border, Bank, and Kafe maps with new lighting, shadows, and resolution updates, with Ubisoft planning these "modernization" updates for three 5v5 maps with each new season going ahead.</p><p>What's more, Siege X adds the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dual-front-brings-fast-paced-6v6-action-to-rainbow-six-siege/1100-6530104/" data-ref-id="1100-6530104">Dual Front 6v6 mode</a>, which is a respawning mode that challenges players to seize enemy territories. It is available only for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI9fgQY0d5I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BI9fgQY0d5I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Beyond this, the game gets an anti-cheat boost with the introduction of R6 ShieldGuard, which is described as a "multifaceted approach to anti-cheat."</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege and the Siege X update are available for free, but players have to pay to unlock things like additional operators and Ranked playlists. Players can alternatively buy the Elite edition ($20) or the Ultimate edition ($40) to get access to even more content.</p><p>All of this is arriving alongside the newest seasonal update, Operation Daybreak, the centerpiece of which is a remaster for the operator Clash. The soldier's CCE shield is now deployable, meaning she can place it strategically. The Operation Daybreak season also makes balance changes, including electricity no longer dealing damage and limb damage being reduced. The Jackal, Sledge, Thunderbird, Jäger, and Blackbeard operators have all received balance updates, too.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege originally launched in 2015 and has been steadily supported and evolved over time with consistent updates. It's reached 85 million players prior to the Siege X update.</p>

<p>The company isn't quite done with the game, however, and we can reveal that the first upcoming content update will contain a remade track from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. You might be able to recognise it from the image above, but for those unaware, the track is <strong>Alpine Trust.</strong></p>
<p>Shin'en has confirmed that it will boast revamped visuals and gameplay elements. It's also confirmed that this is just "one of the courses" in the upcoming update, but the total number is unknown for now.</p><p><figure data-videoid="NK1xJVeVTDM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5b9621qpvyjz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1xJVeVTDM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>In addition to the new tracks, Shin'en will be adding in a new graphics mode simply dubbed 'PURE'. In response to fan feedback regarding the slightly 'blurry' visuals, this will remove anti-aliasing and reprojection from the image, producing a much cleaner presentation.</p>
<p>There's no specific release date for the new content, but we suspect this will be launching sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>For now, Fast Fusion is well worth checking out if you're a fan of racing series like <strong>WipEout</strong> and <strong>F-Zero</strong>. It builds upon what Fast RMX accomplished on the Switch 1 with much-improved visuals, a new jump mechanic, and a Fusion feature in which you can combine two vehicles into something completely new.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>All sequels have to live up to their predecessors in some form, but few have as daunting a task as <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It’s a follow-up to the best-selling game across Nintendo’s last two console generations, and a game that eventually doubled in size thanks to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23941695/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-6-dlc-tracks-release-date-characters">an ambitious array of downloadable add-ons</a>. So instead of following <em>Mario Kart 8</em> with another release that simply adds more, Nintendo shifted in a slightly different direction. <em>Mario Kart World</em> is still <em>Mario Kart</em>; it has a daunting Rainbow Road to speed across and frustrating blue shells to steal victories away from you. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/678097/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-interview-kosuke-yabuki">But it also introduces an open-world structure that makes the game feel larger and more cohesive</a>. This makes it the ideal game to show off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682661/nintendo-switch-2-early-hands-on-mario-kart-world">what the Switch 2 is capable of at launch</a>.</p><p>The biggest change for <em>World</em> is its structure. In all past <em>Mario Kart</em> games, racetracks were discrete entities. Baby Park and Bowser’s Castle had nothing to do with each other. But for <em>World</em>, the entirety of the game takes place on a singular landmass with different areas and biomes, like the map in <em>Fortnite</em>. And because of this, everything is connected. When you race through Grand Prix mode, you go through four tracks that cut a specific path through the continent, one following the other.</p><p>At first, this gave me a sense that the tracks were less distinct and singular, because they bled into one another. At the start of the Choco Mountain track, for instance, you start out in the quaint green fields of Moo Moo Meadows, because that course comes before it. And it isn’t until the second lap that you actually get to the mountains. But eventually I came to enjoy the fluidity of the track design, and how it gave the feeling of a larger overall world.</p><p>I’m not sure if this structure is necessarily better than the more straightforward racetracks of past games, and it’s certainly a change that takes some getting used to. But it ended up winning me over, in part because of how different it feels, and how much I’m enjoying playing the same tracks repeatedly to find all of the details and paths.</p><p>The structure also gives rise to my favorite addition to <em>World</em>: a new mode called Knockout Tour. It’s sort of like a battle royale version of <em>Mario Kart</em>. Instead of a handful of distinct races, you’re ushered through a series of six connected tracks without stopping. At certain points throughout the race, a gate appears, and any racer behind the position noted on the gate will be knocked out. This progresses until only one kart rider remains. I’ve been playing <em>Mario Kart</em> for decades, but Knockout Tour still managed to create a new kind of thrill in me, one strengthened by its longer runtime and harsh win conditions. It also makes for a great spectator experience. It’s a lot of fun watching people <em>just</em> make it over the line.</p><p>There are other new features in the game. That includes new weapons like an ice flower for tossing snowballs at other racers, or a mushroom that turns you into a giant that can squash your enemies. You can pick up food at drive-through restaurants for a speed boost (and costume change), and grind on rails and ride on walls, though I’ve yet to master either of those high-level techniques just yet. And the cast of racers is gigantic this time, expanded even further by all of the different outfits you can unlock for characters like Peach and Waluigi.</p><p>These elements go a long way to making <em>World </em>feel like a proper sequel. But again, it’s the world at the heart of <em>World</em> that makes it feel truly new — and like a showcase for Nintendo’s latest hardware. <em>World</em>’s courses are larger and more intricate, with lots of alternate pathways, but they’re also a lot more chaotic. The game features 24 people per race, instead of the previous 12, and there always seems to be something or someone blowing up on screen. You can drive on water now, and that often means racing across massive cresting waves, and many of the stages are teeming with wildlife, from lumbering dinosaurs to herds of zebras. The levels aren’t just big, they’re alive, dense with things to see and interact with (and avoid being hit by).</p><p>And yet, in my experience, the game always ran smooth and solid. This was true when playing online (both in handheld and docked modes), as well as in four-player split-screen, in which there is frankly too much information happening onscreen at once. It is the definition of chaos. But it also worked perfectly.</p><p>Of course, <em>World</em> isn’t an open world in the same way that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021082/red-dead-redemption-2-review-xbox-one-ps4"><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> are. It’s not a dynamic space filled with things to do and people to see. But it’s surprisingly close for a family-friendly racing game where you can ride a motorcycle as a dolphin. The weather and time of day shift, and there’s a new Free Roam mode where you can simply drive around the map, exploring with zero pressure. There isn’t a whole lot to do aside from some straightforward challenge missions scattered about, but I’ve spent a long time simply observing Nintendo’s strange creation. At one point, I realized that the city buses actually stopped to let Shy Guys and Toads on and off. It’s a completely unnecessary detail, but one that goes to show how thought-out this place is.</p><p>There are a handful of minor issues with the game — unlocking characters relies too much on luck, and it’s a weird miss to not have the Free Roam mode support split-screen play — but the scale, density, and cohesiveness of <em>World</em> are more than enough to make them easy to look past. <em>Mario Kart 8</em> was such a high bar that Nintendo couldn’t simply do that again. Instead, the game’s designers created something much more interesting: a place that feels vibrant and alive. Now you just have to race through it.</p><p><sub>Mario Kart World <em>is available now on the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s worth remembering that Wizards doesn’t make any money from the second-hand market. Outside of wanting to gin up FOMO to artificially inflate demand, there’s no reason for the company not to just print as many cards as people actually want to buy. </p><p>That seemingly sound logic doesn’t appear to be applying to the regular <em>Final Fantasy</em> Universes Beyond set either, at least not yet. Officially launching on June 13, there’s no word on when re-prints for the best-selling expansion ever will start pouring back into stores. Rumors have suggested as early as July while others have suggested a worst-case scenario of <em>Final Fantasy MTG</em> cards <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1l7d5z8/no_final_fantasy_reprints_expected_until_q4_2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1l7d5z8/no_final_fantasy_reprints_expected_until_q4_2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being sold out until the mid-fall</a></span>.

In addition to its hotline, Trans Lifeline runs a microgrant program that provides support for gender-affirming care, defrays legal costs for incarcerated trans people, and assists trans migrants in navigating immigration systems.</p><p>The organization has long operated on a very restricted budget, relying primarily on individual donations of both money and volunteer hours and employing only a small staff. Trans Lifeline has become increasingly crucial as a provider of nationwide resources for LGBTQ communities, as the US federal government has taken steps to eliminate federal support programs and <a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/lgbtq/federal-government-plans-to-cut-funding-for-crisis-lifelines-lgbtq-youth-services" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cease federal funding for organizations that provide LGBTQ-focused services</a>.</p><p>In addition to Devolver, many members of the gaming community have lately been active in bringing awareness to the vital role that LGBTQ charities like Trans Lifeline play today. For instance, Magic: The Gathering YouTubers have <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/trans-lifeline-giveaway-tolarian-community-college-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Trans Lifeline</a> this year.</p>

<p><em>Warning: This article contains spoilers for Xenoblade Chronicles, so be wary if you haven't at least made it to the final hours of the game</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Bionis and Mechonis. Two great titans, eternally locked in battle until time wore them both away and left them in stasis. Two corpses, dead, but home to various living races, whose populations are at war with one another.</p>
<p>This is the setting for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/xenoblade_chronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a>, a world that has become forever etched in my memory. Monolith Soft’s Wii game completely tore up the rulebook as to what an RPG 'world' could be. Planets, islands, recreations of real-life countries – who needs any of those when you can set your entire game on the carcasses of two gods? I’ve spent over a decade and a half marvelling at all the different worlds I’d thought impossible until this game came along. But still, the Bionis and the Mechonis, and the simple dichotomy of nature and technology, has always remained at the top.</p>

<p>I’ll always remember the first time I walked out of Tephra Caves and into the huge, sprawling fields of Gaur Plains, where stone plateaus tower over acres of grass and rivers. And you’ll never speak to anyone who didn’t awe at the nighttime glow of Satorl Marsh. But for all of its spectacular moments and enticingly creative landscape, my favourite place in Xenoblade Chronicles remains its 'quietest': the Fallen Arm.</p>
<p>The Fallen Arm isn’t the first place people think of when you talk about Xenoblade, unless that person is me. The beautiful, dangerous landscapes of the Bionis rightly take centre stage, but the Fallen Arm — the severed left arm of the Mechanical titan’s body — might be the most important place in the game. Not for its simple beauty, its serene, sorrowful music, or its brief moment of respite, but for its <em>place</em> in the story and the tonal shift that takes place.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent themes in Xenoblade Chronicles is revenge, and for about half of the game’s runtime, protagonist Shulk’s rage in particular propels the plot forward. It’s hard to shake the opening hours, where Shulk’s childhood friend and love interest Fiora is brutally murdered by the Mechon Metal Face, particularly as he removes his blood-soaked claws from her 'corpse'. It's this that sets Shulk’s — and Xenoblade’s — quest for vengeance in motion.</p>
<p>From the Organic titan’s foot all the way to its neck, it’s a constant barrage of anger and suffering, of revenge against these supposed bloodthirsty mechanical enemies. Until you reach Prison Island, where you find out Fiora isn’t dead. Instead, she’s been turned half-Mechon, and she doesn’t remember her friends.</p>
<p>That revenge doesn’t go away, but it is joined by a desperation to find out <em>why</em> Fiora is how she is throughout the arm (Valak Mountain) and Mechonis’ sword (Sword Valley), where the Mechon stronghold of Galahad Fortress sits. There, Fiora’s consciousness manages to break through, and in a desperate attempt to save Shulk from certain death, destroys the fortress.</p>

<p>A few cutscenes and a sepia flashback later, Shulk awakens on the serene shores of an unfamiliar location, with a gigantic, collapsed claw protruding out of the sands, and the remains of Fiora’s mech, the nemesis, left in tatters in the waters. This isn’t how I’d expected to arrive on the Mechonis — a blistering attack or kidnapping into a huge mechanical structure had played out in my head multiple times, but a calm, quiet beach was far from my mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was the moment Xenoblade Chronicles went from a game I loved to a game that was <em>special</em> to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we get to see Shulk and Fiora together again. We get to see him fluctuate from fear to focused concern as he pulls her limp body out of the water and saves her life by giving her water and mouth to mouth. <em>Finally</em>, the awkward, kind Shulk is back again, for a brief moment.</p>
<p>Fiora, and the Fallen Arm, bring a new side to the plot that the game had gone great lengths to hide – empathy, not just for the Homs, Nopon, and High Entia, but also for the Machina, the residents of Mechonis. There was no other way to <em>arrive</em> in Mechonis — a place that has suffered just as much as the Bionis — than a peaceful, calm beach, populated by the very people who are supposed to be our enemies, but aren’t.</p>
<p>This was the moment Xenoblade Chronicles went from a game I loved to a game that was <em>special</em> to me.</p>

<p>Reuniting with my lost party members, discovering the Hidden Machina Village and its rusty walls and pipe pathways, meeting Linada, Miqol, and all the other Machina and finding out why they’re not fighting for, or with, Egil — the leader of the Mechon army — few other moments in the game have stuck with me as clearly as these. And the quests for the Machina in the village that you get for the rest of the game help develop relationships that hate and anger would never foster. It’s a stepping stone towards Xenoblade Chronicles’ eventual fight for hope, and for a united future.</p>
<p>Fiora can’t bring herself to hate the person who was inhabiting her body because she was kind, but Shulk’s immediate reaction is anger. She sways him against that path for a moment, and Shulk remains his more level-headed self. As Miqol, leader of the Machina Village, asks Shulk and his party to kill Egil, his son, I felt the weight of that decision, the impact of those words.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about revenge, it’s about pain, too. And this tiny little metallic haven in the centre of the Mechonis’ collapsed claw is where so much <em>forgotten</em>, unchecked pain has lain.</p>

<p>Revenge hasn’t gone away at this point, but those bubbling questions I had from Prison Island all the way to Galahad Fortress were now effervescent at the top of the pool. The threads of vengeance were fraying, waiting to be re-knotted in a new strand that becomes obvious at the top of Agniratha and the Mechonis’ head. This isn't the Machina's fault, it’s not Egil’s fault — who himself is a victim of rage and revenge — but it’s those who are in charge of the world who are to blame. The eternal battle that the gods went through, and later the people, is the cause of the pain.</p>
<p>Without the Fallen Arm, Xenoblade Chronicles’ tonal shift just isn’t possible. This beautiful, understated landscape serves as the gentle bonfire that will spark the rest of the game’s events. From here on out, everything I’d understood was slowly flipping on its head, and it made me look at past events in a new light.</p>
<p>It also paved the way for those questions of faith and philosophy that Tetsuya Takahashi, Monolith Soft’s head and one of the writers on the game, is so well known for, which he’d established in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/xenogears">Xenogears</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/xenosaga_i_and_ii">Xenosaga</a> before. No longer was Xenoblade Chronicles a strictly angry game with a beautifully crafted world to explore – it evolved into one that was chiefly concerned with people, no matter their background, of Godhood and responsibility, of power and corruption.</p>

<p>The beautiful images of this series’ worlds will stick with me forever; Mira, Alrest, and Aionios all have mesmeric qualities to them, biomes full of mystical plants, unusual fauna, crumbling buildings, and glowing corals and structures, that all deserve to be celebrated.</p>
<p>But the Bionis and Mechonis go beyond sheer beauty and awe; they're the conduit for a plot structure that follows a journey up and down two bodies in stasis, an emotional up and down of loss, revenge, hate, relief, fear, empathy, and hope. And all aided by a rusted, broken arm that lay in the seas and sands.</p>

			<p>SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national">announced</a> that it has reached a tentative deal with video game companies over the Interactive Media contract, potentially bringing the voice actors' strike to an end.</p>
<p>Performers under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA) have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-now-in-effect-due-to-ai-concerns-potentially-leading-to-game-delays/">on strike since July 2024</a>, with the main sticking point being protections from companies abusing generative AI technology to use an actor's voice in perpetuity, without having to compensate them after the first contract agreement, or get consent from the actor to use an AI-generated version of their voice for future projects.</p>
<p>Now, a tentative deal has been reached, which SAG-AFTRA's national chief executive director and chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, says "<em>puts in place the necessary A.I. guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains.</em>"</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher added, "<em>Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world’s most lucrative industries. Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal. The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before. As soon as this is ratified we roll up our sleeves and begin to plan the next negotiation. Every contract is a work in progress and progress is the name of the game.</em>"</p>
<p>Once the details of the deal have been finalized, which is expected to happen "<em>soon</em>," the strike will end<em>. </em>Performers under the IMA are still on strike until such time.</p>

At Summer Game Fest we got to sit down with <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>, continuing the story of Will and adding a whole lot more challenge to his adventure.</p>

<p>My time with the game caught me up on Will's story, seeking to adventure and raise money in the small town of Rynoka, as well as set up where we meet the characters at the beginning of the adventure. After opening the 5th dungeon, learning they were connected to alternate dimensions, they were tricked by Morloch the Interdimensional Collector who kicked them out of Ryoka.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-bartering-and-shop.jpg?itok=Jy3dbPKp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-bartering-and-shop.jpg?itok=oyX1PHmQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Now in a completely new and quite harsh location, Will works for Ms Scratch, a strange woman who owns a shop, and she's ready for Will to start making as much money as possible as soon as possible.</p>

<p>This demo was an efficient and effective tutorial. Within moments, you're thrown into combat, have to explore a wasteland, and return to sell your wares. After your first dive you're introduced to a mysterious sentient cube that introduces her/itself as the Endless Vault, from there you're challenged to recover goods enough to gather a large sum of gold.</p>

<p>Combat is a fast-paced hack-and-slash where you'll push to get deeper and deeper into each dungeon with every event. Along the way you'll encounter different 'arenas' where you'll take on enemies, claim a reward, and progress to the next room.</p>

<p>There was some very interesting modifications to each of the runs that I was able to try including causing hazardous effects to deal additional damage or effects, or that certain locations you could travel to as you dungeon crawled would be inhabited by more difficult enemies. The battles would be more difficult, but the reward even greater.</p>

<p>Exploring the town, there were a number of shopkeepers with interesting-looking signs that lent themselves to the idea that, as the story progresses,d there would be a lot to do in terms of upgrading your equipment, abilities, and capacity for items.</p>

<p>In every way this experience felt like <em>Moonlighter </em>but bigger and better. If you were a fan of the original game, or like the idea of a roguelite with a very robust gameplay loop then you should 100% try <em>Moonlighter 2 </em>and it's available demo.</p>
