              <p>Popular streamer Charles White Jr., aka Cr1TiKal/MoistCr1TiKaL, that long-haired dude who seems to be a pretty good person, has taken the unusual step of shutting off his YouTube memberships and Super Chats. Instead of prompting his viewers to throw money at the screen, he’s instead urging folks to donate to charity. “There are so many better options for your money,” he said.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/there-are-so-many-better-options-for-your-money-popular-streamer-turns-off-all-donation-tells-fans-to-give-to-charity/">first reported by <i>VGC</i></a>, White has posted a video announcing that he’s shut off user-donated monetization on his YouTube channel, and saying that he’d shut off Twitch subs as well if he could. “I would say toodle-oo, give it a strong slap on the ass, tell it good game and goodbye.” But apparently it’s harder than that. Still, he stressed that money spent on his stream could be put to better use:</p> <p>There are so many good charities doing extremely good work that could be benefited greatly from your contribution. Like maybe you’d want to donate to a charity that’s doing extremely important work in Gaza. That would be a significantly better use of that money than donating it to me.</p>

<p>The Haunted Masquerade in Overwatch 2 is the game’s latest Halloween event, bringing with it a new game mode, skins, and more content in a new season update.</p>



<p>While Overwatch was dealing with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/almost-half-of-players-who-quit-overwatch-jumped-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loss of players due to Marvel Rivals</a> about a year ago, the game has been making a resurgence with some great content updates, and this looks to be the latest.</p>



<p>Here is when the Haunted Masquerade starts in Overwatch 2 and all the content you can expect in it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-overwatch-2-haunted-masquerade">When is the Overwatch 2 Haunted Masquerade?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The new Stadium additions. Image by Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Haunted Masquerade Halloween event in Overwatch 2 begins on Tuesday, October 14, alongside the update to Season 19.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24232473/beware-a-haunted-masquerade-begins-in-season-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Season 19 in Overwatch 2</a> brings a bunch of Halloween content, like the Haunted Masquerade and the return of Junkenstein’s Revenge, as well as a mythic hero skin for Lifeweaver and a mythic weapon skin for Kiriko. For the first time, Junkrat will also receive a mythic hero skin when the midseason update happens in November.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-stadium-a-round-based-competitive-mode-that-borrows-from-deadlock-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Stadium mode</a> is getting three more heroes added to the mix in Hazard, Torbjorn, and Sojourn. Stadium is also getting a new shop item called gadgets that will help to turn the tide in your favor for battle.</p>



<p>Outside of that, you can expect the usual rotation of new skins and bundles in the shop themed around archangels and spirits.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-overwatch-2-haunted-masquerade-mode">What is the Overwatch 2 Haunted Masquerade Mode?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Be sure to have friends wear each other’s masks for a boost! Image by Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Haunted Masquerade in Overwatch 2 is a limited-time mode that allows players to first select the hero they want to play and then choose a mask of a different hero in the spawn room to gain a special ability for that match.</strong></p>



<p>After you select your mask, your hero will instantly get a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-adds-ability-altering-perks-brings-back-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small perk power-up</a>. For example, putting on a Genji mask will give whatever hero you are playing a double jump, or Reaper’s mask will heal you slightly as you deal damage to enemies.</p>



<p>That’s not all, though, as masks have a little extra surprise if you and a team member select lore-appropriate heroes. For example, if your team has Mei and Juno and they have each other’s masks, their ultimates will combine, bringing in an Orbital Ray boost to your teammates, while also having Blizzard freeze enemies in range.</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-crossover-release-date-all-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch 2</a> Halloween event looks to be a chaotic arcade mode that you and your friends can play throughout October. Be sure to experiment with the masks that work best for your chosen heroes and have fun out there.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-october-10</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's what's up and down this week (October 10).</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-where-to-buy-2025">Mega Evolution</a> has kicked off with a bang thanks to its base set releasing in the US recently, and it's single card market is doing some strange things right now. One things for sure, the majority of the top chase cards in this set are getting more affordable by the day. It seems that day one stock is getting better across the board, with The Pokémon Company seemingly printing newer sets into oblivion. The long term effects remain to be seen, but more cards being printed means less damage to your pocket.</p><p id="mega-evolution-crashers-and-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Evolution Crashers and Climbers">TL:DR; Mega Evolution Crashers and Climbers This Week</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gold Hyper Rare cards are the highest value cards in this set, with Mega Gardevoir ex (187/132) doubling in price compared to market value and Mega Lucario ex (188/132) kicking off high and currently settling at an insane $650 for the time being. There's some supprising Illustration Rare price rises in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-most-expensive-cards">Mega Evolution</a> too, with Helioptile (143/132) rising by 33.6% recently thanks to it's gorgeous artwork. <br>One thing is clear with Mega Evolution, Pokémon trainers and collectors aren't giving in to FOMO. Being able to wait for sealed product and chase cards vs. buying it straight at launch can be a money burner, and it looks like this sentiment is finally sinking in at this point in Pokémania 2025. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/feature-image-37-1760099343193.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/ao65eY?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lucario ex – 188/132</a> is currently going for $650 near mint, which is nearly $70 below it's current market value of $719.37. Whilst it's only a 9.7% drop, it's still a great saving right now and a sign that Gold Hyper Rare cards may settle at or below $600 mark throughout the Mega Evolution era of Pokémon TCG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Brave is a heaby hitter for 270 damage, but can't be used again next turn, so that's something to pull out when you're backed into a corner or need one more knock out. I'd much rather use Mega Lucario ex for energy recycling and building out the rest of my bench whilst dealing a solid 130 damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aADVd0?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Gardevoir ex – 178/132</a> is currently the highest valued Secret Art Rare at around $313, which is lower than the current market value of $317.08. That might not sound like a big deal, but these small dips can lead to big crashers and could indicate a price correction over the coming weeks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overflowing Wishes is great for getting Psychic energy to your benched Pokémon quickly, and it's artwork is classicly gorgeous. This is 100% a Pokémon card that would look amazing slabbed or in a chase card binder for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6DbX2?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Latias ex – 181/132</a> is currently valued at a much more modest $168.05, which is around $11 lower than it's current market value. Again it looks like the fandom are looking towards Gold Hyper Rare cards rather than SIRs in this era, but for me the artwork on this card wins out against the Hyper Rares floating around in this set. Mega Latias' speed and strength is captured perfectly in this artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's Strafe move takes this a step further by causing 40 damage and performing a switch out with a benched Pokémon, perfect for chipping away at opposing Pokémon early game, especially low HP ones. If you follow the switching strategy, Illusory Impulse discards all energy from Mega Latias and deals 300 damage when it counts. Cool or what?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEd07?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">My boy Mega Venusaur ex (177/132)</a> is giving out crashing energy by dropping around 6.2% to $217.97, but that's still a respectable value for an SIR. However, Mega Venusair is a very playable card, with Solar Transfer allowing trainers to move around grass energy during their turn, which is a fantastic ability and works well with Meganium from the same set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jungle Dump is both a hillarious move name and a cracking move, allowing to deal 240 damage and healing 30 damage from Mega Venusaur ex. That's why I love Venusaur, it's an absolute troll and always has a long game strategy about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QrApdG?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Kangaskhan ex (182/132) SIR</a> is also begginign its decent, running in at $91.48 compared to it's current market value of $94.20. The thing is, Kangaskhan doesn't have a massive following, so naturally it's pricing is going to reflect that. It's not very playable either thanks to trainers relying on coin flips for its main offensive move, however, Run Errand allows trainers to draw two cards per turn which is a bonus.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/feature-image-35-1760099499572.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKpB5?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Gardevoir ex – 187/132 Hyper Gold Rare</a> is currently doubling its market value at $600, which is frankly insane. It would however line up up with the other gold hyper rare in the set which is currently going for $650, which makes more sense. It is a ridiculously rare card all things considered, so this level of pricing just weeks after release isn't that much of a suprise. Whilst it's Overflowing Wishes and Mega Symphonia moves are cool, it's value is purely based of the regal presentation and rarity of this Gold Hyper Rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aXVdDx?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Helioptile – 143/132</a> is moving at a strong pace for an Illustration Rare. It's gorgeous artwork is the main draw here, and it's clearly warrants it's 50.6% climb to $8.90. It's a good idea to snap this one up before it gets higher, it's still a great price for an in-demand Illustration Rare. It's not got the best moved for a basic Pokémon, so this price hike is all about looks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbMnne?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lucario ex (179/132) SIR</a> is my top chase card of Mega Evolution just because it features Mega Lucario and Mega Venusaur in battle, two of my favorite Pokémon. It's gone up to $330, which is a rise of 14% from its $289.45 current market value. Something tells me i'm not the only one desperate for this chase card in my collection. Although I can't see anyone using this particular card in a deck, even though Mega Lucario's Mega Brave and Aura Jab moveset is a corker. Once again, this is all about looks, and the artwork here is spot on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z31bbq?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur (113/132)</a> comes in it's stunning Illustration Rare format and a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxx77m?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Evolution promo stamp alternative</a>. The stamped card can be found as a bonus in upgraded booster boxes, and is commanding around $5 more in value right now, which is just a few dollars over it's market value. It's early days for both of these cards, but given Bulbasaurs popularity and the stunning floral and trippy artwork on display here, this is 100% a card to keep an eye on and buy now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

Here’s everything you need to know, from Play Boosters to a Commander Deck.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorders In A Half Shell</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can probably imagine, there are more products coming than you can shake a Bo Staff at launching on March 6, with pre-release a week prior from February 27 to March 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The foundation, as expected, is Play Boosters, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVEDJ3?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Amazon has a box for $209.70 right now</u></a>. If that price changes you’ll be refunded the difference, but history tells us that a box of thirty packs will start to get cheaper shortly after launch (just look at Spider-Man).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also grab the now-customary booster bundle, which includes a promo card, a series of nine Play Boosters, a storage box and a spindown life counter. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gj3JG?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>That’s $69.99 right now</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Less clear pricing-wise are Collector Boosters. As with any set, these are where you’ll find the high-value cards, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBD1oB?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Amazon doesn’t have a price on these yet</u></a>, nor for <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrV7e?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>a box of them</u></a>. Expect them to be <em>expensive, </em>though, with an MSRP of $37.99 each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New this time is a Pizza Bundle, which includes 9 Play Boosters, 1 Collector Booster, 25 non-foil Pizza lands (yes, really), five foil Pizza lands, 2 foil promo cards, and a spindown life counter. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8vO4?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Amazon has this for $99.99</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Draft Night, a new boxed product making its debut in January’s Lorwyn, is also included. It has a bunch of packs (twelve in total) to play sealed draft, and a Collector Booster for the winner to take home. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMdJn?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>It’s $119.99 at Amazon</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Is Getting A Commander Deck</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Commander players can expect a return to precon decks… but just one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After being absent since Edge of Eternities, there’s a new precon coming, which is a five-color deck called Turtle Power!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-commander-decklist" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wizards has the decklist live now</u></a>, but the big focus is on teamwork, so you can have a pair of Heroes in a Half Shell to be your Commanders. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrVpN?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>It’s currently up for preorder at $69.99</u></a>, but expect it to climb.

                <p>Ratchet &amp; Clank's franchise has been dormant since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart/" data-ref-id="5000-513782">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> was released in 2021, but that didn't stop some fans from searching for a game that few remembered. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ratchet-and-clank-clone-home/" data-ref-id="5000-28102">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Clone Home</a> was announced was announced in the mid-2000s as the follow-up to the mobile title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ratchet-and-clank-going-mobile/" data-ref-id="5000-24743">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Mobile</a>. Although Clone Home was canceled and never officially released, the game has finally been found and a copy has been shared online.</p><p>The Golden Bolt's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZx2Exgd8TI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a> (via <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-long-lost-ratchet-and-clank-mobile-game-has-been-found-123008739.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Engadget</a>) has posted a video detailing the years-long search for Ratchet &amp; Clank: Clone Home. As noted in the video below, several members of the gaming community took part in the search, but college students "Emily" and "Super Gamer Omega Clank" were credited for finding a Sony Ericsson W880i that had a working copy of Clone Home. Breaking the phone's encryption was the most difficult step, but their efforts paid off.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZx2Exgd8TI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tZx2Exgd8TI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The title of the game refers to a pair of digital clones of Ratchet and Clank who team up with their counterparts in the real world to foil the plans of Vox, the returning nemesis from Going Mobile. The digital Ratchet and Clank exist in a video game within the game, and the real version of that duo are also transported into the game around halfway through the story.</p><p>It's believed that Clone Alone was briefly online by mistake before being pulled down. The preserved copy is fully playable, but it's unclear why Clone Home wasn't released. The Golden Bolt believes it was over a possible legal dispute between Sony and Handheld Games, the developer of Going Mobile. He also notes that Clone Home was likely developed by JavaGround, rather than Handheld Games.</p><p>This isn't the only surprise that fans of the Ratchet &amp; Clank franchise had in 2025. Earlier this year, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart senior designer Grant Parker revealed that he placed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-dev-reveals-hidden-minigame-no-one-found/1100-6532404/" data-ref-id="1100-6532404">a hidden minigame in the title</a>.

			<p>Battlefield 6 is finally live and available around the globe, and it's clear that players were looking forward to it. Not just because the beta saw <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-surpassed-battlefield-2042-all-time-concurrent-player-count-steam/">hundreds of thousands of players on Steam alone</a> (and likely millions when adding consoles to the mix), do nothing but play Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">during the beta period</a>, but because when it launched today, servers immediately hit capacity.</p>



<p>Players were immediately shuffled into a queue system, though thankfully, we've not seen reports of players having to wait a lengthy amount of time to jump in, and the concurrent player count on Steam soared beyond the beta, hitting a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">peak of 747,440 players per SteamDB</a> shortly after launch. At the time of this writing, it remains above 700K and has stayed there since hitting that peak.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 SteamDB charts on launch day, October 10, 2025.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even with a queue system kicking in right away, the fact that players aren't waiting extraordinarily long seems to be thanks to the fact that EA and Battlefield Studios were prepared for this. Earlier today the studio warned that a queue system would be implemented to help keep things running smoothly, and so far, it seems to have worked.</p>

The single-player campaign fails to impress, but the multiplayer experience more than makes up for it.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gaming-chair-elgato-herman-miller-embrace-elgato-2000634072</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/finally-a-gaming-chair-i-don%E2%80%99t-have-to-be-embarrassed-by.1322218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Stuff for gamers tends to look…ridiculous. You’ve got all these sharp angles, and don’t get me started on the constant need to shove RBG LEDs into friggin’ everything. Well, in stark contrast to that trend,&nbsp; Elgato, makers of the Stream Deck, various capture cards, and other kit for streaming setups, has a new chair that looks almost too normal. And for a decent chair that’ll last you? It ain’t sitting at too terrible of a price.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798127/elgato-embrace-gaming-chair">As spotted by <i>The Verge</i></a>, Elgato’s new chair, the “Embrace,” comes in at $500 bucks and will be shipping this holiday season. It comes with all the design elements that make gaming chairs decent to sit in. For hours. Without moving. Staring at the screen with little urge to get up beyond necessary biological impulses.</p>

 <p>As Tom Warren at <i>The Verge </i>states, the Embrace seems to be going up against Herman Miller’s “<a href="https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming-chairs/embody-gaming-chair/100160889.html?lang=en_US&amp;sku=100160889">Embody</a>” chair which, I’ll be honest, has a touch more personality with its color options. I’m really into the white and purple theme. Elegant, not overbearing. But wow, that thing costs almost $2,000. I’m sure it’ll save me back problems down the line, but if I’m spending that kinda money and it’s not for rent, it’s almost certainly for something completely irresponsible. Plus, do I want to be that girl who spent two grand on a chair?</p>

 <p>I’ve had the same rando-brand chair I bought on Amazon for like five years now. It cost $300, and has held up through my many fits of punching the arm rests while listening to Gojira or some other crazy shit. If I do decide upon the Embrace as my next gaming chair, I’ll be sure to let you know if you can beat the hell out of it. And how comfy it is.</p> <p>But seriously! Like even just a two-tone color option would have added at least some personality without making me feel like I need to hide it if I bring a guy over or something.</p>

                <p>One of the nice perks of EA Play and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (which includes EA Play) are 10-hour trials for new releases from EA. It's a good way to try a game before dropping money on buying it. But the free trials are not available for <em>every </em>EA game, including the just-launched Battlefield 6.</p><p>The game launched today, October 10, and has no free trial, a spokesperson for EA confirmed to GameSpot. This is somewhat unusual, as many EA games do offer 10-hour free trials. The last entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-will-have-a-10-hour-trial-for-game-pass-and-ea-play-subscribers/1100-6497656/" data-ref-id="1100-6497656">Battlefield 2042, had a free 10-hour trial for Game Pass and EA Play members, too.</a> But EA does not guarantee a free 10-hour trial for all games with EA Play. The fine print states that only "select" games get these trials.</p>

<p>From Z-A and beyond</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Not content with <em>only</em> releasing a new mainline game and tickets to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/a-new-pokemon-pop-up-store-is-coming-to-london-next-year">upcoming pop-up store</a> in October, The Pokémon Company is bringing even more monster-catching content to the UK in the coming weeks with a new series of the <strong>Pokémon Horizons</strong> anime.</p>
<p>Part one of the third season, subtitled 'Rising Hope', will arrive on BBC iPlayer on <strong>27th October</strong>, with more episodes following in the future. Those in the US will have to wait a little longer before it makes its regional debut on Netflix on 6th January 2026.</p>
<p>Here's an official synopsis of what we can expect from this third season:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been one year since the events in Laqua left the Rising Volt Tacklers without a leader and a way forward, but a mysterious pink mist that harms Pokémon spurs Liko and Roy into action! Both Trainers have gained confidence and strength alongside their Pokémon, including Roy’s newest friend, a yellow Lucario capable of Mega Evolution. They’re joined by Dot, an intel-gathering expert, and Ult, a brash young Trainer who considers Roy his rival. Determined to rebuild the Rising Volt Tacklers and fulfill a promise made in Laqua, Liko, Roy, and friends are training harder than ever as they take on the Explorers and forge a new path!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If all of that means nothing to you, then you can catch up on seasons one and two on iPlayer right now to work out what's going down with Liko, Roy and the gang.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> arrives before all that, with both the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions launching next week on 16th October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost of Yōtei is undoubtedly the biggest PlayStation exclusive of 2025. Sure, there was also Death Stranding 2, but Kojima's franchise is quite a bit more niche, despite the Hollywood stars, compared to the mainstream appeal attained by Ghost of Yōtei's predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-the-fastest-selling-new-sony-ip-during-ps4-gen-with-2-4-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set new PS4 first-party sales records when it launched in 2020</a>.</p>



<p>It's early days still, but the new open-world action/adventure game developed by Sucker Punch Productions seems to be selling almost as quickly as the previous franchise entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the first sales estimates</a>, despite an unfavorable comparison with the PS4 install base and the COVID-19-induced stay-at-home mandates. The game is also just as great as Tsushima. I dove deeply into my 60-hour experience with it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in Wccftech's official review</a>, which rated the game 8.8 out of 10. </p>



<p>That was all the more reason to be excited when we learned about the opportunity to interview the actor behind Lord Saito, the iconic main villain of Ghost of Yōtei and leader of the Yōtei Six: Feodor Chin. The American actor has a long track record with videogames (his credits in the industry started all the way with the original World of Warcraft) and was also featured as Lord Adachi in Ghost of Tsushima. Furthermore, Chin has appeared on recent TV shows like Secret Level, Love, Death &amp; Robots, and Marvel Zombies.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Feodor Chin (Photo credit: Diana Ragland)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>First of all, Feodor, thank you for being here with us. I've noticed that you have done a lot of work for television as well, TV series and stuff like that, so I wanted to ask you if you'd like to tell us a bit about the differences in your work when you're voicing a character for a game compared to voicing a character for a TV show, for example.</strong></p>



<p>Well, I believe that, regardless of the medium, you know, the approach is always the same, how you approach a character. I think your job as an actor is to serve the writer and to serve the story, and so that's always going to be the same, but I think to me the major difference is that for television or film, the viewer is a largely passive kind of audience, but for video games, the player is an active participant. Because of that, for you as the actor, I think at times it means your performance, while still always grounded in reality, I think it can and even needs to be made dialed up a little bit, because you want to engage the player, and so that to me would be the major difference between acting for television and film and as opposed to a video.</p>



<p><strong>Okay, so gaming characters need to be more intense, is that it?</strong></p>



<p>Maybe. I guess intensity might be one way to put it, but I think it's just maybe more actively engaged. Sometimes, you're actually instructing or commanding the player to do something, and so that requires a little more than you might ordinarily put in the delivery.</p>



<p><strong>Interesting. Are you a gamer?</strong></p>



<p>Definitely. I don't know if I'd call myself a gamer, but I do enjoy video games like just about anybody. I think it's mostly because I'm not great at them. You know, my hand-eye coordination has never been fantastic, but I certainly enjoy playing a game or two, but usually on easy difficulty. To me, it's supposed to be a relaxing, enjoyable experience. I just don't understand why you would want to have frustration in your relaxing times, but yeah, I do enjoy playing video games for sure.</p>



<p><strong>Specifically regarding the Ghost series, I know that before Ghost of Yōtei, you were also in Ghost of Tsushima, right?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, that's right.</p>



<p><strong>Did you play either of these games?</strong></p>



<p>I did. Well, Sony was kind enough to give the cast a free download. If you recall, I think that Ghost of Tsushima really came out at maybe the perfect time. It was kind of right at the start of COVID-19, and so everyone was at home. I had nothing but time on my hands, and I must admit that for about a month, I made my wife a Tsushima widow, because I was just playing just all day long for about a month there until I finally finished it. I remember getting to the end and not wanting to kill Khotun Khan because I didn't want the game to end.</p>



<p>It was just a terrific game, and I'm not just saying that cause I was in it. I think it's actually just a really fun game and perfect for the kind of player that I am. Like I said, on easy mode, I just, you know, went around. I really enjoyed the stealth kills, like coming up behind somebody and just slitting their throat.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>I think that Ghost of Tsushima really came out at maybe the perfect time. It was kind of right at the start of COVID-19, and so everyone was at home.

I remember getting to the end and not wanting to kill Khotun Khan because I didn't want the game to end.</em> <em>It was just a terrific game, and I'm not just saying that cause I was in it.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yeah, they're great games for sure. With Ghost of Yōtei, you'll have an extra motivation not to finish the game because then you'd have to kill yourself, right?</strong></p>



<p>That's right! *laughs*</p>



<p><strong>Seriously, though, compared to the first game where you played Lord Adachi, Lord Saito is obviously a very different character. Can you go into how you played these roles in the two games?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. Well, certainly with Lord Adachi, he had this great reputation of being the finest swordsman in all of Japan. He was presented as this real badass, and then, you know, no spoilers because it happens immediately, and it's been about five years, but yeah, he just gets killed immediately, and it may be in the most disgraceful way possible.</p>



<p>Certainly, the big difference is that Lord Saito lives for a while longer and has a lot more to do, that's for sure. Aside from that, it's always a great time to play a bad guy, the villain and final boss. As far as acting, you never want to judge a character. True villains never think of themselves as the bad guys. Their motivations and their actions are perfectly justified in their minds, and you just have to figure out what those are for you so you can play them honestly.</p>



<p><strong>For the whole game, Atsu is like, I need to kill Lord Saito, I have to kill this kind of demon that killed my family, but as you say, of course, from his perspective, he was just doing what was right after Atsu's father had left his retinue.</strong></p>



<p>Absolutely. I think they really are, Lord Saito and Atsu, kind of two sides of the same coin, because they have similar motivations. They're kind of motivated by revenge and so it's an interesting dichotomy between the two characters.</p>



<p><strong>During the final battle in Ghost of Yotei, </strong><strong>Lord Saito</strong> - <strong>you - even said something like, we are the same.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>I guess the difference is that in the end, Atsu lets go of all that rage.</strong></p>



<p>She does, and I think that's an important lesson. You don't want to be consumed by your need for revenge.</p>



<p><strong>Well said. I also wanted to ask: what was the process for your work like? Did you work remotely or in a studio?</strong></p>



<p>No, that was all in the studio, certainly. We did the cinematics at the Santa Monica studio, a full motion capture session, which is always fun. You get in the suit and you have the props and whatnot, you get to run around. We didn't do any real sword fighting, but there was certainly a little bit of stage fighting kind of stuff, and that's always a good time. And then the video sessions, those were all done in the studio as well.</p>

And then the video sessions, those were all done in the studio as well.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Was it the same for Ghost of Tsushima before COVID?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, that was also all in person. I wasn't involved with the Ghost of Tsushima DLC (Iki Island). I think maybe that one might have been remote.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. I see that you also have credits for many other games, such as Overwatch 2 and others. Are you looking forward to working on more videogame characters in the future after Ghost of Yōtei?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, always. In particular, I've really grown to enjoy doing motion capture. It's certainly challenging at first, but I think now I really, really enjoy it. Motion capture stretches you as an actor, but yeah, I am always open to more games, especially now that they're so cinematic. They're the new movies, really.</p>



<p><strong>I just have a final question. I guess this is a bit more of a controversial topic, but also very interesting. What do you think about the usage of AI in your line of work? Can it be used somehow, or should it be banned outright?</strong></p>



<p>I think, like with any technology, there is a place for AI as a tool, but I don't think it should ever be a replacement for human beings. I certainly don't know enough about the technology to say for certain, but to me, when it comes to games or movies or television or any kind of media, I think what audiences and what gamers want, what they are reacting to is this human connection that they feel either with the voice actors or other players, and that's something that I don't think AI could ever replace because it's other human beings looking for a human connection. That's what it's all about.</p>



<p><strong>AI can mimic a voice pretty well these days, but it definitely doesn't have the range of expressions.</strong></p>



<p>It doesn't have the humanity for sure, and I think that's what really affects people in these performances.</p>



<p><strong>Absolutely. Congratulations on your outstanding performance as Lord Saito and thank you for your time.</strong></p>

              <p><span>The crossover characters and tracks are my least favorite thing about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>, an otherwise excellent kart racer that didn’t need a bunch of licensed partnerships to stand out. That said, it doesn’t surprise me that the modding community has taken that concept and run with it. I do wish someone would add more </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters, such as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189"><span>Agent Stone</span></a><span> from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><span>live-action</span> <span>movies</span></a><span>, but it seems like modders have other ideas, like Jack Black’s Steve from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/a-second-minecraft-movie-is-hitting-theaters-in-just-two-years-2000634000"><span>the </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>movie</span></a><span>. This is basically my worst nightmare.</span></p> <p><span>Steve, as he exists in the </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>games, is already in </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>as DLC, but now you can play as his obnoxious film counterpart. The “Jack Black Steve Collection” mod on </span><a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/625763"><span>GameBanana</span></a><span> comes courtesy of user BROCHONKY, who has added two skins for Jack Black’s character to </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>. One is a photoscanned action figure that looks just like the actor, while the other is a stylized version of the character that uses </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>‘s signature blocky style. As a bonus, the mod also includes the infamous Chicken Jockey as it appears in the original game.</span></p>

 <p><span>The mod doesn’t just include skins, it also has voice lines and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-lava-chicken-jockey-easter-egg-game-1851786345"><span>music from the movie</span></a><span>. Black’s trademark hammed-up delivery followed him into Overworld, so the movie has several soundbites that became memes, such as when he announces the Chicken Jockey’s arrival and says “flint and steel” while teaching the other characters to craft. All of this seems like the making of a troll character, but I also feel like hearing these voice lines repeatedly during races would rot your own brain, so you reap what you sow.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Sega is apparently cool with character mods, so Steve will live to Chicken Jockey another day. The company recently </span><a href="https://x.com/RaceCrossWorlds/status/1976175976720867553"><span>banned cheaters who used mods to win races</span></a><span>, but the company’s </span><a href="https://games.sega.com/eula/?lang=en"><span>End User License Agreement</span></a><span> explicitly encourages creative work like adding new characters to their games. If I see Jack Black Steve on the racetrack, I will be running him off a cliff expeditiously. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Heart Machine, the studio behind Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash, has announced that it is winding down the development of its Early Access title, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2024/03/20/hands-on-with-the-not-quite-a-sequel-to-hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Breaker</a>. The news comes as the Los Angeles-based indie studio announces layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/HeartMachineHQ/status/1976314882468479002">statement</a> posted to social media (and first reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter"><em>Game Developer</em></a>), Heart Machine confirmed that it will end development of Hyper Light Breaker and that an unknown number of employees have been laid off. "As we wrap up our work on Hyper Light Breaker, we’ve had to make the difficult decision to part ways with a number of talented team members. This was not our ideal path, but rather the only one available given the circumstances," reads the statement.&nbsp;</p><p>Although it doesn't delve into specifics, Heart Machine says this news "reflects broader forces beyond our control, including shifts in funding, corporate consolidation, and the uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today." Heart Machine then pledges to continue making games as a smaller core team while supporting departing employees as best it can. &nbsp;</p><p>Heart Machine then clarifies its plans to polish Hyper Light Breaker as much as possible before it ceases work on the game for good. &nbsp;"We still have something coming in January. We plan to deliver something meaningful and as polished and complete as we can given our current circumstances. We’re doing our best to refine what we can, complete key systems, and have the game culminate in a satisfying punctuation point.”</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZzAy9k9fvCk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZzAy9k9fvCk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>While this seems to suggest Hyper Light Breaker will remain playable for those who bought it – and remains available to purchase as of publishing – it likely will not materialize into the final form the studio envisioned for it. Heart Machine also states it will not be releasing any more updates or hosting Q&amp;As for the rest of the year, citing “limited resources with team members rolling off the project” as the reason.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the studio's upcoming 2D action game<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/26/possessors-the-next-action-game-by-the-makers-of-hyper-light-drifter-and-solar-ash"> Possessor(s)</a>, Heart Machine confirms that its development has not been impacted and it will still launch on November 11.&nbsp;</p><p>This news comes nine months after Hyper Light Breaker launched in Steam Early Access on January 14. Although set within the universe of its hit 2016 2D action title Hyper Light Drifter, Hyper Light Breaker was a 3D cooperative action roguelike. Despite a promising premise, it received a mixed reception at launch, with players criticizing its punishing difficulty and performance issues, among other complaints.&nbsp;</p><p>Even after Heart Machine released several updates to address these problems, the game never seemed to fully catch on with players. Hyper Light Breaker's previously “Mixed” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/">Steam user reviews</a> have since plummeted into “Mostly Negative” territory following this latest update.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/10/heart-machine-is-ending-development-of-hyper-light-breaker-amid-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Battlefield 6 is finally here, and to help you put your best foot forward when jumping into multiplayer matches, I've put together a guide for the best weapons and loadouts for each of its classic four classes.</p>



<p>Of course, not every weapon and variant in this guide will be available to you the moment you load up the game; you'll have to grind some levels for them, but they still work well as loadouts to work towards well before you reach the level cap.</p>



<p>Also, since this guide is meant to focus on early loadouts, when it comes to secondary weapons for each loadout, the only option until you at least reach level 24 will be the P18 pistol. It's not bad, but the actual next-best option is arguably the M45A1, and you won't get that until you reach level 39. So that's why each loadout will feature the P18 for now.</p>



<p>A final note, this guide will stick with weapons that are the signature category of weapons for each class. Of course, you're free to mix and match, but this guide is for anyone wanting to stick within that class's signature traits.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-guide-best-early-weapons-and-loadouts-for-each-class">Battlefield 6 Guide - Best Early Weapons and Loadouts for Each Class</h2>



<h3 id="h-assault">Assault</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Assault loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For Assault players, you'll start out having to use the M433 assault rifle, which honestly isn't a bad place to start. The same goes for the introductory carbine, the M4A1. Both weapons are better for close-range encounters than what I actually recommend for this class, but Battlefield isn't just about fighting in tight corridors. That's why my actual recommendation is the B36A4 assault rifle. It has a lower rate of fire but is better for mid to long-range engagements, and packs just as much of a damage punch.</p>



<p>To make it even better for longer ranges, adding the 2.00x sight will help you see across the larger maps like Liberation Peak and Mirak Valley.</p>



<p>If you want an alternative for closer-range encounters while playing Assault, then stick with the M433, but adding a side 1.00 sight to the B36A4 once you've reached Mastery 6 can help make it more usable in close encounters.</p>



<p>When it comes to your gadgets, you'll want to take advantage of the Assault classes trait that lets you add a second primary weapon to your loadout. This is where you'll equip the M87A1 shotgun. It's the first shotgun available to you in the game, and having it in one of your gadget slots (whichever is easier for you to swap to on your button layout) is arguably far better than swapping to the P18 if you're running out of ammo in an encounter. Yes, it's really only great for mid to close range encounters, but you'll do more damage per shot than taking the time to reload your assault rifle. </p>



<p>Your other gadget should be set to the M320A1 high-explosive launcher, and for a better ease of use, mounting it to your assault rifle makes swapping to it much faster.</p>



<p>Here's a full breakdown of what your Assault loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: B36A4 Assault Rifle (2.00 sight, mounted launcher)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: M87A1 Shotgun</li>



<li>Gadget 2: M320A1 High Explosive Launcher</li>



<li>Throwable: Frag Grenade</li>



<li>Melee: Combat Knife</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-engineer">Engineer</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Engineer loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Engineers are arguably one of the most versatile and important classes in Battlefield 6, because they can be a direct response in large-scale battles like Conquest and Breakthrough, and are extremely useful in close-range battles with SMGs as their signature weapons.</p>



<p>The SGX is honestly a really great starting weapon for this class, but you'll want to work your way to the PW5A3 SMG, specifically its Warfighter variant, for a faster reload speed that can make or break close-quarters fights. The PW5A3 is also more versatile for mid-range battles, and since you'll want to be using the Engineer class to take out tanks and other vehicles in those large-scale fights, having a bit more range on your weapon doesn't hurt.</p>



<p>When it comes to your gadgets, you start out with the MBT-LAW auto-guided launcher, which is by no means a slouch. It's great for doing solid damage to vehicles, particularly tanks, but the time you'll need to ensure you're locked on to a tank can sometimes be what gets you killed before firing. That's why you'll want to work your way up to the RPG-7V2 for a much more versatile and all-around launcher that can do solid damage to vehicles, and blow holes out the side of a building if you need to deal with some enemies behind cover.</p>



<p>Your second gadget can stay as the AV mine, or anti-vehicle mine. It's a great defensive tactic when playing defence on modes like Breakthrough, and deals heavy damage to tanks and ground vehicles.</p>



<p>Here's  a full breakdown of what your Engineer loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: PW5A3 (Warfighter variant, Fast Mag, Double-Port Brake Muzzle, Extended Barrel, Red Laser)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: RPG-7V2</li>



<li>Gadget 2: AV Mine</li>



<li>Throwable: Anti-Vehicle Grenade</li>



<li>Melee: Combat Knife</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-support">Support</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Support loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just like how Engineers are vital to dealing with vehicles, the Support class is vital for keeping your squad alive. Battlefield 6, like other Battlefield games before it, is at its best when you're working together with your squad.</p>



<p>That's why, before we even get to your primary weapon, one of your gadgets that should just be permanently equipped is the Defibrillator. It can damage other players, and revives your own teammates much faster than any other class. Regarding your second gadget, I recommend the GPDIS, the grenade intercept system, since it can be a better deterrent for keeping your squadmates alive under heavy fire than deployable cover.</p>



<p>Onto your primary weapon, you'll want to work towards the RPKM LMG (Carnivore variant). You'll start out with the L110, which again, isn't bad, but LMGs like it take far too long to reload for my tastes. Even though you won't have a sprinting or aiming down-sight penalty when using them with the Support class, the RPKM is the way to go in your early hours because it does more damage and is much faster to reload, making it a more versatile choice.</p>



<p>Here's a full breakdown of what your Support loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: RPKM LMG (Carnivore Variant)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: Defibrillator</li>



<li>Gadget 2: GPDIS</li>



<li>Throwable: Smoke Grenade</li>



<li>Melee: Sledgehammer </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recon">Recon</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The best early-game Recon loadout</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Last but certainly not least, the Recon class. For Battlefield 6 players who want to remain on the edges of the fight and take out unsuspecting enemies from range, there are two ways you can approach this class. Either stick with a sniper rifle, though your only option then is M2010 ESR, or swap that for a DRM to fire off shots faster while still being able to see far down range with a stronger scope.</p>



<p>Now, since I said at the top of this guide that I'll be sticking with signature weapons, what I'll recommend here is the M2010 ESR, but I just wanted to note that going with a DRM can make your Recon loadout better suited for smaller-scale battles, if you wanted to go that route.</p>



<p>Regarding the M2010 ESR, it's not going to be the best when you first jump in with it, but what can make all the difference with this sniper rifle are the attachments. For example, if you're setting up in a singular spot to pick off headshots, then equipping the Bipod for your underbarrel attachment helps to keep your aim smooth. If you're going to be picking up and moving, then having the full-angled underbarrel attachment decreases your ADS time and keeps you more mobile.</p>



<p>For your gadgets, you'll want to have your Laser Designator equipped so you can help pick out vehicles and tanks for Engineers and other vehicles to lock onto. You can also pick out locations for players to focus on. Overall, it helps you and your squad see the battlefield better, which is what makes it the preferred choice.</p>



<p>Your second gadget should be the Recon Drone, since it once again helps you and your squad see the battlefield better and spot enemies for you, with the added bonus that you can use it on offence, taking out enemy gadgets through walls.</p>



<p>Here's a full breakdown of what your Recon loadout should look like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Primary: M2010 ESR Sniper Rifle (Bipod/Full Angled underbarrel, 6.00 scope, Range Finder right accessory)</li>



<li>Secondary: P18 Pistol</li>



<li>Gadget 1: Laser Designator</li>



<li>Gadget 2: Recon Drone</li>



<li>Throwable: Proximity Detector</li>



<li>Melee: Combat Knife</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>Obviously, your mileage may vary with each of these loadouts, since everyone will have their own preferences. But these are all great options for what's available to you early on in the game, well before you move through the level cap and all the challenges that are required to unlock the full arsenal. </p>



<p>I'll also put together a refreshed version of this guide when we're deeper into the game and looking at a wider range of what's available, but for now, aiming for these loadouts will help you dominate each match.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MachineGames posted a new 15th anniversary picture and, in it, showcases a new yet-to-be-announced game.</p>



<p>For 15 years, MachineGames has been crafting some of the best action FPS on the market. From the Nazi-killing bloodbath of Wolfenstein to the historic adventures of Indiana Jones, the team are masters of the craft. With last year’s release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-hands-on-previews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, fans have been waiting to see what’s next from the studio. Fortunately, we now know it is working on something new, thanks to a new celebratory post.</p>



<h2 id="h-machinegames-15th-anniversary-poster-shows-mysterious-next-game">MachineGames’ 15th Anniversary Poster Shows Mysterious Next Game</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/machinegames/status/1976685867235164308?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Twitter/X post</a>, MachineGames revealed a poster celebrating the studio’s 15th anniversary. All of the newest titles, like Wolfenstein: The New Order and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, are there. However, next to Indy is a blocked off box with a question mark. Seeing as Great Circle was the most recent, it seems MachinesGames is hinting it’s currently working on the studio’s next new title. Furthermore, as it’s on the 15th anniversary poster, we could find out what it is before the end of the year.</p>



<p>As for what the next game could be, it’s likely it’ll be either a new Wolfenstein or Indiana Jones. For Wolfenstein, the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/machinegames-new-wolfenstein-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed interest</a> in returning to the series in a recent documentary. With Indiana Jones, the massive success and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-indiana-jones-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push from Disney</a> may have the team invigorated to pick up his whip sooner than later. Still, it could be an entirely new project or IP, seeing as MachineGames has been doing franchise titles for a bit. Either way, it’s clear the studio is almost ready to share it’s next title and, if it’s anything like the others, it’s one to watch out for.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see what MachineGames’ new title is? What do you hope the new game will be? Wolfenstein? Indiana Jones? Something new for its anniversary?

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/amd-and-sony-tease-new-chip-architecture-ahead-of-playstation-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-and-sony%E2%80%99s-ps6-chipset-aims-to-rethink-the-current-graphics-pipeline.1322146/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>It feels like it was just yesterday that Sony hardware architect Mark Cerny was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/sonys-ps4-successor-sports-3d-audio-tech-faster-ssd-storage/">first teasing Sony's "PS4 successor"</a> and its "enhanced ray-tracing capabilities" powered by new AMD chips. Now that we're <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">nearly five full years into the PS5 era</a>, it's time for Sony and AMD to start teasing the new chips that will power what Cerny calls "a future console in a few years' time."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw">a quick nine-minute video posted Thursday</a>, Cerny sat down with Jack Huynh, the senior VP and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics Group, to talk about "Project Amethyst," a co-engineering effort between both companies that was <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136">also teased back in July</a>. And while that Project Amethyst hardware currently only exists in the form of a simulation, Cerny said that the "results are quite promising" for a project that's still in the "early days."</p>
<h2>Mo’ ML, fewer problems?</h2>
<p>Project Amethyst is focused on going beyond traditional rasterization techniques that don't scale well when you try to "brute force that with raw power alone," Huynh said in the video. Instead, the new architecture is focused on more efficient running of the kinds of machine-learning-based neural networks behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amds-fsr-4-upscaling-is-exclusive-to-90-series-radeon-gpus-wont-work-on-other-cards/">AMD's FSR upscaling technology</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">Sony's similar PSSR system</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">From the same source. Two branches. One vision.</p>
<p>My good friend and fellow gamer <a href="https://twitter.com/cerny?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cerny</a> and I recently reflected on our shared journey — symbolized by these two pieces of amethyst, split from the same stone.</p>
<p>Project Amethyst is a co-engineering effort between <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PlayStation</a> and… <a href="https://t.co/De9HWV3Ub2">pic.twitter.com/De9HWV3Ub2</a></p>
<p>— Jack Huynh (@JackMHuynh) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>While that kind of upscaling currently helps let GPUs pump out 4K graphics in real time, Cerny said that the "nature of the GPU fights us here," requiring calculations to be broken up into subproblems to be handled in a somewhat inefficient parallel process by the GPU's individual compute units.</p>
<p>To get around this issue, Project Amethyst uses "neural arrays" that let compute units share data and process problems like a "single focused AI engine," Cerny said. While the entire GPU won't be connected in this manner, connecting small sets of compute units like this allows for more scalable shader engines that can "process a large chunk of the screen in one go," Cerny said. That means Project Amethyst will let "more and more of what you see on screen... be touched or enhanced by ML," Huynh added.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> is out today and it’s already blowing up on Steam. The multiplayer military shooter is already well on its way to a million concurrents on Steam alone as fans race to witness the franchise’s revival after years of <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">stumbles and collective disappointment</a>. The record-breaking influx initially meant long queues but now some players are facing others issues, including a weird bug that tells them they need to buy and download a multiplayer mode they already own to start playing.</p> <p>Currently in the top-five most played games on Steam, <em>Battlefield</em> is the only game in the top four that’s paid. A $70 price tag hasn’t stopped it from overtaking Valve’s<em> Dota 2</em> and <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, or the perennial chart-topping battle royale<em> PUBG</em>. Players logging on when the game went live around 11:00 a.m. ET on Friday were immediately greeted by absurd queue positions featuring hundreds of thousands of other players trying to get into the always-online game.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">350,000 in the queue for Battlefield 6 already 🤯 <a href="https://t.co/O6tPcS7e7R">pic.twitter.com/O6tPcS7e7R</a></p> <p>— Tyler James (@FreakyMusic_) <a href="https://twitter.com/FreakyMusic_/status/1976666403723006090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Battlefield</em> lead producer David Sirland <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1974844687484641683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1974844687484641683%7Ctwgr%5Ebe0e9b592c93c25f20d70e73f251027fe236f8e8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fbattlefield%2Fbattlefield-6-lead-tempts-fate-says-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-after-numerous-betas-across-pc-and-consoles%2F">previously</a> seemed confident that the sequel would be prepared to welcome in the flood of day-one players following months of beta hype and promising feedback. DICE was quick to point out that login queues are part of trying to keep the ramp-up process “smooth and stable for everyone.” That didn’t stop fans from jabbing each other with screenshots of their positions on social media and the Battlefield subreddit. Long before anyone has a KDA to brag about in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, fans are turning to queue positions as high-score markers of elite status. Can anyone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o340g7/i_think_people_are_trying_to_play_bf6_idk_maybe/">beat 458,400</a>?</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bro….<br>how doe i play the game now? <a href="https://t.co/wMwXmmHGWm">pic.twitter.com/wMwXmmHGWm</a></p> <p>— DjKr4m3r Gaming (@djkr4m3r) <a href="https://twitter.com/djkr4m3r/status/1976671821476073568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But other players have been facing a strange issue in which, even after getting into the game, they would be asked to install it. “Running into an error with <em>Battlefield 6</em> that states I need to install multiplayer, and it shows me all the files I need to install,” one wrote on X. “Does anyone have any fixes? I’m afraid I’m going to have to queue again.” <a href="https://x.com/NachoCapart/status/1976678451252953251">Someone else</a> even tried deleting the game, reinstalling everything, and queuing again to try and get in. “If it works, please tell me,” another player wrote back.</p>

 <p>So far, EA has said it’s aware of the problem but hasn’t shared advice on how to address it. “We’re aware of an issue preventing players from accessing the game with some receiving an error stating they need to purchase DLC or similar,” it announced around noon on Friday. “Stay tuned for further updates as the team investigates this issue.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000634048" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634048"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634048">Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In the meantime, <em>Battlefield 6</em> seems well on its way to living up to to the initial blitz of player interest some had been predicting. Data firm Ampere Analysis <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/about-that-ea-deal">told <em>The Game Business</em></a> it was forecasting 1.7 million copies pre-ordered on Steam alone. If all of them login within the first 24 hours, the fall blockbuster will be well on its way to being Steam’s most-played game so far this month.</p>

 <p>To break into the top 10 of all-time highest concurrent player counts, it’ll need to beat <em>Banana</em>‘s 917,000 record. The top spot is still held by <em>PUBG</em> at over 3.2 million players simultaneously. EA will probably be content with having already edged out its own free-to-play giant <em>Apex Legends</em>, though. No wonder Activision seems so worried <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-free-battlefield-6-call-of-duty-rivalry-2000633176">about <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> this year</a>. It’s the first time in six years it’s had to go head-to-head with a <em>Battlefield</em> that had a single-player campaign, even if this one has <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">left many critics overwhelmed</a>.</p> <p><strong>Update 10/10/2025 3:04 p.m. ET:</strong> EA says it thinks it’s discovered the cause of the installation error some players are getting and will have a fix ready soon.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update: Installation of Content</p> <p>We believe we have found a possible cause for this issue.

The bad news, the prices might be a little too hot to handle for some. Here's what's available, alongside some handy tips on how to find the restocked items and even just a little less right now.</p><div catalogid="4aaeaa5d-9765-4a22-8fef-b266790ea2f0" id="227468"><div id="227468" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Elite Trainer Box (Mega Gardevoir)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Let's start things off with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKpbl?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Evolution Elite Trainer Box (ETB)</a>. You're getting nine Mega Evolution booster packs, one full-art foil promo card featuring Riolu or Alakazam, 65 card sleeves, 40 energy cards, a player’s guide to the Mega Evolution expansion, six damage-counter dice, one competition-legal coin-flip die, and the collector’s box to hold everything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MSRP is $49.99, but these run at a 100% markup right now, and the market price sits around $90-$100 at the time of writing. So, while Amazon does have this in stock, it is also listed at <em>market </em>price ($99.99), not MSRP. It's good for those who have the cash and want an easy and reliable free delivery. You might even have some gift card credit leftover you want to use.</p></div><div catalogid="4aaeaa5d-9765-4a22-8fef-b266790ea2f0" id="227470"><div id="227470" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Booster Bundle (6 Packs)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mega Evolution Booster Bundle is in similar situation, and in stock for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgykM?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$59.99 at Amazon</a>. That's around a 100% markup from the MSRP of $29.99. It includes six Mega Evolution boosters, which works out at almost exactly $10 per pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, if those prices arent what you're looking for, you're next best bet for finding ETBs or Booster Bundles for the new set is via trusted resale sites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7Gpv?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>. In my opinion its the best place to find sealed booster sets like these, and often enough it's cheaper than paying directly through Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, that's certainly the case, as you can buy the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRDGx?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ETB for around $90-$92</a> including shipping, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z12dY?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Bundle for around $54-$56</a>. It's a small saving compared to Amazon, but still a saving nonetheless.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mega Evolution Chase Cards</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Upcoming Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The closer we get to the November, the more likely you are to see the word "Black Friday" peppered across your every waking moment. Pokémon TCG deals during the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sales are a complicated beast, as it's unlikely you're going to find much at all that's actually below its original MSRP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something more immediate, the best advice I can give is to consider <a href="https://zdcs.link/weNPx?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's Prime Visa Card</a>. If you're a Prime Member already, you'll bag a $150 gift card (that you can immediately use to buy Pokémon cards if you so wish), and up to 7% cashback on purchaes using the card. It's a little niche, but if you don't mind the credit check it's not a bad deal.</p></div><div catalogid="a6b8451e-4fef-449d-8d7e-2f84cb84f315" id="203056"><div id="203056" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Amazon Prime Visa Card</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>7% cashback on Amazon purchases, no annual fee</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not keen, for now you're better off holding out for another Walmart+ drop like the one that went down most recently. In case you missed the news, Walmart was granting early access to rare elusive TCG sets as part of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-collector-con-sale-includes-rare-magic-the-gathering-commander-decks-boosters-prime-day">Collector Con sale</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-prime-day-elite-trainer-box-discount-walmart-plus-early-access">Prismastic Evolution ETBs for $59.99</a>, a huge discount compared to the $200 minimum you’ll currently find on other marketplaces like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxLBp?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a> for the same set. There was also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-preorder-walmart-plus-early-access-in-stock">Phantasmal Flame preorders</a>, including ETBs for $55, another giant saving considering these go for $150+ resale right now as well. There was a bunch more included as well, such as action figures, Magic: The Gathering sets, and more, but you get the gist.</p></div><div catalogid="33f87b44-ee72-4240-98ad-021acd5d3806" id="192311"><div id="192311" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ Membership</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>30-day free trial available. Then it's $12.95/month, or $98/year.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea is that after that early access period, the deals will then be made available to the wider public who don’t have Walmart+. However, given how quickly almost any MSRP-priced stock sells out, most items are typically gone way before general buyers can even get a sniff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't want to miss out on the next one, alongside any of Walmart's upcoming Black Friday deals (which they also put on early access for), I'd suggest picking up a Walmart+ membership when you can. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's $12.95/mo, or $98 annually, and offers a range of benefits beyond early shopping privileges. Members receive free delivery with no order minimum, savings on fuel, access to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/paramount-plus"><u>Paramount+</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/peacock"><u>Peacock</u></a> at no extra cost, and additional perks such as pharmacy delivery and discounts at selected partners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/motordoom">Motördoom</a> boasts one of those genre mash-ups that it can be difficult to understand, on paper, what's going on. It's a "freestyle-sports roguelite horde shooter that combines high octane, visceral combat with fluid movement and trick mechanics," its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/motordoom-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqTU8fWvPp7Dq5U_BZMlbV3GIMzEFtFiA_kA3ELJP5YUD__DqMb">eShop listing</a> reads, which feels like a lot of words for what can basically be boiled down to, <em>kill demons while pulling off sick BMX skills</em>.</p>
<p>This one arrives on the Switch eShop on <strong>7th November</strong> for <strong>$16.99</strong> (the EU page is not live at the time of writing), and it looks really rather gnarly. The above trailer tells you everything you need to know. It's a roguelike where you have to kill as many of the horde demons as possible while pulling off combos on your chainsaw-driven pit bike. Has anything made you want to shout "<em>dude!!</em>" more?</p>
<p>Developer Hobo Cat Games has added a dash of deckbuilder gameplay (because <em>of course</em>) in the shape of cards that boost your abilities, and there are unlockable characters and bikes to give you something to work towards between runs. And putting the 'k' in rogueli<em>k</em>e, an overall meta-progression system will have you gaining bike add-ons for better builds as you go.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the key features and a handful of screenshots from the eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>◆Career Mode (Inspired by classic extreme sports games)<br>
◆Single Run Mode (Highscore Mode)<br>
◆Endless Run Mode (Highscore Mode without Time or Level limit)<br>
◆Free Ride Mode<br>
◆Difficulty settings for all skill levels<br>
◆5 Arenas<br>
◆7 Characters<br>
◆5 Bosses<br>
◆35 different Demonic Offering Cards<br>
◆Unlockable Bike Add-Ons<br>
◆Unlockable Bike and Rider Skins</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The old school polygonal art style might not be to everyone's tastes, but after launching on Steam last year, you just know that such a gnarly mash-up will be up someone's street.</p>
