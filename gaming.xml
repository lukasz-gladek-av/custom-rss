            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Francis Coulombe and publisher Devolver Digital have announced a major new update for pixel horror RPG&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>, and it's adding new quests, new monsters, and more to the apartment building-bound adventure today.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer, the Final Vision update, which is free for everyone who owns the base game, is adding a number of new features, including "multiple new endings", so you'd better get started on that new playthrough right now.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new interactions, new areas to explore, and new quests to complete, as well as "dozens" of new monsters to battle.&nbsp;<em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>is also getting new boss encounters as part of this update, as well as "horrible new secrets", which is enticing. I think.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/look-outside-2.0-update-vincent.jpg?itok=V0a5qYGV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/look-outside-2.0-update-vincent.jpg?itok=h4jvEO-_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Vincent wants you to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>2.0, and you wouldn't want to upset Vincent, would you?</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>, it's a horror RPG that was created using RPG Maker. Much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rv-there-yet-sales" rel="nofollow">fellow indie hit&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em></a>, the game began as a game jam submission, but in&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>'s case, developer Francis Coulombe expanded on its initial content thans to positive feedback.</p>

<p><em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>sees you playing as Sam, a young man who's trapped in his apartment building thanks to a horrifying cosmic entity that turns everyone who looks at it into monstrous abominations.</p>

<p>Together with whatever survivors you can find in your building, it's up to you to explore the high-rise in order to find out whether there's a way for you to get everything back to normal, fighting off the monstrosities you encounter along the way.</p>




<p>I'd thoroughly recommend&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>, honestly; much like&nbsp;<em>Fear &amp; Hunger&nbsp;</em>(although it's significantly less punishing than those games), Coulombe's RPG is infinitely more unsettling than many higher-budget titles thanks to its lower-fidelity artwork, and it's a non-linear joy to play as well.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373660/Look_Outside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-duckov-sales-2m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-duckov-sales-reach-2m-in-under-two-weeks.1337152/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Soda and publisher bilibili have announced yet another huge sales milestone for single-player&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>riff&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em>, so it's safe to say the two studios have a solid hit on their hands.</p>

<p>As revealed by Team Soda and bilibili <a href="https://x.com/GameDuckov/status/1983053864820453385" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on X</a>,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell a whopping two million copies since launching earlier this month. It's achieved that figure in less than two weeks, which is impressive.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the newly-announced sales figure means that&nbsp;<em>Duckov&nbsp;</em>has picked up another 1.5 million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-duckov-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">since October 20th</a>, when Team Soda and bilibili revealed that their game had shifted 500,000 copies in its opening weekend alone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/escape-from-duckov-2m-sales-gameplay.jpg?itok=ptRHXCDq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/escape-from-duckov-2m-sales-gameplay.jpg?itok=FTlot79H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>has quacked - sorry, racked - up two million sales in its first two weeks.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>seems to deserve its high sales, as it's earned itself an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Overwhelmingly Positive rating</a> on Steam across over 3,000 reviews in the last couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Despite the name,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>doesn't actually share too much in common with&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>; it's a survival-focused looter-shooter, but it adopts a top-down isometric perspective as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>'s first-person shooting.</p>

<p>Obviously, the game is also largely focused around ducks, which...well, I can't confidently state&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>doesn't have any ducks, but it's certainly not quite as duck-centric as Team Soda and bilibili's game.</p>

<p>If you want to get a feel for what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>is, you can check out a trailer for it, which shows off some of the (entirely single-player) gameplay as well as the game's overall aesthetic, right here.</p>




<p><em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>is just one of several indie hits currently storming the gaming charts.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Nuggets Entertainment revealed that its indie driving adventure&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rv-there-yet-sales" rel="nofollow">crossed 1.3 million sales</a>, and they both follow hot on the heels of climbing sim&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">hit two million sales itself</a> back in June.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It’s priced at €129, or around $150, which is more than twice the price of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPEWoD0jhhq/">Lego’s $60 Game Boy</a> which the BrickBoy doesn’t include. Early backers can get it discounted to €99, or around $115, but that’s still far more expensive than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314884/anbernic-rg34xx-handheld-emulator-retro-nintendo-game-boy-advance">many of Anbernic’s handheld emulators</a> that are far more capable and ready to play right out of the box.</p><p>The more capable BrickBoy Gamer Kit that adds support for Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games, compatibility with Bluetooth headphones, and a rechargeable battery is €169, or around $197, without discounts. The Collector’s Edition that can turn the Lego Game Boy into a functional display piece running demos is €189, or around $220, and all versions are estimated to ship sometime in March 2026. That’s a lot to pay for a Game Boy replica with questionable ergonomics and controls, but since it relies on ROMs, the BrickBoy won’t require you to source original game carts like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/805673/nintendos-chips-make-this-lego-game-boy-upgrade-kit-the-most-authentic">Natalie the Nerd’s upgrade kit</a> will.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/808051/brickboy-lego-game-boy-emulator-upgrade-kit-kickstarter]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>'s battle royale mode REDSEC is out now, a "genre shifting free-to-play destination" that includes both the promised Fortnite functionality and a new squad-based competitive mode, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> - no, not that Gauntlet, auto-keyword tool, stop it, you're making me look daft, UGH I don't have time to argue with you, please just go away - together with additional gubbins for Battlefield's Portal editor. You can find it either via your Battlefield 6 install or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3028330/Battlefield_REDSEC/">as a separate release on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
REDSEC's battle royale map is Fort Lyndon, pictured below, with takes place in the backyards and beaches of California, and is apparently the series' biggest map ever. The setup is familiar: 100 players divided into squads are dropped into the world and must scrounge for pick-ups and do shooticuffs and fistibangs within a shrinking (and partly destructible) playspace.

<p>
As for the Gauntlet mode, this is a tournament affair in which eight teams of four compete in round-based missions, with each round giving you five minutes to complete an objective. Each round, map and mission has different variables.
</p>
<p>
What, you think all of that sounds rubbish? Hie thee to the Battlefield Portal editor, then, where you can rip REDSEC's skin off and fiddle around with various parameters. The developers give the example of restricting everybody to sledgehammers or making use of scripting tools to put together more bespoke chains of events and objectives.

REDSEC - or Redsec, as it shall be known from this point on, because I am weary of bellowing at you through my keyboard - launches alongside the first season of Battlefield 6's live service offerings, which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">read about here</a>. I'm not much of a battle royaler, certainly nowhere near as battleregal as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Aphid Leggings</a> enthusiast James, but I'll try to get a game going later and let you know how I fare.

No, the most surprising thing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> is that it's being developed by Ice-Pick Lodge, developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a>, with original Polish creators Acid Wizard monitoring the production from afar like lurking creatures in the underbrush.

<p>Pathologic and Darkwood are, I think, neck and neck for the title of Video Game Most Likely To Actually Give You The Plague. Asking the makers of one to make a sequel to the other is like, I don't know, putting Jack the Ripper in charge of the Manhattan Project. To top it all off, the key art reminds me of the main menu art for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a>. Truly, this is a videogame designed for me, though I do have some concerns about Ice-Pick Lodge's ability to craft a top-down horror game and also, how they're faring following the departure of their co-founder amid allegations of kidnapping.
</p><p>Darkwood 2 is set amid the dry salvages of a real-life body of water, the Aral Sea. Lying between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, it used to be the third largest lake in the world at 68,000 square kilometres, but began shrinking in the 1960s after rivers were diverted to Soviet irrigation projects.</p>
<p>Today, it's largely toxic dust, though there have been attempts to replenish the waters. Darkwood 2 takes place in the 1990s. Assuming the game sticks to real-life history, that would be following the abandonment of Soviet Russian efforts to restore the lake by way of a massive canal system, and in the midst of a phase of irrigation system building over in newly post-Soviet Uzbekistan. All that's according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea#History">Wikipedia</a>, anyway - if you happen to be a proper historian of the Aral Sea, I'd appreciate your input on the screenshots and trailer.
</p>
<p>As for how it plays, Darkwood 2 looks to be treading squarely in its predecessor's stinking, gore-filled bootprints. It's a foetid real-time exploration and scavenging sim in which visibility is swallowed and splintered by encroaching trunks. It's still about scraping together resources and fortifying a lair with barricades and traps, before the sun goes down and the real monsters come out. But there are new monsters to discover - hark at that giga-catfish in the footage - and there are "new reasons to pray for the morning light". Set a few years later, the game seems to build on the events of Darkwood, but Hooded Horse assure us that it can be treated as a standalone story.

<p>There are marshes to squelch through, meandering paths amid dunes, and deep waters to row over (I would probably row quite fast). There shall be no quest markers or waypoints, none of your modern cartographical frippery, only the madness and desperation of local humans fighting to keep the invading trunks at bay.
</p><p>All this appetising misery notwithstanding, returning players may have misgivings about the departure of original developers Acid Wizard. The first game's creators <a href="https://x.com/TheAcidWizard/status/1688551878974398464?s=20">suspended operations indefinitely in 2022</a>, after failing "to create a work environment that would not be destructive to our personal lives". They had struggled to find an audience for their follow-up project, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-studio-behind-darkwood-are-making-turn-based-tactical-football-and-you-can-try-it-free-now">jarringly upbeat football game Soccer Kids</a>. 
</p>
<p>"Crafting the world of Darkwood was a very challenging and long journey for the team," Acid Wizard co-founder Gustaw Stachaszewski comments in a press release for Darkwood 2. "After an experience like that, you become emotionally attached to your work. We know that the fans have been eagerly awaiting a continuation of Darkwood. For years, the idea of handing over our baby to another studio was something unthinkable for us. But, after it became evident that working together is not viable anymore, we decided that Darkwood should live on, even if not directly through our work.
</p>
<p>"We're genuinely excited to pass on the torch to Ice-Pick Lodge - creators whose work on Pathologic has inspired us for years," Stachaszewski goes on. "The team at IPL really gets what makes Darkwood a unique experience. We believe they will not only honor its spirit but will create something truly exceptional. As for us, we'll be in the background, making sure it stays true to the original vision."
</p>
<p>As for Ice-Pick Lodge, executive producer Alexander Souslov has some thoughts for people who might question the blend of developer and publisher here (again, Hooded Horse are better known for city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builders</a> and 4X than spooks and squalor). "I believe the most interesting things are created when people with very different backgrounds work together on creative projects," he observes. "Ice-Pick is known for its focus on narrative and on the design of semiotic systems. Hooded Horse, on the other hand, is renowned for its expertise in strategy. What kind of game could come from that?"

<p>Ice-Pick Lodge have been on a complicated journey of their own, these past few years. The developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-announced-with-time-travel-mechanic-due-for-release-in-2025">announced Pathologic 3 in October 2024</a>. Due for release in January 2026, it includes story materials and other elements that were once supposed to be part of Pathologic 2. There was a certain amount of frission over this and the dropping of the original game's open world elements, with our own Brendy (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-quarantine-drops-the-hunger-meters-so-you-can-play-doctor">commenting of one demo</a> that it felt simultaneously designed for and designed to annoy returning Pathologic players.
</p><p>Then, in March this year, founder Nikolay Dybowski suddenly <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ice-pick-lodge-founder-nikolay-dybowski-departs-pathologic-dev">left the studio</a> after Pathologic players discovered that he had been accused of kidnapping and abuse, with allegations dating back to 2021. Former Ice-Pick developer Aleksey Luchin responded to these reports, branding Dybowski a "manipulative sociopath that is very good with words." I've asked Hooded Horse and Ice-Pick if they'd like to offer any further comment on Dybowski's departure. More positively, Ice-Pick Lodge were among the first Russian developers to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pathologic/comments/t3e0es/ipl_statement_regarding_recent_events/">speak out</a> against their country's invasion of Ukraine, telling social media followers that "a crime is being committed in our name. This is not only a crime against our friends. It is a crime against our dignity."
</p>
<p>There's no release date yet for Darkwood 2, but you can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3708010/Darkwood_2">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9NVRB86ZP7XR">Microsoft Store</a>. You might also want to check out Alex Wiltshire's old interview with Acid Wizard about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-killing-permadeath-in-darkwood-led-deeper-into-the-forest">how the original Darkwood "kills permadeath"</a>. We never reviewed it, but Darkwood appears nonetheless on our list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">the best horror games on PC</a>. Here's hoping Ice-Pick Lodge can do it justice.</p>

A release date was not announced. It will also be available via Game Pass. <span id="more-1003103"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Hooded Horse:</p><blockquote><p>Set merely a few years after the events of the critically acclaimed survival horror game <em>Darkwood</em>, the sequel brings with it new lands and waters to explore, new creatures to fear, and new reasons to pray for the morning light. Featuring an entirely new story and new characters, the unfolding events of <em>Darkwood II</em> stand on their own, and can be equally enjoyed regardless of whether you’ve played the first game in the series.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse, the dying Aral Sea has become the site of an anomaly—an eerie forest that swallows everything in its path. No one knows where it came from, or why—retribution, perhaps, for humanity’s abuse of nature.</p><p>All around lie the ruins of a vanished world—deserted villages, rusting ships marooned in sand, derelict oil rigs, power stations, and factories on the verge of collapse. A secret biological lab sits in silence on a remote island as roving gangs of looters, bikers, and former soldiers control the remaining population through fear. Nomads travel through these lands with no rest or respite, day or night—even walls can’t guarantee safety. </p><p>As the world loses its humanity, and as the so-called corruption of the forest spreads, one can’t help but wonder—is it really better to remain human? Or would it be best to give in?</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Only the heart of the forest holds the answer.</p><p><em>Darkwood II</em> sends you on dangerous meandering paths across barren deserts, through thick marsh, and on deep waters alike. As the locals fight to keep the slowly spreading woods at bay, you must rely on your wits to overcome your fears and find your way—there are no quest markers or waypoints to guide you.</p><p>Scavenge for resources, craft weapons to protect yourself, and seek out shelter by night, building barricades and traps to hide behind, securing yourself against an enemy that can strike from any direction. Will you cower in a cellar as the doors creak open and close a few floors above you, or will you stand against the horrors that stalk the night? Or perhaps you’ll choose to rely on strange concoctions to gain new skills and capabilities that may just keep you alive—in a manner of speaking.</p><p>Meet twisted characters, each with their own motivations—learn their dark backstories and make decisions that will determine their fates and impact the world itself, changing your story as you move through it.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Darkwood 2 - Announcement Trailer | Survival Horror Game" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CR99LP_nays?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/darkwood-ii-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

We also covered all of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-battlefield-6-weapons-in-season-1-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6535768/">new BF6 Season 1 weapons and attachments</a> can be found here.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Rogue Ops - Blackwell Fields</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592681-bf6_s1_map_blackwellfields.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592681" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592681-bf6_s1_map_blackwellfields.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592681"></a><figcaption>Blackwell Fields</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592681-bf6_s1_map_blackwellfields.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Season 1 kicks off with the Rogue Ops update, which introduces the new <strong>Blackwell Fields</strong> map. This is a large-scale map set on a massive oil field in California, with lots of open ground for snipers and long-range combat. Structures like oil wells, construction equipment, and other items serve as cover on the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Blackwell Fields features the normal selection of vehicles, including helicopters, planes, and tanks. It also introduces the season's first new vehicle. The <strong>APC Traverser Mark 2</strong> is a brand-new land vehicle. This armored vehicle seats four: one driver, one roof gunner, and two backseat passengers who operate as side gunners.</p><h2 dir="ltr">California Resistance - Eastwood</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592682-bf6_s1_map_eastwood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592682" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592682-bf6_s1_map_eastwood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592682"></a><figcaption>Eastwood</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592682-bf6_s1_map_eastwood.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the second phase coming in November, California Resistance takes the fight to the Cali suburbs with the <strong>Eastwood</strong> map. Pax Armata is attacking a Southern California town, and the fights take place in and around suburban homes, through backyards, and even across a golf course. The houses will give plenty of cover for close-quarters fights, but the golf course provides open ground for long-range engagements.</p><p dir="ltr">And speaking of golf, Eastwood introduces the <strong>golf cart</strong> as a new vehicle for the map. When the map launches in November, you'll be able to use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/10-minutes-of-battlefield-6-season-1-new-maps-gameplay-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood/2300-6466468/">golf carts to cruise around the map</a> and create some interesting new shenanigans on the battlefield.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Winter Offensive - Ice Lock Empire State</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592683-bf6-s1-winteroffensive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592683" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592683-bf6-s1-winteroffensive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592683"></a><figcaption>Ice Lock Empire State</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4592683-bf6-s1-winteroffensive.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The third and final phase of Season 1 is themed around the winter holiday. For this seasonal content, Battlefield 6 adds a winter-theme variant of the Empire State map. This is just a visual update that covers the New York map in ice and snow.</p><p dir="ltr">As of now, a new vehicle has not been announced for the Winter Offensive update.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-guides-hub/1100-6533950/">Battlefield 6 guide hub</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/darkwood-on-ps5-it-goes-much-deeper-than-jump-scares">Gloomy and unsettling top-down horror game Darkwood</a> is getting a sequel and, it turns out, a surprise new developer. Original creator Acid Wizard, and publisher Hooded Horse, have brought in Pathologic developer Ice-Pick Lodge to do the work.</p>
<p>Acid Wizard hasn't disappeared entirely, however. It remains the IP holder and will oversee and consult on the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darkwood">Darkwood</a> 2, as the sequel will be called, will move the action away from a murky and foreboding forest to the parched lands of a dying sea, spreading the playing area across deserts, swampy marshes and deeper waters, where anything might lurk. This dramatic change of biome will bring new sights to see and new creatures to fear, and face. All the more reason to shore up your base and hang on until morning breaks.</p><p>Darkwood was a deceptively slight and harmless-looking game. Its top-down presentation didn't necessarily scream "fear!" at you, but its clever use of line of sight kept unpleasant surprises concealed, and its inky black heart and remorseless nature soon made itself felt. The idea was to survive long enough to work out where you were and what was going on. That meant venturing further and further afield into a strange dream-like world while avoiding the merciless perils of night.</p>
<p>Pathologic is a series with a similarly uncompromising nature, and Ice-Pick Lodge has been around long enough to acquire significant expertise. It's an interesting pairing, for sure.</p>
<p>Darkwood 2 is in development for PC and, apparently, PC Game Pass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Acclaimed indie developer Simogo is celebrating its 15th birthday today, but it feels like we're the one getting presents. Fans of the Swedish studio are going to be thrilled with the projects the team has revealed, so buckle up.</p>
<p>First up (thanks, <a href="https://vgc.news/news/simogo-reveals-7-game-collection-for-switch-and-pc-confirms-sayonara-wild-hearts-for-switch-2/">VGC</a>!) are Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sayonara-wild-hearts-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a>, two of our favourite games on the Switch. Sharper visuals and frames are likely part of these packages, and we only have to wait until <strong>early next year</strong> to try them out. No upgrade path has been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Second, we have the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>2nd December 2025</strong>. This is a compilation of the studio's first seven titles <em>and</em> a whole host of bonus content which, as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/simogo-legacy-collection-announced-for-switch-2-switch-and-pc">Gematsu</a> highlights, including an E-book, an audio drama podcast, unreleased music and art, and a handful of playable prototypes.</p>
<p>All the games in this collection were originally released on iOS, and while some did come to Wii U, most of these have never seen a console release. Simogo actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-dev-teases-switch-port-of-critically-acclaimed-text-adventure">teased one of these earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>The titles are:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amazon is laying off more than 14,000 corporate jobs today, and per a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTY2Nzc5MywiZXhwIjoxNzYyMjcyNTkzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNFVOSThHUTdMSEIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.gpW2CyZmAypCDjxGr-gBHrW6EnUxZkFspCrjiLV-dwc">Bloomberg</a>, the video games division, Amazon Game Studios, is not immune to the cuts.</p>



<p>While Amazon doesn't specify exactly how many people from its video games division will be laid off, a statement from Steve Boom, Amazon's head of audio, Twitch, and games, does call the cut "<em>significant</em>," and says that the cuts are happening despite Amazon being "<em>proud</em>" of the success it has had. While the studio's MMO, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/">New World</a>, isn't mentioned by name, the statement does say that Amazon is halting its game development work "<em>specifically around MMOs</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>While we're proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing</em>," the statement reads, "<em>we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work - specifically around MMOs - within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in or studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team</em>."</p>







<p>A report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/807825/amazon-job-layoffs-2025-ai">The Verge</a> adds that the driving force behind these cuts comes from Amazon pushing further into AI, with senior executive Beth Galetti writing in a memo to staff, "<em>The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well</em>. <em>This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly</em>."</p>



<p>While Amazon calls out MMOs as the genre it is specifically halting work in, it's unclear if the company will move forward in other areas of game development and publishing. Or, this could be the first major sign that Amazon is getting out of games entirely, and will stick to producing TV and film adaptations of video game properties, like its highly popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/">Fallout series</a> and upcoming series adaptations of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">Mass Effect</a>.</p>

              <p>Amazon is pulling back from blockbuster games. The company is laying off 14,000 people, including some across its gaming division. According to an internal memo reviewed by <em>Bloomberg</em>, those cuts include halting a “significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work–specifically around MMOs–within Amazon Game Studios.” The company had previously announced an ambitious<em> Lord of the Rings</em> MMORPG.</p> <p>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work–specifically around MMOs–within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” Amazon head of games, Twitch, and audio Steve Boom wrote in an email to staff, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division">reports<em> Bloomberg</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Amazon has mostly struggled in the world of game development outside of 2021’s MMO <em>New World</em>. It’s only other hits like <em>Lost Ark</em> and <em>Throne and Liberty</em> were developed by external partners. It’s currently set to publish the next <em>Tomb Raider</em> game as well as several other unannounced projects, including an internally developed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO and an online AAA action-RPG. It’s now unclear if those projects will move on or be canceled.</p>

 <p>The latest cuts come amid a recent overhaul of Amazon’s cloud gaming service Luna, with an emphasis on party games including one <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=snoop+kotaku&amp;sca_esv=f60ecab60e0aa489&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifOXDxq2ETzQl4cY3e3JzPgqEeaJrw%3A1761669797715&amp;ei=pfIAaaqvK-Ot5NoP87KVmQ0&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqlYS0q8eQAxXjFlkFHXNZJdMQ4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=snoop+kotaku&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDHNub29wIGtvdGFrdTIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGJ8FMgUQIRifBTIFECEYnwUyBRAhGJ8FMgUQIRifBTIFECEYnwVIrglQAFjGCHAAeACQAQCYAY0CoAHYCaoBBTkuMi4xuAEDyAEA-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&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">powered by an AI Snoop Dogg avatar</a>.

<p>Amazon is laying off more than 14,000 corporate employees. Within those layoffs, Amazon Games and Twitch will be hit in some capacity.</p>



<p>Bloomberg says, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTY2Nzc5MywiZXhwIjoxNzYyMjcyNTkzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNFVOSThHUTdMSEIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.gpW2CyZmAypCDjxGr-gBHrW6EnUxZkFspCrjiLV-dwc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">without going into</a> specifics, that both video games and the cloud-computing area of the company will be affected. Insider Gaming has reached out to Amazon to ask how many people were set to be let go from the gaming division and Twitch. As of publishing, a response has not been received.</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the cuts “would largely fall on its offices in Irvine and San Diego, as well as its central publishing division.”</p>



<p><strong>“The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs,”</strong> the report reads.</p>



<p><strong>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,”</strong> an email sent by vice president of audio, Twitch, and games Steve Boom to employees said.</p>



<p>Included in the layoffs was Tarfu, who had been with Twitch for 11 years.</p>



<p><strong>“I started off working in trust &amp; safety, then moved to customer experience,” </strong><a href="https://x.com/Tarfu/status/1983196834698015164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he shared.</a> <strong>“I was the person who built the entire fraud program at Twitch. One of the reasons I never told people what I did for work.</strong></p>



<p>“<strong>I was the one keeping bad actors off Twitch who steal and abuse revenue on the platform. I guess I did my job too well since they let me go. But do I have some great stories of being there over a decade.”</strong></p>



<p>News of the mass layoffs was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-targets-many-30000-corporate-job-cuts-sources-say-2025-10-27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first reported</a> by Reuters. The cuts would be, according to the outlet, the largest cut since 2022, when Amazon let go of roughly 27,000 people. This new set of layoffs would be the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/amazon-to-announce-sweeping-corporate-job-cuts-starting-tuesday.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">largest in company history</a>, with impacted employees to be notified via email.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have more coverage of the layoffs, including what happens to Amazon Games, as it becomes available.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2’s Future Saga Chapter 3 DLC arrives on October 30, 2025, with new characters, missions, and more content. </p>



<p>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 is one of those games that has been receiving post-launch content for almost a decade now. Earlier this year, the developers introduced the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-daima-character-pack-2-releases-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daima Pack</a>, which brought Goku Super Saiyan 4 to the title. We are now receiving Future Saga Chapter 3, which introduces Broly from Dragon Ball Super and Golden Frieza (Ultra Supervillain). </p>



<h2 id="h-xenoverse-2-future-saga-chapter-3-will-introduce-broly-and-golden-frieza">Xenoverse 2 Future Saga Chapter 3 Will Introduce Broly and Golden Frieza</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtxSegpS7TI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> provides plot details for Xenoverse 2 Future Saga Chapter 3. Frieza has joined hands with Fu, and now he aims to master time itself, which is why they are trying to infiltrate the Time Next. Frieza has unlocked another form that draws power from the crystals, making the character more powerful than ever. The design of this character and some of the plot points seem inspired by Black Frieza’s origins in the Dragon Ball Super manga. </p>



<p>Along with the new playable characters, Golden Frieza (Ultra Supervillain) and Broly (DB Super), the developers have introduced tons of new content for players to try out. A brand new mission, three new parallel quests, six additional moves, five costumes/accessories, three Super Souls, 23 Illustrations, a new stage: Conton City ruins, and an extra scenario: Cheelai &amp; Broly All Out! Conton City Patrol. Towards the end of the trailer, the devs also teased that Future Saga will receive a fourth and final chapter. </p>

<hr>
<p>Okay, so, look, I wasn't <em>trying</em> to do a heist. This is all a big misunderstanding.</p>
<p>See, the Louvre is mostly known for its paintings, statues, stealing art from other countries, and being hard to pronounce for anyone who doesn't have a French tongue. (<em>Loov. Looooov-ruh. Loovuhrrr. Loovurhrh.</em> Never mind.) Also, that one really famous, wildly underwhelming picture of the lady with the mystic smile.</p>
<p>But that's not what I care about when it comes to the Louvre. The Parisian pyramid is the only museum in the world that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/12/hands_on_nintendo_3ds_guide_louvre">used 3DSes as their audio guides</a>, and I've never had the chance to try them! And then, tragically, when the museum <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/louvre-says-au-revoir-to-nintendo-3ds-audio-guides">discontinued them earlier this year</a>, I thought to myself, 'Well, what are they going to do with all those 3DSes? Put them into the archive, like all the rejected paintings that don't draw a big enough crowd? I won't stand for it.'</p>
<figure data-uuid="e729831c85fd3"><a title="Louvre Guide on 3DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e729831c85fd3/louvre-guide-on-3ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I was going to nab a copy of the game, too — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, I went to visit the museum. Just a normal visit, you understand! And yes, I went in through a first-floor window via a ladder, but that wasn't because I was planning to steal things! I just wanted to beat the crowds. And avoid the entry cost. I mean, €25 to walk very slowly through a crowd taking selfies with the Mona Lisa? That's the real robbery here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>€25 to walk very slowly through a crowd taking selfies with the Mona Lisa? That's the real robbery here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was fully my intention to walk over to the information desk, politely ask about the 3DSes, and whether a caring patron of the arts such as myself could make a donation to the museum in order to take one home, and then once they'd handed me a big box of 3DSes, I would leave down my special museum ladder.</p>
<p>But once I was in, well, the crown jewels were just <em>sitting there</em>. I thought to myself, 'You can buy a <em>lot</em> of 3DSes with crown jewels money. Maybe you could even afford a single secondhand copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_heartgold_and_soulsilver">Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver</a> from <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/playing-the-cex-retro-lottery">CeX</a>!'</p>
<p>Besides, I had a very capacious tote bag with me.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I was slowly trundling down the ladder back to the streets of Paris that I even realised that I'd done a heist, or that no sane person on eBay is going to buy <em>obviously stolen</em> crown jewels.</p>
<p>So, here I am, with no 3DSes and too many crown jewels, and people keep writing articles about how cool I am, despite the fact that crown jewels can't play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/hotel_dusk_room_215">Hotel Dusk</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kid_icarus_uprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a>.</p>
<p>Look, I wrote up a comparison:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>3DS</th>
<th>Crown Jewels</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>✅ Comes in many colours</td>
<td>❌ Comes in factory colours only</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Take it anywhere</td>
<td>❌ Can only be taken to state occasions or maybe a fancy party</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Customisable home menu themes</td>
<td>❌ No home menu themes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ StreetPass!</td>
<td>❌ No StreetPass</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Playable in 2D and 3D</td>
<td>❌ No 2D option</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Can play cult classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/zero_escape_virtues_last_reward">Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward</a></td>
<td>❌ Cannot play cult classic Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, the obvious winner is the 3DS. It's not even close. And sure, the Crown Jewels make for some very nice hats, but I don't even <em>want</em> hats. I want to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/pullblox">Pullblox</a>, on a commuter train, with the option to make my eyes feel like they're being peeled from the inside!</p>
<p>Crown Jewels don't even have expandable SD card storage, so even if I <em>wanted</em> to take them to fancy parties or state occasions, I'd have to bring a separate external hard drive with me for all my games. Who wants to bring an external hard drive to a masquerade ball, or the coronation of the new monarch? Not me. It's very unfashionable.</p>

<p>But all is not lost. I have, in fact, started to melt down a couple of the pieces, because I have an amazing idea. I may not have a Louvre 3DS, but I do have a <em>normal</em> 3DS, and it's one of the 'New' ones with swappable faceplates. I've had mine protected by an understated Triforce-pattern plate for a long, long time, so I think I've earned a little glitz and glamour, haven't I?</p>
<p>It turns out that gluing 10-carat emeralds to a bit of plastic is a <em>little</em> difficult, but it's worth it. I feel like a queen, if queens knew what autostereoscopic handheld video game consoles were. It does make the thing bloody heavy, though.</p>
<p>Oh, and hopefully it goes without saying, but please don't tell anyone that I did the heist, okay? I really, really don't want to go to French prison. Or any kind of prison, really. I don't think they let you keep your 3DSes when you're incarcerated. Thanks.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-zack-gameplay-overhaul-mod-will-introduce-new-skills-and-mechanics.1337011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Zack Fair's gameplay in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is set to be significantly expanded by a new mod introducing new mechanics and skill for an overhauled combat experience.</p>



<p>This Zack gameplay overhaul mod is being developed by NSK, the modder behind the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/658">Zack and Sephiroth Combat Fix mod</a> whichaddressed some issues for the two characters and expanded their possibilities when added to the regular combat party outside their small playable segments. </p>



<p>Judging from the video showcase shared a few days ago on YouTube, the changes being made to Zack's gameplay are going to be significant, leveraging his unique Charge mechanics in some very interesting ways while adding some new skills, which include offensive skills that change depending on the Charge level, new Limit Break extensions, changes to existing abilities like High Braver, new combo routes and more. </p>



<p>As the character felt somewhat basic to use, despite some of his unique mechanics, these changes are set to be extremely welcome, providing PC players with one more reason to return to the game and experience it with some new features, although some of the changes could potentially break the game balance in some ways, especially if Zack is fighting with a full party, and not by himself as shown in the video below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy has expanded Zack's role beyond the original, it will be very interesting to see whether the character will return in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's sequel, and how his gameplay will evolve past the foundation set in the second episode of the trilogy if he does. Thankfully, it should take much longer to learn more about a game that is <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/">coming along really wel</a>l, and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-ending-satisfy-old-time-fans-newcomers/">that should satisfy old and new fans alike.</a></p>



<p>Before the third part of the trilogy launches, Xbox and Nintendo Switch 2 owners will finally get to experience both Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth in the future. <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/">The first entry in the trilogy will hit both systems on January 22, 2026.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's a big day for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a>, with both its Season 1 update now live for players to jump into, and its new free-to-play battle royale mode, Battlefield REDSEC, also now available. EA and Battlefield Studios confirmed yesterday what was already rumored, that REDSEC would be revealed and launched today, and now it's here for all players on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Once the gameplay trailer that was teased yesterday was over, the mode and the new season was officially live for all players to jump into, and we got our first major question of the day answered. Battlefield REDSEC can be accessed as an added DLC through Battlefield 6 and will be available in the menu for players who already own the game and have it downloaded. </p>



<p>If you don't already own Battlefield 6, then when you go to download REDSEC, you'll have to access it through Battlefield 6. At least for now, EA and Battlefield Studios have not broken it off into a separate app.</p>



<p>We also learned that the roadmap shared earlier this year was not at all the complete roadmap, which has now been shared along with the release of REDSEC and Season 1.</p>

<p>On top of the new game modes and the new Conquest map, Blackwell Ridge, that arrives in Battlefield 6 with Season 1 today (<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">which you can learn more about in our Season 1 preview</a>), REDSEC arrives with two different game modes: a core battle royale mode and a multiplayer-inspired mode, Gauntlet.</p>



<p>Both modes are set on one map called Fort Lyndon, a government testing ground that is basically your own personal battlefield for REDSEC and its two modes. The battle royale mode is your bog-standard battle royale of 100 players entering a map that continuously gets smaller with a toxic circle pushing everyone to one area, and the last squad standing wins. Squads can be either two or four players, with no solo queue available at launch.</p>



<p>You'll decide on your class and sidearm before dropping in, and acquire the rest of your loadout during the match, including primary weapons, gadgets, etc. It's even possible to find keycards that'll grant access to vehicles like tanks, though they come with limited fuel and ammo.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield REDSEC Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn8k1g3vMDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The new Gauntlet mode is a "<em>knockout-style</em>" mode with eight squads entering the fray, each trying to complete a set of missions to end up on top.</p>



<p>"<em>Every Gauntlet 'round' is a different mode or 'missions,' such as Deadlock, a multi-team variant of King of the</em> <em>Hill, or Wreckage, which is similar to Rush,</em>" the Battlefield 6 <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-full-roadmap">website reads in its explanation of Gauntlet</a>. "<em>With eight mission types and numerous Combat Zones, it is incredibly rare to have the exact same Gauntlet mission sequence in back-to-back matches.</em>"</p>



<p>You'll also be able to create your own versions of REDSEC through Portal, which can let you really up the ante and adjust REDSEC to create whatever crazed and chaotic version of REDSEC you want for both the core battle royale mode and Gauntlet.</p>



<p>It's also worth mentioning that the first battle pass for Battlefield 6 is now live for players to start working their way through. Of course, you can mostly ignore the battle pass if you're not a fan of the weapon and character skins it is mostly filled with, but you will have to work through them if you want to unlock the new weapons like the SOR-300SC carbine or the new Mini-Scout sniper rifle.</p>



<p>Beyond that, it's exciting to see REDSEC now live for players to try out, and it'll be interesting to see what players think of it as we get ever closer to a new year of Call of Duty and Warzone. We'll have a better idea by the end of the year if REDSEC can stand up to Warzone and keep players interested.</p>



<p>And for EA and Battlefield Studios sake, hopefully today's launch doesn't also come with a slew of technical issues.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has announced that it’s increasing its investment in AI. On Tuesday, it was announced that the company purchased a 27% stake in OpenAI for $135 billion. </p>



<p>Microsoft has had a partnership with OpenAI for years, but Tuesday’s announcement increases that commitment to the AI-based company behind ChatGPT, Sora, Whisper, and more. </p>



<p><strong>“What began as an investment in a research organization has grown into one of the most successful partnerships in our industry,”</strong> the joint press announcement says. <strong>“As we enter the next phase of this partnership, we’ve signed a new definitive agreement that builds on our foundation, strengthens our partnership, and sets the stage for long-term success for both organizations.”</strong></p>



<p>With the added push towards AI within Microsoft, players and employees are likely to be concerned about more AI being used to develop upcoming games. On this front, Xbox’s Phil Spencer has gone on record saying that they won’t force its use on staff. </p>



<p>He said that AI use is left to individual teams and that he’s <strong>“found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier, and any top-down mandate that ‘Thou must use a certain tool’…is not really a path to success.”</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> battle royale game mode has officially arrived in the form of Battlefield REDSEC – but it’s probably not exactly what you think it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-shadow-drop-imminent-as-ea-schedules-redsec-gameplay-reveal-for-tomorrow">surprise launched</a> their Battlefield battle royale experience across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S just moments ago, bringing months of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-official-name-and-release-date-reportedly-leak-online"><u>rumors</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-highlights-multiplayer-combat-in-latest-bf-labs-leak"><u>leaks</u></a> to an end with a standalone offering that’s free for both those who do and do not own Battlefield 6. Its name, shorthand for “Redacted Sector,” teases an updated take on a popular multiplayer pastime that’s been bundled in with two additional modes: Gauntlet and Portal. There’s more to REDSEC than fans may have expected, and it’s all tied in with the Battlefield 6 experience under one unified umbrella.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield Battle Royale</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle royale is no doubt the headline here, offering access to 100-player matches where classic battle royale gameplay is mixed with the Battlefield 6 formula. Infantry can be seen parachuting over and into explosive firefights in its first trailer, which reveals how BF Studios translated familiar elements into the Battlefield universe, all while 2Pac and Dr. Dre’s California Love plays in the background.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finding rare loot, hoarding armor plates, mastering small and large points of interest, and completing missions with friends are core parts of many battle royale experiences, and each is necessary to survive in Battlefield, too. It's more Warzone than Fortnite, but REDSEC has some features that help it stand apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fort Lyndon, a Southern California location that EA and BF Studios call the “biggest Battlefield map ever,” serves as the backdrop for each match. As the trailer highlights crumbling buildings, REDSEC aims to convince players it can build on battle royale without sacrificing what so many love about the franchise: tactical destruction.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield REDSEC Launch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Map-altering vehicles are a mainstay for any true Battlefield experience, and that remains the case for Battlefield 6 battle royale, which features everything from tanks to attack boats to golf carts to find. As the ever-present, ever-shrinking ring of fire (fans may remember it from Battlefield V: Firestorm) forces teams out of the frying pan, discovering an M1 Abrams could mean the difference between victory and succumbing to the flames. There will be plenty of less-threatening vehicles to discover around the new battle royale map, but those looking to drive a heavily armored tank will first need to complete missions, nab a keycard reward, and then use it to unlock specific garages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 and REDSEC will coexist, so those who have already enjoyed the former can expect to find familiar vehicles, guns, and gadgets in the latter – save for a few tweaks. Class upgrades are just one element to consider and give Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon players upgrades to work toward. Earn enough XP as the Recon class, for example, and you'll gain access to an enhancement that powers up drones with bomb-dropping capabilities. Custom loadouts can also be built and used, with players able to earn them by completing missions or by betting on the slightly riskier option of waiting for limited global drop events.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/fort-lyndon-1761661117488.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield REDSEC: Fort Lyndon. Image courtesy of EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players have not-so-patiently waited for battle royale updates for months. Now that REDSEC is finally here to toss Battlefield into a battle royale blender, fans should know that it's not the only new experience dropping today.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gauntlet</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you need a break from battle royale, Gauntlet is a separate mode that is also offered as part of today’s new standalone free-to-play experience. While Battlefield battle royale may see squads prowling for loot in between shootouts throughout longer matches, Gauntlet is propped up as a relatively short, elimination-driven gameplay experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of 100-player matches, just 32 players (eight squads with four players each) are spread across Fort Lyndon. BF Studios says Gauntlet is structured as a tournament, with teams tasked with fighting through fast-paced, round-based missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have five minutes to complete the objective for each round, with Gauntlet keeping everyone on their toes with rotating missions and locations. As objectives and settings shift, it’s teamwork that will determine which squad emerges victorious.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Portal</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield fans have been familiar with Portal since its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-portal-custom-game-mode-announced">inception in Battlefield 2042</a>. Although the community has already taken to Battlefield 6 Portal to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-launched-just-hours-ago-and-players-have-already-recreated-call-of-duty-map-shipment-in-portal">create bizarre game modes and recreate fan-favorite maps</a>, REDSEC Portal opens a new door of possibilities.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/rs-screenshot-5-1761624880681.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield REDSEC brings Portal to Fort Lyndon. Image courtesy of EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">REDSEC takes the promise of limitless game-creation tools and brings them over to Fort Lyndon’s massive play area. It’s more room for fans to let their imaginations run wild, with one example we’ve seen including a midair obstacle course that features golf carts, colorful shipping containers, and narrow paths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">REDSEC Portal looks more Grand Theft Auto Online than Battlefield, but that also seems to be what EA and BF Studios are going for. Two official Portal maps will be available at launch, with more set to follow in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Does Battlefield 6 Work With REDSEC?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The base Battlefield 6 experience takes after Call of Duty, bundling in REDSEC so that players can access it from one main menu. Those who don’t own the recently released Battlefield game can still download REDSEC without issue and at no extra charge, but there are a few differences for those who own the full, premium experience and those who don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coinciding with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-trailer-highlights-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood-maps-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch"><u>the launch of Season 1 today</u></a> is Battlefield 6’s battle pass system, which shares unlocked rewards and XP progress between both the base game and its REDSEC counterpart. Though some unique challenges and events will be tied to each experience, and some Battlefield 6 vehicle skins won’t appear in certain REDSEC experiences, EA says “there are no plans” for REDSEC-exclusive unlocks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Portal is where things get slightly complicated. Creative fans who own Battlefield 6 can enjoy the new Portal tools introduced with REDSEC completely unrestricted, gaining access to all the new standalone experience and Fort Lyndon have to offer. Those without the base game, however, won’t have access to any Battlefield 6-exclusive content, such as maps, when making Portal creations. These restrictions don’t stop at the creation side of the user-generated community content hub, either, as EA clarifies that REDSEC-exclusive players won’t be able to create or play any content using Battlefield 6 materials.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield REDSEC Fort Lyndon Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield REDSEC isn’t just battle royale – it’s a completely different beast. This three-pillar standalone experience will change as seasonal updates continue to roll out, and if the weeks following the launch of Battlefield 6 are anything to go by, it will also likely rapidly change as community feedback pours in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The October 10 release of Battlefield 6 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S proved to be quite the moment for the series, but the true test of its potential begins with REDSEC and Season 1. While we wait to see how EA and BF Studios plan to maintain yet another major addition to the Battlefield universe, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-community-update-reveals-long-list-of-gameplay-changes-ahead-of-season-1-and-battle-royale-launch">all of the changes introduced with Season 1</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Catch up with Brad and Janet seven years later.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Richard O'Brien's The Rocky Horror Show and its 1975 film adaptation easily rank among the most popular and enduring musicals ever released. But if you've ever wondered what became of all-American couple Brad Majors and Janet Weiss after their fateful night in the mansion, you're about to get an answer. That's where the official graphic novel sequel Bride of Rocky Horror comes in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbotmedia/rocky-horror-show-bride-of-rocky-horror?ref=73z702" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Kickstarter campaign for The Rocky Horror Show: Bride of Rocky Horror</a> live now, IGN can exclusively debut a new preview of the book. Check it out in the slideshow gallery below, along with a look at some of the exclusive merch tied to the campaign:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Bride of Rocky Horror Preview Art Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bride of Rocky Horror is a 95-page book set seven years after the events of the musical. The book is published by Bit Bot Media, and the creative team includes writer Magdalene Visaggio (Girlmode), artist Noemi Vettori (X-Men Unlimited), colorist Josh Rodriguez (The Brooding Muse), letterer Jeremiah Lambert (Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver – The Dead Shall Rise), and cover artist Soo Lee (Carmilla). Here's the official logline for the book:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Bride of Rocky Horror, Janet Weiss has embraced a life of decadence and debauchery. But when a mysterious invitation draws her back into the orbit of her ex-fiancé Brad Majors, a new mystery unfolds. Who is the enigmatic Bridget Von Frankenstein? What secrets is Brad hiding? And is it, once again, time for the Time Warp?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rocky Horror is one of my favorite stories of all time,” said Visaggio in a statement. “It was the safest queer art I had access to when I was young because my parents were both huge fans. So to get the chance to look beyond it and see how it could have played out once that fateful night ended was a dream come true. I tried to make something as personal and idiosyncratic as O'Brien's original, riffing off the themes that stood out to me the same way O'Brien was riffing on his childhood influences. I think me and Noemi have made something really unique."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As an artist, and even more so as a Rocky Horror Show fan, it meant a lot to me to pay tribute to our beloved characters, striving to stay as true as possible to their original appearance and personalities,” said Vettori. “I hope I succeeded in representing what Rocky Horror embodies: chaos, passion, and rebellion. Working on Bride of Rocky Horror wasn’t just about illustration, it was about channeling all the energy of an eccentric and mesmerizing musical onto paper!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbotmedia/rocky-horror-show-bride-of-rocky-horror?ref=73z702" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kickstarter campaign for The Rocky Horror Show: Bride of Rocky</a> is live now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other comics news, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dcs-batmandeadpool-1-to-feature-crossovers-between-nightwing-and-wolverine-harley-quinn-and-hulk-and-more">the other superhero crossovers featured in Batman/Deadpool #1</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wiccan-walks-the-witches-road-in-first-ever-solo-marvel-series">learn more about Marvel's Wiccan: The Witches' Road</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Masters of Albion Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"I think that line in Fable--'For every choice, a consequence'--wasn't delivered on well enough," Molyneux explained. "I think the possession mechanic that we had in Dungeon Keeper wasn't delivered on enough. The open-world freedom that we had in Black &amp; White, I think it was good at the start, but it didn't deliver enough at the end. And Masters of Albion is an opportunity to mix all those together. Even though one is an RTS, one is a god game, and one is a role-playing game, why the f**k can't we mix them all together?"</p><p>He went on to say that, because Masters of Albion is his last game (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peter-molyneux-says-masters-of-albion-could-be-his-last-game-due-to-his-smoking-drinking/1100-6526010/" data-ref-id="1100-6526010">primarily due to his drinking and smoking habits</a>), the city-building God game is all about course-correcting for his decades of misleading fans.</p><p>"And I don't know if it's going to work," Molyneux continued. "It's so important to me, this game, because to a certain extent it's about redemption. I admit now that I did overpromise on things, and said things that I shouldn't have said about Curiosity. But I only ever did that because I thought it was the right thing to do at the time. And so Masters Of Albion is a redemption title for me. But also, it's my last game. It just is."</p><p>With it being his last game, Molyneux kind of dipped back into his familiar bag again. Although he didn't explicitly say that Masters of Albion will do A, B, and/or C as he's done with his previous games, he did claim that the forthcoming strategy sim is "nothing you've ever played before." Not necessarily a promise, but an indication that Masters of Albion is something special. He went long, calling the game" significant" for him:</p><p>“For me, it's the most significant title that I've ever done, for sure. And I'll tell you the amazing thing--it’s going to f**king work. It really is. It's like nothing you've ever played before, but it's still unbelievably familiar. It is Black &amp; White, it is Dungeon Keeper, and it is Fable, but it's a completely new genre. And it shouldn't really work, but it does. I can't call this a great game. That's the wrong thing for me to say, because if I say in the press, 'Masters Of Albion is going to be a great game,' that's a promise. So I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is, it's a unique experience, which is unbelievably intimate and familiar to any person who played Fable, Black &amp; White, and Dungeon Keeper. If I turn around and say, 'This is going to be my greatest game,' that's when I get in trouble."</p><p>Speaking of getting in trouble, do you remember Bryan Henderson? It's OK if you don't, but the name should ring a bell because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/curiosity-winner-once-promised-a-life-changing-pri/1100-6425241/" data-ref-id="1100-6425241">he won and never received a "life-changing" prize</a> for conquering Molyneux's experimental iOS game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/curiosity-the-concept/" data-ref-id="5000-244859">Curiosity</a> in 2013. </p><p>In development for at least three years, Masters of Albion was revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live in August 2024. You build up a town by day with money and resources, and you defend your settlement at night from all manner of creatures, from ghouls to zombies. It doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PC.</p>
