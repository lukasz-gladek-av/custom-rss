			<p>During a special livestream that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just aired</a>, Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment announced the final release date for its first multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak. The cooperative first-person shooter game for up to three players will be launched for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fbc-firebreak-fc3830" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on June 17, priced at $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, it will also be available on day one via Microsoft's PC Game Pass/Game Pass Ultimate and Sony's PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers in a bid to maximize the player base from the get-go.</p>
<p>Remedy is also releasing a Deluxe Edition, priced at&nbsp;$49.99 / €49.99 / £39.99. This edition includes exclusive cosmetic items and voice packs that allow players to customize their audiovisual identity.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak Deluxe Edition includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The Firestarter” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li>“The Pencil Pusher” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li>Firestarter Armor Set, Apex Revision (Helmet, Body Armor, Gloves)</li>
<li>Scorched Remnant Double-Barrel Shotgun Skin</li>
<li>Golden Firebreak Spray</li>
<li>Classified Requisition: “Firestarter”: A collection of 36 unlockable cosmetic items, including weapon skins, sprays, and armor sets</li>
</ul>
<p>Owners of the base game can upgrade to the Deluxe Edition at any time for $10.00 / €10.00 / £7.00.</p>

<p>During today's live stream, Remedy also briefed fans on the post-launch support. Two new Jobs (missions) will be released later in 2025, while even more updates will be made available throughout 2026. As the studio previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-info-all-post-launch-content-will-be-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>, all post-launch content will be free, and monetization will be limited to cosmetic-only items.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is powered by Remedy's proprietary Northlight engine, previously seen in Control and Alan Wake 2. However, being a multiplayer game first and foremost, the studio has <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken care to optimize it</a> to be more accessible to a wider range of PC configurations. Even so, high-end features like path tracing (already implemented in Alan Wake 2) and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will be supported on PC.</p>

<p>Remedy revealed the news in a livestream this evening, although due to the time altering world event known as embargoed press releases, I'm writing this before the stream goes live on Remedy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/RemedyGames">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/remedygames">Twitch</a> channels. Thus, I can only guess what the reveal looked like for the new job, Hot Fix. 'Jobs' are what they're calling the repeatable missions you'll play through in the titular Federal Bureau Of Control, one of gaming's finest mind-melting bureaucratic horror institutions. A Housing Benefit Form Desk Of Leaves, if you will.</p>
<p>Firebreak is Remedy's first foray into the Getting That Potentially Infinite Bag world of live service, which, inevitably, means cosmetics. There are two types, the first being 'Requisitions' ("weapons, equipment, armor, sprays, and more") that'll be sold for an in-game currency you'll earn by playing. No timers or rotating stores for these, either. The second, 'Classified requisitions' ("armor sets, custom voice packs, sprays, and weapon skins"), will cost you. "The items are purely cosmetic, have no gameplay impact, and will remain available permanently," Remedy say. This all sounds like it'll be funding post-launch support, with new jobs planned as early as this year.</p>
<p>Edwin had a chat with Remedy about their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/controls-office-junior-firebreak-cant-decide-if-its-a-job">approach to live service recently</a>, in which they basically say that their 'We did not make Firebreak just to get that potentially infinite bag' t-shirts are raising a lot of questions already answered by the shirts. Personally, I'm torn between being reflexively iffy about this stuff on principle while also believing Remedy deserve a fat payday, every day, and rubbing my hands together in glee over what sort of stupidly self-indulgent, brilliant art they can make with the funds. Oh! Oh! I'm coining 'Deep Bloc Galactic'. Because of brutalism, right? Little gift there for you. Nice little Thursday treat.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Interestingly, <em>Madden 26</em> is finally leaving behind the aging PS4 and Xbox One. Since 2013, <em>Madden </em>has launched on those consoles every year, but no more. Last year’s <em>Madden 25</em> will be the last EA football game to launch on last-gen machines. Funnily enough, the first <em>Madden </em>to launch on Xbox One and PS4 was also called <em>Madden 25</em>, as the franchise was celebrating its 25 year anniversary. Weird stuff! </p><p>It’s a year of change for <em>Madden</em>, because not only is it skipping consoles it has released on for over a decade, but EA is bringing the football series back to Nintendo platforms.<em> Madden 26 </em>is set to launch on Switch 2 in August alongside the other versions of the game on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. This is the first time a <em>Madden </em>game has appeared on a Nintendo platform since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_13&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2012's<em> Madden NFL 13</em>. That game launched on Wii and Wii U</a></span>. </p><p>Weirdly, only <em>Madden</em> is making the leap to Switch 2<em>. EA College Football 26</em> will not be available on Nintendo’s new console. Last year,<em> EA College Football 25 </em>became one of the best selling games in the United States after fans waited a decade to play another EA Sports college football game. (The last one was released in 2013.) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-one-series-x-s-college-football-25-madden-nfl-ea-1851604118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-one-series-x-s-college-football-25-madden-nfl-ea-1851604118"><em>EA College Football 25 </em>already skipped PS4 and Xbox One last year</a></span>, so its not surprising they are skipping it again this year. </p><p><em> Madden NFL 26</em> launches for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on August 14.<em> College Football 26 </em>launches on July 10. You can pay EA a ransom fee to play three days early via the $100 <em>Madden NFL 26</em> “Deluxe Edition.” On PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, a $150 “MVP Bundle” is also available, and it comes with <em>College Football 26</em> “Deluxe Edition.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We also got a look at the Requisitions system, which serves as FBC: Firebreak's main form of progression and is similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2's</a> Warbonds. By playing the game, players will be able to unlock new weapons, armor, equipment, and more using free in-game currency, although real money can be spent to access "Classified Requisitions" that obtain premium cosmetic items.</p><p>Though this is a battle pass-like system, Remedy says the game is designed to be anti-FOMO. In a recent preview, GameSpot's Mark Delaney said it's "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedys-fbc-firebreak-is-more-left-4-dead-than-live-service-and-thats-the-beauty-of-it/1100-6530228/" data-ref-id="1100-6530228">more [like] Left 4 Dead than [a] live-service game</a>," with no daily challenges and expiring passes that make players feel like they have to play it or fall behind.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0s2x2a35wP8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Of course, the release date is the most exciting piece of news from the showcase, and Remedy revealed the different versions of FBC: Firebreak that will be available. Although it will be included in both PS Plus Extra and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate's game catalogs from day one, players will be able to buy the standard edition of FBC: Firebreak for $40. This game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-will-feature-cross-play-multiplayer/1100-6530895/" data-ref-id="1100-6530895">will support cross-play</a>, so it won't matter where you or your friends play it.</p><p>A $10 Deluxe Edition upgrade will also be available and nets players The Firestarter and Pencil Pusher premium voice packs, the Firestarter Armor Set, a Scorched Remnant Double-Barrel Shotgun Skin, a Golden Firebreak spray, and access to the Firestarter Classified Requisition.</p><p>Remedy confirmed that at least two new Jobs will come to the game this year, with more new content on the way in 2026. While players will have to pay for Classified Requisitions, all playable content released post-launch will be free for players.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fbc-firebreak/" data-ref-id="5000-647734">FBC: Firebreak</a> launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on June 17. Its developers have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-dev-says-its-given-no-thought-to-switch-2-support-so-far/1100-6530274/" data-ref-id="1100-6530274">not considered a Nintendo Switch 2</a> port yet.</p>

                <p>The real journey in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">Oblivion Remastered</a> begins after you step out of the grimy Imperial City sewers and emerge in the world of Cyrodiil. Right from the start of the game, there are zero restrictions on where you can go, who you can meet, and what you can do. You can choose to follow the main story quest, which requires you to hand over the amulet the emperor entrusted to you before he died, or completely ignore the story and explore the new world before you.</p><p>If you're a veteran of Oblivion, then you likely have a solid idea of the best places to go first. However, if you're hopping into the game for the first time with the remaster, you might need some guidance. After all, the map is huge and offers some free fast travel destinations thousands of meters away right from the get-go.</p><p>So, what should you do first in Oblivion Remastered? Below, we'll offer a few specific directives on the best places to visit after emerging from the sewers. For so much more on the "new" game, use our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">full Oblivion Remastered guide</a>.</p><h2 id="Follow_the_Black_Road">Follow the Black Road</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482155-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.38.33.80.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482155" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482155-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.38.33.80.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482155"></a><figcaption>An overview of the Black Road</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482155-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.38.33.80.png"></figure><p>There are several different roads that branch out from the Imperial City in Cyrodiil. The northwestern road is called the Black Road, and it leads to a major city called Chorrol. Along the Black Road, you'll be able to discover a plethora of different locations, such as caves to explore, small towns to see, and quests to start. The Black Road starts with a town called Weye, which is where you can begin the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/how-to-complete-go-fish-in-oblivion-remastered/2900-6500/" data-ref-id="2900-6500">Go Fish side quest</a> in Oblivion Remastered that rewards you with a particularly useful ring.</p><p>If you continue on the Black Road, you'll eventually run into Weynon Priory, which is where the first main story quest tells you to go. Here, you can speak to Jauffre and learn about why the emperor gave you the amulet in the first place.</p><p>However, you don't have to stop in Weynon Priory if you don't want to. Instead, you can head right past it and make your way into the city of Chorrol. This city is home to a number of interesting characters and several engaging side quests. It's also where you can join both the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/#Fighters_Guild" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Fighters Guild</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/#Mages_Guild" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Mages Guild</a>.</p><p>Unlike in Skyrim, there's not much of an initiation process to join either guild, so you can enter both of them in the northern part of Chorrol and join straight away. This allows you to accept new quests, meet new characters, and receive some new weapons, spells, and gear. Chorrol isn't the sole city where you can join these guilds, but it's one of the best places to start.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482156-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-22.26.37.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482156" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482156-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-22.26.37.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482156"></a><figcaption>The entrance to the Fighters Guild</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482156-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-22.26.37.38.png"></figure><p>The Black Road culminates with a location called Battlehorn Castle. Battlehorn Castle is nothing particularly special from the outside, but when you approach it, there will be a small war going on in front of its gates. If you manage to defeat all of the enemies trying to break down the gate, you'll actually receive the deed to Battlehorn Castle. This entitles you to full ownership of the castle and everything that it holds.</p><p>At the very least, Battlehorn Castle offers you free access to a blacksmith to repair your gear, a plethora of beds to sleep in so you can level up, and the possibility to design your own castle. You can talk to a merchant in Imperial City to buy blueprints for various upgrades around the castle to truly make it yours.</p><h2 id="Head_inside_the_North_Sewers">Head inside the North Sewers</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482159-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.56.00.26.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482159" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482159-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.56.00.26.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482159"></a><figcaption>The entrance to the North Sewers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482159-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.56.00.26.png"></figure><p>Just because you emerged from the sewers doesn't mean you can't head right back inside them. From the main sewer entrance in Oblivion Remastered, you can travel west to enter the North Exit of the sewers. Along the way, you might also find a Nirnroot Plant by the nearby lake, which triggers the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/seeking-your-roots-quest-guide-fo-oblivion-remastered/2900-6497/" data-ref-id="2900-6497">Seeking Your Roots quest</a>.</p><p>If you try to enter the North Sewers, you'll need to pick a Hard lock, which can certainly take a few attempts. Once you're inside, make your way through the tight corridors and caverns until you reach a ladder that allows you to head up to "The Main Ingredient" basement. You'll need to pick this lock as well as a lock that allows you to head into The Main Ingredient shop itself from the basement.</p><p>After getting through, though, you can speak to the proprietor of the shop, who's name is Oegir Goerick, and start the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/unfriendly-competition-quest-guide-for-oblivion-remastered/2900-6493/" data-ref-id="2900-6493">Unfriendly Competition quest</a>. This quest is quite the tangled web, but it winds up with you securing two of the best early-game melee weapons in Oblivion Remastered. You also receive some other gear as well as a general understanding of how the Imperial City is laid out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482160-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.31.45.42.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482160" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482160-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.31.45.42.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482160"></a><figcaption>Speaking with Oegir Goerick</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482160-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.31.45.42.png"></figure><p>Emerging from the North Sewers allows you an easy way to get inside the heart of the Imperial City and start to explore it a little more. From there, you can go any way you please, explore the city until your heart is content, and head back down to the sewers and start from the way you came.</p><p>One of the best ways to spend your time in the Imperial City is to speak with NPCs and ask them about "Rumors." This lets you know of some major side quests and who to speak to next.</p><h2 id="Join_one_or_all_of_the_Guilds">Join one or all of the Guilds</h2><p>We've already talked about the Fighters and Mages Guilds in Oblivion Remastered, but those aren't the only two guilds you can join in Cyrodiil. You can also join the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/#Thieves_Guild" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Thieves Guild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/#Dark_Brotherhood" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Dark Brotherhood</a>, both of which require you to perform a specific action instead of visiting a location.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482178-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-23.28.10.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482178" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482178-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-23.28.10.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482178"></a><figcaption>Teekeeus is the head of the Chorrol Mages Guild</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482178-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-23.28.10.60.png"></figure><p>For the Thieves Guild, you can either commit a crime and choose the option to go to jail, become friends with a beggar by giving them coin and asking about the guild, or find the guild on your own through The Grey Fox. Regardless of how you do it, the Thieves Guild offers some great quests and rewards in Oblivion Remastered.</p><p>You could also join the Dark Brotherhood, which is only doable after you murder an innocent person and then go to sleep in a bed. During your rest, an NPC named Lucien Lachance will approach you about joining.</p><p>In addition to all of the guilds in Oblivion Remastered, you can also join the Imperial Arena. This location is found within Imperial City and by speaking with Owyn, you can take part in Arena battles as a participant. The Arena allows you to fight enemies and soar through different ranks as you keep winning, which earns you new rewards in the process.</p><h2 id="Go_east_towards_Vilverin">Go east towards Vilverin</h2><p>The final direction we'll offer is to go east from the sewer entrance. Directly across the lake, you'll find an Aeylid Ruin by the name of Vilverin. If you travel inside Vilverin, you'll be able to loot a slew of interesting items. One of the more notable pieces of loot are Welkynd Stones, which allow you to instantly regain magicka points. They're also used as a conduit for shock spells, which come in handy if you join the Mages Guild in Chorrol.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482179-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.23-18.36.29.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482179" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482179-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.23-18.36.29.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482179"></a><figcaption>The location of Vilverin </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482179-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.23-18.36.29.36.png"></figure><p>Also inside Vilverin you'll find a number of chests with plenty of gold, some bandits to kill and loot, and a number of different areas to explore. After you're done with the Aeylid Ruin, you can exit and keep heading east along the Blue Road towards the city of Cheydinhal. There are branches of the Mages and Fighters Guild here as well and plenty of other quests to embark on.</p><p>You could also head slightly north from Vilverin and take the Silver Road to the city of Bruma. While Bruma isn't too exciting, it's certainly not a bad city to visit and explore either.</p>

This one's a biggie, too: it's called Celestial Guardians, and it's themed around Pokemon Sun and Moon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Celestial Guardians officially releases on April 30, and is a bigger expansion than the last couple, with two different types of booster packs themed around legendaries Solgaleo and Lunala. It primarily features Alolan Pokemon, including the three starters Rowlet, Litten, and Popplio, as well as regional variants such as Alolan Raichu and Marowak. And of course, it comes with new trainer cards, themed around popular characters from the Alola region, and new ways to display your collection such as a new binder cover and display board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, the set also appears to include what looks like two versions of the starter trio, a daytime and a nighttime version, each with different stats and abilities. It's unclear how prevalent this split is going to be throughout the set, but it could make for some interesting decks if there are multiple paths to getting the same cards out on the field.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon TCG Pocket Celestial Guardians Expansion First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Celestial Guardians is the sixth expansion so far and the third major one, following major expansions Genetic Apex and Space-Time Smackdown and smaller expansions Mythical Island, Triumphant Light, and the most recent, Shining Revelry. At the time this piece was written, none of these expansions have been retired yet, but it's perhaps only a matter of time before we say goodbye to Genetic Apex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Pokemon TCG Pocket has kept up the pace with roughly one new expansion per month, alongside regular in-game solo and competitive events. Alongside collecting and battling, TCG Pocket also implemented trading earlier this year, but the feature was widely panned due to its high cost barrier and lack of useful trading feature, forcing the developer to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-confirms-changes-to-much-loathed-trading-system-are-coming-eventually">confirm changes were on the way</a>... months down the road. Nevertheless, the game has been successful, and is estimated to have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-made-half-a-billion-dollars-in-less-than-3-months">made half a billion dollars in less than three months</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I'll be real: Now that I think about it, the trick I'm about to talk about is <em>incredibly </em>obvious. So I'm begging you, please don't judge me too harshly and appreciate the fact that I am majorly humbling myself by writing about this. And, for those of you who also didn't realize you could do this, rest assured that you are in good-ish company.</p><p>Earlier this year, Fields of Mistria's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fields-of-mistrias-second-major-update-march-2025/2900-6312/" data-ref-id="2900-6312">second major update</a> was released, bringing with it the lava caves biome. And did you know that, unlike me, you don't have to use your watering can and desperately hop around the cave's various rock formations to progress through it? In a post shared on the official Field of Mistria Instagram, the team behind the game revealed that players can use the game's rain spell to instantly solidify every single inch of lava on the floor. That's right. All of it. And although this feat takes a lot of mana if you want to do it on multiple levels, man oh man, it changes things--and saves my poor stamina bar.</p><p>Admittedly, I haven't played nearly as much Fields of Mistria since the game's second update dropped--I blame the absolutely wild number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/" data-ref-id="2900-6127">phenomenal games that have come out this year</a> for that. For this reason, I think I'm a <em>little</em> more justified in not picking up on this sooner. But as someone who delights in games that force you to think about things in more roundabout way (ie. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid/" data-ref-id="5000-1362">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo/" data-ref-id="5000-582009">Paranormasight</a>, etc.), I am kicking myself for not considering that I could use the rain spell down in the mines.</p><p>While this is probably the biggest "oh god, you can do that" to come from Mistria's Instagram page, I also highly recommend checking out all the other tips, too. For example, did you know that if you feed a mimic items, it will spit out valuable resources and simply disappear? I've also noticed quite a few folks who have struggled a bit with the slimes that shoot rocks at you down there. The trick to besting them? Swing your sword at the right time and send those rocks hurling right back at 'em; just two good shots should do it.</p><p>While NPC Studios remains hard at work on the already fantastic farming simulator, we at GameSpot are continuing to chug away on our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fields-of-mistria/guides/">Field of Mistria guides</a>. Right now, it's one of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/most-anticipated-games-leaving-early-access-in-2025/2900-6151/" data-ref-id="2900-6151">most anticipated games</a> that's scheduled to leave early access in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/655709/hori-usb-nintendo-switch-2-camera-gamechat-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After debuting a fun <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642514/nintendo-switch-2-usb-c-camera-hori-piranha-plant-privacy">Piranha Plant-inspired alternative</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">Nintendo’s own $50 Switch 2 camera</a>, Hori is back with another camera accessory for the console that’s less fun but more functional. Standing just shy of two inches tall and weighing 30 grams, the camera is small and light enough to be connected to the Switch 2’s top USB-C port without making the console feel top-heavy while playing in handheld mode.</p><p>Hori’s USB Camera for Nintendo Switch 2 is currently listed on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/NSX-023/dp/B0F5WTSW21">Amazon Japan website</a> for 3,981 yen, or around $28, making it much cheaper than the company’s $60 Piranha Plant cam. It’s not known if the tiny camera will be exclusive to Japan, but since the Piranha Plant is already listed on <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/nsx-001u/">Hori’s US website</a>, there’s a good chance this one will also see wider availability. For now, only Amazon Japan has the new camera listed with a June 5th, 2025 release date.</p><p>In addition to being small enough to perch atop the Switch 2, the GameChat-compatible camera can also be attached to an included weighted base allowing it to stand alone on an entertainment center like Nintendo’s own camera is designed to. The base also has a fold-down support on the underside so you can sit the camera on the top edge of a TV, assuming that edge is thin enough.</p><p>Hori’s latest camera seems like a better alternative to Nintendo’s in terms of portability, but like the Piranha Plant it’s limited to a resolution of only 640x480 – a significant step down from the 1080p capabilities of Nintendo’s. That’s potentially enough resolution to match the quality of Nintendo’s camera when Hori’s is perched atop the Switch 2 and right in front of your face. But when it’s zooming in on you from across the room while the camera is sitting next to your TV dock, there will likely be a significant reduction in video quality while using GameChat.</p><p>Nintendo says “any compatible USB-C camera you’d like” will work with the Switch 2 so you can probably use the external webcam you bought for work. But the company also warns that “<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessories%2Fcamera%2F" rel="sponsored">not all cameras may work as intended</a>” and it has included a testing tool in the Switch 2’s settings to make sure. If you’d rather play it safe and know ahead of time, both of Hori’s cameras are officially licensed Nintendo accessories.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</a> was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sequel-to-robocop-rogue-city-sounds-more-like-dredd">just last month</a>, and despite its slightly wordy and DLC-sounding title, it was a welcome surprise. The first game was prime 7/10 material, and it's pretty rare we get an AA game of this calibre these days. Earlier today publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/nacon">Nacon</a> shared a new story trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>, giving an insight into the game you probably won't care about given the whole thing here is being a robot cop that does robot cop things. Oh, and it has a release date!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Unfinished Business is currently slated to release this coming July 17th, a little under three months away now. Wait, hang on, that's less than two years since the first game came out, that can't be right can it? Seems like it is possible to release follow-ups to generally well received games in a reasonable amount of time without pouring heaps and heaps of cash into something that's ultimately a bit too shiny and full of bloat. Who could have guessed!

<p>
The story, if you are curious about it, sees RoboCop being sent out to OmniTower, which has been taken over by some armed mercenaries. They want to have complete control over Omni Consumer Products, which includes RoboCop himself, and what's in the tower is the last part of the puzzle they need to achieve that goal. It's RoboCop! You already know what its deal is.
</p>
<p>
It generally sounds like it'll just take place in OmniTower, which sounds like it'll have some great potential for some lovely level design. That was the first game's strength, here's hoping developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/teyon">Teyon</a> pull it off with the sequel.

But whether you’re tackling the Arena or exploring the surrounding landscape, you’ll encounter trouble eventually—and you will want health potions readily available. <strong>You can buy plenty at The Gilded Carafe in the Imperial City Market District</strong>. There, Claudette will sell you five or six for just under 1,000 gold.</p><h2 id="h7760"><a id="favs"></a>Set your favorites for quick access</h2><figure id="" data-id="4ce58572dbd7356ac4fc022fd56ca995" data-recommend-id="image://4ce58572dbd7356ac4fc022fd56ca995" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The favorites radial menu in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The favorites radial menu in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4ce58572dbd7356ac4fc022fd56ca995" data-recommend-id="image://4ce58572dbd7356ac4fc022fd56ca995" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The favorites radial menu in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Whether you wield sword and spell or simply require quick-access to all of your potions and scrolls, the favorites radial menu in <em>Oblivion Remastered </em>isn’t going to fill itself!</p><p>I recommend adding health potions—either at the very top slot or the very bottom—for easy access.

The game runs at a constant 30fps in quality mode and a steady 60fps during performance mode, and Digital Foundry says developer Panic Button's PS5 port is a "near-perfect match" to the Xbox Series X|S version.</p><p dir="ltr">It's playing the game on the PS5 Pro where the real differences can be seen. Digital Foundry notes that there is a "huge difference" in the amount of foliage when playing on PS5 Pro while running Forza Horizon 5 in performance mode. Greenery is denser and more vibrant, and can also be seen in higher detail from farther away with less pop-in. The foliage rendering while in performance mode closely matches that of the foliage on display on the base PS5's quality mode, meaning PS5 Pro players get the best of both worlds.</p><p dir="ltr">"Getting quality mode foliage at performance mode frame rates is a huge bonus for Pro users, and provides a big visual boost over the base machine," Digital Foundry said.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few other perks for those playing on PS5 Pro as well, such as ray-traced self-vehicle reflections while playing in quality mode during normal gameplay--a feature that is normally only available while using the garage and Forzavista feature on base consoles. Digital Foundry found the reflections "noticeable" for those looking for it, but that it isn't hugely impactful. Overall, Digital Foundry called playing Forza Horizon 5 on the PS5 Pro a "compromise-free experience."

Developer Playground Games and Turn 10 Studio's racing series is just the latest first-party Xbox game to make the jump to Sony's consoles, with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-is-doing-phenomenally-on-ps5-sells-1-million-copies-already-report/1100-6526047/" data-ref-id="1100-6526047">Sea of Thieves</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/" data-ref-id="1100-6530308">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, having also been released on PlayStation.</p>

            <p>
It seems <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s divisive Game-Key Cards - physical releases containing a download "key", rather than the full game data - will be a pretty common sight when the console launches this June. The vast majority of third-party Switch 2 physical releases currently available for pre-order in Japan come on game-key cards, and the situation is looking similar in the UK.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2's game-key-card-heavy launch window line-up was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lniuq7ix4k25">first highlighted by Gematsu</a>, which noted all third-party physical releases seen so far in Japan feature box art indicating their game-key card status. The exceptions are CD Projekt's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and all Nintendo Switch 2 Edition titles - that is, original Switch games featuring Switch 2 specific enhancements.
</p>
<p>
The likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bravely-default">Bravely Default</a>: Flying Fairy, Wild Hearts, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-0-review">Yakuza 0</a>: Director's Cut, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2, and Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion all feature game-key card branding on their Japanese boxes, with 11 out of 12 Switch 2-specific third-party physical releases opting for the key-on-card approach. Nintendo's own titles - namely Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza - all use standard game cards.

<p>
Furthermore, it looks like the situation will be similar in the west if the handful of third-party Switch 2 games currently available to pre-order are any indication. UK retailer Smyths <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/gaming-and-tech/nintendo-switch-2/c/SM060402">features game-key card box art</a> for Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition, Street Fighter 6: Year 1-2 Fighters Edition, and Bravely Default: Flying Fairy, while Amazon in the US shows Yakuza 0: Director's Cut, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2, Raidou: Remastered – The Mystery of the Soulless Army Launch Edition (all from Sega) utilising game-key cards.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">unveiled its game-key cards earlier this month</a>, as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">big Switch 2 blow-out</a>. "Game-key cards are different from regular game cards, because they don't contain the full game data," it said at the time. "Instead, the game-key card is your 'key' to downloading the full game to your system via the internet. After it's downloaded, you can play the game by inserting the game-key card into your system and starting it up like a standard physical game card."

The fact many third-party publishers have so enthusiastically embraced game-key cards this early into Switch 2's lifespan isn't likely to delight physical collectors, but the scheme does at least have one major advantage over code-in-a-box releases in that game-key card downloads aren't locked to a specific user account, meaning they can be shared and resold.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 officially launches on 5th June, and pre-orders were available in the UK just days after its big reveal. US and Canada pre-orders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-guide-us">finally went live today</a> after Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">opted to delay them</a> in order to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">assess the impact of the US administration's recent tariffs</a>. But while the console itself has retained its original $450 price tag in the US for now, Nintendo recently confirmed it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raising prices for various console accessories</a> "due to changes in market conditions".

			<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/nintendo-says-demand-for-switch-2-console-in-japan-overwhelming?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a> report, analysts are expecting Nintendo to have &nbsp;6-8 million <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> units on hand for its June 5 launch. This would make it one of the biggest console launches in the video game industry's history.</p>
<p>Coming into 2025, everyone expected the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 to be one of the most significant events of the year. Demand for the Switch 2 has even exceeded Nintendo's expectations. In Japan alone, Nintendo received 2.2 million applications from consumers looking to grab a Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa had to take to <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155">X</a> to formally apologize to players that "<em>a significant number of applicants won't be selected</em>" because the demand exceeded expectations. Bloomberg's report also notes that Nintendo is doing what it can to increase console production to meet the demand as best it can by June 5.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 only went live in the United States and Canada today, after having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">delayed</a> due to tariffs announced by the U.S. Consumers looking to lock in their pre-orders<a href="https://x.com/spencerhakimian/status/1915257488703705328?s=46"> reported</a> that websites for retailers like Best Buy and Walmart crashed due to the overwhelming flood of traffic. The outages weren't too bad overall, as many people were still gleefully announcing they had grabbed a pre-order.</p>
<p>While the price of the Switch 2 and its games remains controversial for players, those who could grab a pre-order or buy it on day one are likely getting a better deal than those who choose to wait. Tariffs still loom over the console's pricing like a dark cloud, and we've already seen them impact the Switch 2, as Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/">increased the price</a> of several Switch 2 accessories as a response to tariffs.</p>
<p>The price of the console has stayed the same for now, but Nintendo stipulated that it could still increase in the future, "<em>depending on market conditions</em>."</p>

Some players argue that Strategist heroes are penalized by <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ ranking system, which prioritizes kill counts over other stats like healing or damage mitigated, unfairly penalizing players for focusing on keeping their teammates topped off rather than popping heads. Support heroes have also been on the receiving end of several nerfs over the course of the game’s first three seasons.

It’s tiring to be called brain dead or worthless when your stats are solid and you’re playing your role the way it’s meant to be played.”</p><p>The movement has spread across other social media platforms, including X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok. However, there are a fair number of detractors casting doubts on the size of the movement, with several <em>Rivals </em>streamers making fun of the whole thing and calling it dramatic. As of yet, it’s unclear if the message is getting through to those in the community who need to hear it. Maybe those players will get it when they’ve got to swap over to Strategist themselves because nobody is healing.</p><p>For more on <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The talk of the town currently in gaming is Bethesda's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, but it might not be the only RPG remaster from Bethesda. A report said a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">Fallout 3 remaster is coming</a>, and now one of the game's original designers, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/16256/bruce-nesmith/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bruce Nesmith</a>, has commented on what he'd like to see from it.</p><p>Nesmith told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-3-designer-expects-remaster-to-heavily-revise-gunplay/?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20250423" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Videogamer</a> that he'd like to see Fallout 3's gunplay improved upon to make it more like Fallout 4's. "[Fallout 3 combat] didn't hold up to shooters at the time," he said. "Also, it's an RPG shooter; it's not a run-and-gun shooter. But a lot of work was done on that for Fallout 4. So I anticipate seeing a lot of that work go into it, assuming they're doing the same thing."</p><p>Nesmith pointed out that Fallout 3 marked Bethesda's first big stab at a shooter-style game, and the gunplay was not ideal.</p><p>A Fallout 3 remaster could also beef up the visuals of the 2008 game, Nesmith said. The Oblivion remaster didn't just make the game visually in line with the 2011 version of Skyrim--it exceeded it, Nesmith said. He said he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-oblivion-dev-reacts-to-oblivion-remastered-not-sure-remaster-does-it-justice/1100-6531057/" data-ref-id="1100-6531057">pleasantly surprised by the work that went into Oblivion Remastered.</a></p><p>A report said the rumored Fallout 3 remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">would not launch for a long time</a>, so anyone hoping to play it soon should probably give up hope about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bethesda Game Studios plans to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/">Fallout 5</a>, but it's not coming until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>--so it's not going to launch soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Oblivion Remastered is currently on sale for 17% off at GameSpot sister-site Fanatical (both GameSpot and Fanatical are owned by Fandom).</p><p>In other Fallout news, new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-fallout-76-update-is-live-letting-players-finally-become-a-ghoul/1100-6530194/">Fallout 76 finally allows players to become Ghouls</a>.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> has introduced quite a few <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/">new features and improvements</a> to Cyrodiil, but one classic feature from the original 2006 version of the game has undeniably remained: extremely cursed character faces.</p><p dir="ltr">To be fair, most of the horrifying faces in the original Oblivion belonged to NPCs. Player-characters often ended up looking a bit off as well, but the player-character's face wasn't featured as prominently in the original game as it is in the remaster, nor was third-person mode as polished as it is in the latest version of the game, so the game's wonky NPC faces tended to overshadow whatever horrors players put together in the character creator. In Oblivion Remastered, however, many of the game's NPCs have had glow-ups, while the game's character creator has given players more flexibility to turn the Hero of Kvatch into an utter monstrosity. There's even a subreddit where players can share said monstrosities: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OblivionAbominations/" rel="nofollow ">/r/OblivionAbominations</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, Oblivion Remastered's updated character creator makes it far easier for players to create <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k6aau5/i_made_a_beautiful_orc_lady/" rel="nofollow ">visually appealing characters</a>, but it also makes it easier for players to create characters that are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k6becp/you_are_the_one_from_my_dreams/" rel="nofollow ">pure nightmare fuel</a>. Almost immediately following the game's surprise release, social media started filling up with screenshots of player-character designs that make <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/167oww7/why_do_the_characters_look_like_that_im_scared/" rel="nofollow ">the bug-eyed NPCs</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a> look downright friendly. Here are some of our favorites.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Sir Vancelot</h3><p>Arguably the most popular horrifying player-character, Sir Vancelot has started appearing all over social media since his creator first shared him.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Dumb and Dunmer</h3><p>This delightfully horrifying dark elf is truly the stuff of nightmares.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Shrek</h3><p>This particular orc (...that <em>is</em> an orc, right?) is giving off major "Shrek had a few too many filler injections" vibes.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Yu-Gi-Oh My God</h3><p>It's nothing if not accurate.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Janker</h3><p>Some men just want to watch the Oblivion Gate burn.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Not-So-Handsome Squidward</h3><p>Someone free him from his suffering.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Jimmy No-Tron</h3><p>Depends on one's definition of gorgeous.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Orange-In-Chief</h3><p dir="ltr">"This is a really, really great Oblivion player-character. The best, really terrific. No fake news here. Other player-characters? Losers! Total disasters. Everyone agrees. Believe me."</p><h3 dir="ltr">I Have No Eyes And I Must Flush</h3><p>50% orc, 50% sleep-paralysis demon.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Crimson Chin Deathclaw</h3><p>He looks even more hilarious with his armor on.</p><p dir="ltr">Which Oblivion abomination is your favorite?
