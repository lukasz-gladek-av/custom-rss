			<p>It's been a long time since we last covered Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. Chinese developer Lenzee Games&nbsp;has been largely quiet since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beautiful-chinese-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 announcement</a> of the Soulslike action RPG, but the release date is finally approaching, and Chinese media and streamers have just published some new promising gameplay footage captured at 4K@60FPS.</p>
<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is set in the land of Shu during the late Ming Dynasty, during a time of war that is only worsened by a mysterious disease that spawns monstrous creatures. Players will become the titular Wuchang, a skilled pirate warrior stricken with amnesia who must explore this perilous land while suffering from the terrifying Feathering Disease.</p>
<p>During the game, players will upgrade Wuchang's arsenal and master new skills gathered from fallen enemies. The fighting style can be enhanced by sacrificing the elusive Red Mercury and developing new techniques picked up during the journey. Powerful enchantments to the weapons in Wuchang's arsenal can be added as well to tailor the player's favored combat style.</p>
<p>She'll go through forgotten temples, overgrown ruins and the like to face against grotesque abominations that draw on ancient Chinese lore. As the player and Wuchang piece together her lost memories, the choices will reportedly lead you to one of several endings, in a major change from usual Asian titles. The endings will be based on the decisions made, the secrets uncovered, and the allies chosen.</p>

<p>Leenzee Games, whose only prior project is the relatively unknown cyberpunk sci-fi VR interactive movie <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1523370/AD_2047/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A.D. 2047</a>, is promising a rich storyline, dynamic combat system, and stunning visuals, making for an unforgettable adventure.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, but Wuchang: Fallen Feathers should launch on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5 later this year, published by 505 Games.

<p>TikTok’s final days in the US were counting down to zero. Long ago, it was announced the popular social media phenomenon was set to be banned in the United States. However, a last-minute change allows TikTok to work in the US again, and we know why.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/president-joe-biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-in-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Joe Biden signed a bill in April 2024</a> that would end TikTok’s usability in the US. January 19 saw the ban finally take effect, and as Biden planned, TikTok was no longer allowed in the US. The change would impact millions of users, and content creators, and make wholesale changes to the social media landscape.</p>



<p>This was the plan until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-is-already-starting-to-come-back-online-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok quickly came back online in the US</a>. Many wonder how the app is online despite President Biden’s decree, so let’s explain.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-brought-tiktok-back-in-the-us">Who Brought TikTok Back in The US?</h2>



<p><strong>Future president Donald Trump is the reason TikTok is back in the United States.</strong></p>



<p>The former—and now forthcoming American leader—has made his TikTok thoughts clear. He doesn’t feel it should be banned and feels its profitability is too valuable to lose.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-tiktok-working-again">Why is TikTok Working Again?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>People need their quick-clip fix. Credit to TikTok</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>On January 19, Donald Trump indicated he would declare an executive order on Monday, January 20, to “extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect.”</strong></p>



<p>Trump posted a stern statement on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Truth Social</a>, asking companies to “not let TikTok stay dark!” He also made clear his intentions for Tikok, and how the <strong>social media platform’s existence in the US would be saved</strong>.</p>



<p>“I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security. The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113855616848696050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said Trump in his post</a>.</p>



<p>He adds that he wants the “United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.”&nbsp;This will “save TikTok” and “keep it in good hands.” Trump has proposed a joint venture between the US and TikTok and believes it’s “worth hundreds of billions of dollars – maybe trillions,” to the US.</p>



<p>Donald Trump officially becomes president again on January 20, and if the figure has his way, TikTok will likely remain online in the US for good. A joint venture allowing the US to benefit from TikTok seems to be better than no TikTok at all, and the turnaround could be a shrewd move and win over some of the United States public.</p>



<hr>



<p>Is TikTok being active in the US a good thing? Or were you relieved to see the social media platform be taken offline? Drop some comments down below to have your say on TikTok in the US.</p>



<p>It’s not only TikTok that’s been hit by the ban. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Snap was also down due to the TikTok Ban</a>, along with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bytedance-ban-takedown-mobile-legends-bang-bang/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</a>.</p>

            <p>
An annual report into the state of video games has raised eyebrows for suggesting Rockstar will sell the long-awaited behemoth that is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> for $100 - around £80.
</p>
<p>
The amount could be justified by the game's enormous budget and would fit with a similar move by GTA publisher Take-Two back at the start of the current console generation, when it helped lead the charge in raising game prices previously.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">report</a> - published by Matthew Ball of Epyllion - suggests there is "hope" within the wider video game industry that prices do rise closer to an average £80/$100 price point to reflect rising development costs.

<p>
In 2020, the launch of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S saw the average boxed game release shift upwards to around £70 here in the UK. Numerous big budget releases also offer premium editions priced even higher, with added in-game content, or early access dangled as an incentive.
</p><p>
But will it happen? Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad has offered another view, which is that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> has - and continues to - earn so much recurring revenue through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> that a higher price to play the game upfront isn't necessary.
</p>
<p>
"I'd be surprised if this happens," Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1881049643221746005">wrote</a> on X. "If anything Take-Two could afford to lower the price (they won't) to get more people in given how much they earn via GTA Online.
</p>
<p>
"Besides, you don't need to raise prices when a good chunk of pre-orders will be for a $100 SKU with bonuses anyway."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-comes-a-time-when-we-all-declare-the-war-is-over-former-playstation-studios-boss-shawn-layden-on-the-future-of-video-game-consoles">Eurogamer spoke with Shawn Layden, former chairman of PlayStation Worldwide Studios</a>, on the issue of ballooning game costs and what he believes should be done to bring prices down. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid we've built AAA gaming into a kind of cathedral business, and it just can't grow any further," Layden said. "In fact, it's probably grown too far already."

		<p>The setting of a solar system war is a familiar setting, that’s been explored in various stories. Stories From Sol: The Gun Dog is a visual novel set in a universe where such a war has concluded. The allied front of the Martian Territories and the Jovian Unified Colony Fleet has defeated the oppressive Earth-based Solar Federation. Your character is a Jovian, meant to take part in a battle during the final days of the war, but your mech had engineering issues. Those issues lead to almost all of your squadron getting killed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog - Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4D9LXfAyAVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Stories From Sol: The Gun Dog opens aboard the Jovian Carrier JFS Kalyke. Your character, who you can name, is a fresh conscript who is trained as a pilot, but training has all been done in simulations and not in real-world situations. In this opening, your frame, aka mech, does not disengage from the Kalyke, leading to the aforementioned squadron wipe out. The game moves on from this opening to four years after the war, where your character is made a lieutenant following years of doing security detail, and is transferred to the JFS Gun Dog, a very small ship with a small crew.</p>


<p>Before you meet the crew you familiarise yourself with the gameplay screen, which has five options on the right hand side. Those options are move, use, look, talk and item. Look lets you observe surroundings and gain information about locations, use is for interacting with things in the rooms, item lets you see and use the items you are carrying. The talk button brings up who is available to talk and interact with. Later on, a function button is made available that gives access to your task list, a map of the ship allowing fast travel, and an info tab which gives background about items and the game’s lore. What I found a great design choice here was that when you clicked on a button there was a hefty clunk sound, providing satisfying feedback and playing into the retro design feel of Stories from Sol: The Gun Dog.</p>
<p>Stories from Sol: The Gun Dog looks green throughout, with the graphics fundamentally being different tones of that shade. It evokes the sense of playing on a retro handhold, and it mostly looks great. The function screen could be a bit better since the words on the options are blurred. Understandably, it is done to maintain that retro feel, but a modern touch here wouldn’t take away from the overall impact of the game’s look. Music is very good and maintains a retro feel that the game is going for. It has that sci-fi feel to it, while also feeding into that classic old-school gaming setup, while the music matches each scene I played through very well.</p>


<p>The crew of the Gun Dog include Cassandra, love interest of the main character who has also been assigned to the same ship after some playing around with admin. She is described as someone who jokes around a lot, and this is the reason why she doesn’t have her own ship command, though she is high-ranking in the hierarchy. Captain Bartermews, captain of the Gun Dog, appears to be quite laid back and you later find she has a bit of a drinking problem. Mackenzie Cathays, &nbsp;is the Chief Engineer and will go into lectures and tangents about various engineering theories and terms.</p>
<p>Dylan is the gunner, who spends much of his time in the gunner room, listening to albums. Seifer Rosarium is the ship doctor who doesn’t care much for patient confidentiality, while Cadet Dalton Grange is the junior engineer based in the hangar. There’s also Haru Rumney, pilot, and Hansen Crwys, only other survivor of the Kalyke squadron that was killed and former squadmate of your player character, who blames your character for that failed mission. The relationships and how they evolve will depend on your actions and decisions. Throughout Stories from Sol: The Gun Dog, you will face various decisions and choices, from how you deal with interpersonal conflict to bigger choices that will impact the whole crew.</p>

<p>What's interesting here though is the developer TeamKill Media's reasoning for keeping their game away from your desktop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/henry-cavills-good-but-hes-got-nothing-on-these-five-celebrity-pc-builds?view=comments">thinking telly</a>. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/01/code-violet-takes-aim-at-dinosaur-horror-in-june-on-ps5">Pushsquare</a>, Here's their <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1880780993813987541">post in full</a>:</p>
<p>"For those asking us about a PC version of Code Violet… the reason we are not bringing it to PC is we do not want anyone modding vulgar versions of the main character as well as other characters in the game. We hold our voice actresses and actors with high regard, as well as our artistic vision for the game and story and reject any form of destroying that with sexual mods. Making a joke out of our art and possibly tarnishing the reputation of our voice actresses and actors is not worth the extra money we can make."</p><p>I…don't know what to make of it, honestly. As far as reasoning goes, it isn't unprecedented. The talent agency for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judgment">Judgement</a> star Takuya Kimura <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-judgment-series-is-ending-over-pc-version-disag-1847271300">got in a tangle with SEGA</a> over not wanting to have the series ported to PC for similar reasons. In 2021,<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/cdpr-shuts-down-cyberpunk-mod-that-let-players-have-sex-with-keanu-reeves/"> CD Projekt shut down</a> a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077 </a>mod that reskinned a boneable joytoy to look like Keanu Reeves ("It's always nice when it's nice" was Reeves' own response.)</p>
<p>So, the wording of the tweet focusing on the actors might suggest a similar case of talent agency reticence to that of Judgement. And, hey, if this is genuinely a case of a developer sticking to their guns about their vision for their work to the point where it excludes an entire massive market, then fair play. They <em>probably</em> could have worded in such a way that doesn't suggest the entire PC owning market is a bunch of slavering boob goblins. But then again, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-mod-jimbos-big-naturals-is-a-lot-funnier-and-safer-for-work-than-it-sounds">Jimbo's Big Naturals</a> suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>Teamkill previously released dino FPS <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3200540/Son_and_Bone/">Son and Bone</a> to Steam. The only mod I could find was <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/sonandbone?tab=latest">this one</a>, which removes the splash screen. Maybe they're just really, really proud of Code Violet's splash screen?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This weekend’s round of Call of Duty League matches unfolded in a typical fashion, with the teams that you’d expect walking away with their heads held high. Toronto Ultra is the only organisation to remain unbeaten during the Major I qualifiers, and Atlanta FaZe is still trying to claw its way up the standings after a miserable season opening.</p>



<p>One team that shone this weekend was OpTic Texas, which now sits on a 5-1 record for the stage after punishing LA Thieves and the Vegas Falcons this weekend. The match against LAT was something special.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-record-you-want">Not The Record You Want</h2>



<p>The OpTic Texas v. LA Thieves fixture was nothing short of chaotic, opening with OpTic 100-clubbing LAT in a round of Hardpoint on Hacienda. During this match, LAT’s Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst secured a record he’s probably not too proud of. He became the first player in Call of Duty League history to land less than 1000 damage on a single round of HP.</p>



<p>By the time the dust had settled, he’d produced a kill-death ratio of 6 – 19, marking his place in history with one of the worst performances since the CDL debuted in 2020. </p>



<p>He took it in jest, though:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Map 1. 6 kills, 750 dmg. 10 miles ran.</span></p></article></div>







<p>As the match unfolded, it looked as though the LA Thieves found their footing and secured wins in the first round of Search and the game of Control, but OpTic Texas held firm. The second Hardpoint, which took place on Skyline, was a relatively easy win for OpTic, and during game five, something monumental occurred.</p>



<p>From a 5 – 1 lead, LAT crumbled, being reverse-swept by OpTic Texas. In the final round, Kenny clutched a 1v2 finish that was nothing short of spectacular, netting the win and the much-needed COD points that almost guarantee a top seed for the team at Major I.</p>



<p>We’ve got one more regular weekend of CDL action before Major I arrives. It’s the first CDL Major to take place in Europe, and it’ll unravel in Madrid from January 30 to February 2.</p>



<p>I’ll be on location for the whole weekend with Insider Gaming – so keep an eye open for the hottest coverage from the CDL.</p>

<p>The World Series of Warzone Global Finals unravelled in Las Vegas in September 2024, with hundreds of thousands of people tuning in to catch the battle royale action unfold. As the biggest tournament in the Warzone space, it naturally attracts the most prolific competitors, and it bears a $950,000 prize pool.</p>



<p>Recently, a claim surfaced on social media from Biffle, the Team Falcons player who was part of the trio that won the Global Finals. The group scooped a $300,000 prize, but according to Biffle, ‘around 20 people’ (including him) still haven’t been paid more than four months later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-debt-owed">A Debt Owed</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/DiazBiffle/status/1881038922114879847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Biffle wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Its been 4 months since WSOW and there is probably around 20 people that haven’t been paid out that I know of (including my $100,000). No one is answering the email that was provided to us for WSOW support. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Biffle, Soka, and Shifty claimed the $300,000 prize at the World Series of Warzone Global Finals just two months after winning the top prize in the Warzone category at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>For a while, there have been concerns regarding Activision’s stance on battle royale-based esports events, and for a few months, it has seemed like the scene is wavering and perhaps preparing to fade away. Presently, nobody has any idea what this year’s competitive ecosystem looks like for the World Series of Warzone.</p>



<p>Biffle has gone public with his concerns, and rightly so. To be missing out on a $100,000 payment is ludicrous, and it shows a lack of integrity that could forever mar Activision’s competitive Warzone ecosystem.</p>



<p>In a follow-up comment, UnRationaL, who secured the second-place spot behind Biffle’s team, said that he’s still waiting on a $53,000 payment.</p>



<p>There are no indications that the Call of Duty League teams have their payments held for so long when they win a Major or COD Champs, so why is Warzone being forgotten about by Activision and Microsoft?</p>

We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><strong>(Update 4:10pm-- </strong>Users are also seeing Trump thanked in their now-functioning app, with a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/phillewis.bsky.social/post/3lg4k6ulsos2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">message</a> reading "As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.! You can continue to create, share, and discover all the things you love on TikTok."<strong>)</strong></p><p>While Google and Apple did in fact remove TikTok from their stores (alongside, to many players’ surprise, mobile game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/511299/marvel-snap-down-bytedance-tiktok-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Marvel Snap</em></a>, which is published by a ByteDance subsidiary), no one seemed particularly keen on enforcing the rule, which required ByteDance to shut TikTok down in the US when it didn’t find a US buyer for the app by January 19. A White House <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-administration-trump-implement-tiktok-ban-rcna188155" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> on Friday noted that “actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration.” On <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tiktok-ban-sunday-what-to-know-rcna188256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saturday</a>, the White House added that “We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday;” Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-likely-give-tiktok-90-day-extension-avoid-ban-rcna188258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that day that he would likely issue a 90-day extension on the sale deadline once he took office. The initial idea to ban TikTok was actually <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-technology-foreign-policy-politics-business-1f636191b0b9e28c7041fb64fb547801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump’s idea </a>back in 2020, though some Republicans seem to be doing their best to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/numb.comfortab.ly/post/3lg4lnplmg226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memory-hole</a> all that.</p><p>Basically, no one really had to do anything here, and yet a lot of things happened, or felt like they happened. It’s the perfect situation for Trump: a lot of chaos and high emotion, with lots of fingers to point and credit to claim. Regular people faced losing something that matters to them; those who haven’t been closely following the whole <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-timeline-ban-biden-india-d3219a32de913f8083612e71ecf1f428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long journey</a> to this moment might be easily convinced that it’s the cruel fault of Biden and the Democrats, who can be cast as out-of-touch elites who have been consistently letting them down. (It doesn’t help that this is, to some extent, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/188333/democrats-break-status-quo-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">true</a>.) Trump could throw around bombastic rhetoric and big promises, aided by companies <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/18/trump-washington-return-inauguration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kissing his ring</a> and parroting his talking points. Neither Trump nor ByteDance did this for the good of everyday TikTok users, but it could <em>feel</em> like a win for them; they get to go back to finding <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/19/tiktok-ban-important-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community</a> and making dance videos, while Trump gets to boost his image and ByteDance, like every other big company, gets to curry favor with his administration. Trump has even been able to tie his inauguration proceedings into TikTok’s return, writing on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113855616848696050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TruthSocial</a> that “Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations.”</p><p>The only thing more embarrassing than having to live through all this is if it actually works, if Trump comes out of this weekend having tricked even one more regular person into thinking he's on their side. I understand why some people would <em>want</em> to believe this narrative, and I understand why the last four years might make them susceptible to it. But hopefully even more people will see it as a warning for how much more bullshit is headed our way, a reminder of how clear-eyed we'll need to be to resist politicians and companies punting us around in their self-serving football game.&nbsp;</p><p>Republicans are<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-2-gop-senators-break-trump-tiktok-extension-rcna188307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> already bickering</a> over it all, with Speaker Johnson claiming he’ll uphold the ban and several Republicans praising “Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft for following the law.” Maybe we’ll at least get some funny TikToks out of whatever happens next.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review"><h3>Grand Theft Hamlet Is A Funny, Touching Take On Shakespeare</h3></a><p>‘We’re putting on a play inside a game, but the game is a kind of play, because we’re playing’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-elon-musk-asmongold-twitch-path-of-exile"><h3>Elon Musk Has Once Again Revealed That He’s A Fraud, This Time By Beefing With A Twitch Streamer</h3></a><p>"He needs to believe, for his own sake, that it’s possible for him to jump into the deep end of anything and excel"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-trump"><h3>What Games Journalism Can Do Now</h3></a><p>Readers, and fellow journalists, are going to need what games journalists know in the face of the upcoming administration</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A Sims fan reckons they've stumbled upon evidence of unannounced MySims games.</p>
<p>According to redditor OyeDiego, pages for the MySims Action Bundle and MySims Beacon Bay briefly popped up on the EA app over the weekend, although neither bundle has been previously confirmed by publisher EA.</p>
<p>To bolster the claim, the poster included a screen recording of what they saw.</p>

<p>"Last night, I found broken pages for MySims Action Bundle and MySims Beacon Bay in the EA app," the poster explained. "Neither had no images nor summaries, just the title, PEGI 7, and a date of 2099.</p>
<p>"It did not leave [sic] me pre-order them, so I saved them to my wish list. Today I couldn't find the games by searching for them, but they were still in my list. But Beacon Bay was causing the app to break. However, the Action Bundle was still intact.</p>
<p>"When I completely restarted the app, both games disappeared from my wishlist and I couldn't find them anymore."</p>

</span></p><p>Whilst the OP was unable to assuage all cynics that the video was genuinely taken of the EA App, one poster <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/1i3u3op/comment/m7q85zx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> in their defence: "I work as a developer. It would be a lot of work to create an EA app clone just to provide both unfinished pages and 500 error codes. Like, it would take a lot to mimic the UI and setup of the app just for bait.</p>
<p>"I don't see any reason as to why this wouldn’t be real - and the hypothetical response of removing the post kind of pushes people away from wanting to post here over Twitter."</p>
<p>Other fans hypothesise that the action bundle reads as though it's Agents and Skyheroes, whilst <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Beacon_Bay">Beacon Bay</a> is a throwback that only players of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a> on Nintendo DS may remember, and could well be a brand-new MySims game.</p><p>Is the video real? Who knows. But with TheSims' 25th anniversary coming up, it's certainly plausible that a bundle of older and fan-favourite games could be on the way. We've reached out to EA and will let you know as and when we know more.</p>
<p>Talking of the 25th anniversary, all that kicks off on 4th February with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-marking-series-25th-anniversary-with-huge-free-update-adding-70-new-items">"huge" free The Sims 4 update introducing over 70+ new items</a> spanning both Create a Sim and Build Buy modes. There's talk of turtlenecks and bodysuits, bike shorts, accessories, and hairdos. New furnishings, meanwhile, include "stylish" windows and doors, wood finishes for kitchen cabinets, and even a new playground pirate ship.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-boss-doesnt-rule-out-possible-frame-generation-support-for-rtx-30-series/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At CES 2025, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyxXRXDtcPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Bryan Catanzaro, VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, about the announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> and&nbsp;its many improvements to Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Frame Generation.</p>
<p>Catanzaro talked about the new transformer models that are replacing CNN (convolutional neural networks) for Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction. These are simply much smarter, can be trained on larger datasets and make better choices as a result, improving historic NVIDIA DLSS shortcomings like shimmering or ghosting. The new Super Resolution model, for instance, has four times more compute compared to the previous one. Catanzaro didn't provide an estimate on how much more rendering time it will cost, but he did say NVIDIA believes it's the best way to play on the new Blackwell-powered GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards that are launching later this month.</p>
<p>Frame Generation is also being overhauled, abandoning the previous model based on the Optical Flow hardware accelerator for an entirely AI-powered solution. Here's why NVIDIA is doing that:</p>
<p><em>When we built NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation, we absolutely needed hardware acceleration to compute Optical Flow. We didn't have enough Tensor Cores and we didn't have an Optical Flow algorithm that was good enough. We hadn't developed a real-time Optical Flow algorithm that ran on Tensor Cores that could fit our compute budget. We had the Optical Flow accelerator, which NVIDIA had been building for years as an evolution of our video encoder technology, and it's also been a part of our automotive computer vision acceleration for self-driving cars.</em></p>
<p><em>It made sense for us to use that for NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation. But the difficult part about any sort of hardware implementation of an algorithm like Optical Flow is that it's really difficult to improve it. It is kind of what it is and the failures that arose from that hardware Optical Flow, we couldn't undo them with a smarter neural network until we decided to just replace it and go with a fully AI-based solution, so that's what we've done for Frame Generation in DLSS 4.</em></p>
<p>The new Frame Generation model is heavier on Tensor Cores, but it uses less VRAM, offers improved image quality (which Catanzaro deemed critical, especially for the new Multi Frame Generation available on the new RTX 50 GPUs), and is also more efficient as the cost has been amortized over multiple frames.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>DF's Alex Battaglia asked then whether the new model could be ported to older hardware like the GeForce RTX 30 Series, and the head of NVIDIA DLSS didn't close that door.</p>
<p><em>I think this is primarily a question of optimization and also engineering and then the ultimate user experience. We're launching this Frame Generation, the best Multi Frame Generation technology, with the 50 Series, and we'll see what we're able to squeeze out of older hardware in the future.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, when NVIDIA introduced Frame Generation with the GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards, Catanzaro himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-engineer-says-dlss-3-on-older-rtx-gpus-could-theoretically-happen-teases-rtx-i-o-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that the feature was exclusive to then-new GPUs because they had a much improved Optical Flow hardware accelerator than the RTX 30 Series. Back then, he also said it was theoretically possible to port it to older hardware, although it probably wouldn't be as beneficial.</p>
<p>With the new model removing the Optical Flow hardware accelerator, it seems like the door might be open for that to happen. However, Catanzaro also said the Tensor Core requirements are higher, and obviously, the older GPU architecture has worse Tensor Core performance. We'll see if NVIDIA can really make it happen.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Bryan Catanzaro highlighted the importance of decoupling the updated flip metering from the CPU to reduce frame time variability (and, therefore, improve frame pacing) by a factor of five to ten compared to before. Last but not least, he claimed that playing a game with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reflex 2</a> (which is also AI-based) feels much more 'connected' and he believes that especially latency-sensitive gamers will love it.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more NVIDIA DLSS 4 coverage on Wccftech as we get closer to the launch of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>

<p>The two finalists were given five attempts to set the fastest time across a devilishly difficult level, using the flower umbrella and slo-mo to speed up the run as much as possible.</p>
<p>Team Circle's Rhys secured a win with an astonishing run-time of 34.51.6s, narrowly beating Team Square's equally-impressive 34.84.1s.</p>
<p>There was no word from the commentary team on whether the general public will eventually get the chance to run the gauntlet, too, but Bot fans are hopeful Team Asobi hasn't yet given up on patching in a cheeky cameo or two given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-update-teases-surprising-bonus-cameo">several games noted in the credits have yet to be discovered</a>.</p><div>

<p>"I've built my entire working life around [video games], my career dedicated to celebrating the best and highlighting the worst," Tom O wrote in his feature, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2024-astro-bot-made-the-best-play-for-nostalgia-this-year-and-i-dont-care-if-you-think-its-a-big-advert">Astro Bot made the best play for nostalgia this year, and I don't care if you think it's a big advert</a>. "As a job, it's as tiring and exhausting, sometimes exasperating, as any other, and it's easy to lose sight of why I chose this path all those years ago.</p>
<p>"Just for a moment, in the darkened early hours, a dim light from the DualSense painting the room in an ethereal glow, I was 12 again, and it was incredible. For that, I love Astro Bot, and I guess I love PlayStation too."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Another 136,000 ranked play accounts have been banned for cheating across both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone.</p>
<p>In a detailed update shared on social media, developer Treyarch said it recognised cheaters "are frustrating and severely impact the experience for our community" but insisted it was addressing the issue, and will continue to do so "throughout 2025".</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Part of these efforts include "new layers of security and protections", as well as updated detection models for behavioural systems like aim botting, and "other data points", including "account trust and hardware identifiers to target serial cheaters".</p>
<p>Players can also expect new detection and warning systems for spam reporting and enhanced cross-examination tools to reduce the time it takes to review reports.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Ahead of Season 02’s launch, we’re here to discuss what the various dev teams and studios are doing right now to address what matters to our players today:</p><p>• Cheating and bans<br>• Ability to disable cross-play on consoles in Ranked<br>• Server issues<br>• Quality of life updates<br>•… <a href="https://t.co/O6traEfwwG">https://t.co/O6traEfwwG</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1880372557221884278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>From Season 2, players can expect to see new and improved client and server-side detections and systems, too, as well as "major" kernel-level driver updates that not only improve driver security, but also reinforce the encryption process and introduce a new tampering detection system.</p><p>Treyarch stressed that "malicious reporting is against the security and enforcement policy", adding that when a user spams the report button in-game multiple times against a user – or someone uses an illegal cheat tool to spam 10,000 reports – its system "does not consider more than one single report from a player versus another (despite what cheat developers are telling players when they try to sell their illegal software)".</p>
<p>Interestingly, when a cheater is banned, the developer's system will also "detect other accounts it had regularly partied up with and raise flags for investigation to combat boosting and other cheater behaviour".</p>
<p>"We have seen community questions about detection methods, like IP-based banning," the studio explained. "We do not utilise IP-based bans for anti-cheat because they tend to take action against entire groups within a range that aren't problematic. For example, a college campus or internet café would be swept up in an IP-based ban wave when only a single machine was targeted."</p>
<p>ICYMI, as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 readies for the release of Season 2 on 28th January, developer Treyarch has shared initial details of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-next-zombies-map-is-called-the-tomb-and-plunges-players-into-ancient-catacombs">Zombies mode's next map, The Tomb</a> - which plunges players deep beneath the earth, down into ancient catacombs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>TikTok has stated that their services will return online following the services ban earlier today.</p>



<p>The statement came from the official X (formerly Twitter) account of TikTok, which reads:</p>



<p>“In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.”</p>



<p>They continued, “It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.”</p>



<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/us-tiktok-ban-statement-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok was forced to limit its service</a> to US residents following the United States’ decision to ban the app due to “safety and security concerns.” Other countries, including the UK have said that they would not follow the US in banning the app, despite widespread reports that US allies may impose similar bans.</p>



<p>Darren Jones, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in the UK said cats and dancing videos do not “seem like a national security threat.”</p>



<p>TikTok’s ban was said to impact some 170 million users who use the social media app, with tens of thousands of content creators and small business using it as a source of revenue.</p>



<p>The ban also meant that Marvel Snap, the competitive digital collectible card game developed by Second Dinner, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also banned in the US</a>. Second Dinner, who said they had no idea about the ban, is yet to comment on when Marvel Snap will return to US residents. </p>

			<p>2025 is going to see a lot of massive releases across a multitude of genres. Narrowing it down to the sports and racing games in particular, there are a fair few games that are going to be released this year that will be major hits for petrolheads and sports fans. If you want to know what games you should be putting on your calendar this year, make sure to keep reading for Wccftech's most anticipated sports and racing games of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a></em></p>

<h2>Assetto Corsa EVO (Out Now on PC via Steam)</h2>
<p>Assetto Corsa is a very popular racing game franchise, and the latest iteration has just been released, albeit on early access. There isn't a date set yet for when Assetto Corsa EVO is going to be on consoles just yet, so those on console will have to wait a little bit longer for this hyperrealistic racing game. What we do know is that Assetto Corsa EVO is set to have its full launch between September and December. The game will feature extensive modding support, as well as consistent updates to keep the game fresh once it has experienced its full launch, when it will include 100 cars and 15 officially licensed circuits (with 5 more tracks following afterward as free updates). Before that, KUNOS <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-to-get-open-world-map-in-summer-2025-early-access-begins-january-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will add an open world map sometime this Summer</a>.</p>
<p>If you jump in right now, though, you'll already find 20 cars from several classes and 5 circuits across the continents: Laguna Seca (America), Brands Hatch and Imola (Europe), Mount Panorama (Australia), and Suzuka (Japan). When it comes to modes, the early access launch build features Practice sessions, Quick Races, the brand new Driving Academy, and the Hotstint and Test Drive special events.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>WWE 2K25 (March 2025)</h2>
<p>WWE is a popular franchise that helps boost profits for both Take-Two Interactive. This game was mentioned during the earnings call, where they mentioned both the potential release of PGA Tour 2K25 and, of course, WWE 2K25. Since 2000, WWE has received a new game every year except for 2021, where there was no game released at all. Since then, it's gone back to regular scheduling, and it's likely that WWE 2K25 will be released this year. It doesn't have a set release date as of yet, but it was mentioned in the earnings call that the game will be released before March 31, 2025. This would make sense, as the past three WWE games (including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-improved WWE 2K24</a>) were all released in early March.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>iRacing NASCAR 25 (Fall 2025 - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>It's been a long time coming, but NASCAR fans are finally getting a new game in the franchise. It's been three years since the last iteration aside from NASCAR 21: Ignition, but most people don't count that as an actual game in the series. iRacing NASCAR 25 was first heard of in 2023, when iRacing purchased the NASCAR license from Motorsport Games. This game will be built in Unreal Engine alongside Monster Games and is currently planned to launch on consoles, while a PC release is still up in the air.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/maxresdefault-14-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (TBA - All Platforms)</h2>
<p>This game was first showcased at The Game Awards 2024, where Sega released a trailer for this upcoming game. The release date is currently unknown, but it is set to debut "soon." All we know is that the developers have promised a distinct racing mechanic that will 'transport Sonic racing fans into a new dimension.'</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be available across all platforms (including Nintendo's) and, like its predecessor <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/team-sonic-racing-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Sonic Racing</a>, could be the perfect game to get youngsters into gaming and engage in some friendly competition.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wreckfest_2_Keyart-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Wreckfest 2 (TBA 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Throughout the whole sports and racing games genre, there isn't anything quite like Wreckfest. The spiritual successor to FlatOut <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-announced-with-new-car-customization-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returns in 2025</a> after 2018's first installment. We don't know a lot about it yet, although Finnish developer Bugbear Entertainment has promised improved destruction thanks to the more accurate physics engine and better sounds, with the latter being boasted as among the best in a racing title. So far, the main new feature is the ability to customize your vehicle. More info will undoubtedly be shared ahead of the launch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Snap goes offline in the USA as part of the Bytedance apps ban]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/19/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban.1086411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/19/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>From today, mobile users in the United States of America cannot access any apps that are owned by the Chinese company ByteDance Ltd. ByteDance Ltd has ceased operations following the upholding of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which bans any foreign adversary apps from essentially operating in the USA. The biggest app shutdown is TikTok, which was the primary target of the legislation. However, in the app US users will see that ByteDance is hoping the app will be back online, saying they hope President Trump will work with them.</p>
<p>One unexpected app shutdown is Marvel Snap, which developers Second Dinner and publisher Nuverse did not expect. Nuverse is a subsidiary of ByteDance Ltd, and falls under the ban brought in with the legislation. Ben Brode, co-founder of Second Dinner, released the following statement regarding the banning of Marvel Snap on social media, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social">BlueSky</a>.</p>


<p><em>“Unfortunately, MARVEL SNAP is temporarily unavailable in U.S. app stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. This was a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse. We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.”</em></p>
<p>In a follow up post, Ben has said that US players using VPNs should be able to get around the ban and continue playing Marvel Snap. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121596">Apple</a> has also created a support page regarding the Bytedance apps ban, and listed the following apps as no longer available in the US.</p>

<ul>
<li>TikTok</li>
<li>TikTok Studio</li>
<li>TikTok Shop Seller Center</li>
<li>CapCut</li>
<li>Lemon8</li>
<li>Hypic</li>
<li>Lark – Team Collaboration</li>
<li>Lark – Rooms Display</li>
<li>Lark Rooms Controller</li>
<li>Gauth: AI Study Companion</li>
<li>MARVEL SNAP</li>
</ul>
<p>It is currently unknown if the ban will remain in place, with incoming President Trump stating he is likely to give TikTok, and by extension ByteDance, a 90 day reprieve when he takes office. That would overrule the Supreme Court’s ruling of upholding the ban. This is a change in the message from Trump’s previous term in office where he publicly stated opposition to TikTok and was in support of a ban, as reported by <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-tiktok-timeline-1.7432843">CBC</a>.</p>
