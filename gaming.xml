  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will not be returning to iOS in Japan next year "as promised" because, according to Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney, Apple has allegedly launched "another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking".</p>
<p>In a series of messages posted to X/Twitter, Sweeney explained that whilst Apple had been "required to open up iOS to competing stores", it has instead introduced additional fees, including a 21% "junk fee" on third-party in-app payments, 15% for purchases made on the web, and a "new 5% junk fee on all revenue from apps distributed by competing stores".</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-in-japan/">announced</a> earlier this week that it would be making changes to iOS in Japan, including new options for developers to distribute apps and process payments, acknowledging that the changes have been implemented to comply with the Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA).</p>
<p>"Sadly, Fortnite will not return to iOS in Japan in 2025 as promised," CEO Sweeney wrote. "Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores [on 18th December], and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan.</p>
<p>"Apple chose poorly. Again."</p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet, he added: "They're charging a competition-crushing 21% junk fee on third-party in-app payments, and 15% for purchases made on the web (a practice the US District Court already found to be illegal in the contempt of court proceeding that Apple lost and the 9th Circuit Court upheld)." He then linked to a page on <a href="https://t.co/QDtWekKflY">Apple's website</a>.</p><p>"They're introducing new anticompetitive warning screens meant to mislead customers into believing their privacy and financial security are at risk when dealing with Apple competitors. They're imposing a new 5% junk fee on all revenue from apps distributed by competing stores, and intend to surveil all transactions within them using a mandatory reporting API."</p>
<p>He closed on calling the changes "an egregious Apple imposition on distribution and payments they have no involvement with, and a practice the US courts already found to be illegal and upheld on appeal".</p>
<p>"Obviously, real competition won't happen, and consumers won't benefit, when Apple abuses its position between users and competitors to obstruct honest dealing between them," Sweeney concluded. "This is another sad day in the history of relationships between platform makers, developers, and consumers, and we will be raising our complaints with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission."</p>
<p>It's the latest in the five-year feud between Apple and Epic Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">when the Fortnite maker deliberately added a cheaper payment option to its battle royale that circumvented Apple's own method</a>, from which it then takes a 30 percent cut. The case has rumbled on since, but has rarely felt quite as dramatic as in the 80-page verdict slapped down on Apple in May by the US District Court of Northern California, which found the iPhone maker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">"in wilful violation" of the court's previous injuction designed to prohibit the company's "anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing"</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeney has previously stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Epic Games had lost around $1bn in missed revenue over the run of the case</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Despite being a very niche genre, fighting games haven't been in a better position, but looking at the number of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/">games released this year</a></strong>, this wouldn't seem to be the case. <span>With the latest entries in iconic series like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/" target="_blank"><strong>Street Fighter</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/" target="_blank"><strong>Tekken,</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/guilty-gear-strive-smells-underbaked/" target="_blank"><strong>Guilty Gear</strong></a>&nbsp;continuing to receive support with new content and balance changes, there's obviously no reason for CAPCOM, Bandai Namco, and Arc System Works to launch new games.</span></p>



<p>Still, the few fighting games that launched in 2025 are all quality games. Whether you are looking to experience a brand new game or return to a beloved classic, these games have something good to offer you.</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category:<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>Action</strong></a></em></p>



<h2 id="h-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Fatal-Fury-City-of-the-Wolves.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Despite being absent from the spotlight for a very long time, SNK's Fatal Fury series continued to be extremely popular among fighting game fans. After a long wait, the series returned this year with Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, and it couldn't have done so in a better way.</p>



<p>Besides featuring the unique two-plane combat mechanics of past entries, City of the Wolves ups the heat with the new mechanics, such as the Rev mechanics that can enhance special attacks, open up combo possibilities, and more. </p>



<p>With a wealth of single-player modes, including the RPG-like mode Episodes of South Town, a character roster featuring both beloved returning characters and newcomers (including some familiar faces from Street Fighter), Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is rightly considered by many to be the best fighting game released in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-2xko">2XKO</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2XKO_KeyArt_YasuoDarius_Final-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Riot's Project L has been a known entity for a long time, but it's only this year that the fighting game community has been able to go hands-on with the project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/"><strong>now known as 2XKO.</strong></a></p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/">Having only launched on PC in an early access version late this year,</a></span> it's still too early to know if Riot's immense expertise in multiplayer games will be able to make a dent in the popularity of games like Street Fighter 6. Still, it's undeniable that, leveraging the iconic League of Legends cast, the developer is creating a compelling tag-fighter that is easy to get into thanks to simplified execution of special moves, and harder to master with its deep assist system and interwoven offensive and defensive mechanics.</p>



<p>With 2XKO launching next year on consoles, 2026 could definitely be the year for Riot's fighting game. However, even in its current state, the game is more than worthy of anyone's time.</p>



<h2 id="h-absolum">Absolum</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Absolum.png"></a></figure>



<p>Although traditional competitive games are the face of the fighting game genre nowadays, the resurgence of the side-scrolling beat 'em up subgenre continues at full speed, providing some excellent games, such as Absolum.</p>



<p>Developed by Supamonks and Guard Crush Game, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/streets-of-rage-4-beautiful-brawl/"><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></a>, Absolum blends the same combo-oriented gameplay of the SEGA series revival with roguelike mechanics and procedurally generated levels, creating a remarkably satisfying experience with tons of replayability and an immense amount of depth thanks to the masterful crafting of each character's moveset.</p>



<p>While the game may be a little lacking in content right now (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1904480/view/519732795817328673?l=english"><strong>though more is coming next year</strong></a>), Absolum brings a new spin on a classic formula that works exceptionally well, making it one of the best fighting games released this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-world-stage">Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Virtua-Fighter-5-REVO-World-Stage.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>With fighting games being in a better place than in past console generations, it was baffling to see how SEGA was neglecting the Virtua Fighter series, one of the first franchises to guide the genre's transition from 2D to 3D. Thankfully, the Japanese publisher eventually came to its senses, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/"><strong>a new entry in the series is in the works by the Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.</strong></a></p>



<p>To bring back the franchise to a new generation of players ahead of the launch of the new game, SEGA <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-revo-world-stage-october-5-debut/"><strong>launched Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</strong></a>, an updated version of the latest entry in the series, complete with a single-player mode incorporating all the gameplay mechanics and tweaks introduced to the base game over the years.</p>



<p>Though not the new entry in the series fans expected, Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage is a more than decent release to tide them over for the launch of a new generation game that promises to be the peak of the series.</p>







<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CAPCOM-Fighting-Collection-2.avif"></a></figure>



<p>Considering the current state of the genre, supporting more than a single fighting game is a real challenge for even big publishers like CAPCOM, which has been exclusively focusing on Street Fighter 6 since its launch in 2023.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the Japanese publisher hasn't completely forgotten about some of its older IPs, such as Capcom vs. SNK and Rival Schools, releasing them to the modern audience with the Capcom Fighting Collection 2.</p>



<p>Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein, Power Stone and its sequel, the two Capcom vs. SNK games, Project Justice, Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper, and Capcom Fighting Evolution, the Japanese publisher has made it easier than ever to enjoy these classic games, hopefully with the intent of eventually reviving one of these series with new entries.</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>2025 has been a huge year for multiplayer gaming. From big budget sequels in major franchises, to emerging genres like the extraction shooter breaking into the mainstream, and smaller, more experimental indie games, there’s been a little bit of everything for everyone to enjoy – so long as you enjoy other people, I guess.</p>
<p>So, of all the headline-grabbing multiplayer games, both expected and unexpected, which came out on top?</p>



<p>When <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> exploded in popularity back in 2023, it triggered a major shift in the culture around multiplayer gaming – competitive argument-simulators like Jackbox and Among Us remain popular, but a new crop of games focused on chaotic co-op shenanigans emerged out of the woodwork. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/peak">PEAK</a> represents not only the best of that new genre we playfully refer to as “friendslop” – it represents the most fun you can have with a new multiplayer game this year, and it’s a major achievement in online gaming.</p>
<p>The concept is simple: it’s a co-op game about climbing, and if you and your three friends have to try to scale the massive multi-biome summit laid out before you. Fail to do so and your run is over. The fluid, physics-based absurdity of the game generates a million laughs a minute, but even in downtime and defeat there’s fun to be had. The game smartly lets dead players not just spectate the remaining crew, but float around as adorable ghosts, berate the surviving climbers, and even get in their face and distract them a little bit. It’s a wonderful blend of friendsloppy chaos and genuinely well-designed systems that has made it the best multiplayer that money can buy in 2025.</p>

<p><em>– Miguel</em></p>
<h3>Mario Kart World – Runner Up</h3>
<p>How do you follow up from near perfection? It’s a problem that you could argue Nintendo has faced many times over the decades, but was definitely true for creating a sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-8">Mario Kart 8</a>. That kart racer had sat atop the genre for a decade, presiding over both Wii U and Nintendo Switch as the best-selling game, and being exceptionally well supported with DLC through the years. So how do you top that? Well, you don’t, really. You turn right and just go for a drive through the countryside for a while.</p>
<p>Going open world is a huge part of what makes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> feel new and different. In addition to having the many themed race circuits, they’re all joined up by a network of roads and environments that you can also race through – OK, that you&nbsp;<em>have</em> to race through because Nintendo decided to put really emphasise this. With larger lobbies, wider roads and more items, Mario Kart World is even more of a light party game than before. But then there’s the Knockout Tour, the Battle Royale racing mode that features huge map-wide races, eliminates players at regular intervals, and builds up to a real pressure moment to survive to the very end.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of chaotic fun, perhaps a touch too chaotic, and with Nintendo’s typical quirks like not letting you party up for matchmaking (that they’ve thankfully tweaked in patches), but it remains an essential purchase for any <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> owner.</p>
<h3>Battlefield 6 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>2025 was the year that Battlefield finally, well and truly, stuck it to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a>. EA placed a huge bet in assembling a collective Battlefield Studios around DICE, and while some parts of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> have been a miss, the core multiplayer brings back a lot of the tone, feel and action that defined this series through the early 2010s. 64-player matches, defined classes, vehicular warfare are all here, and it’s great to get back to basics alongside some new and inventive game modes.</p>
<p>Through launch and its first season, the main complaints to lodge against Battlefield 6 have been a lack of large-scale maps that defined this franchise, and Battlefield Studios’ annoying tinkering to shorten match lengths and reduce player counts, and (of course) some rather silly looking skins in the battle pass, and then backtrack when the community complains that this is stupid and not what they want. But the core is still there, and we hope that 2026 sees Battlefield Studios build and grow around that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One day, video game critics and journalists will put together a comprehensive study on the impact <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">Balatro</a></em> had on the industry — of how so many games that came after tried to capture its essence by adding complex systems to otherwise simple, easily understood games. Until then, I’m gonna play <em>Dogpile</em>.</p><p><em><a href="https://dogpilegame.com/">Dogpile</a></em> is a deckbuilding match-3 roguelike that builds on the style of merge games like <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24049020/how-to-beat-suika-game-impossible/">Suika Game</a></em> by adding a <em>Balatro</em>-like twist. The result is a cute, cozy (in both genre and vibe) game that appeals to both the numbers-go-up and the dog-loving sicko in me. Drop matching dogs on top of each other to create bigger dogs that reward you with points to unlock higher levels. The smallest unit of dog is a Chihuahua, two Chihuahuas merge to form a Pomeranian (at least that’s what I think it is), and so forth. The dogs pile up the playing field kinda like <em>Tetris</em>, and also like <em>Tetris</em>, if the dogs spill over the top of the field, it’s game over.</p><p>Merging dogs is the simplest part of the game. It’s where the player has the least control — everything is subject to the whims of gravity, physics, and trajectory — but also where <em>Dogpile</em> is the most thrilling. The dogs themselves are cute, contorted into fun, confounding shapes that sometimes show off a butthole or two. Introducing modifiers like making the dogs bouncy or magnetic adds an interesting physical component to the game — <em>Dogpile</em> is match-3 <em>Tetris</em>, yes, but built with a physics engine. It feels so silly, so “baby distracted by jangling keys” to say that a pug glomming onto another pug to make a dachshund is gameplay action worth highlighting in the year of our gaming lord 2025. But the little guy does so with a satisfying “pop” accompanied by a cute little “arf” that <a href="https://youtu.be/LiFz5J9DHig?si=gvuwe322wcDtZg4x&amp;t=23">like Benoit Blanc, I’m compelled</a>.</p><p>Though the game has nothing to do with poker, you can see the DNA of<em> Balatro</em> running throughout. Like <em>Balatro</em>, each round you’re dealt a hand from a deck of cards that have dogs as the different suits. Also like<em> Balatro</em>, you get money to spend on modifying your deck with more cards and tags that work similar to <em>Balatro</em>’s jokers. For $15 (of in-game money, there are no microtransactions), you can either buy a chow chow card or a tag that makes certain dogs spin in place to agitate the dog pile for more merging opportunities. When you win a round, you also visit the grooming salon where you modify your dog cards directly. You can give a dog positive traits like “friendly,” making them magnetically attracted to their matches. Or you can wash away negative traits like fleas, which negate any positive traits a card might have.</p><p>Building your dog deck full of synergies to increase your points is where <em>Dogpile</em> is the most like <em>Balatro</em> and where the bulk of your strategic thinking comes into play. I like to give my dogs the barking trait that makes them disturb the pile with a bark when they’re dropped. That combined with the tag that awards points every time a dog barks makes for a brain-pleasing display of meters filling up and cash register noises going off that really drives home the fact that a lot of these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cloverpit-is-a-fun-not-gambling-roguelite-satire-of-capitalism-but-i-would-quite-like-us-to-stop-cashing-in-on-our-own-despair">well-intentioned, celebrated <em>Balatro</em>-likes</a> tap into the psychology of gambling addition to make them stick.</p><p><em>Dogpile</em> doesn’t feel very deep. There are no boss challenges. Failing to meet the point threshold doesn’t end a run, but instead makes you pick from a stock of negative events or traits that are either easily ignored or so detrimental that you lose the game immediately. Unlike <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Dogpile</em> doesn’t inspire the same feeling of endless possibility of the kinds of decks you can build.</p><p><em>Dogpile</em> isn’t the first game to complexify the humble match-3 genre, and I don’t know if its similarities to <em>Balatro</em> are intentional or not. But I like seeing how games can push <em>Balatro</em>’s formula beyond poker — especially if a dog is involved.</p><p>And yes, you can pet them.</p><p><sub><em>Dogpile</em> is out now on Steam.</sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/848041/dogpile-review-inde-game-steam-balatro-puppies]]></content:encoded>

But for an extra <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4QW8798?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$20 at Amazon</a>, you can change that today — with officially Asus-approved and sanctioned TMR joysticks from Gulikit, the company that’s made a name for itself by supplying aftermarket drift-resistant sticks.</p><p>The company says it worked with Xbox Ally manufacturer Asus to create these sticks, that they’ll be “automatically recognized” when you swap them in, and that you can use the handheld’s built-in Armoury Crate app to calibrate them afterwards.</p><p>And while I haven’t tried these ones (I do have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button">a pair in my Switch</a>), I can confirm it’s pretty easy to pop open the Xbox Ally to install. Just loosen the Philips-head screws, poke in a guitar pick pry tool to create a small gap, and pull a little harder than you think you need to pop open the clips. The joystick modules are right underneath. There’s nothing blocking you — just pop a ribbon cable and undo their three screws.</p><p>Here’s the company’s walkthrough in case you want to see for yourself — though I do not recommend taking sharp tweezers to ribbon cables when your fingernails can do that job safer and easier. (I may have broken a few ribbon cables in my life.)</p><p>When we’re talking about TMR or the older and slightly less power-efficient Hall effect joystick technology, I usually write “drift-resistant” instead of “drift-free” because you <em>may</em> find your center point drifting over time — but the beauty of magnetic is you just have to recalibrate! Unlike the potentiometer joysticks that ship with Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, and Microsoft Xbox controllers, you’re not scraping away material that’ll lead to permanent drift as you use the magnetic versions.</p><p>Gulikit’s new Xbox Ally sticks are <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4QW8798?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$20 in the US today</a>, and should also be available in the UK for <em>£</em>20, and in Italy, France, and Spain for €22, this January.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/848568/xbox-ally-gulikit-tmr-joysticks]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is changing vehicle availability on its Breakthrough maps to improve pacing and "vehicle availability" for attackers and defenders.</p>
<p>The changes, coming first to New Sobek City, are "part of a set of changes across multiple Breakthrough maps", and will be "actively monitor[ed]" to assess how they impact gameplay.</p>

<p>"Over the last few days, we’ve been rolling out a set of changes across multiple Breakthrough maps, starting with our earlier test on New Sobek City," the team explained in a social media post. "These changes are aimed at improving overall pacing and vehicle availability between Attacker and Defenders, and we are actively monitoring how these changes are impacting gameplay."</p> <div>

<p>Interestingly, the team is transparent that these change may not "perform well", but did commit to roll[ing] back some or all of these changes as our focus remains on steadily improving Breakthrough overall".</p>
<p>The team closed on thanking players for their "patience, support, and feedback as we continue to tune the mode", hinted further updates would be coming in the New Year, and wished everyone "happy holidays".</p>
<p>The last big update came earlier this month, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-addresses-primary-community-complaint-improves-hit-registrations-and-netcode-ahead-of-winter-offensive-update">Battlefield 6 received both netcode and hit registration improvements ahead of the Winter Offensive update</a>, which went live on the 9th December. It's part of the team's wider work to enhance both components of online play and is especially noteworthy, as issues with online netcode and hit registration have been sources of frustration for some players since launch.</p>
<p>This update came shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-was-cheater-free-in-roughly-98-of-games-after-launch">EA revealed that close to 98 percent of its games post-launch were cheater-free</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-flounders-battlefield-6-free-for-a-week">a week-long free-to-play offering that allowed folks to try the military FPS out without breaking the bank</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Friend slop’ made co-op gaming goofier than ever in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/845347/friend-slop-co-op-games-2025</link>
            <guid>1389040</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When a friend invited me to play a new game called <em>REPO</em> earlier this year, I thought I was wasting my money — not because the game looked bad, but because it looked like <em>Lethal Company</em>. The surprise-hit 2024 co-op survival horror game has players wander through unnerving ruined structures collecting trash while evading monsters. <em>Lethal Company</em> was popular with my friends (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24040561/lethal-company-roblox-popularity-explained/">and just about everyone else</a>), but its eerie liminal spaces spooked me too much. My friends swore <em>REPO</em> was different, though, that it was so funny it was hard to be scared, especially with its goofy robot avatars — and they were right.</p><p><em>REPO</em> has become one of my favorite games, and was one of the biggest co-op titles of 2025, along with similar indie co-op hit <em>Peak</em>. Over the past several months, the two titles have become the faces of a new niche of games with a somewhat controversial name: “friend slop.”</p><p>The term usually refers to indie co-op games that are best experienced with friends and have an emphasis on humor. They’re typically PC games, cost less than $20, include proximity voice chat, feature wacky game physics, and often fall into the survival horror genre. Friend slop isn’t always scary, though. Some lighthearted flavors of “slop” popped up this year, like <em>Peak</em>, where you attempt to scale increasingly perilous mountains with your friends.</p><p>That’s just the tip — or rather, peak — of the friend slop iceberg. There’s also <em>Guilty as Sock!</em>, where you and your co-op buddies roleplay court showdowns as sock puppets. <em>Lockdown Protocol</em> takes inspiration from <em>Among Us</em>, a precursor to the friend slop trend, where one player attempts to sabotage their friends as they complete chores on a timer in a lonely base. <em>Mage Arena</em> is one of the cheapest friend slop games to arrive this year at just $2.99. It’s also one of the most unique — you compete in magic duels with your friends by verbally shouting spells.</p><p>Friend slop games tend to follow a similar formula: You and your friends need to accomplish something together, but the consequences for failure aren’t particularly intense (and it’s often funnier if you <em>don’t</em> succeed). <em>Peak</em> is a perfect example. I have yet to survive to the end of a run, and yet I keep playing. Winning <em>Peak</em> is great, but the most entertaining part is watching your friends miss a jump and fall off a mountain, eat poisonous food, or get chased down by the scoutmaster for running ahead.</p><p>In friend slop, the main objective is humor. Winning is secondary. If you’re hoping for a deep, nuanced plot, you’ll probably be disappointed. Friend slop games also tend to lose their charm when you’re playing solo. <em>REPO</em> just isn’t the same when there’s no one there to laugh every time you clumsily shatter a vase.</p><p>Therein lies one of the major criticisms of the genre and one of the reasons it’s been labeled “slop” to begin with. While <em>REPO</em> and <em>Peak</em> have been hugely popular this year, some say they’re just designed for viral, clippable moments and lack substance beyond that, partly because they’re not usually fun to play solo.</p><p>That could be a fair drawback depending on what you expect from these games. However, it misses the point of “friend slop” and overlooks a potential explanation for their popularity this year.</p><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> was also one of 2025’s biggest co-op games, and I’ve had a great time with it as well. However, it offers something completely different from <em>REPO</em> or <em>Peak</em> and feels drastically different to play, despite technically being under the same broad co-op umbrella. <em>Nightreign</em> requires concentration, skill, and strategy, whereas <em>REPO</em> mostly just requires you to keep an eye out for monsters while absentmindedly picking up junk. It’s also a much more affordable game than <em>Nightreign</em> and doesn’t hinge on any <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc">prior knowledge of other games</a>.</p><p>That difference highlights one of friend slop’s greatest strengths. For all their arguable faults, friend slop games are approachable. They ask little of you — both in terms of money and time. You don’t even need a particularly powerful PC. These games are a way for people to hang out with friends for little money and laugh with each other. To some, myself included, that’s worth just as much as a rich story or dramatic boss fights.</p><p>This year, we’ve seen the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive">prices of games soar</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">gaming PC hardware is becoming unaffordable</a> for many. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive">Almost everything about the hobby has become more expensive</a>. Friend slop games offer an oasis from that with low prices and low hardware requirements, staying accessible to a large swath of gamers, even more so because they’re typically easy to learn how to play. The very things that led some people to call these games “slop” are also part of what has made them so popular in 2025 in particular.</p><p>Paige Wilson, community manager at <em>Peak</em> publisher Aggro Crab, echoed that sentiment. “We actually think friend slop is a fire term,” they told <em>The Verge</em>. “Sure, it started with the intention of [having] a negative connotation, but I think we always saw the term as funny and actually pretty accurate. It’s used to describe a low-cost game that you and your friends can pick up whenever, have some fun, hang out, and expect a bit of jank. I think some people might not view it as this, but we do!”</p><p>In other words, friend slop isn’t so much about the game as it is about the people you play it with. If that’s “slop,” then I’ll gladly embrace the “friend slop” label, too.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/845347/friend-slop-co-op-games-2025]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another game worth checking out is this year’s&nbsp;<em>Marvel’s Deadpool VR</em>. This title puts your inside the head of everyone’s favorite merc with a mouth—shredding through enemies, guns a blazing—all while you get to enjoy the voiceover provided by none other than Neil Patrick Harris. This one is not part of the Meta Quest+ subscription package, but may still be worth dipping into as it’s the biggest VR release of 2025.</p>



<p data-start="2185" data-end="2651">The Meta Quest 3S is an impressive upgrade from its predecessor, the Meta Quest 2. It’s powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset, which delivers faster performance for smoother gameplay. The addition of outside sensors allows for full-color passthrough, letting you see the real world around you while using the headset. A new action button makes it easy to toggle between virtual reality and mixed reality.</p>
<p data-start="2653" data-end="2899" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6531/">With current discounts offering up to $50 off, now is the perfect time to grab the Meta Quest 3S</a>.

<hr>
<p>For some, football is something to play; for some, it’s something to watch; for others, it’s something to be scared of in the playground. But in 2001, in Ecuador, football meant just about everything to just about everyone. At least, that’s the story told by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">Despelote</a>, a game that conjures the magic of childhood and football fever and makes it captivatingly relatable.</p>
<p>The game opens with you playing video soccer on an old console. As it’s gradually revealed that you’re sitting in a family living room, your parents’ chatter creeping into your awareness, you are connected very intimately with the protagonist of the game — its designer — Julián, a kid in Ecuador in 2001.</p>
<p>That year, Ecuador clinched a game against Peru, starting a journey towards first-time World Cup qualification, and everyone’s there for it. Your family are watching football, school kids are playing football at break time, overheard grown-up conversations are about football, and it’s blaring on TVs in bars and shop windows. The sense of optimism brewing around this national event permeates every aspect of life and it’s impossible not to be swept up in it.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161215/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This historic moment fixes the story in place and time, creating a little bubble of childhood. The nostalgia is flavoured with small adventures, like skipping school to take in the glorious scenery of Ecuador, aggravating your teacher, and playing out too long in the rain.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, this is all delivered in a variety of ways. That opening moment of playing on the console gives you a top-down, black-and-white football game, controlled with an innovative two-stick arrangement. The game then moves into first person, your “real-world” playtime football-kicking coming to mirror the console game’s controls. From this perspective, you sit in class, check your watch, skip school, talk to your friends, and, yes, kick around a football.</p>
<p>Much of the time, you're just an observer, building the sense of being a kid and following whatever is set out for you by the adults in your life. You listen to lessons while you wait for the bell; you ride in the back seat and hear conversations happening in the front. Among the passive moments are a variety of first-person interactions, almost always involving or adjacent to football.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161209/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despelote doesn’t try to riff on a central mechanic. In place of that, it develops themes of memory and childhood through a range of gameplay approaches. This keeps the experience light while making the excitement about the football feel totally irresistible. However you look at it, however you interact with it, everything is football. From Julián Cordero’s perspective, everything orbits around football, but other key moments in Ecuador’s history play out, too, from dollarisation to the country’s first showing at the Venice Film Festival.</p>
<p>This gameplay-light approach does mean Despelote asks for a certain mindset. This isn’t a game driven by challenge, mastery, or meaningful choice, and there are long stretches where your role is simply to exist in the moment it presents. Progress is gentle, more like turning a page of a book than developing gameplay, and the designer is happier letting scenes wash over you than pushing you forward. If you’re willing to meet it on those terms, the restraint feels purposeful; if not, this gentle vignette may feel too far from a traditional game.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161210/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, the game could hardly be more distinctive. The art, by Sebastián Valbuena, sees figures drawn by hand in black outlines on white backgrounds making up the cast of the game. They sit on top of hazily dithered two-tone scenes. This effect layered on top of the 3D environment completely disguises the level of detail in the world, its lighting and textures – almost anything that might normally contribute to overall visual impressions.</p>
<p>The graphics are therefore, in a sense, flawless. The art direction is expressed to its full, love it or hate it. In motion, it comes to life in a way screenshots can’t convey, and once you're immersed, the world is living and breathing. This is helped by the voicing of all dialogue and the inclusion of real video of football matches, displayed through the same vibrant filter.</p>
<p>All the spoken language is Spanish, with English speech bubbles written out onscreen. This adds beautifully to the sense of place and authenticity; I was transported to Ecuador and my imagination ran with it. Meanwhile, active sound effects and incidental sounds lift the realism of the world. Music is relatively sparse and often diegetic, with key moments of wistful guitar – but this contributes to a matter-of-fact tone that doesn’t overegg the emotional heart of the story. And an emotional response is what the game is all about. Yes, football provides a pitch for it to play on, but this is a relatable story even to someone with no interest in the sport.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161213/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>A slightly dry tone also makes room for some light humour. With Despelote, Cordero doesn’t take himself too seriously. A lack of self-importance places the protagonist as just one thread in the tapestry, which again builds a sense of a moment in history. A remembered story is always one you can’t alter, so drifting through this autobiographical account makes total sense. That said, if you’re looking for greater agency or action, maybe this won’t quite be for you.</p>
<p>It’s to Cordero’s credit that they also knew when to stop. The game tells its story without padding, then ties it in a bow and bids farewell after just a couple of hours. It lands as a complete work and can’t be criticised for being short – but bear in mind that this is not some open-ended adventure.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With its distinctive presentation and light-touch mechanics, Despelote builds a mesmerising feeling of a community brought together by a fleeting football obsession. The historic moment of Ecuador’s journey towards World Cup qualification grounds the story in time and place, perfectly capturing the author’s salad days. Whether you play, watch, or avoid football, this is a beautifully-told story you can enjoy.</p></section>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-crashes-playstation-portal-pricing-in-a-sudden-clearance-push-making-remote-ps5-gaming-cheaper-overnight-2000654542</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PlayStation Portal Remote Players are great for streaming your favorite titles directly from your console over Wi-Fi, without relying on a bigger screen. These are great for gaming anywhere you want, from the comfort of your cozy bed to the lounge, or even away from home. On a regular day, you’d pay around $200 to snap one, but that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">Amazon is currently offering the PlayStation Portal Remote Player for just $179, after taking 10% off its usual price.</a> The offer applies to both white and black models, but there’s a catch. The discount is only available today, as it wraps up at midnight. If you’ve been thinking of picking one, now is the time to act. Just note that these are likely going to be shipped after Christmas. If you’re looking to gift it to a loved one, it’s important to keep this timeline in mind and plan accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Remote Access</h2>
<p>The remote player comes with a nice 8-inch LCD, Full HD screen that pushes vibrant, detailed visuals for all your favorite titles. This thing is capable of delivering smooth gameplay at up to 60fps with exceptional image clarity on its 1080p resolution screen for an immersive experience. These visuals are thoughtfully paired with the Tempest 3D AudioTech for better sound. Connecting a compatible audio device, either wirelessly via PlayStation Link or wired via the 3.5mm audio jack, gets you that realistic, room-filling audio that pulls you into action. Adaptive triggers and haptic feedback take the experience a bit further by creating sensations that actually make you feel like a part of the digital world.</p>
<p>Portal Remote Player requires broadband internet Wi-Fi to stream the compatible games installed on your PS5 console. Your Wi-Fi should have at least 5Mbps speeds to get started, but a high-speed connection of at least 15Mbps will give you a smooth gaming experience. Getting started couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is connect the console the a broadband internet connection, and turn it on in Rest Mode. Ensure Remote Play is enabled in Settings &gt; System &gt; Remote Play. Then, power your portal on, log into your PSN account, and choose the pairing option. You can also tap your console from the home screen to establish a connection.</p>



<p>Note that titles that require a VR headset or additional peripherals (except DualShock 4, DualSense, or DualSense Edge wireless controller) won’t work with the player. PS Plus Premium membership is supported, but only for the games that are installed on your console. The membership gets you instant access to hundreds of games from the Game Catalog and Classics Catalog. New titles are added every month, so you’ll never be out of worlds to explore.</p>
<p>Taking everything into consideration, those who have been looking to enjoy their favorite titles remotely can benefit from having <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">the PlayStation Portal Remote Player in their setup. It normally runs for $200, but you can now snap it up for $179.</a> Both white and black versions are discounted, so there are options to choose from. Remember, the offer ends at midnight, so you only have a few more hours left to save. Grab it as fast as you can to avoid last-minute rush and chaos.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/848449/nex-playground-review-nintendo-wii-microsoft-kinect-motion-tracking-camera</link>
            <guid>1388980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you told me last year the Nex Playground would outsell Microsoft’s Xbox, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/844380/nex-playground-outselling-the-xbox">even for two weeks</a>, I would have laughed my way out of the room.</p><p>It’s a three-inch cube of a game console that’s likely less powerful than your phone, one which uses a single camera to track your body. It only plays curated, <a href="https://www.kidsafeseal.com/aboutourseals.html">certified kid-safe</a> games. Though frequently compared to the Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect, the Nex Playground is worse than either at tracking motion.</p><p>Nor is it cheap: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playground-AI-Powered-Transforms-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0D2JGYX3F/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$250 upfront</a> <em>plus</em> $89-a-year or $49-a-quarter annual subscription to get more than a basic sampler. If you like a game, you can’t buy it separately. Many are little better than shovelware and most are graphically ugly; I haven’t tried a single game with the charm or polish of Nintendo or the best of Apple Arcade.</p><p>And yet, lying sick in bed with a 99-degree fever, my five-year-old begged me to let her play.</p><p>When we started a game of virtual bowling, even Grandpa wanted in. (Grandpa <em>never</em> wants in.)</p><p>“I want to try again!” said my nine-year-old, after she sent her low-rent airplane plummeting to its doom.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>This one wide-angle camera tracks up to four people.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>They didn’t care that the games were bad. They cared that they were dead simple to pick up and play, no controller and no experience necessary, on a big screen. They cared that the games made them dance and jump and swing their arms, and that their dad looked pretty funny doing the same.</p><p>I just wish the games didn’t make them cry, too.</p><p>Nearly 20 years ago, the Nintendo Wii put an infrared camera and an accelerometer in your hand to tell if you moved your arm fast, slow, closer or further, and track basic orientation. A few years later, Microsoft’s Kinect captured your whole body with no controller at all: it painted your room with a structured pattern of infrared light to estimate your skeletal position in 3D space.</p><p>The Playground is different: a single wide-angle camera up front and HDMI and USB-C power around back, nothing else to plug in. But it also doesn’t “see” 3D depth. It has to estimate your body pose from flat images.</p><div id=":R1j1djeab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>“Holding” my bowling ball with a six-joint skeletal pose.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The bowling game has fun Christmas unlockables like a gingerbread ball and toy nutcracker pins.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Sometimes, it’s impressive: by identifying just six joints — shoulders, elbows, hands — you can throw a bowling ball straight down the lane or veer it left and right. But with no real depth perception, it can easily get confused: my nine-year-old couldn’t sit on the couch while my five-year-old was bowling several feet ahead, because the Playground assumed all their limbs belonged to the same person. My youngest cried for several minutes when the eldest raised a hand and accidentally stole her turn.</p><p>Soon it was the eldest’s turn to cry, too, when the Playground lost her hand mid-swing and sent her ball careening into the gutter. She got mad when it happened again.</p><p>There are <em>so</em> many things that can confuse single-camera tracking, and Nex knows it. Warnings include: Don’t wear clothing with repeating patterns. Don’t wear long sleeves. Play in a well-lit room, but not <em>back</em>lit. “Avoid non-players in the camera view.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The USB-C power cable comes with a detachable magnetic camera privacy cover</em>.</figcaption></p></div><p>These all help a single camera tell people from their background — but parents know some are harder than they sound! Our kids get game time after their evening bath, which means PJs. Have you seen kids’ PJs? They have long sleeves and repeating patterns. Hearts. Stars. Smiley faces. Repeating cats and unicorns till the cows come home.</p><p>We had to roll up sleeves and rethink seating. Realistically, “Avoid non-players in the camera view” meant clearing the entire living room of anyone who wasn’t bowling, having them stand far off to the side, so that the camera didn’t suddenly snap to the wrong person mid-play. Sometimes we could sit on the couch with hands hidden behind blankets or laptops.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The bundled remote. Most games make you switch to it for navigating menus; rarely used for gameplay.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Even so, my kids frequently got too frustrated with the controls. “I can’t keep my hand steady! I just can’t keep it steady!” complained my five-year-old, trying to send her cute puppy for a spa treatment in Nex’s <em>Nintendogs</em>-like game. Many games don’t penalize kids for swinging their arms wildly, but some inexplicably require dragging a cursor to press virtual buttons.</p><p>It also feels like the Playground lags behind my movements, even plugged directly into a low-latency OLED TV with Game Mode turned on. In Nex’s kart racer game, I couldn’t turn the steering wheel as fast as I wanted in its fastest 150cc mode.</p><p>Again, the issues didn’t stop us from having fun, particularly when with games that don’t require precision. The kids had a blast <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/mirrorama">with <em>Mirrorama</em></a><em>,</em> which turns your TV into a giant mirror with magical camera filters that let kids shoot lightning bolts from their hands, stretch their face, blur like as speedy as Sonic the Hedgehog, dance with their own clone.</p><p><sup><em>Mirrorama, above, made my kids laugh the most. </em></sup></p><p>They enjoyed <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/copy-cat-deluxe"><em>Copy Cat</em></a>, where they just had to strike a zany cartoon pose and let AI judge who did it better. Meanwhile, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwBAO7kifFA"><em>Brick Buster</em></a> to be an excellent Breakout clone — you only need move your body left or right to move the paddle, which is forgivingly large, and thrilling multiball action makes it fun.</p><p>I can’t say we’d get our money’s worth, though, because so many games are simple and inanely repetitive, or — like <em>Connect 4</em> <em>Bounce</em>, where my kid and I gave up trying to get balls to even go in — frustrating from the get-go. Many sports games are either laughably easy or have a large learning curve because the camera can’t see depth, so it can’t detect how you’re hitting a ball. With tennis, for example, you can’t aim with your arm: it only controls the timing of your swing. You have to move the rest of your body to aim left or right.</p><p>One of Nex’s biggest marketing points is that it’s already attracted huge kid brands to the platform: Bluey, Peppa Pig, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Sesame Street, How to Train Your Dragon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But my kids weren’t necessarily sold.</p><p><sup><em>Bluey, is one of the better licensed experiences — but my Bluey-loving kids weren’t that into it.</em></sup></p><p>They seemed entranced at first with <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/unicorn-academy-friendship-adventures"><em>Unicorn Academy</em></a>, but quickly disappointed when they couldn’t ride the unicorn anywhere interesting. The TMNT game is a frustrating endless runner where you constantly have to hop into the air to clear obstacles, though I suppose it could help tire out my kids. And even though they love <em>Bluey</em>, my kids quickly asked me to quit its too-repetitive balloon-bouncing game.</p><p>There’s enough in the Playground’s library that I bet your kids will find <em>something</em> they enjoy. My eldest wants to go visit her puppy, and the other night at dinner, my youngest erupted into cheers of “Bowling!!! I love bowling!!!” when we said we might play it again. Despite countless tracking failures, they say that Nex’s <em>Flappy Bird</em> clone, where up to four people hop in the air to keep their dragons eating fruit instead of crashing into towers, is one of their favs.</p><p>I think the Playground is far too much money for not nearly enough game. But it goes to show fun isn’t all about quality of execution. Many classic arcade games are frustratingly unfair, even broken — but sometimes you just want another turn to beat the machine.</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/848449/nex-playground-review-nintendo-wii-microsoft-kinect-motion-tracking-camera]]></content:encoded>

Not just any ol' weekend either! No, it's the weekend before Christmas, which means it's time to start preparing your stomachs for an avalanche of food and chocolate.</p>
<p>This week in the world of Nintendo, it seems that there may be an alternative to those ruddy Game Key Cards after an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-has-a-game-key-card-alternative-in-the-works-with-smaller-switch-2-carts">announcement from ININ Games</a>.

<p>We also heard some rather grim news confirming that the US had its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-us-suffered-its-worst-november-since-1995-in-terms-of-hardware-sales">worst November since 1995</a> in terms of hardware sales, which may be partially attributed to just how darn expensive everything is these days.

<p>The Christmas spirit is well and truly underway at Casa Jim this weekend, so I’ll be bringing out the big guns with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a>. As has become something of a tradition in recent years, I’ll probably end up dusting off the Wii U GamePad and setting up a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/nintendo_land">Nintendo Land</a> to keep everyone happy — they just don’t make ‘em like this any more!</p>
<p>Sure, I technically still have a bunch of 2025 games that I’d like to finish before the year is up, but hey, that’s not very festive now is it?</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm checking out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</a> on the Switch 2 at the moment, so please keep an eye out for my review very soon!</p>
<p>Otherwise, since I've pretty much finalised my list for Game of the Year, I'm in no hurry to try and play games that I might have missed over the months. With that in mind, I'm going to go back to something familiar and comforting... Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> – how did you know?</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>My head has been up in the (virtual) clouds since the VGA announcement of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ace_combat_8_wings_of_theve">Ace Combat 8: The Wings of Theve</a> so I got back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a>, a game that is begging for a Switch 2 update. The final physical games arrived so there will also be some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mandragora_whispers_of_the_witch_tree">Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/old_school_rally">Old School Rally</a> thrown into the rotation along with <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> (on my way to <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/halo_3">Halo 3</a> now!).</p>
<p>Game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>. It is my goal to wrap it up before 2026. So far up to chapter 9 and loving every bit of it. It reminds me we are but two shy months away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Kiwami 3</a>! Happy holidays everyone!</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm playing... oh dear. The same games as last week. Aren't I boring. That's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">Outer Worlds 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, and <strong>Astro Prospector</strong>. They're good! And I don't have the brainpower for anything new in the run-up to Christmas!</p>
<p>I'm also playing through the festive content in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure">Hello Kitty Island Adventure</a>, but that's because I wrote a lot of it, so... does that count? Probably not. Also, does this count as self-promotion? Am I in trouble? Please don't give me a lump of coal. Or whatever the Nintendo Life version of that is.</p>
<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>My weekend should be pretty full this side of Christmas (we're having duck), but if I manage to find some time to squeeze in a game or two, I'll definitely be diving into Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition. I loved the original, but never delved into anything beyond the base game, so I'm keen to see what this new version can throw at me.</p>
<p>Felix and I are also planning to continue our time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/we_were_here_together">We Were Here Together</a> at some point as well, but that is... unlikely to happen over the immediate weekend.</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> is going to take Zach and I a <em>long</em> time to get through. We're maybe 35 hours through and the town building has only just opened up more. How long do we have left? No idea, and that's kind of exciting!</p>
<p>But for the holidays, I've picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a>. The latter I've been waiting to come to Switch for a while, and the former seems like perfect cosy Christmas gaming. However you celebrate, readers, make time for your loved ones and get some rest!</p>

                <p>While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kinects-revenge-nex-playground-outsells-xbox-hardware-in-the-us/1100-6537053/" data-ref-id="1100-6537053">a very strong showing</a> in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii "problem."</p><p>Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service.</p><p>"One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model," Lee told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-want-a-nex-playground-in-every" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem."</p><p>Lee was very complementary toward Nintendo in his follow-up remarks, but he added that the Wii's model of selling only a few games to certain members of its install base was "not sustainable."</p><p>"It's very important that we set ourselves up to serve our customer continuously with new innovations," added Lee. "That is how the whole system can sustain. But it started with Wii. We are standing on a giant’s shoulder."</p><p>Nex Playground reportedly accounted for 14% of all console sales on Black Friday, finishing ahead of the Xbox family of systems.</p>

<p>Now, as 2025 comes to a close, the return of Frosty Fest has been announced. This time the question is: "Who do you spend the holidays with?" Is it with your friends, family or solo?</p>
<p>This in-game event will kick off early next year on <strong>9th January 2026</strong> and runs until <strong>11th January 2026</strong>. Here's the official announcement:</p>

<p>In case you missed it, the free Switch 2 update for Splatoon 3 (which launched a week after the Switch 2 in June) includes a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-heres-how-splatoon-3-on-switch-2-improves-visuals-and-performance">bump in resolution and frame rate</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo also announced a new Splatoon spin-off known as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>. This game will be arriving exclusively on the Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You are an Avatar, floating in the void. By your power alone you can mold the earth beneath you, from scorching deserts to shifting seas. But there is another Avatar, a foe contesting the realm. Will you have the magic, wits, and minions to survive? That’s the question posed to you when you shuffle up your decks and play <a href="https://sorcerytcg.com/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em></a>, a Trading Card Game created by Erik's Curiosa.</p><p><em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> is a collectible TCG created in 2024 by Erik’s Curiosa, which aims to capture the old-school feel of classic trading card games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="28960c39-7173-4bd8-bcaf-074e72deed91" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Magic: The Gathering</a>.</p><p>From incredible, oil-painted artwork (of which all the artists retain the rights to their work!), to a “Kitchen Table TCG” design philosophy, the game aims to capture what it felt like to first crack packs of early-days TCG’s and jump into a strange and enchanting world.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-beginning-board-state.jpeg?itok=Ou5OURx8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-beginning-board-state.jpeg?itok=O45IfbRQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>The rules are designed to be simple, but there’s plenty of tactical strategy involved to encourage players to experiment with deck-building and different approaches to battle.</p><h2>How Do You Play Sorcery: Contested Realm?</h2><p>To play the game, each player will need an Avatar of their choosing, a deck of 30 Atlas Cards, and a deck of 50 Spellbook cards, as well as a play mat or gaming surface divided into a 4x5 grid.</p><p>There are four different elements (you guessed it: earth, wind, air, and fire) which each give different flavor to cards, and require different types of Site cards played on the field to power up.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-artwork-4.jpg?itok=5NIkZgzv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1600" height="1080">

  </picture><p>You’ll use your Avatar to play these Site cards onto the battlefield, cast spells, attack enemy Site cards with minions, and attempt to bring your opponent’s health down to 0 - which triggers a tense end-game as you move your forces in for the kill.</p><p>Wait… did I just say move?</p><h2>How Does It Feel To Play Sorcery: Contested Realm?</h2><p>One of the most exciting aspects of <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> is the way you battle on the board. You’ll actually move your minions and Avatar around the playing field (once you’ve placed cards down that serve as realms across the vast void), attacking, defending, and trying to close the gap on your opponent. This adds a thrilling mix of troop movement into your usual TCG game.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-board-closeup.jpeg?itok=a2uLWKI2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-board-closeup.jpeg?itok=lx1gy53R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>In a way, it almost feels like you’re playing a smaller, approachable version of a tabletop war-game in the middle of your classic TCG. This reliance on physical placement of cards on the board adds a truly unique feel to the game - with some Spells shooting out in a straight line. There are also ways to destroy your opponent's Site cards, or in other ways hinder your enemy's movement.</p><p>Attacking feels familiar to games like <em>Magic</em>, where your Minions deal damage equal to their strength to your opponent's Minions - but there's a unique mechanic here, too, where nearby allied Minions can swoop in to help defend. It all leads to much more movement around the board than you'd expect at first glance (most Minions and Avatars can only move one space per activation). It all feels familiar <em>and</em> refreshingly new at the same time. Just like the artwork on the cards.</p><h2>The Art of <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em></h2><p>As you've likely noticed from the imagery so far in this review, the artwork on display for <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> is unique, iconic, and captures a feeling I miss from modern TCG games: that hand-made feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not saying games like <em>Magic</em> and <em>Pokemon</em> can't have gorgeous card art - they more often than not <em>do</em> - but overall there's a slickness to the images that leaves them feeling less personal.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-artwork-1.jpg?itok=Bj6a2JbD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1600" height="1080">

  </picture><p>With <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> all of the artwork is, to quote their own site (where they proudly <a href="https://sorcerytcg.com/art" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">devote an entire page to speaking in depth about the art and artists</a>), "hand-painted using traditional mediums such as oil, acrylic, water color paintings, pen and pencil, or a mix of all the various media. This creates a very authentic and varied feel within the art, evoking the golden age of fantasy."</p><p>That's my favorite part of the Sorcery artwork, every card looks different. <em>That</em> feels like old-school TCG games to me, where there's no unified set of design imperatives all the artists have to adhere to. It feels free, wild, and evokes the varied magic being flung around the void in <em>Sorcery</em>.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-artwork-2.jpg?itok=wezgxUzC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1600" height="1080">

  </picture><h2>Learning The Game</h2><p>The game's core rules and concepts are very easy to pick up on <em>if</em> you're a veteran of trading card games already. You'll understand core mechanics like needing resources to play cards, tapping things to attack/gain effects, etc. If you're brand new to trading card games, you will need to do a bit of catch up - as <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> takes the foundations built over the last 30 years of gaming and adds on it with "troop movement" (for lack of a better term).</p><p>My <em>only</em> complaint with the game is also something I love about it - go figure! That's this "kitchen table" approach to gaming, meaning there are some elements that flavorful, but not clearly defined (especially in the starter set's quickstart rulebook). And while that leads to a little extra flipping back and forth through the core rules, I'd imagine it also opens the game up to more creative ideation in the future.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Where To Start With <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em></h2><p>As I just mentioned above, <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> currently has three sets out: the core set, Arthurian Legends, and the <em>just</em> released set: Gothic. If you want to get a good feel of the game, I highly recommend picking up one of their two Starter Sets - The Four Elements Starter Set comes from the core set, and features four mini-decks each attuned to one of the four elements.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a great way to get a taste of the game. The new The Prophets of Doom Starter Set was just released with the release of Gothic, and features four decks attuned to angels, demons, and other gleefully grim cards from the new set.</p><h2><em>Sorcery: Contested Realm - </em>Final Thoughts</h2><p>I've wanted to try <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> for a while now based just on hearing rumbling about it in the TCG community, and I'm so glad I did! <em>Sorcery</em> is one of the biggest surprises of the year for me, completely blowing away my expectations. The artwork on display is unlike anything else in the TCG world today, and the gameplay feels fluid, satisfying, and tactical.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're a fan of classic fantasy artwork and you're looking for a new game to try as your other faves get filled with outside IP's, chase ultra-shiny mega rares, and more bloat -- you should absolutely give <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> a spin! You won't be disappointed.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Friday, retro and arcade game publisher ININ Games surprisingly announced it’s been able to “recalculate production” on offering a physical version of <em>R-Type Dimensions III </em>for the Switch 2 because “Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2.” Physical games on the Switch 2 have been something of a contentious topic; full physical games are reportedly expensive for developers, while game-key cards don’t actually have the game on the cart.</p><p>But later in the day, ININ removed that line from its post and published <a href="https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2002062795857174721">a significant correction</a>: “There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities. Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo.” However, it will still be able to offer the physical Switch 2 version of <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em>, though by tacking on €10 to the retail price.</p><p>Nintendo didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Solid information about why more developers don’t offer games fully on-cartridge is hard to find, though it may come down to cost. In May, a Brazilian Nintendo journalist <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1921315639563608384?s=19">reported that</a>, based on leaks from Arc System Works, Nintendo only offered two types of physical games for developers: a 64GB cartridge and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">game-key card</a>. The YouTube channel Physical Paradise has <a href="https://youtu.be/x1wCUjEwklg?si=PhTU7qqhdB_t7nFT&amp;t=274">also reported that</a> the cost of a physical cartridge is “about” $16, “which is quite expensive.”</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad, replying to ININ Games’ initial announcement about the new cartridge sizes, <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/2002066817704194487">said on X that</a> “cost was always the primary factor between key cards vs full cart releases.”</p><div><div><p id="do-you-know-the-actual-cost-of-switch-2-cartridges"><h2>Do you know the actual cost of Switch 2 cartridges?</h2></p></div><p>If you do, please email me at jay.peters@theverge.com or message me on Signal @jaypeters.11.</p></div><p>It’s unclear exactly how much more affordable additional cartridge capacity sizes could be or why the company might offer them to developers now. New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen tells me it could be because of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/839353/pc-ram-shortage-pricing-spike-news">rising cost of memory</a>; his two cents is that this “is in anticipation of memory going up in cost soon, allowing Nintendo to charge a more reasonable price especially for third-party games.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/848462/nintendo-switch-2-smaller-cartridges-inin-games]]></content:encoded>
