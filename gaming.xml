            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> has submitted a lengthy defence in response to lawsuits filed last year in which the families of those killed in the 2022 Uvalde school shooting accused the publisher of "grooming" the 18-year-old perpetrator through Call of Dury.
</p>
<p>
19 children and two teachers were killed in the attack on Robb Elementary School in May 2022, while 17 others were injured. Families of those killed during the tragedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uvalde-school-shooting-victims-sue-activision-claiming-its-the-most-prolific-marketer-of-weapons-in-the-us">later filed lawsuits in Texas and California</a> against Activision (after it emerged the shooter had played Call of Duty), alongside Instagram owner Meta and gun manufacturer Daniel Defense.
</p>
<p>
"This three-headed monster," the lawsuit alleged, "knowingly exposed [the perpetrator] to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it." At the time of last May's filing, Activision called the shooting "horrendous and heartbreaking", but noted "millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts".
</p>
<p>
Now though, as reported by journalist Stephen Totilo in his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File newsletter</a>, Activision has formally submitted its initial defence, spanning nearly 150 pages of legal documentation filed last December. In a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813228593/Activision-s-direct-legal-reply-to-the-Uvalde-families-lawsuit-via-Game-File">six-page direct response to the California lawsuit</a>, the publisher has denied "each and every allegation contained in the Complaint", claiming, among other things, a lack of causation between Call of Duty and the shooting. Totilo notes the publisher has also asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis of California's anti-SLAPP laws, which are designed to prevent the abuse of the legal system against a defendant's free speech.
</p><p>
"Call of Duty tells complex stories that explore the real-world combat scenarios that soldiers face in modern warfare," Activision wrote in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813227428/Activision-s-defense-in-Call-of-Duty-Uvalde-lawsuit-via-Game-File">separate 35-page filing</a>. "There can be no doubt Call of Duty is expressive and fully protected by the First Amendment... By bringing a laundry list of causes of action against Activision premised on allegedly dangerous 'hyper-realistic content' in the Call of Duty video games played by the perpetrator who committed heinous acts of violence, the Complaint runs headfirst into this overriding constitutional principle."
</p>
<p>
Activision's submissions also include a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813230017/Declaration-of-Matthew-Thomas-Payne-in-Mata-et-al-vs-Meta-Activision-Microsoft-via-Game-File">35-page declaration from Notre Dame media studies professor Matthew Thomas Payne</a>, arguing the Call of Duty series "flows from the same military realism tradition that has been explored for decades in critically acclaimed war movies and television shows" - and is thus far from the "training camp for mass shooters" in which "teenage boys learn to kill with frightening skill and ease" described in the Uvalde families' lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
The publisher's defence is also supported by a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813229303/Call-of-Duty-s-chief-Patrick-Kelly-s-declaration-for-Mata-vs-Activision-via-Game-File">38-page submission from Call of Duty head of creative Patrick Kelly</a>, which goes into significant detail regarding the design and creation of the series. This is the same document that revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-cost-an-eye-popping-700m-to-make">Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War's eye-popping $700m budget</a>, and includes a wealth of information Activision's lawyers could potentially use to counter the various claims made in the Uvalde families' legal filing.
</p>
<p>
For instance, while the claimant's suit alleges the Uvalde shooter learned about the gun he used from the loading screen of 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Kelly highlights two key points. Firstly, he says the generic assault rifle depicted in the image had been deliberately anonymised to ensure it did not feature identifiers that could link it to any particular firearm manufacturer. Secondly, he notes that by the time the perpetrator played the game in November 2021, the loading screen had been changed and would likely not have been seen.
</p><p>
There's plenty more detail in Activision's submitted documentation, and Totilo has a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/activision-uvalde-call-of-duty-defense">considerably expanded breakdown of the publisher's arguments</a> in his paywalled newsletter. The Uvalde families have until late February to respond to Activision's filings, and the publisher can then reply in April. As Totilo notes, if the case goes to trial, it likely won't be for a long time.

A 10,000mAh (37Whr) power bank can charge a Nintendo Switch OLED from completely empty to full about 1.9 times while still managing a slim footprint. Provided you fully charge your Switch from the get-go, that nearly triples your total playtime. Both power banks also boast a 22.5W charging output over USB Type-C. The Nintendo Switch console accepts a maximum charging rate of 18W, which is the charging rate of the official Nintendo charger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a power bank this small, you don't need to worry about being stopped at airports. The 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit. Both power banks also also low-profile enough that no one will take notice in the first place.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-confirms-nerfs-and-buffs-coming-with-season-1-balance-changes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals Season 1 balance changes are nearly here, and NetEase Games has revealed details that promise tweaks for popular heroes like Captain America, Cloak &amp; Dagger, and Jeff the Land Shark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team detailed its reasoning for the buffs and nerfs that will soon be delivered with version 20250110 in <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250108/41548_1205103.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on its website</u></a>. Despite having launched only last month, NetEase says it’s happy with the “vibrant diversity of lineups” it has seen this far but still sees some room for improvement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hence, in the first half of Season 1, we are set to make balance adjustments to certain heroes, enabling a broader roster to partake in more intricate gameplay, ensuring a richer, more engaging, and diverse gaming experience for all,” the team explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the balance tweaks arriving in the first half of Marvel Rivals Season 1 include slight nerfs to a few of the more dominant heroes in the roster. Hulk’s Indestructible Guard gamma shield is going from 250 to 200 health, while Hela will be hit with a base health reduction that brings her from 275 to 250. Hawkeye is also getting a decrease to his medium-long range damage alongside a slight increase to his close combat resistance. Then there's Luna Snow, whose ultimate ability will now take longer to switch from damage to healing.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The list of heroes set to benefit from buffs, meanwhile, is quite long, with Cloak &amp; Dagger, Storm, Punisher, Moon Knight, and more due improvements in some form. Captain America is getting some of the more substantial balance adjustments, with NetEase aiming to enhance his survivability. Jeff’s Joyful Splash healing is also getting an increase from 140/s to 150/s, while the team has also moved to make his ultimate ability warning marker line up better with its actual radius.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-details-the-fantastic-four-new-maps-and-mode-coming-in-season-1">Marvel Rivals Season 1</a> launches this Friday, January 10.

It’s a list that will almost certainly change with Season 1 not only because of the balance adjustments but the introduction of four new heroes with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-four-confirmed-for-marvel-rivals-in-official-first-look-image">Fantastic Four</a>.

          <p>Just when you thought you had seen every possible <em>Doom</em> mod, two game developers <a href="https://bobatealee.itch.io/doom-the-gallery-experience">released a free browser game</a> that reimagines the first level of 1993's <em>Doom</em> as an art gallery, replacing demons with paintings and shotguns with wine glasses.</p>
<p><em>Doom: The Gallery Experience</em>, created by Filippo Meozzi and Liam Stone, transforms the iconic E1M1 level into a virtual museum space where players guide a glasses-wearing Doomguy through halls of fine art as classical music plays in the background. The game links each displayed artwork to its corresponding page on the Metropolitan Museum of Art's website.</p>
<p>"In this experience, you will be able to walk around and appreciate some fine art while sipping some wine and enjoying the complimentary hors d’oeuvres," write the developers on the game's itch.io page, "in the beautifully renovated and re-imagined E1M1 of id Software's <em>DOOM</em> (1993)."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/analysis-ubisoft-faces-its-most-challenging-year-in-its-history/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>2024 was nothing short of a disaster for Ubisoft. In fact, it’s safe to say that it’s had a rough few years. Ubisoft stock has fallen from its February 2021 high of €84.60 to a mere €12.53 at the time of writing. That’s a massive 85% reduction in stock price from its all-time high. To put things into perspective, if you invested $1000 into Ubisoft during its peak, you’d now only be left with $150.</p>



<p>So far, its current fiscal year hasn’t been great either and has seen poor financial results attributed to games missing internal expectations, increased development costs, game cancellations, and delays. The years of mismanagement, overspending, and generally just being out of touch with the gaming sphere have led Ubisoft to a crossroads. Unfortunately, it’ll ultimately be the developers that suffer the consequences, and with Ubisoft’s future seemingly hanging in the balance of just one AAA game, that being Assassin’s Creed Shadows, we might not have to wait long to see how things shake out.</p>



<h2 id="h-buy-out-talks">Buy Out Talks</h2>



<p>It’s been widely reported that Ubisoft is currently in talks with advisors about ways to stabilize the business, with the most recent reports suggesting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-buyout-talks-continue-as-stock-trading-temporarily-halted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tencent was set to buy out the company and take it private</a>. Those talks seem to have stopped, as a significant term in negotiations revolved around the Guillemot brothers’ insistence on retaining control, which is likely a term that Tencent probably wouldn’t want to agree to. After all, the Guillemot brothers essentially put Ubisoft in this predicament in the first place.</p>



<p>For now, the negotiation halt seems to be a strategy both sides are playing. Tencent will continue to snap up shares and raise its stake. At the same time, the Guillemot brothers will want to wait until late February to early March to reignite negotiations, as Ubisoft is set to release the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows on February 14</a>. An Assassin’s Creed Shadows failure gives Tencent more opportunities to increase its stake at a lower share value. Conversely, a successful launch gives the Guillemot brothers more negotiating power to head into further talks.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It seems that, at least by my own sources, the move could favor the Guillemot brothers more. By all accounts from various Ubisoft sources, pre-orders for the game were high before the game’s delay and are still looking strong, but expectedly still behind that of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (which was released on both past and current generation consoles at the time). Assassin’s Creed Shadows seems to be Ubisoft’s last major lifeline, and even if the game is a tremendous success, it doesn’t necessarily mean Ubisoft is out of the woods.</p>



<h2 id="h-mismanagement-hell">Mismanagement Hell</h2>



<p>Ubisoft and mismanagement go hand-in-hand; you can’t have one without the other. Over the past few years, I’ve reported on countless projects that have faced mismanagement issues, and it seems that it’ll never change at face value. For the most part, it comes down to upper management’s personal friendships and family, with one looking out for another at the expense of thousands of frustrated developers.</p>



<p>The most public projects that have struggled are the likes of Ubisoft’s self-proclaimed AAAA title Skull &amp; Bones and Beyond Good and Evil 2, with the latter still not having a public release date despite being announced 16 years ago. But beyond the more prominent titles, the mismanagement at the company has led to countless projects being canceled or in a confusing stage of development without any end in sight. One notable game, codenamed Project U, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-project-u-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returned to the drawing board after five years of development</a> and saw its budget balloon in size. One developer who worked on the project said they wouldn’t be surprised if it already exploded past the $100M mark.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a>, one of the most promising free-to-play shooters at Ubisoft, and to be honest, in the entire industry over the past decade, released half-baked thanks to the same fate of mismanagement and higher-ups only looking out for themselves. After the game’s initially impressive numbers, developers told me that the writing was on the wall for months and that it would eventually close due to the massive drop-off and lack of player spending. &nbsp;The game was losing several million dollars in development costs alone — and that’s without the initial development costs, servers, and more on top — a cost that Ubisoft couldn’t afford in its current state, nor see a future where it could become a profitable title due to its own doing.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the end, Ubisoft’s mismanagement presents a serious challenge for the company moving forward. Despite Ubisoft’s board launching an investigation into the company’s struggles (of which 5 members are from the Guillemot family, by the way), no one, at least to those I’ve talked to, believes it will lead to any change. Speaking with past and current Ubisoft employees at various levels in the company, it’s widely speculated that CEO Yves Guillemot would rather go down with the [Skull &amp; Bones] ship rather than give up his position with a similar sentiment reflected about the other Guillemot brothers. It’s a hurdle the company will somehow need to overcome wherever Assassin’s Creed Shadows lands, even if it’s a success.</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s latest annual internal survey, which allows employees to somewhat anonymously (I say this because departments and studios are not anonymous) give feedback to the company, shows that employee trust in the company is staggeringly low. While I do not have an exact number for the entire company, some studios had an overall company trust level as low as 15-20% (purposely being vague here).</p>



<h2 id="h-an-uncertain-future">An Uncertain Future</h2>



<p>It feels somewhat inevitable that at some point during 2025, Ubisoft will change in a big way. Going private seems the likely way forward, but that decision will undoubtedly affect thousands of developers.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Ubisoft could try and simply ride out the storm, especially if Assassin’s Creed Shadows hits the way they hope, but the company needs to streamline the number of projects it’s working on. It needs to earn players’ trust back, starting with Shadows; and it needs to continue building that trust again, first, by stopping the constant chasing of trends.</p>



<p>Ubisoft currently has some big hitters in development and set to release by the end of 2026, including Splinter Cell Remake, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry 7</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Hexe</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-recon-project-over-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost Recon Over</a>, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake, and a few other smaller projects under big IP names. The Division 3, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rayman-remake-team-prince-of-persia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rayman Remake</a>, another Assassin’s Creed Remake codenamed Stardust, another flagship Assassin’s Creed RPG, and Beyond Good and Evil 2 (which is now progressing well) are further out.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Yet, on the flip side, Ubisoft continues pumping money into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-project-u-gameplay-details-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project U</a>, Project Scout (another Battle Royale heavily inspired by Apex Legends), <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Maverick</a> (a Far Cry extraction-based shooter), NFT games, and several more titles that almost everyone with common sense will say is not going to provide a return on investment. To be clear, I’m not saying that Ubisoft needs to stop trying “new” ideas (the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-alterra-animal-crossing-inspired-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing-inspired ALTERRA in development at Ubisoft</a> looks phenomenal in my opinion), but some projects are so blatantly destined to fail, that it’s mind-boggling that the company continues to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year, that they don’t have, on projects in the hopes that they are the next Fortnite.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is undoubtedly at a crossroads. However it goes, change has to happen at the top for it to succeed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>The Golden Needle, how I loathe you. Credit: LocalThunk</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><em>Balatro</em> and I had come to an agreement. I was only allowed to interact with it under certain conditions. I was almost free of its grasp again when I hit the cruelest scenario of all: Golden Needle.&nbsp; I was trapped in a prison of my own creation until I found a way to win.</p><p>Some context: I had previously banished <em>Balatro</em> from my personal computer. If it’s on there, like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> before it,<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-nerve-of-balatro-for-being-this-good" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> work just doesn’t get done</a>. I knew instinctively that the mobile version was going to be far more insidious, and largely resisted its call until I had a six-hour Thanksgiving train ride to my parents I needed to kill. So I allowed it back into my system under the condition that I delete it immediately from my phone after the holiday was over.&nbsp;</p><p>This arrangement largely worked until I tried to reinstall the game for a Christmas train ride and found out that cloud saves were nonfunctional for a huge portion of users on iOS. This is a huge issue and you will see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1fq287j/careful_with_cloud_save/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tons of pissed off reddit threads on the topic</a>. All that progress I had previously was gone. Lucky, the developers were smart enough to include an option in the menu that lets you just unlock everything. The problem with that is that I am goal oriented when playing <em>Balatro</em>, and with nothing to unlock I decided to go after the 20 “challenges,” custom scenarios built into a special mode in the game.</p><p>Most of the challenges in <em>Balatro</em> are fun and fairly straightforward. The Rich Get Richer starts you off with $100 and vouchers that max out your interest, but limits your scorable chips to the amount of money you have. Medusa gives you a single, indestructible <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Marble_Joker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marble Joker</a>, which rapidly fills your deck with stone cards. Fragile gives you a deck of entirely glass cards and gives you <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Oops!_All_6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two jokers that double all probabilities</a>, which makes glass cards break every time. Each of these scenarios forces the player to work around the limitations of their deck and often upend how the game is played.&nbsp;</p><p>Challenges are fair for the most part until you get to the last three and the difficulty skyrockets tremendously. Cruelty forces you to operate at a disadvantage – small blinds and big blinds give no reward money. This sucks but is very reliably beatable. Jokerless forces the player to operate without jokers. This also sucks, but there are ways to get to the end without jokers – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1bx1jhf/comment/kyae510/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">building on four of a kind or straights, which scale more aggressively</a>. Of the three, Golden Needle is the cruelest.</p><p>Golden Needle<em> </em>starts you off with a <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Credit_Card" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit Card</a> joker and $10, allowing you to go -$20 in debt. Each used discard costs you $1. You have six discards a round, and can only play one hand each round. Welcome to hell.</p><figure><figcaption>These Jokers all become far more powerful in Golden Needle. Credit: Localthunk </figcaption></figure><p>What makes Golden Needle<em> </em>so frustrating is that it is the scenario most dependent on random chance. You get past the first round by aggressively cycling through one of the few hands that can beat it – usually a high end straight, flush or full house. What you pull in the first shop determines how you must proceed, if you can at all.</p><p>Golden Needle also subtly changes the way you play the game. Certain MVP jokers that would carry you through the game, jokers that get stronger each hand like <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Ride_the_Bus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ride The Bus</a> or <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Spare_Trousers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spare Trousers</a>, do not scale fast enough to account for the scenario. Conversely, other jokers that shine in a scenario with one hand and six discards become elevated in importance – jokers like <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acrobat </a>(which gives you a 3x multiplier on the final hand), <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Dusk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dusk</a> (retriggers the final hand), <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_Cream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ice Cream</a> (which gives you a massive chip bump but reduces every hand played) and <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Castle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Castle </a>(gains +3 chips every time a specific suit is discarded).&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Oh COME ON. Credit: Localthunk.</figcaption></figure><p>The constant financial drain of discarding means maintaining a functioning economy becomes twice as hard, and you are forced to take a risk to pull yourself out of debt, or function exclusively in the negative. On top of this, certain <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Blinds_and_Antes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boss blinds</a> like The Mouth or The Needle become irrelevant, while others like The Water will destroy you outright. This unique combination of pure chance and elevated strategy mean that you not only have to be lucky, you also have to be good. Every round played is on a knife’s edge. One move and you are done.</p><figure><figcaption>Here's what worked. Flushes. Credit: LocalThunk</figcaption></figure><p>That’s where I was for days: refusing to delete <em>Balatro</em> until I bested Golden Needle. Through a series of convoluted circumstances I engineered a prison of gaming that I could technically leave but refused to out of pride. I have gotten to the final round multiple times, only to come up short by inches. And this morning, as I was writing this, it finally happened. A combination of the <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Banner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banner</a>, <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acrobat</a> and <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Onyx_Agate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onyx Agate</a> while focusing on juicing flushes (which is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1bbh75a/how_to_win_chips_and_influence_mult_a_thorough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">normally a bad idea</a> but far more viable due to the number of discards in this specific scenario) carried me through to Ante 8. The joy I felt was sublime.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I'm finally free. Credit: LocalThunk</figcaption></figure><p>I love and hate you, Golden Needle,<em> </em>and now I have defeated you. Time to delete <em>Balatro</em> until my next train ride.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post"><h3>The Myth Of The Star Reporter</h3></a><p>Good journalism isn't created in a vacuum</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339206/agdq-2025-batman-forever-the-arcade-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>, the annual charity speedrunning marathon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24334425/how-to-watch-awesome-games-done-quick-agdq-2025">is in full swing</a>, already amassing over $500,000 for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. With three more days to go, there’s a great many runs of popular games coming up. But relying on the schedule or your own preferences to determine when to tune in is a surefire way to miss the best AGDQ has to offer.</p><p>Take today, for example. I’ve never played <em>Batman Forever: The Arcade Game</em>, but after watching the speedrun, I might have to. It’s a Batman-flavored beat-’em-up that bears precious little resemblance to the movie it’s based on. The runner, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lrock617">LRock617</a>, chose to play as Robin and within moments of starting the game, I was hooked. The graphics were reminiscent of the early <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games, appropriate since it was published by Acclaim Entertainment. But there was a surreality to them that — when combined with Robin’s overpowered abilities (like one that has him essentially go Super Saiyan), the runner’s charisma in explaining what’s happening, and the audience getting in on the fun with funny donation messages — gave the run an absurd goofiness that was a sorely needed shot in the arm at 9AM on a Wednesday morning. And if I hadn’t had the marathon on in the background, I would have missed it.</p><p>Games Done Quick’s schedule is set up to have the most popular games or gimmicky runs take place during the early evenings and weekends — the time when folks are most likely to tune in. But I’ve found some of my favorite runs are of games I’ve never heard of played well outside those primetime hours. I’ve developed a deep an abiding love of <em>Mr. Bones</em>, a Sega Saturn game I have never played, because I found it during <a href="https://kotaku.com/after-a-very-shitty-day-the-mr-bones-speedrun-helped-1846020990">a bout of January 6th-induced insomnia</a>. The <a href="https://youtu.be/NgQ6AKLsOwY?si=3QgLKu_rA81EL4l9"><em>Ratatouille</em> run from Summer Games Done Quick 2023</a>, one of that year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/summer-games-done-quick-2023-is-over-so-come-watch-ratatouille-cosplay">stand</a>-<a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/best-speedruns-sgdq-2023">out</a> runs, happened on a Tuesday at 11AM. </p><p>More than simply being entertained, keeping GDQ on all the time is a good way to find your next indie game. I didn’t know what<em> </em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fpizza-possum-switch%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorvTrs9fk-4p2sjbGWy50hNKRxjjWIIs2vgyJgyxUJLJLNp-6oE"><em>Pizza Possum</em></a> was, but after <a href="https://youtu.be/HPjJbwzn9k8?si=OooLH-EdTHGfzuG0">watching the speedrun</a>, it’s on my list of co-op games to try at home. There’s still plenty of AGDQ left to enjoy. There’s a <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em> run that’ll be played while the runner plays the piano and I cannot wait for the <em>Crazy Taxi</em> run that’ll be accompanied by a live band playing covers of the songs in the game. But I’m even more excited to find the next hidden gem of the marathon purely by chance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo isn’t officially at CES, but it might have stolen the show anyway: accessories-maker Genki brought a 3D-printed mockup of what it says is Nintendo’s Switch successor, and we got to hold it and take some high-resolution pictures. </p><p>Based on the mockup of what we’ll call the Switch 2, Nintendo’s next console appears to be wider than the original, with slightly larger Joy-Con controllers that seem like they’ll be more comfortable to hold. Compared to a Steam Deck OLED, the Switch 2 mockup still feels noticeably smaller, in part because the Joy-Cons are not as pronounced and ergonomic as the Deck’s grips. But the mockup still feels closer in size to Valve’s handheld than the original Switch.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><p><figcaption><em>A rough size comparison with a Steam Deck OLED.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>As previous rumors have indicated, the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons will attach to the console via magnets instead of a sliding rail, Genki cofounder and CEO Eddie Tsai tells <em>The Verge</em>. To detach a Joy-Con from the Switch 2, you press a big button at the top of the backside of each controller, Tsai says, and that button apparently pushes out a pin that nudges against the chassis of the console, disconnecting the magnets.</p><p>You can remove the Joy-Cons with brute force if you really wanted to, according to Tsai, but he says, overall, they feel secure for regular use and that the big release button detaches the Joy-Cons with ease. Tsai declined to share where he’d learned details of the new console.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->8</p><p><figcaption><em>The left JoyCon without pressing the detachment button.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Tsai also tells <em>The Verge</em> that housed within the mounting channel of the Joy-Cons is an optical sensor, and by using another attachment the new Joy-Cons may offer mouse-like functionality. It sounds a bit like what Lenovo does <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">with its Legion Go handheld</a>.</p><p>Nintendo has promised that it will announce the Switch’s successor <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">before April 2025</a>, and as that deadline creeps closer, there have been waves of leaks and rumors about the new hardware. In December, YouTube channel SwitchUp posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nacn4yqUY1s">a video</a> showing a 3D-printed, non-functional Switch 2 mockup provided by a Chinese case manufacturer. That mockup basically looked like the current Switch but bigger, and it revealed a few other potential changes like a new USB-C port on the top of the device and a mysterious new square button under the Home button on the right Joy-Con.</p><p>Days later, accessories-maker Dbrand announced its “Killswitch 2” case, and CEO Adam Ijaz <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">told <em>The Verge</em></a> that it was designed based on “actual dimensions”&nbsp;based on a “3D scan of the real hardware.” Ijaz also said that it was his “understanding” that the console’s Joy-Cons are magnetically attached. And Dbrand’s imagery showed that the new square button had a “C” printed on it, though Ijaz didn’t know what it was. Days after that, our colleague Sean Hollister spoke with a Redditor who shared apparent photos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">of the Switch 2’s dock</a> and the&nbsp;inside&nbsp;of what appears to be a Switch 2 Joy-Con.</p><p>With that April 2025 deadline inching closer every day, it seems like it won’t be long until Nintendo officially, finally reveals the Switch 2. But until that happens, at least we have these pictures to look at.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Among those laid off were, reportedly, most of The Post’s <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-crisis-hit-washington-post-axes-dozens-in-cash-crunch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PR team</a>; a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxtani.bsky.social/post/3lf6gudz25k2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo</a> about a new PR strategy reads in part,</p><blockquote><p>Talent-driven journalism is the future of media, and personalities and creators will lead the way...</p><p>Effective immediately, we are repositioning the entire Post PR division to build and launch our Star Talent Unit. We will stop the dedicated practice of publicity for our journalism across broadcast and traditional media outlets…</p><p>The core focus of our team will be to ensure our audiences know who our journalists are and rely even more on these trusted voices... We will also be working closely with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2024/12/20/introducing-wp-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WP Ventures</a>, expanding our talent roster to include creators.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wagatwe.com/post/3lf6njrkztc2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stevemullis.bsky.social/post/3lf6jir2df22a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alone</a> in being <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lf6hgee5tk2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrified</a> by the phrase “Star Talent Unit.” While it’s not clear yet precisely what this new approach will look like, the name and the mention of "creators and personalities," alongside the intention to hire more, suggest The Post could lean in on promoting whoever it considers its biggest personalities instead of the paper’s work more holistically. On its face, such a move would make a kind of sense; I think most journalists would admit influencers and content creators are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/04/nx-s1-5246011/influencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nibbling our lunch</a> when it comes to engagement and subscriber money, especially among <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/media/news-influencers-social-media-conservative-study/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">younger audiences</a>. And I think we’d all admit that borrowing some of these personalities’ promotion strategies is an <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/2/1/24056883/tiktok-self-promotion-artist-career-how-to-build-following" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unfortunate necessity</a> these days, especially on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of the “star reporter” is a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031975/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long</a>-<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051036/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standing</a> <a href="https://bojackhorseman.fandom.com/wiki/Paige_Sinclair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image</a> that’s been present in every newsroom I’ve worked at or known people who work at: your biggest names who do the site’s most high-profile work, and as such are afforded the autonomy, time, and pay (maybe– we’re still talking about journalism here) to do so. They do the kinds of stories that go wide, that audiences talk about, that can effect change in your beats. They become the people your site is known for and come to feel <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/abeewords.bsky.social/post/3lf6hopqtcs23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">essential</a> to, the people readers take to the comments section to declare a site “over” if they leave. Sometimes, especially these days, these folks strike out on their own, realizing they can use the name they’ve built in a newsroom to get paid by readers directly. Other times, an organization will bend over backwards to keep them, which may or may not go well for them and the people they work with.</p><p>I’m not going to pretend star power isn’t real: there are writers out there with unique strengths and compelling personalities and savvy self-promotion skills. When you’re an editor or team leader, as I’ve been, you don’t serve those writers, your outlet, or your audience by clipping their wings, but you have to balance that against the needs and strengths of everyone on your team, including those whose talents or interests lie in less flashy areas. I always wanted as best I could to give each of my writers the assignments they wanted and the things they’d excel at, to put them on the work that would be the best for both them and the outlet. This isn’t always possible: there are only so many of the biggest games of the year to review or events to cover; if everyone is heads-down in long-term reporting or ambitious criticism, no stories are going up while that work gets done; sometimes, there is just workaday news to write or videos to make or admin work to do, to keep your site functioning or to keep the suits above you happy about your page views or, simply, to serve your audience and keep them informed.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, you want to give everyone on your staff the time and opportunity to shine at what they shine at, and to acknowledge and promote that work accordingly, but I’m not sure–and I’ll regretfully include myself in this–I’ve ever seen that fully work out. Just as much as “star” reporters can elevate an outlet, they can wreak havoc inside it too. Resentments flourish; even in the most well-managed scenarios, it’s natural to be jealous of someone who you think gets more freedom and attention than you do. People can behave badly, leading to mercurial “stars” and mistreated or bitter colleagues. A “star” can, intentionally or not, claim a beat or style of work and crowd others out of it. Colleagues can feel like they have to, or be made to, pick up the slack while someone does long-term work without ever getting their own shot at it. A site can go from being a team of journalists to feeling like a “star” or two and their support staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When the big stories from the big names go up, they can seem to an audience like the work of whoever is on the byline, when in reality <em>everything</em> that goes on the page is the product, to some extent, of everyone who works at an outlet. Great journalism doesn’t happen in a vacuum; colleagues talk a story over, point a reporter to sources, lend their expertise, give feedback, edit, suggest a headline, provide art. They write the day-to-day stories readers need, and those stories help keep the lights on and make the money that pays for the more ambitious work. The “star reporter” builds on the work and reputation of an outlet to do their work, from the kinds of stories they pursue to the sources who’ll be willing to talk to them. A good newsroom and its leaders acknowledge this, internally and externally, when a big story goes live. A handful of people’s names might be on the page, but that story is the work of everyone who works on that team, and everyone had some hand in its impact and success. A good leader, and a good organization, doesn’t leave those teammates behind or use them to build up other people’s names.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m saying this all from my perch at a version of the situation I’m warning against, an independent outlet built, at least in part, on name recognition and thus some version of star power. It’s likely you were willing to pay for Aftermath because you heard of the people who work here; you heard of us because an outlet and its team supported us in learning to make the work you’re paying for. You could see Aftermath and our worker-owned outlet peers as a success story of the very thing The Post could pursue, some kind of triumph of personal branding alongside the democratizing power of the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>But you could also read it, more pessimistically but maybe more honestly, as a damning example of what it takes to still make journalism these days. Things weren’t going <em>so well </em>that the five of us and our colleagues at other outlets all decided there was a way to make them go even better; our organizations failed us, or didn’t want us anymore, and we went independent because it was that or leave the field. I’m aware, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ld267tue7s2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every day</a>, that everyone can’t do that, that there’s a view of our sites that sees us building our own little islands and leaving others behind. I fully believe independent organizations like Aftermath and our peers are paving the way for democratic workplaces that live our values and prioritize our audiences. But we aren’t, or aren’t yet, a working alternative to the system crumbling around us, one that creates a reliable future for journalists and journalism as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to undertake all the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3le3qy5qyp22u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burnout-inducing</a> self-promotion and name recognition and cultivation of reader relationships as a survival mechanism as much as a unique strength of our space. The Post’s PR pivot has the potential to embrace the worst of that, to cut even more people out of having a satisfying, stable future in journalism by combining the harshest requirements of independent spheres with established journalism’s own worst habits of competition and “star power” myths. A focus on “star talent” wouldn’t serve those supposed “stars”--as we’ve <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/g-s1-27366/taylor-lorenz-leaves-washington-post-after-rift-with-editors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already seen</a>, why would someone submit themselves to the strictures of an organization when even the organization is telling them their personal value will get them farther? And it wouldn’t serve the people who don’t get to be the “star talent,” who might feel their work is devalued or that they’re playing second fiddle to whoever the paper decides is worth promoting. And why would <em>anyone</em> in this situation put their efforts into The Post, or any outlet, as a whole, if that outlet's PR strategy promotes the opposite?</p><p>There’s no denying things both in established journalism and outside of it are bleak. It’s naive to be dedicated to an outlet that could fold or cut you at any moment, and it’s exhausting to add self-promotion to any writer’s already endless to-do list. One of the most well-resourced news organizations in the world should be looking for alternatives to how things currently stand, not just creating another version.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat"><h3>Balatro’s Golden Needle Became A Prison</h3></a><p>Balatro's Golden Needle challenge, which requires both luck and skill, trapped me in a gameplay torment of my own creation.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You probably won’t be too surprised to see Jeff leading the pack as the number-one pick across PC and console quickplay games. He’s sitting at 21.18% pick rate, with Venom in second at 19.09% and Cloak &amp; Dagger in third at 18.81%. At the opposite end of the list, we find Storm, with only 1.66% of players choosing to smite opponents with her weather abilities in quickplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pick rates for competitive, meanwhile, tell a slightly different story. Pop-centric healer and Strategist Luna Snow tops the pick rate list at 20.66%, with Jeff still cracking the top 10 in seventh with 13.86%. The tough-to-handle Storm remains at the bottom in competitive games at just 0.69% on PC, while Black Widow sits in last with 0.79% in competitive console matches. It also seems that the Strategist and Vanguard roles remain equally popular among players regardless of mode or platform.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Concrete numbers for Marvel Rivals show NetEase is willing to be a bit more transparent about how fans are choosing to engage with the roster, but many will likely find little surprise in the pick rate list. Jeff, specifically, has proven to be quite the punching bag for the community since launch arrived last month. This adorable dog shark has terrorized enemy teams with his It’s Jeff! Ultimate ability, which sees him swallowing multiple enemies and, usually, sending them hurtling to their deaths. He’s relatively easy to get a handle on, so it’s never been a surprise to see him show up in a match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Win rates, on the other hand, reveal that Marvel Rivals has been a mostly even experience regardless of which hero players dive into battle with. While nearly every character hovers around a 50% win rate regardless of game mode, Jeff actually finds himself on the lower end of the spectrum at 45.39% of matches won in quickplay and 44.38% in competitive. It’s actually Mantis who brings home the most consistent victories, with 56% of games won in quickplay and 55.20% won in competitive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of these stats may give players clues as to how NetEase will push forward when it comes to future balance changes. That said, those pick rates will certainly change once <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-details-the-fantastic-four-new-maps-and-mode-coming-in-season-1"><u>Season 1</u></a> introduces new maps, modes, and characters, such as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-four-confirmed-for-marvel-rivals-in-official-first-look-image"><u>Fantastic Four</u></a>, starting this Friday, January 10.

In this post, we're rounding up everything we know about the Switch 2--or whatever the next console is called--and what's been speculated about the next system from Nintendo. There has been quite a lot of news about the next Nintendo console lately. In fact, it appears the rumor mill is really heating up of late, though this doesn't necessarily mean an official announcement is coming up soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has made multiple announcements lately, including an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-alarmo-alarm-clock-only-works-with-switch-2-in-our-dreams/1100-6527034/" data-ref-id="1100-6527034">alarm clock</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-music-app-provides-the-soundtrack-for-the-wait-for-switch-2/1100-6527499/" data-ref-id="1100-6527499">a music app</a>, but there hasn't been any <em>official</em> word on the Switch 2. </p><p dir="ltr">2025 kicked off with a juicy rumor, as people claim to have their hands on the Switch 2's Joy-Cons. Images posted online claiming to be the new controllers suggest they will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-images-apparently-emerge-could-tease-unexpected-feature/1100-6528637/" data-ref-id="1100-6528637">sport a similar design to the original, though they could be hiding a new feature or two.</a> Another recent report detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-units-the-switch-2-could-sell-in-2025-in-the-us/1100-6528704/" data-ref-id="1100-6528704">how many units the Switch 2 could sell in the US during its first year.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Another recent report that claimed the next Nintendo console is indeed called, simply, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-is-indeed-called-switch-2-report/1100-6528573/" data-ref-id="1100-6528573">Switch 2. </a>One Chinese retailer is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alleged-switch-2-accessories-are-now-available-to-buy-with-a-major-asterisk/1100-6528194/" data-ref-id="1100-6528194">selling screen protectors and carrying cases for the Switch 2</a>, and these could contain clues about the form factor and size of the Switch 2.

The images suggest that the Switch will sport a bigger eight-inch screen, Joy-Cons that use a magnetic attachment, and significantly improved hardware in comparison to the current model.</p><p>The pictures were first found on a Chinese social media site and uploaded to Reddit.

Several times in the briefing, Furukawa spoke about the "successor to the Nintendo Switch," suggesting that the new device will build on the foundation established by the Switch console.</p><p>"At this stage, we cannot say anything more about the successor to Nintendo Switch," Furukawa said when asked why that term was used specifically.

They're always part of a portfolio mix of platform mix. Just wait."</p><p>Recently, analyst David Gibson suggested the Switch 2 may release in March 2025.

Nintendo, for its part, has said nothing at all about what to expect from its next system, apart from how the aim is for it to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-nintendo-has-nothing-to-announce-but-says-next-console-aims-to-surprise-and-delight/1100-6512297/">"surprise and delight"</a> fans, so we only have predictions and guesses to go on for now.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-nintendo-switch-2-details-continue-to-emerge/1100-6518945/">Digital Foundry reported</a> that the Switch 2 may use Nvidia's new custom variant T239 processor. The site compiled a PC based on what it believed the Switch 2's specs could be and found that it could capably run Death Stranding at 1080p at an average of 35 fps.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo consoles are historically less powerful than the latest PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and many believe that might be the case for the next system as well. But no one knows for sure. Whether or not the Switch 2 could be a 4K-capable device or offer cutting-edge graphics and performance is unknown.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350770848/exclusiva-switch-2-conocemos-en-primicia-nuevos-detalles-de-la-proxima-consola-de-nintendo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vandal </a>(<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-reportedly-has-magnetic-joy-cons-might-not-support-existing-ones/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>) recently reported that the Switch 2 will use Joy-Con controllers once again, but this time, they will attach to the system magnetically. Whether or not the existing Joy-Cons you might own already will work on the system is unknown. The report also mentioned how the current Switch Pro controller will be compatible with the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tah4ALPgOk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broken Silicon podcast </a>recently (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode-battery-life-rumor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via IGN</a>), Moore's Law Is Dead and The Phawx had a conversation in which it was suggested by Moore's Law is Dead that the Switch 2 will be "clocked faster than we expect" in its docked mode. In undocked mode, it's "going to be clocked crazy low," apparently. The goal, apparently, is to help the Switch 2 have a longer battery life when played on the go compared to the original Switch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4245023-screenshot2024-01-11at1.47.56pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4245023" data-ratio="0.54519774011299" data-width="2124" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4245023-screenshot2024-01-11at1.47.56pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4245023"></a><figcaption>The next Nintendo console could launch in 2024</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4245023-screenshot2024-01-11at1.47.56pm.png"></figure><p>While Switch sales boomed during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage presented new challenges for Nintendo as it struggled to meet demand. For the Switch 2, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-shouldnt-be-impacted-by-any-chip-shortages-nintendo-says/1100-6523347/" data-ref-id="1100-6523347">doesn't "anticipate" this to be a problem ahead of the launch of the Switch 2</a>. At the same time, Nintendo's sales forecast for the financial year doesn't currently factor in Switch 2 sales, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-window-still-uncertain-despite-nintendos-earnings-news-analyst-says/1100-6523313/" data-ref-id="1100-6523313">but that could change in time</a>.</p><h2 id="Gen_AI_">Gen AI?</h2><p>Artificial intelligence, or more specifically, generative artificial intelligence continues to be a major talking point in the world of video games--and technology in general. But will Nintendo implement genAI for the Switch 2 and its games? It remains to be seen, but Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently weighed in to say Nintendo will carefully consider the use of genAI.</p><p>During a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A with investors</a>, as translated by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/99109/nintendo-wont-use-generative-ai-in-its-first-party-games/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TweakTown</a>, Furukawa is reported to have said AI has been used in video game development for ages already for things like controlling enemy characters. But genAI is a different story.</p><p>"Generative AI, which has been a hot topic in recent years, can be more creative, but we also recognize that it has issues with intellectual property rights," he said. "We have decades of know-how in creating optimal gaming experiences for our customers, and while we remain flexible in responding to technological developments, we hope to continue to deliver value that is unique to us and cannot be achieved through technology alone."</p><h2 id="Switch_2_Games_and_Backward_Compatibility">Switch 2 Games and Backward Compatibility</h2><p>It's widely expected that Nintendo will release a new Mario Kart game for its next home console–there are not many safer bets in gaming that one could make. A report said Mario Kart 9 will have some kind of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-should-use-these-new-twist-ideas/1100-6499581/">"new twist,"</a> and fans are eagerly waiting to see what that might be. If a new Mario Kart game is in the works, it would seemingly make business sense for it to be a launch title for the next console. A report from 2023 said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-already-with-developers-launching-in-2024-report/1100-6516402/">a number of developers already had the new Nintendo console at their offices</a> and were beginning to build games for it, but none have been announced or even hinted at thus far.</p><p dir="ltr">A major question fans want to know is whether or not the next Nintendo console will support games from the Switch, and on November 6, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">confirmed backwards compatibility for the Switch 2</a>. Not only that, but Nintendo Switch Online will work across Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">"At today’s Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch," Nintendo confirmed. "Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date."</p><p dir="ltr">Keep checking back with GameSpot for more as we learn more about the next Nintendo console, as we'll continue to update this story as more information comes to light.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Switch_2_Price">Switch 2 Price</h2><p dir="ltr">The Switch 2 has not been announced, so everything is guesswork at this stage. But one analyst recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nintendo-employees-predict-when-they-think-switch-2-will-be-announced-and-what-it-will-be/1100-6520125/">predicted</a> that the Switch 2 will cost $400 and that its top-tier games will sell for $70. The original Switch launched at $300, and its relatively low price point no doubt helped the system perform exceptionally well in the market. Whether or not the next Nintendo console launches with just one SKU or multiple editions, at various price points, remains to be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of the prediction about game costs rising to $70, that wouldn't be very surprising. After all, Nintendo already charged $70 for Tears of the Kingdom, and it was a sales juggernaut at that price point. Nintendo said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-will-be-worth-its-70-price-tag-nintendo-president-says/1100-6512284/">that was a one-off for Switch game prices</a>, but charging $70 for Switch 2 games would bring Nintendo in line with what companies like Microsoft and Sony, as well as a variety of third-party publishers, charge for their leading titles.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Switch_2_News">Switch 2 News</h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's previous consoles had their own account systems and players had to create new accounts for subsequent hardware launches. But the new overarching Nintendo Account changes this, and this could help <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-boss-says-transition-from-switch-to-next-console-will-be-smoother-than-before/1100-6518543/">ease the transition to the next Nintendo console. </a></p><p dir="ltr">It "allows us to communicate with our players if and when we make a transition to a new platform, to help ease that process or transition," Nintendo's Doug Bowser said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal is to minimize the dip you typically see in the last year of one cycle and the beginning of another," he added. "I can't speak to the possible features of a new platform, but the Nintendo Account is a strong basis for having that communication as we make the transition."</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's CEO, Shuntaro Furukawa, said in 2023 that the next Nintendo console will use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-will-keep-the-same-account-system-on-next-console-for-ease-of-use-apparently/1100-6515509/">the same Nintendo Account system as the Switch</a>, so hearing Bowser suggest something similar is no big surprise.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/nintendo-s-record-gain-tested-in-wait-for-switch-2-tech-watch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Yijia Zhai of Macquarie Group Ltd. said the next Nintendo console is not going to be able to match the success of the Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">"We do not think the new console will be as successful as the Switch, and see potential profit-taking after the announcement," Zhai said, further noting that Macquarie had downgraded Nintendo's stock analysis to "neutral."</p><p dir="ltr">Goldman Sachs analyst Minami Munakata, meanwhile, said the next Nintendo hardware likely won't increase the total addressable market for Nintendo. However, the firm isn't married to that idea and says its forecast could change if the system "turns out to be new concept hardware rather than a successor along the same lines as the Nintendo Switch."</p><p dir="ltr">A console not being as successful as the last one might not tell the whole story and isn't necessarily totally bad news for Nintendo. The Switch, of course, performed exceptionally well in terms of hardware and software sales. And that success is all the more apparent following the dismal performance of the Wii U.</p><p>In September 2024, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella said the next Nintendo console may "disrupt" the video game industry.</p><p>"A couple of things will really impact how things go: Nintendo's next hardware device, expected to arrive next year, could significantly disrupt the market," <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cheap-money-and-bad-bets-how-the-games-industry-turned-pandemic-success-into-disaster" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he told GI.biz</a>. "Of course, not much is known about this device beyond rumor, but a highly successful new Nintendo device could apply downward pricing pressure across other devices. But we'll have to wait and see."</p>

			<p>Studio Atelico is a brand new gaming startup that has been founded by veterans of Uber, Meta, and Creative Assembly. Today they announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/startup-exists-announces-new-genai-gaming-platform/">new AI Engine</a> that will enable game developers to create game experiences that are powered by GenAI that run on-device without having to pay extortionate prices for cloud solutions. With Atelico AI Engine, the costs of production are significantly reduced for developers, and it provides them with an experience that gives them full control and power.</p>
<p>CEO, Piero Molino made a statement today regarding their new AI engine, saying: "The revolution is upon us. GenAI is enabling new interactive experiences that have never been possible before. However, the current, large-model approach that Cloud AI providers are taking is fundamentally flawed for video games. Game developers currently implementing GenAI in their games are struggling due to the high costs and the lack of fine-grained control needed in video game development."</p>
<p><iframe title="Studio Atelico - Generative Agents Real-time Playground (GARP)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/krOP_bIW74g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, Generative AI in gaming is a heavy point of contention for both the consumer and the creator. There are people who feel that it should be left safely in the hands of humans to develop, while others feel that there are creative minds out there who should be able to use tools to make the development process easier without having to put the effort in.</p>
<p>Already there are many games on the market using AI, with a fair few of them not disclosing the fact that they are using AI in their titles. An<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-steam-labs-dev-claims-1-000-steam-games-use-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ex-Steam Labs developer</a> has claimed that there are over 1000 Steam games that are using generative AI. This includes titles such as The Finals, Tribes 3, and Atman: Rebel Flame.</p>
<p>While most known studios won't be using AI for their games, more and more studios and developers are coming out of the woodwork with AI games. With the release of the Atelico AI Engine, there will now be even more potential for AI titles.</p>
<p>The Atelico AI Engine can be embedded into game engines, where the user will have full control and flexibility with the modular design of the tool. To showcase the tool, Studio Atelico has released a tech demo which is inspired by the Stanford paper "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior." You can see the tech demo above, where you can see the model in action.</p>
<p>"Atelico AI Engine is the perfect tool for developers to invent entirely new game genres. We foresee a Cambrian explosion of creativity, where our AI tools empower designers to build more immersive experiences and truly widen the horizon of what's possible. The only limitation is the developer's imagination," says <a href="https://atelico.studio/blog/cloud-ai-for-video-games-is-dead-on-arrival?dm_i=2AEH,21IEL,AMZC5B,7EFIS,1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ennio De Nucci, Co-Founder and Design</a> Director of Studio Atelico.</p>

Son of Oak's successfully crowdfunded fantasy RPG made a splash on Kickstarter. The game, which uses the same underlying system as the urban fantasy TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/off-shelf-city-of-mist-rpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>City of Mist</em></a>, made more than sixteen times its funding goal, concluding with over $855,000 raised.</p>

<p>This is an impressive accomplishment in popularity given the game's competition. <em>Legend in the Mist</em> beat out Darrington Press' highly anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-darrington-press-hotly-anticipated-ttrpg-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>, Modiphius' adaptation of an acclaimed British author Terry Pratchett's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/discworld-board-games-coming-courtesy-of-modiphius-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Discworld: Adventures in Ankh-Morpork</em></a>, and fantasy novelist Brandon Sanderson's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the other entries in the Most Anticipated TTRPG have established quality names. MCDM Productions' <em>Draw Steel</em>, their <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/mcdm-productions/mcdm-rpg" rel="nofollow">successfully crowdfunded</a> response to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tabletop-developers-prepare-for-ogl-less-future" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D OGL</a> debacle. Free League Publishing's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/coriolis-great-dark-fully-funded-in-7-minutes-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Coriolis: The Great Dark</em></a> and <em>Alien: Evolved Edition</em>. Pelgrane Press' <em>13th Age Second Edition</em> and Necrotic Gnome's <em>Dolmenwood</em>. Even Paizo Inc's own <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/starfinder-second-edition-playtest-bundle-announced-by-paizo-and-humble-bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/starfinder"><em>Starfinder: Second Edition</em></a> appears on this list.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/draw-steel-dragonborn-warrior.jpg?itok=NoPQhPok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/draw-steel-dragonborn-warrior.jpg?itok=mJ7LS5xK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What makes <em>Legend in the Mist</em> stands out from its competition is its narrative focus. Characters don't have attributes but keywords, allowing background details and character traits to have in-game impacts on spells and weapons. In addition to the built-in character motivation and story arc system, the game can support tactical play, journeying, exploration, and just about any magic system,</p>

<p>Legend in the Mist is set to release digitally in Spring of 2025 with a physical release in Summer 2025.</p>

It’s on this latest assignment that Reacher faces his toughest challenge yet: a 7-foot-tall bodyguard named Paulie. “He’s twice my size,” Reacher tells his handler. Yes...ha ha ha...<u>YES</u>.</p><p>Fans are already ecstatic. “Somebody is bigger than Reacher.  This alone is a solid reason to watch Season 3,” reads the top comment on the season 3 trailer’s YouTube page. “Finally, a worthy opponent for Reacher! This deserves unlimited seasons, keep em coming!” reads another. “This show should go on for 30 seasons,” added a third. </p><p><em>Reacher</em>’s success is part of a recent wave of “lean back” TV, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/05/08/1097514186/2-new-shows-fall-into-the-smart-dumb-tv-category&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/08/1097514186/2-new-shows-fall-into-the-smart-dumb-tv-category" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also known as “smart-dumb” TV</a></span>, that indulges in the fun and satisfying delights of storytelling that knows what it’s about, does it very well, and doesn’t try to take itself too seriously. Where <em>The Lincoln Lawyer</em> revels in absurd but totally awesome courtroom antics, <em>Reacher</em> in unabashedly a show about a decent, stand-up guy who never found a bad situation that couldn’t be made right again through the careful deployment of his rippling biceps and manhole-cover quads.</p><p>In season 2 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://defector.com/it-is-now-time-to-discuss-jack-reacher-throwing-a-grill-at-a-guy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://defector.com/it-is-now-time-to-discuss-jack-reacher-throwing-a-grill-at-a-guy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he threw a grill at a guy</a></span>.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, or whatever Nintendo calls its next console, is expected to be announced soon and released later this year. But how many units will the system sell? According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lfakfksucs2q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a>, the Switch 2 will sell 4.3 million units in the US during 2025.</p><p>This assumes that the Switch 2 launches in the first half of 2025, Piscatella clarified. He added that the Switch should make up about one third of all video game consoles sold during 2025 in the US, excluding PC portable devices.</p><p>Piscatella went on to say that he expects the Switch 2 to face "hardware constraints" for several months after launch, and that the total number of units sold will depend on how many Nintendo can produce. Despite the popularity of a new Nintendo console, Piscatella said he continues to expect Sony's PlayStation 5 to be the No. 1 best-selling console in the US in 2025 based on unit sales.</p><p>Nintendo's platforms are popular globally, and US sales represent just one piece of the console's expected overall sales. Circana tracks the US video game industry specifically. </p><p>The Switch 2 has big shoes to fill, as the existing which has sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 145 million systems and more than 1.3 billion games to date.</a></p><p>Nintendo has said it will officially announce the new console by the end of March 2025, and while we wait for that, the rumor floodgates have opened. Plenty of unverified images and details about the system, including its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">purported new Joy-Cons</a>, have emerged in recent days and weeks.
