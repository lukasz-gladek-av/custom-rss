<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> launches next month on the Switch 2, and as we get closer to this anticipated release, Capcom has announced it will be airing another Resident Evil Showcase this week on <strong>15th January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>It promises to feature "brand new gameplay and news" about the upcoming entry starring Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy. Of course, if there are any other surprises revealed, we'll be sure to let you know when the news drops.</p>

<p>Capcom also notes how it will feature a "post-show" discussion on the Capcom USA channel after the main showcase, featuring Twitch partner guests and a giveaway of a Resident Evil 4 Collector's Edition. It's worth noting, there will be "no new information" during this segment.</p>
<p>This announcement follows a short trailer for Resident Evil Requiem popping up at CES 2026 last week (it was actually featuring during NVIDIA'S PC showcase of the title). Apart from Requiem, Capcom also previously confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a> will be heading to the Switch 2 on 27th February 2026.</p>
<p>To start the new year off, Capcom is also currently offering some deals on the Nintendo eShop in select locations - with sales on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ace_attorney_investigations_collection">Ace Attorney</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man</a> and more.</p>

Hopefully, much more exciting updates are on the way this year, but for now, it's getting things started with some system stability improvements.</p>
<p>The same patch note applies to both the Switch and Switch 2 firmware updates, and if anything else significant is revealed about this latest update, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/more-switch-games-have-received-compatibility-updates-for-switch-2">such as compatibility updates</a>, we'll let you know.

            <title><![CDATA[GTA Online Players Keep Making Charlie Kirk Assassination Missions And Rockstar Keeps Deleting Them]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-online-charlie-kirk-killing-assassination-missions-rockstar-deleting-censor-block-2000659038</link>
            <guid>1404088</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Rockstar Games seems to be playing cat-and-mouse with some <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-online-the-kotaku-review-1844188338"><em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a> players who are using newly added tools to recreate the assassination of Charlie Kirk in the extremely popular online open-world crime simulator.</p> <p>In September of last year, right-wing commentator <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439">Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck and killed</a> during a public appearance at a college in Utah. In the weeks that followed, many people, <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-announces-jimmy-kimmel-return-tuesday-boycott-back-abc-not-canceled-2000627662">including Jimmy Kimmel,</a> found themselves in trouble for commenting or joking about it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-community-manager-fired-for-responding-to-charlie-kirk-assassination-with-nothing-was-lost-2000627182">Some even lost their jobs</a>. Then, in December, right before the new year, Rockstar added a mission creator to<em> GTA Online,</em> letting players make their own solo missions. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cinemascrubs/video/7582722056542784799">And it didn’t take long for</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1143251116647159/posts/1673819406923658/">some creators to start recreating Kirk’s killing in <em>GTA Online</em></a>, leading to an ongoing situation where it seems Rockstar is trying (and failing) to stop these assassination-themed missions from spreading.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rockstar Games has added the term "Charlie Kirk" to the profanity filter in GTA Online after someone created this mission: <a href="https://t.co/oEubYl6TG6">pic.twitter.com/oEubYl6TG6</a></p> <p>— GTA 6 Info (@GTASixInfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTASixInfo/status/2010798891269243103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On January 12, <a href="https://x.com/gtasixinfo/status/2010798891269243103?s=46">the Twitter account GTA 6Info posted</a> a clip of what appears to be a user-created <em>GTA Online</em>&nbsp;mission called “We Are Charlie Kirk” that features the player being tasked with killing a man standing outside behind various props in a location that looks like a college campus. Once the man is killed, the mission is completed. GTA 6Info also claimed in the tweet that because of this mission, Rockstar Games has now added “Charlie Kirk” to <em>GTA Online’</em>s profanity filter. The tweet went viral, but it’s unclear if Rockstar did, in fact, add Kirk’s name to any such filter and if that particular mission is the reason.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Rockstar Games for more information.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000659042" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659042"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659042">©Rockstar Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>However, while <em>Kotaku</em> can’t confirm the specific claim in that tweet, it can verify that if you try to search for “Charlie Kirk” on the official custom jobs site for<em> GTA Online</em>, you’ll be greeted with an error regardless of which platform you pick. This also happens if you try to search for a slur or other vulgar term blocked by Rockstar. You can still search for <a href="https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/jobs/Charlie/?dateRangeCreated=last7&amp;platform=ps5&amp;sort=likes&amp;title=gtav">Charlie</a> or <a href="https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/jobs/Kirk/?dateRangeCreated=last7&amp;platform=ps5&amp;sort=likes&amp;title=gtav">Kirk separately</a>, and doing so will reveal that previously shared Kirk-themed maps, like the one from that viral video, seem to have been removed from <em>GTA Onlin</em>e sometime between December 10, when the mission creator tool was added to the game, and today. Players appear to be using “Charlie Pink” or mashing his first and last names together to try and get around what appear to be Rockstar’s attempt to make it much harder to find and share these missions.</p>

 <p>The question now is whether Rockstar Games will continue to play cat-and-mouse with creators trying to build and share recreations of Kirk’s murder.&nbsp; And if so, for how long will this trend continue in the live-service game? If I know the internet, Rockstar has a hard job ahead of it, especially as rumors of a banned topic spread online and entice more creators to try their luck at getting around any possible filters. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k26-charlie-kirk-character-creator-neck-tattoo-2000629891">We saw something like this happen in<em> NBA 2K26 </em>last year,</a> with players using the in-game creator tools to create bloody characters referencing the killing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Now More Than Ever, It Is Imperative That Tim Sweeney Log Off]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-x-ai-csam-epic-games-fortnite/</link>
            <guid>1404058</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last year, following Tim Sweeney’s full-throated endorsement of racist, conspiratorial tweets from Elon Musk, we <a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms/"><u>implored the Epic Games CEO to log off</u></a>. Now, in the somehow already worse year of 2026, we feel the need to urgently reiterate that message.</p><p>At the tail end of last week, Sweeney decided to once again swing to the rescue of the richest man on the planet by quote-retweeting an article headlined “U.S. Senators Ask Apple and Google to Remove X and Grok Apps Over Sexualized Image Generation” with <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009732745140871463?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>the following bit of commentary</u></a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“Reason #42 for open platforms: to shut down every politician’s incessant demands to all gatekeepers to censor all of their political opponents. All major AIs have documented instances of going off the rails; all major AI companies make their best efforts to combat this; none are perfect. Politicians demanding gatekeepers selectively crush the one that's their political opponent's company is basic crony capitalism.”</blockquote><p>This prompted more than a few raised eyebrows, seeing as one could – sans much or really any mental gymnastics – infer that Sweeney was defending Musk and co’s recent decision to implement AI tools that <a href="https://www.404media.co/groks-ai-csam-shitshow/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>allow X/Twitter users to generate pornographic imagery of minors</u></a>. Or at least that he was minimizing the harm those tools <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/474563/grok-x-ai-bikini-deepfake-liability-section-230?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">have caused and continue to cause</a>. PC Gamer <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-argues-banning-twitter-over-its-ability-to-ai-generate-pornographic-images-of-minors-is-just-gatekeepers-attempting-to-censor-all-of-their-political-opponents/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>published a piece</u></a> suggesting as much and also rightly pointing out the hypocrisy of Sweeney taking such a nauseating stance while overseeing a store that <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><u>couldn’t stomach <em>Horses</em></u></a>, a <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-indie-game-banned-steam-epic-review-impressions-santa-ragione/"><u>tame art game</u></a> that sparked a bewildering panic around nonexistent sexual content involving a minor.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the weekend, Sweeney, a billionaire with at least a billion better things to be doing, logged on perhaps harder than ever to <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010497254495342610?ref=aftermath.site"><u>call PC Gamer’s article “a vile lie.”</u></a>&nbsp;</p><p>“I criticized a government official for pressuring Apple and Google to block a speech app owned by their political opponent,” he wrote, “deplatforming 500,000,000 users on the pretense of stopping a small number of users from distributing disgusting content.”&nbsp;</p><p>Where to begin. First and foremost, hosting pornographic material involving minors is a crime to the extent that, as Chris pointed out <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-ai-bubble-2026-predictions/"><u>on Aftermath Hours last week</u></a>, X users could be implicated by downloading the app. And even if you agree with Sweeney’s techno-libertarian stance that lawmakers should have no power here, there must be <em>some kind</em> of consequence for creating history’s most powerful child porn engine. Otherwise, as we have seen time and time again specifically from billionaires like Musk, wealthy assholes will simply do whatever they please if it suits their vainglorious desires.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s worth noting that legal and financial constraints <em>have </em>caused Musk to fold in the past – for example in 2018 when he essentially committed fraud by claiming on Twitter that he’d secured funding to take Tesla private, at which point the SEC offered him a deal that’d force him to step down as chairman, which he rejected, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200623023744/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/business/elon-musk-sec-lawsuit-tesla.html"><u>then sued him</u></a>, causing him to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018-226?ref=aftermath.site"><u>accept the deal</u></a>. Now, however, Musk <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91472488/why-elon-musk-is-laughing-off-groks-flood-of-deepfake-ai-porn?ref=aftermath.site"><u>owns the regulators</u></a>, making consequential US government intervention a far less likely proposition. But this gives up the game as to what billionaires like Musk and Sweeney really want: Not a lawless land in which openness and innovation thrive, but one where the laws bend to and serve their specific wills.</p><p>Beyond that, if we’re really choosing to die on this hill, we must consider the matter of intent: OpenAI, as much of a stain on what remains of society as it is, at least has <a href="https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a policy</u></a> stating that its services "must never be used to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old." (Granted, other companies with similar policies, like Microsoft, have previously <a href="https://www.404media.co/microsoft-closes-loophole-that-created-ai-porn-of-taylor-swift/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>struggled with deepfake porn</u></a>, and OpenAI’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/chatgpts-adult-mode-is-coming-in-2026-2000698677?ref=aftermath.site"><u>forthcoming “adult mode”</u></a> will almost certainly prove to be a disaster.) X, for its part, has referred members of the press to <a href="https://x.com/safety/status/2007648212421587223?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a tweet from earlier this month</u></a> in which it said that “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” Thus far, however, the results speak for themselves. It is clear that X did not implement rigorous safeguards before releasing this feature, and now – instead of taking the whole thing offline until it’s in better shape – the company is <a href="https://www.404media.co/x-premium-grok-paywall-images-ai-generator/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>attempting to monetize it</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t also point to <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-app-store-return/"><u>Sweeney’s own history</u></a> where deplatforming users is concerned. As Nathan Brown, writer of the <a href="https://newsletter.hitpoints.co/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>HitPoints newsletter</u></a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hitpoints.bsky.social/post/3mc7oud4ph22q?ref=aftermath.site"><u>put it</u></a>: “[All of this] from a guy who deplatformed tens of millions of his own users so he could pressure Apple and Google to change what he considered an immoral policy.” But then, said policy happened to cost Sweeney money, obviously making it a far more urgent matter than something that stands to enable pedophiles while endangering, traumatizing, and embarrassing countless children, as well as numerous adults (mostly women).&nbsp;Meanwhile, thanks to the recent addition of microtransactions on Sweeney's platform, a user-generated game popular with millions of younger players <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-steal-the-brainrot-gambling-vbucks-2000658885?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">now includes real-money gambling</a>. </p><p>Sweeney, like every other tantrum-throwing tech baby irreparably brain-poisoned by a mixture of obscene wealth and an app where people are sometimes a little mean to them, needs to log off. He needed to do it yesterday – and also all the days before. But hey, the sun will rise again tomorrow. There is still hope, dim though it might be.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms/"><div><p>Log Off, Tim Sweeney - Aftermath</p><p>Again, if I had $5 billion you would never see or hear from me ever again</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

It’s a matchmaking tactic that has set the Arc Raiders community ablaze since the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-confirms-it-recently-added-aggression-based-matchmaking-but-its-not-a-full-science"><u>announced its implementation</u></a> earlier this month. While some of the more aggressive fans aren’t sure how they feel about being linked up with other bloodthirsty Raiders, gentler players are using ABMM to find lobbies where player-vs.-player violence is practically off-limits.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The type of lobby you get after not shooting someone for 20 games <a href="https://t.co/TAYzsiEd6e" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TAYzsiEd6e</a></p>— Arc Raiders Intel (@ArcRaidersIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaidersIntel/status/2010455941330927874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Multiple players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz5gfoy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>shared stories online</u></a> about finding friendly lobbies that see Raiders cooperate with one another by evenly sharing loot after taking down a Matriarch. Some runs have even been said to result in a group dance party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Took down a matriarch and everyone shared the loot equally and then danced together at extract,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz4vog4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player explained</u></a>. “After a week of pure PvP this is like a whole new world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Lately I’ve been running into nothing but friendly players," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz57uka/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another added</a>.

While players do their best to use ABMM to land them in friendly lobbies, some have begun <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pyca5k/comment/nwhn724/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offering advice</a> to those who would prefer to avoid PvP but can't quite crack the code. There are even some fans discussing their hope for official support for strictly peaceful lobbies, but for those who prefer to rummage for loot in Stella Montis with a hint of paranoia, ABMM can be manipulated in the other direction, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who keep the safety on when looking for rusted gears and light bulbs with friends may have some luck balancing their lobbies with both friendly and aggressive players if they don’t exclusively stick to PvE combat. With enough trial and error, a few fans say they've had luck tweaking matchmaking to add just a dash of mischief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I enjoy both lobbies,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz4xgok/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user commented</u></a>. “PvE for making new friends and looting properly. PvP with my mate terrorising the whole lobby and losing all the good weapons we brought [because] someone outplays us with a big smile on our faces and having a great time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark has been clear: ABMM isn’t a science. The aggression-based matchmaking tool is also likely still being tweaked as Arc Raiders rides <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms">success</a> through its third month since launching for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 30. Still, it’s proven to be at least somewhat useful for those looking to avoid PvP, and the tension that comes with it, as much as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While players argue over whether ABMM is right for Arc Raiders, Embark seems to have made up its mind. For the Stockholm-based game developer, Arc Raiders is better off without doubling down on competitive gameplay mechanics like leaderboards, with CEO Patrick Söderlund explaining in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=QKpGyvRhpr7r-Cdw&amp;v=vY3u7wOmm4w&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesBeat</u></a> interview that “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-mechanics-like-leaderboards"><u>the game isn't about shooting other players</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can do that if you want to,” he added, “but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players. It's a part that we use to craft tension.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Arc Raiders community is still deciphering its favorite way to experience the evolving extraction shooter.

"Even after barreling through the campaign in a couple of days, I still couldn't stop myself from going back for more," wrote critic Richard Wakeling. "Ninja Gaiden 4 is a brutal menagerie of excessive blood spray, gratifying weapons, and gloriously stylish action. It banishes the sour memories of Ninja Gaiden 3 and has me pining for more character-action games, serving as a wistful reminder that games like Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, and Bayonetta ruled the roost before the recent proliferation of Souls-likes."</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NINJA-GAIDEN-Ragebound-Playstation-5/dp/B0FD4NMM41?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</a> on PS5 is down to its lowest price ever at Amazon, now available for $31.12 (was $40).

			<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3435450/Hardest/">Hardest</a></strong> is a free rock-paper-scissors game on Steam that was released in 2025 and made by indie developer <strong>Eero Laine</strong> under the studio name <strong>Rakuel</strong>. It's one of many games on Steam that includes a disclaimer towards the bottom of its page indicating it was made with generative AI tools, and on<strong> January 30, 2026</strong>, Laine plans to delete the game from Steam because his girlfriend of one month made him realize that "<em>AI is bad</em>," and now wants nothing to do with the game he made using <strong>GenAI</strong>.</p>



<p>Laine explains how he made the game through GenAI tools he had access to through university, and while the tools at first seemed 'free' for him to use without repercussions, he explains that he now understands more of the larger picture of what it means to use AI and GenAI tools from an economic and environmental standpoint.</p>



<p>"<em>This game will be deleted at 30.1</em>," Laine begins in a post on the game's Steam page. "<em>I made this game during the summer in [a] couple months and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free, so I could generate unlimited images for free and so.</em>" </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AI-Is-Bad.png"></a><figcaption><em>Eero Laine used this image as the heading for the post to announce the game's removal. Image credit: Eero Laine</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>But I have realized the AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment. Some AI companies can use this game just existing as a reason to get more investment for their AI companies, that benefit no one, but rather suck resrouces from the economy from hard working people.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I coded everything myself, so I can in the future make a new game with real assets if I feel like it, but the game existing in its current form is a disgrace to all game makers and players. Ethically only logical reason is to delete the game from Steam. The girl I've been dating for a month made me realize this. Thank you, Eero Laine</em>."</p>



<p>GenAI has been, and will continue to be, a controversial topic in video games. On one side, we have people like Eero Laine and indie publisher Hooded Horses, who are entirely against GenAI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/publisher-hooded-horse-added-no-fing-ai-assets-to-its-contracts-calls-genai-cancerous/">with the latter even adding a "<em>no f***ing AI assets" </em>clause to the contracts of games they decide to publish</a>. Starfinder: Afterlight developers Epictellers Entertainment told Wccftech, <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/">"<em>there's no point in using AI for any creative endeavor</em>,"</a> and developers are even going out of their way to make it clear that they<a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/"> not only don't use GenAI tools, but have no intention of ever using GenAI tools</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there are companies like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studios</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/">Larian Studios</a></strong> that have been more open about their GenAI use and support, and plenty of others who <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">believe that GenAI will become part of a game developer's toolset as much as anything else is</a>.</p>



<p>Whatever side of the aisle you sit on, it's clear that for Eero Laine, once his girlfriend pointed out some of the big negatives that go along with the current state of GenAI (<a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">not to mention what's happening with RAM prices</a>), they could no longer support the tech, no matter how small their support may have been. </p>

According to developer Eero Laine, he’ll be removing <em>Hardest</em> completely from the Steam store on January 30. According to the update, <em>Hardest</em> was made in Summer 2025 using free tools provided by the developer’s university, and according to him, at the time, he didn’t realize the effect that AI tech can have on people’s jobs and the environment. <em>Hardest</em> was released on Steam in July 2025 and is free to play.</p> <p><wbr>“I made [<em>Hardest</em>] during the summer in couple months [sic] and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free, so I could generate unlimited images for free,” said the developer on Steam in a post titled AI Is Bad. “But I have realized the AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment. Some AI companies can use this game just existing as a reason the get more investment for their AI companies[sic], that benefit no one, but rather suck resources from the economy from hard working people.”</p> <p>According to Laine, he coded “everything” himself in <em>Hardest</em>, so in the future, he might try to build a new game with “real assets” using his past non-AI code. Laine concluded the Steam update with:&nbsp;<wbr>“But the game existing in its current form is a disgrace to all game makers and players. Ethically only logical reason is to delete the game from Steam. The girl I’ve been dating for a month made me realize this.”</p> <p>I’m not 100 percent sure, but I think this might be the first time someone has deleted a game from Steam because their new partner convinced them it was a disgrace and should be removed from the planet. Harsh, but in the case of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-generated-rpg-pixel-art-viral-elder-scrolls-daggerfall-2000616694">AI-generated</a> slop, accurate. Kudos to that young woman for doing some good work. And I hope Laine’s next game is great and not filled with ugly AI-generated art.&nbsp;<wbr><wbr></p>

Isn't it funny that we don't have a definitive reason as to why we dream? We have ideas, theories, like that they're the brain moving memories from short-term to long-term storage. But why the hell can they get so weird? And worse, scary. This feels like the central question at the heart of Mama's Sleeping Angels, an upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>-esque procedurally generated dream-exploration game where you're having a sleepover with friends and must feed a goddess within her dream.
</p>
<p>
The core "friendslop" structure is still in Mama's Sleeping Angels somewhere amongst the effervescent dream/nightmarescape. You can play by yourself, or with up to three friends. There are different maps to explore, themed around things like the suburbs, all procedurally generated. You must find items and return them to your spawn point to progress. It's just the donkey brains madness of it all that almost forces me to look away from my screen.

There is a texture to these dreamworlds that feels like a dirty needle poking right out of the ground, a collection of digital, mechanical, brutalist viscera so, not grotesque, just unfathomably in your face and loud. A cute flip phone sits in the top right of your screen, acting as your flashlight, but also your tool to analyse the items you are tasked with finding, unlocking memories and more about this strange plane.
</p><p>
This goddess, mother, is oh so hungry, and you have to feed her the items you find, the equivalent of selling off loot in Lethal Company. You'll come across baffling, almost imperceptible enemies that you can fend off with weapons that range from chainsaws to guns so grimey you can feel them on your keyboard. It is a Y2K smorgasbord for the zillenialpha generations that is as equally janky, and difficult to control, as it is mesmerizing. There's so much more going on here that I haven't begun to understand, like how you can saw off your own head and lop it into a grinder, or this one weird clown creature that taunts you behind a set of bars, but perhaps that's all for another time.
</p>
<p>
Right now there's no more precise a release date than Q1, 2026, but you too can try it out in a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918310/Mamas_Sleeping_Angels/">Steam</a> (if you're prepared to legitimately, probably have some weird dreams anyway).

            <title><![CDATA[‘There Is an Underrepresented Majority That Wants Entertainment Without a Specific Agenda’, Says Ex Tripwire CEO]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/john-gibson-ex-tripwire-ceo-underrepresented-majority/</link>
            <guid>1403986</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A little more than four years ago, <strong>John Gibson</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-following-backlash-against-john-gibsons-views-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his role as CEO and co-founder of <strong>Tripwire Interactive</strong></a> following a controversy sparked by his tweet supportive of the <strong>Texas Heartbeat Act</strong>, which banned abortions in the state after the detection of embryonic or fetal cardiac activity.</p>



<p>For a while, Gibson, who started as a programmer on the <strong>America's Army</strong> series (developed and published by the <strong>US Army</strong>) and then went on to co-found the studio known mainly for Red Orchestra and Killing Floor, remained out of the games industry. That changed around two years ago, when he started consulting for <strong>Bible X</strong>, the studio behind the Christian-based game project <strong>Gate Zero</strong>. Last month, Gibson, through his recently established publisher <strong>Templar Media</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/templar-media-acquires-bible-x-studio-making-gate-zero-where-you-play-the-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the developer</a>.</p>



<p>I recently interviewed him to discuss the investment and the game itself, although we started with an explanation of Templar Media's slogan: <strong>"Entertainment First."</strong> Gibson wants to deliver games that focus on the fun factor rather than pushing a political agenda, as he said games (and other media) have been doing lately. </p>



<p><em>I was formerly the co-founder, co-owner, and CEO of Tripwire Interactive. Now, I am leading Templar Media. I founded Templar Media earlier this year.  After selling Tripwire, I took a break, but I realized I wanted to get back into games. <strong>I noticed that in a lot of media, the focus had shifted away from pleasing the player or the viewer. Instead, it was often about whatever commentary or message a developer or entertainer wanted to convey. This is where our slogan, "Entertainment First," originated.</strong> I wanted to establish a company focused on creating great content that people truly enjoy. While everyone aims to make something great, players can tell if your primary focus is not on building an entertaining and fun game. Our goal is to make great, entertaining content.</em></p>



<p><em>[...] <strong>We are catering to an underserved mainstream market. In America and somewhat in Europe, the people creating entertainment often represent a monolithic political block. However, consumers are not a monolithic block and do not necessarily share the same views as those making the entertainment. There is an underrepresented majority that wants entertainment without a specific agenda. </strong></em></p>



<p>Later, the former Tripwire executive referenced <strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</strong> specifically, where the <strong>Qu'nari</strong> companion <strong>Taash</strong> eventually transitions to non-binary and has a significant discussion with their mother, <strong>Shathann</strong> (an NPC), about it during a personal quest.</p>



<p><em>When I was growing up, movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones or games like Zelda and Metroid were about entertaining you, not an agenda. This has been lost in much of modern entertainment. <strong>For example, in the new Dragon Age game, there is a cutscene where the player is lectured about pronouns. We experience entertainment to forget about day-to-day politics and just have fun. Entertainment needs to go back to focusing on entertaining people.</strong> While our first game is faith-based, we are not afraid to tell those stories to an underserved market and to anyone who simply wants great content without modern agendas. As a company owner and designer, you must focus on what the customer will enjoy, not just your own preferences.</em></p>

			<p>A UK judge has denied 31 former <strong>Rockstar</strong> employees' bid for interim pay as they and their union representation, the <strong>Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB)</strong>, fight their dismissal and are accusing Rockstar of <strong>union-busting</strong>.</p>



<p>If their interim bid pay had been granted, then Rockstar would have been mandated to put the 31 employees back on the payroll while the legal battle between the employees and Rockstar raged on. The ruling to deny the interim pay bid comes from a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2ODI0NzI2MywiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODUyMDYzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOFJPOVVLSVVQU1owMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.27VI473B4UvIhmPh6eOoW2Crg7Pem9jtOtoGNX34Bco">Bloomberg</a>, which reports that after a two-day tribunal last week, Judge Frances Eccles felt that the IWGB and the fired workers had not successfully met the bar to demonstrate they had a "<em>pretty good chance of success</em>" at convincing the tribunal of Rockstar's alleged union-busting.</p>



<p>"<em>In all the circumstances, the tribunal was unable to conclude that it appears likely that the tribunal will find that the principal reason for the claimants’ dismissal was their membership of the IWGB</em>," Eccles wrote in their ruling.</p>

<p>Last year, Rockstar fired 34 employees (<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">31 in the UK and three in Canada</a>) at the end of October 2025, with the news breaking and initial union-busting accusations flying at the beginning of November 2025. Rockstar shot back at the accusations, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/">claiming the workers were fired for leaking confidential information,</a> which Rockstar would later claim included "<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/"><em>specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles</em>."</a></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">The IWGB filed legal claims against Rockstar</a> as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">employees asked for reinstatement</a>, while protests began to appear in physical and digital forms, with game developers both within and outside of Rockstar and Take-Two taking to protesting at Rockstar and Take-Two offices and <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">over 200 Rockstar North employees signing an open letter to management</a> calling for the reinstatement of their colleagues.</p>



<p>An anonymous employee claiming to have knowledge of the situation came forward to <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/">claim that Rockstar's accusations are false and that this is a clear case of union-busting on Rockstar's part</a>, and the issue has since been brought to the UK parliament twice, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-calls-grand-theft-auto-vi-developers-allege-union-busting-deeply-concerning/">UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer speaking on it the second time, calling the accusations "<em>deeply concerning</em>."</a></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-6-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Protestors outside of Rockstar Toronto</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The alleged leaking of confidential information is said to have taken place in <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-reportedly-used-internal-slack-changes-shared-in-discord-server-to-fire-34-union-members/">a Discord server used by the IWGB and Rockstar employees for the purposes of organizing</a>. Initially, the IWGB claimed that Rockstar was trying to call employees discussing internal Slack policy changes in that Discord server, the 'leak' of confidential information. A claim that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">corroborated by one of the three employees fired from Rockstar Toronto when Wccftech spoke to them, CWA Canada, and other protestors who demonstrated at the Rockstar Toronto offices in December 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Though Rockstar alleges it was more than just the discussion of Slack policies, today's ruling from Eccles does seem to clear up a few unanswered questions about the Discord server in question. Eccles' ruling confirms that the server, which includes 350 members, was, as advertised, used for organizing, but that it also included more than just current Rockstar employees and IWGB staff. </p>



<p>Eccles cites that beyond the three Canadian workers who were not part of the IWGB union, the server did include former Rockstar staff who did not leave the server after having left the company, and it even included one person who Bloomberg describes as someone who "<em>writes articles about the video-game industry</em>."</p>



<p>When Wccftech asked the fired Rockstar Toronto worker about the server, who spoke to us under anonymity, they claimed that if there were people in the server who were no longer at Rockstar, they had "<em>no idea</em>" of their presence, adding, "<em>everyone I've ever spoken to [in that server] was a current employee</em>."</p>



<p>Eccles' ruling also points out that there were other organizing members within the server who were not fired, though, in a point against Rockstar, Judge Eccles also noted that some of the employees who were fired were dismissed despite "<em>having posted very little on the Discord server</em>."</p>



<p>Rockstar, for its part, says, "<em>We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing</em>." Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, the IWGB is "<em>more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar’s calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful.</em>"</p>

            <guid>1403980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-union-busting-firing-keir-starmer-2000652135">30 fired Rockstar Games employees</a> have lost a request for interim relief following an ongoing fight with the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker. A UK employment tribunal ruling read that it “was unable to conclude that it appears likely that the tribunal will find that the principal reason for the claimants’ dismissal was their membership of the IWGB,” meaning the legal battle will continue with no immediate back pay for the fired developers. The union representing them says it’s undeterred while a spokesperson for Rockstar said the company regrets being put in this situation and maintains the employees were fired for leaking confidential information.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881">The dispute revolves around a Discord</a> set up by the IWGB to help organize union video game developers. Rockstar says it fired 31 UK developers last year for disclosing company secrets in the channel, including information related to development schedules and game features. IWGB has denied that any sensitive info was leaked and claims the firings infringed on employees’ labor rights and are tantamount to union-busting.</p>

 <p>According to employment Judge Frances Eccles’ initial ruling, the Discord channel included around 350 members, including former Rockstar employees, at least one of whom had <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-discord-union-rockstar-leaks-2000657761">previously published articles</a> about the company online. A spokesperson for Rockstar pointed out that there were current employees who shared support for unionizing in the Discord and who weren’t fired, stressing that the terminations were specifically for mishandling of company information.</p>

 <p>“The Glasgow Employment Tribunal has rejected the union’s application for interim relief. We welcome the decision, which is consistent with Rockstar’s position throughout,” a spokesperson for Rockstar told <em>Kotaku</em> in an emailed statement. “We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing.”</p>

 <h2>Rockstar accused of spying on fired devs</h2> <p>But the IWGB says the ruling highlights that Rockstar failed to follow procedural guidelines when firing the employees, with no disciplinary meetings, investigations, or chances to appeal the company’s findings internally. It also accused Rockstar of “covertly monitoring” employees on the Discord by “impersonating” a union staff member. And the organization points to a part of the judge’s ruling that reads “There was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings” as evidence that Rockstar overreacted.</p>

 <p>“Despite being refused interim relief today, we’ve come out of last week’s hearing more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar’s calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful,” IWGB president Alex Marshall said in a statement emailed to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “The fact that we were granted this hearing speaks to the strength of our case and, over the course of the two-day hearing, Rockstar consistently failed to back up claims made in the press or to refute that they acted unfairly, maliciously, and in breach of their own procedures.”</p>

 <p>The case will now continue to be argued before the tribunal for a full finding which could have important implications for whether the studio behind one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world becomes unionized. Whatever the outcome, it seems likely to be decided before<em> Grand Theft Auto 6</em> ships later this year in November.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nvidia CEO Says AI “Doomer Narrative” Is “Hurtful”]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-ceo-says-ai-doomer-narrative-is-hurtful/</link>
            <guid>1403944</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants everyone to stop being so negative about AI. </p>



<p>The head of the company with the $4.502 trillion market cap—the highest in the world—feels that people spreading a “doomer narrative” are only doing harm to the industry.</p>







<p>Speaking on a recent episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">No Priors podcast</a>, Huang was asked about the idea of “God AI” and the stigma that’s surround the growth of the technology as a whole. </p>



<p>Regarding God AI, Huang doesn’t see researchers “having any reasonable ability to create god AI.” </p>



<p>“The ability&nbsp;to understand human language, genome language, and molecular language and protein language and amino-acid language and physics language all supremely well—that god AI just doesn’t exist,” he says. </p>



<p>He continues to say that there are a lot of industries that “need” AI, which he calls “just the next computer industry”. Huang says that while this God AI isn’t coming next week or next year, the “whole world needs to move forward next week, next year, next decade.”</p>



<p><strong>“I think that the idea of a monolithic, gigantic company, country, nation-state is just…super unhelpful, it’s too extreme,” </strong>he said. <strong>“If you want to take it to that level, we should just stop everything…what’s the point?”</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-a-continued-fear-of-ai">A Continued Fear Of AI</h2>



<p>With the growth of AI continuing at a rapid pace, there are many people out there who are completely against the idea. Whether it be for the fear of losing jobs or the ability to create believable falsehoods, you don’t have to go far to find someone with a negative opinion on the technology. </p>



<p>To that notion, Huang feels that the constant negativity from the general public and prominent figures has been <strong>“extremely hurtful”.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“I think we’ve done a lot of damage lately with very well-respected people who have painted a doomer narrative, end of the world narrative, science fiction narrative,”</strong> he said. <strong>“And I appreciate that most of us grew up enjoying science fiction, but it’s not helpful.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“It’s not helpful to people, it’s not helpful to the industry, it’s not helpful to society, it’s not helpful to the governments.”</strong></p>







<p>Huang then continued to question what the purpose of that type of narrative and what the intentions are of those who spread it. </p>



<p>Of course, the feeling around AI is going to continue to be division both in the general population and within the games industry. Just recently, the use of generative AI resulted in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 seeing its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of the Year award at the Indie Game Awards</a> stripped away. </p>

It feels quite fitting that a game like Big Hops released today, the day after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/awesome-games-done-quick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a> wrapped up, because this thing feels like it has a guaranteed spot in Summer Games Done Quick already. You're a frog! Who hops around! What's not to love? It helps that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> feels so good in motion, too.
</p>
<p>
If you've not heard of Big Hops before let me give you the proper run down. You play as Hop (get it?), a happy-go-lucky frog that is fooled into unleashing a mischievous spirit called Diss that I was half convinced was voiced by Elijah Wood for a minute (but is actually voiced by the very talented Ben Diskin, hey there Young Xehanort). Big Hops is very much a game that would not exist without, well, any 3D Mario, but it isn't beholden to those games either.

There's no triple jump, at least in the demo, but there is a crouch jump. There's some wall bouncing, but more critically there's some Breath of the Wildian wall climbing, complete with a stamina bar. And of course there's tongue swinging, rolling, mid-air dashing, a real mish-mash of original and borrowed ideas that have been cooked up into a game that feels incredibly tight, speedy, and most importantly of all, bouncy.
</p><p>
I like the sillier elements, like catching bugs with said tongue, giving them a good inspection before adding them to your collection. The environments feel neatly designed too, no wasted space, secrets to be found, and colours that make a nice meal for the eyes. It is a game I cannot describe as anything but delightful, and I look forward to finding the time to play the actual game, somewhere amongst the mess that is life!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/anthem">Anthem</a>, the failed attempt at a live-service game by Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare, is now offline for good. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning, shortly after 10am Pacific time, Anthem's remaining players reported seeing the game's servers blinking out of existence, rendering the game fully unplayable, forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare had not given a specific time for when Anthem's switch-off would occur, and instead only indicated the game would remain online until today, January 12, before its removal. Still, a small cluster of fans had been tracking Anthem's final hours, and a few dozen had been playing the game on Twitch to see out its final moments. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At around 10.03am Pacific, in-game players reported getting suddenly booted as the plug was pulled. After warnings of a connection problem, players were left sitting back on the Anthem's startup screen, showing the game's logo and its characters — now left to forever tinker with their amored Javelin suits, which will never fly again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of all the dead live games, this is one of the most painful, as the game was so very close to greatness," wrote Anthem fan <a href="https://twitter.com/Com_Raven/status/2010807200458117385" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marcel Hatam</a> on X/Twitter. "Great core gameplay with fun combat and flying, an intriguing world and great customization. Freelancer signing off 🫡."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Damn wanted to get a few more hours before closure, sad," wrote new fan Regis via BioWare's Discord, who said they'd only given Anthem a try this month after learning it was shutting down. "Got to play the game for just a week but it already leaves a hole in my chest."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/12/playing-anthem-until-the-servers-shut-down-01-33-45-1768250034127.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">BioWare's Anthem, 2019 - 2026.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem launched in February 2019 to lukewarm reviews, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">including IGN's own</a>, which criticized the game's grindiness, lack of polish and mismatched story. The game sold more than 5 million copies but failed to meet EA's own internal targets, set after a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bioware-executive-producer-breaks-down-what-really-happened-to-anthem">long and troubled development</a>. Despite some effort to further update and improve the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anthem-development-ceases-bioware-to-focus-on-dragon-age-mass-effect">BioWare ceased active development on Anthem back in February 2021</a>, citing a need to prioritize Dragon Age: The Veilguard (which launched in late 2024 to its own set of mixed feedback) and Mass Effect 5 (which is still seemingly years away).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem publisher EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january">announced last year that it would stop running the game's servers today</a>, and confirmed that users would no longer be able play at all after this point. Premium in-game currency was withdrawn from sale last summer, and the game was delisted at the same time from EA Play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">An online-only action RPG spread across a large multiplayer map, Anthem had no offline option — meaning that the game's world, characters and lore are now officially gone for good. But as IGN reported last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-biowares-failed-live-service-anthem-gets-ready-to-die-players-rush-to-unlock-platinums-and-say-their-goodbyes-while-others-work-on-custom-servers">there are fledgling efforts underway by fans to bring Anthem back online via custom servers</a>, though it is too early to tell exactly how far this option might progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <guid>1403914</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">An employment tribunal has today rejected an application for interim relief filed on behalf of the fired Grand Theft Auto 6 developers at Rockstar Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Glasgow Employment Tribunal released the outcome of the hearing today, rejecting all applications for interim relief. “We welcome the decision, which is consistent with Rockstar’s position throughout," a Rockstar Games spokesperson told IGN. “We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has insisted the employees it fired late last year were dismissed because they leaked game features for upcoming and unannounced titles in Discord, not because they were trying to unionize. 34 members of staff at Rockstar were dismissed, 31 in the UK and three in Canada, sparking protests outside the office of GTA 6 developer Rockstar North in Edinburgh, Scotland, and outside parent company Take-Two’s office in London.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rockstar North and Take-Two Office Protest Photos Nov 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which had accused Rockstar of “union-busting,” asked a judge to grant the fired GTA 6 developers interim relief at a preliminary employment tribunal hearing held in the UK last week. Interim relief is a legal mechanism that can provide workers with support while they wait for a full hearing. If the interim relief had been granted, the workers would have been put back on Rockstar’s payroll and had their work visas reinstated where necessary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the ruling, Judge Eccles said that of the approximately 350 members of the IWGB Discord, over half were members of the IWGB, but some were no longer employed by Rockstar Games. One member was said to have written press articles about video games, including at least one that commented on Rockstar and the development of GTA. Judge Eccles added that because Rockstar dismissed three employees in Canada who were not members of the union, their union membership could not have been a factor in their dismissal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to information provided to IGN by a Rockstar Games spokesperson, the ruling indicates that Judge Eccles believes that the IWGB is not “likely” to show that union activity or membership was the reason for their dismissal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lord John Hendy KC, who represents the fired developers, argued it was not “gross misconduct” to share confidential information in a group containing external third parties, even as a matter of principle, but Rockstar insisted this claim was not credible. Lord Hendy KC also suggested there was ‘no leak’ of information, at best only a ‘risk’ of leak. However, Rockstar said that posting confidential information in a public forum constitutes a 'leak’ because that information was shared with people outside of Rockstar, including individuals who work at competitors and with journalists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has also denied having a “blacklist” of union members, stressing that at the time of the dismissals, the company did not know whether the claimants were union members, so could not have targeted them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize"><u>as it has said before</u></a>, Rockstar employees themselves raised concerns to the company and granted representatives access to the “social” channel, not the Discord channel used for official union organizing. As IGN has also reported, Rockstar has claimed that the union channel mods didn’t know who was in the channel, and that it posed a leak risk.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the alleged leaked information, Rockstar believes it to be significant and related to game features around GTA 6. This includes specific game features, comments on the overall progress of GTA 6 development, timelines to launch, and company IT security protocols. Rockstar believes that if the comments in question had leaked they would have been big gaming news and might even have affected Take-Two’s share price. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026"><u>Rockstar officially announced that GTA 6 would be delayed by six months</u></a> to November 19, 2026, the market value of Take-Two plummeted $3.75 billion in a single day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Rockstar has pointed to its well-established zero tolerance approach to leaks, highlighting that it dismissed a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK in April 2025, who it alleged disclosed confidential information about GTA 6 to a third party who published the information to social media, and dismissed an employee in the U.S. in November 2023 and another in India in November 2025 for two separate acts of information leaking. Rockstar said that many of the claimants accepted in the Discord server that their comments might not have aligned with Rockstar’s policies on confidentiality and security, which it believes to be a sign they were aware of the company’s zero-tolerance approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IWGB issued IGN with a lengthy statement in response to the ruling:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The judge’s decision - that Rockstar will not be forced into providing emergency support to our members whilst they await trial - is disappointing but does nothing to dampen our hopes of winning justice when the full hearing takes place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In fact, we are emerging from this hearing, having now had a glimpse of Rockstar’s flimsy grounds for defence, feeling bolstered in our claims that these firings were not just deeply unjust but also plainly unlawful. The judge stated in her ruling that: ‘There was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was also highlighted in the ruling that many procedural guidelines were broken in the process of firing these employees, including there being no disciplinary meetings, no chance for appeal until six weeks later, and no evidence of an investigation. Comments relied on by Rockstar’s lawyers were obtained without the knowledge of employees using Discord, described by the claimants as 'covert monitoring.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have always been clear that Interim Relief is an incredibly high bar to meet as a temporary measure before the substantive tribunal, and it would have been almost unprecedented for a Judge to award this to a group of this size. That we did not secure an interim relief order means the especially stringent conditions required for this kind of hearing were not met, but does nothing to suggest that Rockstar will not be found guilty of unfair dismissal when the case goes to trial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The facts of the matter remain shocking, such as how Rockstar management have now admitted to covertly monitoring their employees on this private Discord by impersonating a member of staff. Rather than focusing their case on evidence that Rockstar acted fairly and reasonably in their decision to fire 31 people on the spot, the argument resided largely on legal technicalities, with Rockstar's lawyers declaring that it doesn’t matter if the dismissals were unfair, or if the leadership that dismissed them acted with malice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Such an approach is wholly in keeping with what we already know of Rockstar’s utter disregard for the people whose creativity and hard work deliver its billions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We remain confident in the strength of our case against Rockstar Games and we reiterate our firm belief that Rockstar broke the law when it summarily dismissed 31 union members. We look forward to the day we face them in court."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alex Marshall, President of the IWGB added: "Despite being refused interim relief today, we’ve come out of last week’s hearing more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar’s calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful. The fact that we were granted this hearing speaks to the strength of our case and, over the course of the two-day hearing, Rockstar consistently failed to back up claims made in the press or to refute that they acted unfairly, maliciously, and in breach of their own procedures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They’ve shown their hand and also shone a light on their own callousness and incompetence. Given the outpouring of public support over the last few months, from Paris to New York, the world knows that Rockstar is in the wrong and their disregard for workers will cast a long shadow over the release of GTA6. This hearing could have alleviated the hardships faced by those in financial precarity or forced to leave the country as a result of Rockstar’s actions but we remain undeterred in our efforts to hold them to account."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IWGB also provided a statement attributed to a former Rockstar employee: "This decision to fail to award IR is a gut-punch to everyone legitimately engaged in trade union activities. The real world consequences of this are forcing valuable people to leave this country, upending their families and destroying their lives, and all because of the actions of a ruthless uncaring employer’s quest to crush a trade union. We’ll continue the fight to clear our names, regain our jobs and put an end to this chapter of our lives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Throughout all this, the bonds we have made with those who were unlawfully fired have kept us all strong. The kindness, compassion and dedication we have all shown to each other is heartwarming and a reminder that we are all fighting for workers rights. This decision, while not in our favour, is not an exoneration of Rockstar’s behaviour and actions. Merely a stumbling block on the road to justice."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Union busting has consequences!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Peter Molyneux, the mind behind the Fable series, Populous, and Black &amp; White, announced his next game, Masters of Albion, during <a href="https://youtu.be/CSLGKKAuZwo?si=wgxWrMJrTAOFcIlB">Gamescom 2024</a>. His next – and final – game is coming to PC on April 22.</p><p>Masters of Albion comes from Molyneux’s studio, 22 Cans, and blends elements of real-time strategy, town management, and simulation to an experience Molyneux describes as “the culmination of my life’s work,” in a press release. Players take on the role of a powerful god possessing a “god hand” capable of designing and building entire villages from the ground-up.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/joy9aDGawTU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/joy9aDGawTU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Buildings can be customized, and different types of structures can be combined to form new building types. As you lord over your human citizens, you can manipulate them via possession, inspire them with divine acts, or punish them using abilities such as weather manipulation and more. Masters of Albion does not feature timers or waiting, allowing players to rule their worlds at their own pace. You can explore Albion from the heavens, control humans or animals such as dogs and chickens to take in the sights on foot. Players can complete quests to unlock treasures and secrets, or explore hidden areas to uncover the secret history of Albion.</p><p>When night falls, the gameplay of Masters of Albion shifts into more of an RTS as players defend villages against evil creatures that appear in the dark. Fighting back involves building and placing defensive weapons, such as turrets, constructing walls and other structures to funnel enemies where needed, and hiring heroes to protect the populace. You can also possess heroes to fight monsters directly in real-time combat.</p><p>Masters of Albion is 22 Cans’ first game since launching The Trail: Frontier Challenge in 2017. In October 2025, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-about-redemption-peter-molyneux-says-masters-of-albion-will-make-up-for-decades-of-overpromising-on-things/">Molyneux told <em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a> that the game serves as a form of “redemption” following 22 Cans’ previous projects in which he overpromised and underdelivered, such as 2012's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/05/26/22-cans-announces-goddess-curiosity-cube-winner-will-control-the-game.aspx">Curiosity: What's Inside the Cube</a> and 2014’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/godus/b/ios/archive/2014/08/07/godus-launches-today-on-ios.aspx">Godus</a>. He also stated that Masters of Albion would be the final game of his 43-year career.</p><p>“I admit now that I did overpromise on things, and said things that I shouldn’t have said about Curiosity,” Molyneux told <em>VGC</em> last October. “But I only ever did that because I thought it was the right thing to do at the time. And so, Masters of Albion is a redemption title for me. But also, it’s my last game. It just is.”</p><p>It makes sense, then, why Molyneux bills Masters of Albion as the nexus of every game he’s worked on, from Dungeon Keeper to Fable. “It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map,” says Molyneux in today’s announcement.&nbsp;</p><p>Masters of Albion will be available exclusively on PC via Steam.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/12/peter-molyneuxs-final-game-masters-of-albion-gets-april-release-date]]></content:encoded>

One continues to expand the layered and complex setting of Golarion. The other, <em>Pathfinder Impossible Magic</em>, introduces new and updated magic classes for its players.</p><p>In an official live stream, reported on by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/pathfinder-announces-two-new-rulebooks.717153/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, Paizo announced both <em>Pathfinder Impossible Magic</em> and the <em>Lost Omens: High Seas</em> supplements for <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em>.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The first book is a new supplement of player options. According to its store page listing, the book contains new magical options, ranging from new cantrips to reality-bending spells. Among those options are four new dedicated spellcasting classes: Magus, Necromancer, Runesmith, and Summoner.</p><p>These classes are important since three out of the four are updates from <em>Pathfinder First Edition</em>. The Runesmith can transcribe and apply magical runes and glyphs. The Summoner can summon creatures to do their bidding. The Magus is a classic GISH; a combination of strong spellcasting and martial prowess. With this new supplement, players can see how these classes work in the latest edition of the game.</p><p>In addition, <em>Pathfinder Impossible Magic</em> introduces over 200 new spells to the game, new character archetypes, and new schools of magic derived from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-lost-omens-impossible-lands-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Impossible Lands</a>. If you are attending GenCon this year, you can pick up a copy of this book for yourself. The store page listing has it priced at an MSRP of $29.99.</p><p>The other supplement, <em>Lost Omens: High Seas,</em> is a continuation of Paizo's in-depth setting books in the vein of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-returns-to-tian-xia-this-october" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Tian Xia</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-lost-omens-highhelm-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Highhelm</a>. As the name suggests, the book will cover the open waters of the Inner Sea. This will include the failed utopian island of Hermea, Mediogati Island, the mysterious Mordant Spire, the pirate-scoured isles of the Shackles, and the dangerous underwater depths.</p><p>The <em>Lost Omens: High Seas</em> supplement releases in July. The store page price listed is an MSRP of $44.99.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>2025 was an odd year for me and my "best of" list. Many of the titles I thought would be absolute locks for this--like <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, <em>Civilization VII</em> and <em>Endless Legend 2</em>--ended up getting nowhere near it!</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions/"><u><em>Battlefield 6's</em> campaign was a disaster</u></a>, and I wasn't able to play the multiplayer at all thanks to a bug where the game told me my GPU wasn't physically connected (it, uh, was), so it's been a total write-off.<a href="https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5/"> <u><em>EU V </em>was fine, but as I said at the time</u></a>, it's so ambitious, and needs so much more tweaking, that it feels like a game I won't sit down with properly for another year or two.<a href="https://aftermath.site/endless-legend-2-review-impressions-early-access/"> <u><em>Endless Legend 2</em> was just a good old-fashioned disappointment</u></a>, and<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review/"> <u><em>Civ VII</em>, whew, man</u></a>.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024/"><div><p>Luke’s Favourite Video Games Of 2024 - Aftermath</p><p>From archaeologists to Barnsworth, it was a good year</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>I know it's weird to lead a list of my games of the year by talking about games that weren't on it, but those disappointments defined my 2025 in a way, and seem to be mirroring many of the various crises the wider games industry itself has faced in 2025. Namely AAA bloat and strategic mismanagement leading to dependable sequels losing their way,<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-7-civ-vii-layoffs-firaxis-2k-take-two/"> <u>before the resulting layoffs</u></a> threaten to simply make everything even worse.</p><p>In a way, then, putting this list together felt like a slight bummer; I'd come into 2025 <em>really </em>excited for a bunch of seemingly dependable heavy-hitters, all of which ended up letting me down. Thankfully, <em>Civ VII</em> sucking simply freed up more time to play other stuff, like all the games on this list, most of which I'd never even heard of until I sat down with them, but all of which ruled on their own merits, and my year was better for having played them.</p><h3 id="flotsam">FLOTSAM</h3><figure></figure><p>A survival city-builder in broadly the same vein as stuff like <em>Frostpunk </em>and <em>Ixion</em>, Flotsam is a game set at the end of the world that, thanks to its vibrant art style and optimistic outlook, actually feels more like the start of a new world instead. </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/flotsam-impressions-review-city-builder/"><div><p>Flotsam Builds Some Hope At World’s End</p><p>The end of the old world is a chance for a new one</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><h3 id="tavern-keeper">TAVERN KEEPER</h3><figure></figure><p>It's always fun running a pub, pubs are inherently great, but running a pub that's truly&nbsp;<em>yours</em>, right down to the designs on the cushions and the placement of the silverware, is even better.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/tavern-keeper-review-impressions-pc-game/"><div><p>Tavern Keeper: It’s Good</p><p>“But the only brew for the brave and true...comes from the [Redacted]!”</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><h3 id="town-to-city">TOWN TO CITY</h3><figure></figure><p>It gives me the systems of a city-builder but the elegance of a town-painter, the challenge of juggling morale but letting you cheese your way to improving it by drowning your residents in dogs and fancy clothing stores. It's given me everything I love from this genre and tossed out everything I don't, then played some wonderfully soothing accordion music over the top, just for good measure.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/town-to-city-pc-builder-cozy-impressions-review/"><div><p>I’ve Been Playing Town To City From Dawn To Dusk - Aftermath</p><p>*Accordion plays*</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><h3 id="the-king-is-watching">THE KING IS WATCHING</h3><figure></figure><p>Every game has this wonderful tension to it, where I always feel like I'm doing well enough to survive, but never like I've&nbsp;<em>perfected&nbsp;</em>my build, a constant pull between doing well enough to progress but always feeling like I could do, and learn,&nbsp;<em>more</em>.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/the-king-is-watching-pc-steam-review-impressions/"><div><p>The King Is Watching: It’s A Very Good Video Game - Aftermath</p><p>‘There’s no wrong way to play this!

            <title><![CDATA[A Steam Sale’s Background Art Was Filled With Hidden Free Game Codes]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>At any given point in time, there are at least two or three different sales happening on Steam. Most of them include some background art that you aren’t really meant to notice. But Team 17’s new sale did something I’ve not seen before. It hid free game codes in the sale artwork for those observant enough to spot them.</p> <p>On January 12, <a href="https://go.bsky.app/redirect?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbuff.ly%2Fxu8nST3">Team 17 launched its big Hidden Treasures Sale on Steam</a>, featuring discounts on over 50 different games, ranging from recent hits like <em>Dredge</em> to older titles like <em>Golf With Friends</em> and<em> Worms Reloaded</em>. There’s some great stuff on sale from today until January 19.</p>

 <p>But the best deals were hidden in plain sight. Over on the Hidden Treasures Steam event page, you can spot a pirate-themed background filled with gold and treasure. If you scroll down and look past the game deals, <a href="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/32941731/c454af314fa3cb448a7a4012aa50e6bf78b8c507.png">you’ll spot faint writing on what looks like parchment paper</a>. And it’s buried in these words that you’ll also notice some alphanumeric codes, which are in fact keys for different Team 17 games.</p>

 <p>Shortly after the sale went live, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mcamwhbmpq2g">this neat detail was shared by deals guru Wario64 on social media</a>, but even by then, it seems like most of it not all of the codes had already been redeemed. And at this point, it seems all but certain that every code has been grabbed and used.</p>

 <p>Even if you didn’t get a free game, you can still take advantage of the sale. Here are some of the best deals I spotted in the Team 17 Steam sale. These offers may not be as good as free, but they still beat paying full price.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><em>Dredge</em> – $20 ($40)</li> <li><em>Heavenly Bodies</em> – $9 ($25)</li> <li><em>Hell Let Loose</em> – $21 ($60)</li> <li><em>Golf With Friends</em> – $1.50 ($15)</li> <li><em>Killer Frequency</em> – $5 ($25)</li> <li><em>Moving Out</em> – $2.50 ($25)</li> <li><em>Conscript: Director’s Cut</em> – $8 ($24)</li> <li><em>The Escapists 2</em> – $4 ($27)</li> <li><em>Overcooked 2</em> – $1.70 ($17)</li> <li><em>Sworn</em> – $20 ($40)</li> </ul> <p>If you were one of the lucky ones to snag a code, let us know in the comments below and tell us what game you got!</p>
