            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-accessibility-options<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and BioWare have revealed some of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s accessibility options ahead of the game's launch at the end of this month, and the list seems pretty exhaustive.</p>
<p>The accessibility list is part of a series of deep dives detailing everything about&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>, from combat to companions and more, before it arrives. EA says the goal with accessibility in&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is to ensure that everyone can enjoy the game "regardless of skill level or ability".</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>will offer five preset difficulty levels, running the gamut from the relaxed Storyteller mode through to the intense-sounding Nightmare. An Unbound option will also allow you to customize individual difficulty elements like parry timing, enemy aggression, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-accessibility-combat.jpg?itok=N0SIiGEI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-accessibility-combat.jpg?itok=vFYoxNoC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>will let you customize combat to your heart's content.</figcaption></figure><p>UI elements like your health bar, objective tracker, and minimap can be turned off, and you can also change the game's text size if you're struggling to read it.</p>
<p>If you suffer from motion sickness, you'll probably want to take advantage of the game's Persistent Dot option, which can help your brain to keep track of the action if it's moving too fast. You can also turn off motion blur entirely.</p>
<p>Additionally, you'll find interface elements accompanied by accessibility aids; you can, for instance, add audio cues for incoming attack indicators, as well as adding full-screen filters to help with vision deficiencies.</p>
<p>All in all,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s list of accessibility options seems rather comprehensive. You can see the full list of accessibility features the game will have <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/accessibility-spotlight" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>series of dark fantasy RPGs, which began with 2009's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>.</p>
<p>This latest installment is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer">a pretty far cry</a> from the CRPG-style gameplay of that first entry, though; it's closer in spirit to&nbsp;BioWare's&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>series, focusing as it does on set pieces, companion relationships, and fast-paced action combat rather than real-time-with-pause RPG-style engagements.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-age-the-veilguard/bsdx4fnnc0dk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 31st.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roblox is facing accusations that it lied to investors about the number of people who use the platform. In a report published on Tuesday, the <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">investment firm Hindenburg Research</a> claims Roblox is “consistently overstating the amount of people on its platform by 25 percent to 42 percent or more.”</p><p>Roblox, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic">which went public in 2021</a>, reported <a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2024/Roblox-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=non%2DGAAP%20guidance.-,Based%20on%20the%20carrying%20amount%20of%20deferred%20revenue%20and%20deferred,2024%20and%20an%20increase%20in">having 79.5 million</a> daily active users in its most recent earnings report. However, Hindenburg claims Roblox “intentionally conflates” actual people with daily users, as that number could also include alt accounts and bots. The research alleges that Roblox can separate alt accounts from single users, even though the company’s disclosure says daily active users “are not a measure of unique individuals accessing Roblox.”</p><div><p>Hindenburg is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/19/hindenburg-research-is-making-a-name-for-itself-by-taking-on-carl-ichan-gautam-adani-and-others.html">an activist short-selling firm</a> that infamously publishes research when it says it’s identified something shady about a business, allowing it to make a profit as its share value declines. One example is from 2020, when Hindenburg <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436126/nikola-fraud-allegation-hindenburg-short-seller-electric-truck">accused the EV startup Nikola</a> of fraud. Subsequently, an investigation by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848108/nikola-settlement-sec-fraud-trevor-milton-investors">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> resulted in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/18/24006571/nikola-trevor-milton-sentence-prison-fraud-electric-truck">four-year prison sentence</a> for its founder, Trevor Milton.</p></div><p>The firm also claims Roblox isn’t doing enough to protect children on the platform, alleging its “in-game research revealed an X-rated pedophile hellscape, exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech.” Roblox <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/short-seller-hindenburg-says-roblox-inflates-user-metrics-compromises-child-safety-92c77b5e?st=ktia3b&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">shares dipped</a> following the release of the report.</p><p>Last week, a financial newsletter also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262033/roblox-the-bear-cave-child-abuse">accused Roblox of enabling child abuse</a>. At the time, Roblox spokesperson Eric Porterfield denied claims that child endangerment is a widespread issue on the platform, saying it frequently updates its safety practices to “catch and prevent malicious activity.”</p><p><em>The Verge</em> reached out to Roblox with a request for comment about Hindenburg’s report but didn’t immediately hear back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Like the previous games, it allowed players to create their own levels and mini-games and then share them online with others. <em>LBP3 </em>also supported all previous <em>Little Big Planet</em> user-created levels and DLC which, along with the expanded creator tools, made it the biggest and best game in the series. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/littlebigplanet-3-ps4-servers-sony-playstation-1851423658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/littlebigplanet-3-ps4-servers-sony-playstation-1851423658">However, in April 2024</a></span>, Sony confirmed that<em> LBP3</em>'s servers would remain permanently offline after they went down due to technical issues, essentially erasing thousands of player-created levels.

Thank you for your continued support and understanding.”</p><p>Three weeks’ notice is not much warning.

Not only is this a poor way to treat customers, but it also makes it hard to preserve video game history. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Coffee Stain and developer Box Dragon have unveiled a new roguelike deck builder called As We Descend. The reveal took place during Coffee Stain’s “The Spill” showcase event on Tuesday.</p>



<p>“As We Descend takes a strategic twist to the beloved deckbuilding roguelike genre,” the studio said. “Recruit units for your expeditions, navigate political treachery, enlist allies across the city, and take on incomprehensible foes.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="As We Descent - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4yLbne3m3aA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The first game from Box Dragon, As We Descend features turn-based combat as well as card crafting. There is also relationship building for players which will impact the characters met in a “desperate city which evolves and crumbles in unique ways based on the player’s decisions”.</p>



<p>The game’s director, Kevin Chang, said during The Spill described it as a strategy sandbox based on the decisions players are allowed to make while they play. He also hinted the game has a Dark Souls-like difficulty where it will provide a fair challenge for players.</p>



<p>The game doesn’t have a release date just yet. However, there is a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/">available on Steam</a> to give players a first look at what they can expect on a full release.</p>

Paradox's overarching message? It's sticking to what it's good at, and what it's good at is strategy games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"It is not in our strategic direction to make this kind of game," Lilja told PC Gamer. "So if Bloodlines 2, God willing, is successful, Bloodlines 3 [will be] done by someone else, on the license from us. I would say it's the sort of strategic way this would work. So it's still an outlier from what we're supposed to do, we don't know that stuff, so we should probably let other people do it."</p><p>In short, Lilja considers Bloodlines a "dead end" for the company regardless of how well it does, which is made more awkward by the fact that Paradox Interactive owns Vampire: The Masquerade creator White Wolf Publishing. Lilja didn't talk about Paradox's plans for White Wolf, but it seems as if any future Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines RPGs will be licensed out to other developers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So if Bloodlines 2, God willing, is successful, Bloodlines 3 [will be] done by someone else, on the license from us</p></div><p>"I think some studios do strategic investments, long term things, because they feel that the cost of not doing it is too high. But, I mean, I think it's fairly clear, at least to me, and I think to you, even in the best of cases, Bloodlines does not have a super long shelf life. That's not the way these games behave. You have an influx of players, there's a bit of word of mouth, and they have a high peak, and then they trail off. And it's not the type of gameplay that develops over time that much. So I think that's part of why these types of games are not really that attractive to us."</p><p>Lilja's comments come amid the still-ongoing development of Bloodlines 2, which was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/22/bloodlines-2-announced">announced back in 2019 as a faithful successor to the original game</a> by Troika Games — considered one of the greatest RPGs ever made. The original development was handled by Hardsuit Labs, but numerous delays and other problems led to its near cancellation before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-with-a-new-developer-and-release-window">Paradox handed development to The Chinese Room </a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"If we hadn't found The Chinese Room," deputy CEO Mattias Lilja said, "and seen what they'd done with the early work, [cancellation] would have been the next logical step, because we could not continue as we did."</p><p>The Chinese Room is taking what looks like a very different direction from Hardsuit Labs, boiling it down into more of a straightforward action RPG. Fans have posted various comparisons between the two online, noting the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gameplay-reveals-bloodthirsty-combat">differences between the melee combat</a> among other things.</p><p>"Generally, it's a continuation of the same vision but they had to make it theirs," Lilja told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/paradox-on-bloodlines-2-we-had-a-game-we-could-do-but-maybe-not-with-the-team-we-had" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GI.biz</a> in a separate interview. "When a game has been going this long with a sizable team in Seattle for a number of years before we moved it... It might have commercial  challenges, but we liked the direction."</p><p>Lilja says that Paradox is targeting a first half of 2025 release for Bloodlines 2, and that development is currently on track after its suffered yet another delay in August. </p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Previously, the company already disclosed drop rates for different item rarities, but not to this level of detail. Respawn confirmed that no drop rates are changing at this time – it’s simply providing more detailed information about what the rates are. You can see the full breakdown of drop rates in the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/frequently-asked-questions#q3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Apex Legends FAQ</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The change is specifically occurring in response to an amendment to the Korean Game Industry Promotion Act that took effect earlier this year, which mandates that companies disclose certain information about loot box odds. However, Respawn will also be publishing the rates globally.</p><p>The actual published rates, Respawn notes, come with an important asterisk. The developer is publishing the lowest minimum drop rates for each item, but due to duplicate protection, the actual drop rates for individual items will be higher depending on how many other items of the same type from loot boxes players have obtained.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-began-as-a-concept-called-like-a-dragon-tuna-where-kiryu-was-a-fighting-fisherman<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>, the next game from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, was originally a concept called Like a Dragon: Tuna where original protagonist Kiryu Kazuma was a fighting fisherman.</p><p>RGG Studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama revealed the origins in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/08/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> post discussing Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii ahead of its February 28 release date. The game stars the fan favorite Majima Goro as he wakes up on a beach with no memory and, in a sea-faring alternative to his yakuza roots, becomes a pirate.</p><p>It wasn't originally going to star Majima at all, however. "For quite some time, I wanted to make a game called Like a Dragon: Tuna, where Kiryu Kazuma, as a tuna fisherman, sets off to sea to fight against fishing boats," Yokoyama said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/08/shark-1728399164136.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kiryu has a long and complicated relationship with the ocean.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Long story short, it never came to fruition, but keywords like 'ship,' 'sea,' and 'fighting,' which had since then been engraved in my head, evolved into the concept of pirates."</p><p>Kiryu has had plenty of fishy experience over the years through the myriad fishing minigames sprinkled throughout the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series. He's also resorted to beating the rowdier ones up with his fists, like in the shark boss fight from Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth that's practically the end of Jaws.</p><p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a spin-off to Infinite Wealth, the eighth mainline entry in the Yakuza series (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review">or ninth including Yakuza 0</a>). <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-renamed-like-a-dragon-in-the-west-explained-why">The series underwent a name change from Yakuza to Like a Dragon</a> upon its release, made more confusing by the seventh game being called Yakuza: Like a Dragon and starring new protagonist Ichiban Kasuga.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Yakuza Games In (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii grew into its own thing during the development of the latest game, however. "Around June or July 2023, long before the release of Infinite Wealth, the dev team was already mulling over the idea of an Infinite Wealth spin-off," Yokoyama said.</p><p>"Even if we were to make Like a Dragon 9, we knew that wouldn’t be enough to capture and tell the story. During the end of the Infinite Wealth development, we began percolating the idea of a spin-off that stars characters who are not Ichiban Kasuga. It was almost as if we were creating a blown-up sub-story for Infinite Wealth."</p><p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii was revealed in September as a half Yakuza, half Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag-looking entry. A lengthy reveal trailer showed Majima washed up on the beach of Rich Island, near Hawaii, looking worse for wear and helped by a child with a pet tiger (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-features-ichiban-actor-in-bizarre-role">who is bizarrely played by Ichiban voice actor Nakaya Kazuhiro</a>).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This will be the first time in a while Yakuza fans have had to wait an entire year for a new release, with Infinite Wealth having arrived in January and Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii not launching until February. While this is fairly normal for most game franchises, RGG Studio is known for its rapid release schedule.</p><p>In the last five years, for example, it has released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgment Remastered, Lost Judgment, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5. That's 12 games in total.</p><p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will therefore add to that list, but the next mainline game (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-fans-buzz-as-sega-trademarks-yakuza-wars">and a mysterious trademark called Yakuza Wars</a>) are yet to be revealed. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-the-first-preview">In our first preview of the incoming entry</a>, IGN said: "Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is ship-shaping up to be a seaworthy spin-off with a fin-favorite at its helm."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Neither Sony nor Sony Santa Monica have announced the game's PS5 Pro support yet, and there’s no detail on what it will involve, but of course the hope is Ragnarok's resolution will be boosted while maintaining 60 frames per second.</p><p>God of War Ragnarok joins the likes of Blizzard’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-first-microsoft-game-confirmed-to-be-getting-a-ps5-pro-enhanced-update">Diablo 4</a> in a list of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/even-more-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-confirmed-via-playstation-store"><u>over 60 games with confirmed PS5 Pro Enhanced</u></a> updates, according to eagle-eyed fans who’ve been keeping an eye on the PlayStation Store (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro"><u>IGN has a list of all the PS5 Pro Enhanced games so far</u></a>).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><p>PS5 Pro has an AI-powered upscaling feature called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) that can automatically improve the image clarity of games, but PS5 Pro Enhanced games take particular advantage of the beefier console’s features.</p><p>At a recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-biggest-improvements-spider-man-2-last-of-us-hogwarts-horizon"><u>PS5 Pro preview event</u></a>, we spoke with the technical leads of some of PlayStation’s biggest games, including Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 and The Last of Us Part 2, to discuss the improvements we can expect to see now there’s a more powerful PS5 on the market.</p><p>In an interview with IGN, Saber Interactive Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-will-hopefully-automatically-make-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-performance-mode-look-better-than-quality-mode-does-now-dev-says"><u>he’s hopeful the PS5 Pro will improve Space Marine 2 by default via PSSR</u></a>, but did not confirm a PS5 Pro Enhanced patch. PS5 Pro itself launches November 7.</p><p>Just days after God of War Ragnarok launched on PC to a ‘mixed’ Steam user review rating <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnark-launches-to-mixed-steam-user-reviews-with-most-complaining-about-the-playstation-network-account-requirement"><u>over its forced PlayStation Network account linking</u></a>, a mod was released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-mod-removes-controversial-psn-requirement-and-its-creator-has-vowed-to-maintain-it">that bypassed the requirement entirely</a>.

Sony has said this will soon to be added to the console version, but we don't have a release date yet. Perhaps it will arrive alongside the PS5 Pro Enhanced update.</p><p>Though God of War Ragnarok met with critical and commercial acclaim, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-reaches-11-million-units-sold-milestone">selling a whopping 11 million copies in less than three months on sale</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">earning a 10/10 in IGN's review</a>, one gripe players had was with the companions throwing out puzzle solutions before players had a chance to solve them.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

As We Descend is an upcoming roguelike deckbuilding game that incorporates elements from strategy games.</p><p dir="ltr">In As We Descend, you play as a senior member of a city, directing your home's forces to fix failing technology, venture into monster-infested areas to find resources, and mount defenses for approaching threats. Your actions--both navigating the city and fighting in turn-based combat encounters--are dictated by the cards you've collected and upgraded in your deck, injecting a sense of curated randomness into each attempt to protect the city. You must find a way to protect the city as it slowly descends into the planet, uncovering secrets to this post-apocalyptic world. Each failed run sees you start over in the city centuries later, attempting to build upon whatever systems were left behind by the previous civilization embodying the city.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380275-ss_99a0dc87d02e7852aa58235dce0dc4527f6e7212.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380275" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380275-ss_99a0dc87d02e7852aa58235dce0dc4527f6e7212.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380275"></a><figcaption>As you descend further, you'll build your ideal deck.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380275-ss_99a0dc87d02e7852aa58235dce0dc4527f6e7212.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Ahead of the launch of the demo for As We Descend, I got a chance to play the roguelike game and simultaneously interview game director Kevin Chang. As I marveled at the game's incredible art direction and storytelling hooks and laughed with malicious glee at combining the right order of cards to demolish the dangerous-looking demonic forces attempting to breach the city's walls, our conversation touched on Chang's background in tabletop gaming design, how As We Descend captures the exciting opening hours of a Civilization game, and how the narrative elements of the game almost didn't happen.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Did you come into this project wanting to make a tabletop-inspired game and then you adopted roguelike elements, or was the plan to make a roguelike and the systems of a tabletop game snuck in later?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Chang</strong>: It's always going to be a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation but I do feel like I did approach wanting this to just be a really good roguelike game. Actually, you won't believe where it started--it was a 4X roguelike deckbuilder. So it was very siege-like--non-violent--and I tried so many wild ideas. I even have an old build of the game. I'll show you sometime. It's in a little command prompt and we added mouse-and-keyboard support to it, and there's a little hex grid that you get to just play on. It's the funniest thing. It looks like Dwarf Fortress.</p><p dir="ltr">...It did just keep moving closer to tabletop unintentionally. Early on we were like, 'Okay, it's going to make it super strategic, going to make it really replayable,' and then people kept wanting more conflict, more hype, more [excitement]. I think a big part of that was of course we found our art director, [Aleks Nikonov]. He used to work at Riot Games as a senior concept artist for both their sort of environmental design and also their characters once we hired him. So [tech director] Karl [Bergström] and I co-founded the studio together. We used to work at Stunlock Studios. This was back in 2020.</p><p dir="ltr">We found Aleks, I want to say in the summer of 2020, and when we hired him, we went, 'Wow, we can actually make sure the game looks amazing now,' because, between Karl and myself, we can make a very fun game. I'm a game designer and Karl's a programmer. We can land a good game, but can we make it look amazing? No. [But now] we've got Alex, and we're like, 'Okay, we can make it look amazing.' So we leaned more into it--I would say that is probably the biggest impetus for change. I don't think it was even a tabletop or roguelike thing. It was more like, 'What is the potential of the studio and sort of the team potential?' and we wanted to just lean into it more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380277-ss_f5491a0e539fe3b8a571b0f070cf34db77923d1b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380277-ss_f5491a0e539fe3b8a571b0f070cf34db77923d1b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380277"></a><figcaption>Each unit archetype features different weapons and decks, so you can curate several different combat decks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380277-ss_f5491a0e539fe3b8a571b0f070cf34db77923d1b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>So to focus a bit more on that change in direction, why opt for the cyclical nature of a roguelike to tell a story? Neither tabletop campaigns nor strategy games tend to lean into cyclical stories, even if mechanically they can be sometimes.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The problem [in strategy games like Civilization] is the sort of late game--in Civ I might pass turn 200, 300, maybe even 400 depending on the run. You just have so many units, so many cities, and the decisions you make aren't that impactful anymore. You have to move a bunch of troops. There's so much logistics to do--which [does match] the feeling of controlling this massive unwieldy empire, but it's also a chore. [You spend] a lot of time doing very little, and that's the part we want you to fix [with As We Descend]. We're like, 'Okay, can we capture the magic of that first 45 minutes of [Berlin] game where you're making good decisions, you're choosing from a random tech tree where you are finding the best places to settle?'</p><p dir="ltr">...As We Descend is all about making choices and pivoting the whole time. We don't want that feeling to go away. So that's been there from the start. And I think the thing that has been more fleshed out over time [is] this idea about what the unlockables are in the game... I think nowadays people expect unlockables in roguelikes.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm a fan of both difficulty and, what I would call, side-grades or horizontal unlocks--anything that gives you more content to play with or more ways to enjoy the game. It's more sandbox-y, so it's not Rogue Legacy or something like that where the game gets easier for you the more you play. You get more ways to interface with [the game] as you play more. You get to customize it more, but the game doesn't necessarily get easier for you. In fact, if anything, maybe it gets harder actually as you learn more, you unlock more and [there are] more choices and more interesting decisions too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380279-ss_c1f900c1147fb302fc30b4bdbab67de5fcc1c9be.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380279-ss_c1f900c1147fb302fc30b4bdbab67de5fcc1c9be.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380279"></a><figcaption>As We Descend is pretty brutal so you'll lose units if you don't play strategically.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380279-ss_c1f900c1147fb302fc30b4bdbab67de5fcc1c9be.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>The narrative elements of As We Descend are probably my favorite part of the game--I like how they inform and characterize the city. And the skill checks for talking with people warms my little TTRPG-loving heart.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We've only had strong, narrative-driven characters for the past seven months I want to say, maybe eight months.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Wait, what?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah. Before that, it was a very, very impersonal city. I kept arguing with other people, being like, 'Hey, we have to include this. We have to put the lore text in. We have to make these characters good. We have to make you care about the characters here.' I kept impressing upon them the sort of urgency I felt of that mission because, without that intimacy of just caring about the city, [As We Descend] does become just yet another strategy game where you don't give a f***--the troops die and it's whatever, and there are no stakes there, but sure, let's pretend there are stakes, [and if] you lose the city and you die off, it's whatever. That's not the same as something like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/frostpunk-2/" data-ref-id="5000-536249">Frostpunk</a> or a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-577618">Hades</a> where you know the characters, you care about their stories and their journeys and that adds a lot more meaning to the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380280-ss_7f4a3b199974a1a96018394dddb3888c5941fb75.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380280" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380280-ss_7f4a3b199974a1a96018394dddb3888c5941fb75.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380280"></a><figcaption>You'll often be summoned to speak with important members of the city and make choices in how you interact with them.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380280-ss_7f4a3b199974a1a96018394dddb3888c5941fb75.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How do these fleshed-out characters inform the characterization of the protagonist? How far can a player stress the protagonist's morals in defense of the city?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I want [choices] to matter but not in a morality system way, which I think is a bit shallow... I think a good character to talk about is actually Geralt from The Witcher because he always makes Geralt-like decisions no matter what--the game only offers you Geralt-like decisions for all the pathways. They'll never give you a choice where he does something out of character. So I think it's going to actually be similar here where your character will never act completely out of character, but you will be able to choose within the framework you're given.</p><p dir="ltr">There are quite a few origin stories for your character. You come from one of the three great houses that inhabit the city, and you can choose what your origin is, what ally you start with, and there might be some additional sub-choices within that. But the goal is [to make you] always this person who is thrust into this position of power, being a warden of the wall. You are not actually the dictator that's at the top or the authoritarian [voice]. I think that's such an overdone thing in strategy games, but I also think it misses the topic a little. It doesn't let us introspect into this idea about being at the whims of something much greater than yourself--it plays into this fantasy of being like an authoritarian sandbox. You get to just dictate as you please, and I think [As We Descend] is not a game where you get [that fantasy]. There's so many other things that bind you in this game to your responsibility.</p><p dir="ltr">So within that framework, you'll get to make choices that matter, and I hope that when you play later versions of this game, that it really does feel like whatever you choose, you are giving yourself a character by the choices you make, but I don't want it to be in a character creation way or a, 'you get to define these things' [way]. It is not like we're doing a dating simulator or anything like that. You'll reflect who you are through your character's choices, and I want the story to be able to reflect as much of that as possible.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This interview was edited for both brevity and readability.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-report-pedophile-hellscape-lying-investors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A damning new report has emerged that accuses&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>and its creators Roblox Corporation of fostering an "X-rated pedophile hellscape" on the platform, as well as lying to investors about engagement and more.</p>
<p>The report comes courtesy of Hindenburg Research, and it's an incredibly comprehensive and lengthy document backed up by a huge amount of research, as well as conversations with former&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>data scientists and developers.</p>
<p>Some of its more shocking findings include discovering that&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>groups are "openly soliciting sexual favors and trading child pornography", and that users have "identified issues of simulated rape, naked users, and rampant in-game sexual harassment".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roblox-report-moderation-lying-racing.jpg?itok=XnKkf8gf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roblox-report-moderation-lying-racing.jpg?itok=6t9RZdQv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>games and experiences are innocuous, but Hindenburg Research's report shows that a huge number are not.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Hindenburg Research's report found that moderation was "largely outsourced to Asian call centers", and that moderators were "paid $12 a day to review countless instances of child grooming and bullying".</p>
<p>What's more, Hindenburg says moderators have a "limited ability to keep perpetrators off the platform permanently", suggesting perhaps that Roblox Corporation's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-financials-trust-safety-spending">decision to cut its trust and safety spending</a> earlier this year was not a particularly sound one.</p>
<p>As well as the horrifying details of what the company found during its time on&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>(of which there are many, many more in the full report), Hindenburg Research also says its data suggests Roblox Corporation could be lying to its investors and advertisers about its engagement and user numbers.</p>
<p>Roblox Corporation says its per-user-per-day engagement hour rate was around 2.4 hours in 2023, but Hindenburg's report says the studio "could be massively overstating" this number, and that its own research found users were spending just 22 minutes or so in&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>games per day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roblox-report-moderation-lying-monster.jpg?itok=HfeEmWwc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roblox-report-moderation-lying-monster.jpg?itok=iAc1SeB7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This monster may well be the least harrowing thing you'll see in&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>today.</figcaption></figure><p>One former&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>data scientist told Hindenburg Research that the platform's actual number of daily active users (DAUs) could be "like anywhere between 30 to 20 percent lower" than the number&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>itself states.</p>
<p>According to Hindenburg's research,&nbsp;Roblox Corporation effectively reports two different user numbers: one that includes users with multiple alternate accounts, which is for "internal business decisions", and one that discounts alts, which is for investors.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full report</a> is well worth a read; it's an exhaustively-researched look at just how much Roblox Corporation might be getting away with, and since safety concerns have been raised by other entities as well, including investigative YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">People Make Games</a>, much of it is likely to be accurate.</p>
<p>The report also appears to have caused&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>shares to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hindenburg-research-discloses-short-position-on-roblox-alleging-inflated-metrics/articleshow/114051997.cms?from=mdr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fall by almost 10%</a>, although stock prices tend to fluctuate so regularly that this might not be an indication of long-term damage. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

<p>It looks like Saudi Arabia wasn’t looking to increase its stake in Nintendo. Instead, the country, through its Savvy Games Group, has reduced its stake in the company.</p>



<p>On Monday, a report from Kyodo News claimed that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) was looking at increasing its shares in Nintendo. The outlet <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/10/71fd22ea510c-saudi-wealth-fund-eyes-raising-stakes-in-nintendo-other-game-firms.html?phrase=Nintendo&amp;words=Nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ultimately updated their story</a> to say they were looking at all Japanese gaming companies as opposed to just Nintendo. Now, 24 hours later, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/saudi-arabias-pif-cuts-stake-in-nintendo-after-report-said-it-was-considering-increase.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> has come out with a report stating the opposite.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-nintendo-shuts-down-another-popular-switch-emulator">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-shuts-down-another-popular-switch-emulator/">Nintendo Shuts Down Another Popular Switch Emulator</a></h6>



<p>According to CNBC, Saudi Arabia’s PIF has reduced its stake in Nintendo to 7.54% from 8.58%. The source is a Japanese regulatory filing from Tuesday.</p>



<p>At 7.54%, it remains one of the largest shareholders in Nintendo. It’s still higher than the original 5.01% it owned when it first bought in to the company in 2022.</p>



<p>What do you think of Saudi Arabia ultimately lowering their stake in Nintendo rather than increase it? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">Epic Games, the company behind Fortnite and Unreal Engine, just won a significant antitrust case against Google, meaning the Android mobile store must open up alongside other requirements. However, Google announced it's already appealing the order.</p><p dir="ltr">Google vice president of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland detailed why the company is fighting back against the ruling on <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Google blog</a>. For starters, Mulholland points out that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-declares-resounding-victory-over-epic-games-following-appeals-court-ruling/1100-6513515/" data-ref-id="1100-6513515">Epic already lost a similar case to Apple</a>, though <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/07/google-ordered-to-open-android-app-store-in-epic-games-case.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> notes that was decided by a judge--Google's case was decided by a jury. As such, Mulholland writes: "In contrast, the Apple decision, upheld on appeal, rightly found that Android and iOS compete in the same market. This is obvious to anyone who has bought a smartphone."</p><p dir="ltr">On top of this, Mulholland argues Google and Apple fight for app developers. The ruling puts a three-year ban on Google paying developers for exclusive apps, for instance, per CNBC. Last but not least, "Android is open and Google Play is not the only way to get apps," writes Mulholland. Google highlights that Fortnite is available on Android phones through the Samsung Galaxy store. Interestingly enough, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-is-suing-google-and-samsung-over-auto-blocker-feature/1100-6526808/" data-ref-id="1100-6526808">Epic Games is suing Samsung, and Google again, over an autoblocker feature</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Epic also revealed its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-plans-to-launch-second-free-games-program-this-time-for-mobile-devices/1100-6526869/" data-ref-id="1100-6526869">plans to launch a free games program for its mobile store</a>. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-calls-out-apple-for-arbitrary-rejection-of-its-new-app-store/1100-6524733/" data-ref-id="1100-6524733">Fortnite maker continues to fight with Apple</a>, though <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile/ios" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Epic Games Store mobile app is available on iOS in the European Union</a> now.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>'s expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4s-first-expansion-is-vessel-of-hatred-and-its-coming-late-2024">Vessel of Hatred</a> released earlier today, welcoming a record number of Steam players in the process.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are 45,231 Diablo 4 players on Steam, a record for Blizzard's hellish game on the platform. Earlier today, the all-time Steam player peak was sitting at 39,782, recorded four months ago.</p>
<p>Diablo 4 originally launched on consoles and for PC via Battle.net in June 2023, then popped up on Steam that October, by which point it had reached 12 million players total.</p>

<p>Despite these record-breaking numbers on Steam, Vessel of Hatred hasn't had the smoothest of debuts. Its launch had to be delayed by several hours due to "a small technical issue".</p>
<p>This has, unfortunately for Blizzard, seen a spate of negative reviews for the expansion. As I write, there are a total of 269 reviews for Vessel of Hatred on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3043530/Diablo_IV_Vessel_of_Hatred/#app_reviews_hash">Steam</a>. Of those, 69 are positive (nice), but the remaining 200 are negative.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there are still reports on social media of some lingering niggles, and Blizzard's Adam Fletcher recently acknowledged an issue in which players are randomly losing their access to Vessel of Hatred through their play sessions on consoles.</p>
<p>"We have identified the issue and have a fix in flight for testing. The plan is for this to be in our next hotfix," Fletcher wrotein a blog post titled <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/vessel-of-hatred-license-revokes/192700">Vessel of Hatred Licence Revokes</a>. "The workaround for now is to log out and back in or by swapping to a non Spiritborn character and then back again.</p>
<p>"Apologies for this but we are hoping to have a fix out for this soon!"</p>

<p>Hopefully, Blizzard will sort out those remaining kinks soon, and in time for our own Vessel of Hatred review. As a reminder, there was a setback with our code, so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Eurogamer's Vessel of Hatred review will be arriving on the site a little later than anticipated</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, Blizzard recently announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-first-microsoft-game-to-land-itself-a-ps5-pro-enhanced-label">Diablo 4 will be getting that shiny PS5 Pro Enhanced label</a> on the release of Sony's console. This all means Diablo 4 players with a PS5 Pro will be able to take full advantage of the console's improved features, such as advanced ray tracing and a GPU that enables up to 45 percent faster rendering, thanks to a free software update.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/littlebigplanet-3-and-all-littlebigplanet-dlc-being-delisted-on-halloween.1003761/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/littlebigplanet-3-plus-dlc-delisted-halloween<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Sumo Digital have announced that <i>LittleBigPlanet 3</i>, along with the entire currently-available range of&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>DLC, will no longer be available via the PlayStation Store starting later this month.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1843652568389480651" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>X (formerly Twitter) account,&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em>and the series DLC will be delisted from the store on October 31st. That's one way to scare&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>fans, I suppose.</p>
<p>Sony says that anyone who owns the game or its DLC will still be able to access those things after the delisting, so this isn't a complete removal. However, you won't be able to purchase the game or any of the DLC being delisted after that date.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/littlebigplanet-3-delisted-dlc.jpg?itok=apRFEsJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/littlebigplanet-3-delisted-dlc.jpg?itok=x0suQEyz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em>will be delisted from the PlayStation Store soon.</figcaption></figure><p>As Sony points out, its message is a "friendly reminder" that anyone who has yet to purchase&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em>or "any&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>DLC currently available for purchase" should do so before October 31st.</p>
<p>Of course, if you own a physical copy of the game, it's not just suddenly going to stop working, so you'll always be able to play it from the disc. However, it won't be available to buy digitally anymore.</p>
<p>Sony doesn't give a reason for the game being delisted, but it's possible that since much of&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet</em>'s DLC revolves around licensed IP such as <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>, those licenses have run out and Sony either won't or can't renew them.</p>
<p>Games are delisted from digital storefronts for a variety of reasons, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge">licensing</a> is just one of them; others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/postal-3-delisted-on-steam-due-to-drm-problems">DRM issues</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-rez-delists-paladins-switch-version-due-to-bad-performance">poor performance on certain platforms</a>, and a host of other potential causes.</p>

<p>The delisting of&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em>means that after October 31st, it will no longer be possible to buy and own a&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>game via a digital PlayStation storefront, which feels like a real blow for preservation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as long as it's possible to track down pre-owned physical copies of the game, you'll still be able to pick it up from somewhere, and you can still buy&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/littlebigplanet-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the PlayStation Store</a> for now, so if you have any inclination whatsoever to play it, I'd pick it up sooner rather than later.</p>

You’re probably already seeing all kinds of creepy creatures, from black cats to ghosts, in your everyday life, and why should video games be any different? Thank goodness they’re not, especially if you’re a <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>player. Square Enix’s MMO offers the Black Coeurl (a black cat) and Mama Automaton (basically a ghost) for players to acquire when joining in the scary festivities.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196452,195905" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h132699"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Obtain the Black Coeurl and Mama Automaton</strong></h2><p>The nice thing about these monstrous minions is that the method for obtaining both the Black Coeurl and Mama Automaton are the same.

That’s because ghosts are exactly 50 percent better than cats.</p><p>Once you have enough of the area’s currency, simply go to the main area of the park. At the front desk, there will be an attendant with the title “Gold Saucer Attendant ”. Speak to him and select the third option (“Prize Exchange III”), where you will see both of the critters available for purchase. Note that they will not show up in your Minion Guide automatically after you buy them—you will need to go into your inventory and “use” the newly acquired item before they are added to the list of available minions.</p><h2 id="h132700"><a id=""></a><strong>What is MGP and How Do I Get It?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="c0f9224f35688c0efd1523da7614d130" data-recommend-id="image://c0f9224f35688c0efd1523da7614d130" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cat menu and oh good grief this game looks a mess." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cat menu and oh good grief this game looks a mess." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0f9224f35688c0efd1523da7614d130" data-recommend-id="image://c0f9224f35688c0efd1523da7614d130" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cat menu and oh good grief this game looks a mess." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>MGP is obtained by participating in different activities around the Gold Saucer. The most lucrative method is to participate in GATEs which occur every 20 minutes at the 20, 40 and 60 minute marks. Depending on your performance, up to 4,000 MGP can be awarded during these events, so even if you do well, it will take completing a handful to get enough points to afford one of the minions, perhaps even both.</p><p>Another couple of easy options are buying Cactpot Tickets, of which there are two kinds. There is a small lottery—basically a scratcher—that can be purchased up to three times daily, and a jumbo lottery where you can purchase three tickets weekly with the winning numbers being drawn every Saturday. Since players can use MGP to purchase up to three tickets per drawing, this can be a simple and effective way to farm MGP with little effort on your part.</p><figure id="" data-id="330ea83db626fc42c994307243a7d0c9" data-recommend-id="image://330ea83db626fc42c994307243a7d0c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A visual migraine in gaming form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A visual migraine in gaming form." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="330ea83db626fc42c994307243a7d0c9" data-recommend-id="image://330ea83db626fc42c994307243a7d0c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A visual migraine in gaming form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It may seem counterintuitive to spend currency when you are trying to save up for a specific prize, but the great thing about the Cactpot lotteries is even if you don’t win the jackpot, you will receive a consolation prize, the amount received almost always being greater than what you spent on the actual ticket. Which is a terrible way to run a lottery. As an added bonus, the daily tickets are actually fairly easy to win, and if you are playing three times every day, you should have no problem getting a winning ticket several times a week—that’ll net you 10,000 MGP per win!</p><p>Decorating in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> is just as fun as in real life, so take advantage of this opportunity to get into the Halloween spirit. Or, if you are reading this too late, know that these prizes are available year round, so you can pick them up now, show your love of black cats and ghosts independently of the festivities, and be ready for when the ghoulies return next year.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tequila Works, the developer behind acclaimed puzzle game Rime and publisher of The Sexy Brutale, has laid off a number of staff as part of a studio restructure.</p>
<p>In addition, it has cancelled an unannounced game.</p>
<p>The studio made the announcement earlier today on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tequilaworks_with-deep-regret-we-must-inform-activity-7249379290159452160-vRKo/">LinkedIn</a>. "With deep regret, we must inform of the decision to cancel an unannounced game," it wrote. "This tough decision means we will be restructuring the studio to concentrate on the development of only one game. These changes will have an impact to a small number of roles at the studio.</p>

<p>"This is an incredibly difficult time, and our focus is to provide the support and guidance to those affected."</p>
<p>It's unclear exactly how many staff members are affected, or in which roles.</p>
<p>Tequila Works, based in Madrid, is best known as the developer of 2017's Rime, a beautiful puzzle game about a young boy lost on an island. That same year it co-developed and published The Sexy Brutale.</p>
<p>Since then, it released Stadia-exclusive Gylt in 2019, which made its way to consoles and PC shortly after that platform's shutdown.</p>
<p>Its most recent game was Song of Nunu: A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> Story, released under the Riot Forge label that shut down earlier this year.</p>
<p>Still, as the studio wrote in its post, it's now working on just one game, which can hopefully avoid the bad luck of recent releases.</p>
<p>Layoffs across the games industry in 2024 are now <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">estimated</a> to be at over 13,000.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">Microsoft laid off 650 staff</a>, in addition to 1900 earlier in 2024. Sony laid off 900 staff back in February, followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">220 staff at Bungie</a> in July.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/08/enotria-the-last-song-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Confession time: I have never played Dark Souls. Nor have I played any of its immediate kin. So, no Elden Ring, no Bloodborne, not even Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. My excuse is that, upon Dark Souls release, I was taking an enforced leave of absence from video games, so I missed all that initial buzz. And then, when I came back to the warm loving embrace of video gamedom, the thought of spending hours trying to beat just one boss kept me far away from the Souls-like phenomenon. How then, I wondered as Enotria: The Last Song booted up, would I get on with the latest entry in the bloated Souls-like genre?</p>
<p><iframe title="Enotria: The Last Song - Gamescom 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3IO29PB62fI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Enotria stands out from its many Souls-like siblings in two ways. The first is its colour pallet. The aesthetic of Enotria is resoundingly light and bright. The action takes place beneath glorious azure skies, amongst scores of golden, gleaming sunflowers, through white-washed villas, and across resplendent sandy beaches. It’s a far cry from the dark, dank, and gloomy look usually associated with the genre.</p>


<p>The second way Enotria emerges from the pack is with its setting of Italian mythology. Like all brilliant mythologies, Italian folklore is totally bonkers and completely inaccessible and incomprehensible to those not already immersed in it. I couldn’t make head nor tail of the story, nor did I understand what was occurring with the characters at any given point. But when the world you’ve created is this wonderfully over-the-top, you can’t help but be carried away by the wilful insanity of it all. What I can tell you is that it involved the stage, acting, singing, lots of masks, and very big hats.</p>


<p>In comparison to its look and world building, when it comes to gameplay, Enotria is more traditional. Your silent protagonist explores, fights bosses, gathers weapons and equipment, discovers save points, and dies. A lot. To a Souls-like newbie like me, it’s all a bit much. There are so many systems, so many intricacies, that developers Jyamma Games clearly didn’t know where to even begin with communicating it all to the player. The tutorial is a near-endless stream of pop-up text boxes explaining everything and anything. You can barely move for the first hour of the game without another very long lump of text telling you in excruciating detail about whatever it is you just tried to do. Clearly., it’s very much a case of tell, don’t show.</p>
<p>As such, it takes a long time for Enotria to get going and find its feet. But slowly – very very slowly – the systems start to reveal themselves. Rather than different player characters, you can equip and wear masks to power your avatar with new abilities and skills. You can generously switch between several of these masks on a whim, giving ample opportunity to change up your play and discover some impressively long attack combos in the process. It’s a revelation, providing the opportunity to wipe out even the most tenacious of bosses with a devastating and lengthy series of strikes. Elemental attacks are also unusually interesting. Rather than the usual fire or ice ho-hum, how about imbuing your foe with drunkenness? Now that’s much more fun.</p>

<p>Whilst you can equip hundreds of different weapons, the fact is that a handful will be your go-to choice; offering everything you need to progress. Dodging is the name of the game here, which works well enough, though the attacks themselves lack a sense of impact and contact to truly thrill a player. Combat feels exactly as you’d expect, which is, in this context, completely fine.</p>
<p>Enotria really lets itself down when it comes to the jank. Locking on to foes is fiddly and forced. While the game struggles with characters trying to fight each other on different height levels, it just doesn’t like it and refuses to play. It’s a real problem when your foes seem obsessed with finding themselves stranded on small boulders, totally confused. In fact, enemy AI is generally dumb, and that’s being generous. I encountered issues with controller inputs too, the game choosing to stack up moves and do them all in one go, rather than when I tapped the button. A good patch or seven will definitely be required to smooth out the overall experience.</p>
