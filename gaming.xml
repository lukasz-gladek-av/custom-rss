            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnaroks-pc-systems-requirements-are-here-and-youll-need-to-free-up-190gb<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
God of War Ragnarök is making the jump from PlayStation to PC on 19th September, and ahead of its arrival, Sony has shared PC system requirements - which, among other things, reveals players will need to free up 190GB of hard drive space to play.
</p>
<p>
As per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/08/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements-revealed/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the minimum hardware players will likely need to get Ragnarök running at 1080p with an average of 30fps at Low settings is a GTX 1060/RX 5500 XT, an Intel i5-4670K/Ryzen 3 1200, 8GB RAM, Windows 10, and the aforementioned 190GB SSD space.
</p>
<p>
Right at the other, considerably flashier end of the spectrum, it's recommended players hoping to hit an average of 60fps at 4K on Ultra settings have an RTX 4070 Ti/RX 7900 XT, an Intel i5-11600K/Ryzen 7 3700X, 16GB RAM, Windows 10, and, yes, a big ol' chunk of SSD space.

<p>
Sony also notes Ragnarök will support Nvidia DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.1, and Intel XeSS 1.3, as well as "frame generation for all technologies utilising that feature", on PC. Additionally, a PlayStation Network account - which Sony has been determined to foist on PC players since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">failed attempt with Helldivers 2</a> - is required to play.

<p>
But is God of War Ragnarök worth jettisoning 190GB of meticulously digitised 16th century erotica for? Chris Tapsell called it "gargantuan, excessive, and wonderfully absurd" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-glorious-excess-makes-a-triumphant-return">Recommended review</a>. "You will fight some big, ugly monsters," he wrote. "You'll stand silhouetted, jagged, cartoonishly angular in front of them. Finally, deep into this game, you will get a bit of the old Kratos back, a bit of PS2 excess will break free of its self-conscious cage."

But many players aren’t excited about any of that. Instead, they are hyped for the game’s Zombies mode, as the devs behind this entry, Treyarch, are the original studio behind Zombies in <em>Call of Duty</em> and a lot of folks were curious to see what the team has been working on. Turns out, it’s a lot of good stuff. </p><p>On August 8, after some teasing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Quest&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Quest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Treyarch offered a huge in-depth</a></span> look at its upcoming Zombies mode, including the new map “Terminus” as well as a host of new features and options. And a brand new trailer, too.</p><p>One of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1821564838277263844&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1821564838277263844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest new features</a></span> added to Treyarch’s round-based Zombies mode is the ability to take a break during solo runs and return to your game later. This will let players who might be getting tired or who need to eat something stop and save their progress, and come back to continue their run when they’re ready. </p><p>While some players worried that this would make it too easy to reach higher levels, others pointed out that it would still take a lot of skill, it’s just that now you can actually go to bed at 2 am instead of grinding away all night on a good run. </p><p>Another cool feature added to this year’s <em>CoD </em>Zombies mode is the ability for friends to jump into your co-op match while it’s in progress. Perhaps you’re playing with a friend but they have to leave, or their internet connection drops. Well, now you can invite another friend to hop in and help out without having to restart the run. (This is only available in co-op matches, so a solo player can’t hit round 100, take a break, and call in some friends to help later.) </p><p>Treyarch is also looking to get more people involved in completing main quests in this year’s Zombies mode. In the past, main quests have been really hard to pull off, often involving various steps that aren’t telegraphed or explained to the player. This time around, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Quest:~:text=While%20Treyarch%20is,new%20map%20launches.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Quest:~:text=While%20Treyarch%20is,new%20map%20launches." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Treyarch is going to offer a “guided” option</a></span> so that casual or new players will be able to see what to do next to complete a map’s main quest. </p><p>But don’t worry, the guided mode won’t be available right away. Instead, Treyarch says they will be added later, so the community can still hunt for how to complete the main quests and all of a map’s secrets. </p><p>There’s a lot more to be learned from Treyarch’s impressively long blog post about its Zombies mode, including changes to weapon upgrades, equipment, economy tweaks, and much more. A lot of the stuff in the blog goes over my head as I’ve not played Zombies since <em>Black Ops 3</em>, but I’ll admit that I’m more excited to check out <em>BLOPS6</em>'s undead action thanks to some of these smart changes that will make the game a bit easier and more casual-friendly. </p><p><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> launches on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 25. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-day-one-1851503214&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-day-one-1851503214">It arrives on Game Pass on day one</a></span>.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <em>HD-2D Remake</em>, in addition to new bosses, will seemingly let players walk in Ortega’s shoes a bit more and get a bigger sense of his backstory. </p><p>Alongside this tease, Square Enix also released a bunch of new in-development screenshots of the game, some of which show new scenes and others which offer a glimpse of how locations from the original version will look in the remake.

Surely the star-studded cast, which includes several Oscar winners (and Jack Black), would prompt a spark of creativity.

No one wore costumes, and the theater was solemnly silent, as if we were about to watch archival video of the deadliest WWII battle or found footage from 9/11. R-rated trailers aired before it, prompting me to question if this movie, directed by Roth (known for his gory, gross violence), was rated R (it’s not).<br></p><p>Before I have a chance to double-check the rating, Cate Blanchett’s voice echoes through the theater. “Long ago, our galaxy was ruled by an alien race,” she intones, sounding bizarrely flat for an incredibly talented actor who endeavored to deliver a fun, frenetic performance in another superficial flick: 2017’s <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>. I’m immediately assaulted by aggressive, slap-dash cuts and shimmery CGI images of guns, neon signs, and Psychos, as Blanchett (who plays Lilith, a character who inspired early-twenties me so much I got one of her quotes tattooed) gives us the plot overview with as much energy as a ‘50s housewife who regularly mixes mood stabilizers and martinis.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="078977febfce0ed44d4951b119d8b604" data-recommend-id="image://078977febfce0ed44d4951b119d8b604" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lilith, Tiny Tina, Claptrap, Krieg, and Roland sit in a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lilith, Tiny Tina, Claptrap, Krieg, and Roland sit in a car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate / 2K</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="078977febfce0ed44d4951b119d8b604" data-recommend-id="image://078977febfce0ed44d4951b119d8b604" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lilith, Tiny Tina, Claptrap, Krieg, and Roland sit in a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lilith tells us that the Eridians laid the foundation of this galaxy, then disappeared, leaving behind a secret vault hidden on the planet Pandora, inside of which are powerful relics of the long-lost civilization. “That sounds like some wacko B.S., huh?” Blanchett asks. I stifle a groan with a huge bite of my burger. Rather than giving moviegoers the free-wheeling wanderlust that the <em>Borderlands</em> games offer, the film is incredibly linear and straightforward: Lilith, a bounty hunter, is hired by the head of arms manufacturer Atlas Industries to track down his daughter Tiny Tina on the planet Pandora.<br></p><p>We’re introduced to almost all of the main cast rather quickly: Hart as Roland, Greenblatt as Tiny Tina, Florian Munteanu as a Psycho named Kreig. Roland breaks Tiny Tina out of some kind of facility by way of a fairly bland action sequence, during which he punches a guard and calls him a “fake Stormtrooper-ass bitch.” I guess that means <em>Star Wars </em>exists in the <em>Borderlands </em>universe? It doesn’t improve after this.<br></p><p>If you told me <em>Borderlands </em>used AI for its dialogue, I’d believe you without question. Nearly every line that’s uttered with the kind of fake peppiness I’d reserve for my elementary school cheer competitions is either a limp-dicked “edgy” joke that wouldn’t warrant a single Reddit upvote or a cliche phrase like “I’m too old for this shit” and “This has been a <em>really</em> long day.” I could count on one hand the lines that were thoroughly genuine—or at least not dripping with so much snark they were almost sticky. There is no humanity here, just humorless humans.<br></p><p>When a needle-drop of Muse’s “Supermassive Black Hole” bleeds into a scene in which it’s playing over the speakers in a Pandoran bar, I nearly slam my head onto the table. What are we doing here?</p><figure id="" data-id="4d491b942f4727b7b12ee16a71b2e243" data-recommend-id="image://4d491b942f4727b7b12ee16a71b2e243" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Roland, Tannis, Krieg, Tina, and Lilith look off-camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Roland, Tannis, Krieg, Tina, and Lilith look off-camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate / 2K</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d491b942f4727b7b12ee16a71b2e243" data-recommend-id="image://4d491b942f4727b7b12ee16a71b2e243" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Roland, Tannis, Krieg, Tina, and Lilith look off-camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h5461"><a id=""></a><strong>We need to talk about Tina</strong></h2><p>Blissfully, <em>Borderlands</em> isn’t that long of a movie, and the breakneck speed at which the film is paced means we meet Jamie Lee Curtis’ Tannis just before I need a pee break (I chugged a beer). Curtis plays her with a socially awkward twitchiness that I didn’t expect from the actor, and while it’s at least an attempt at imbuing the character with a personality, it is incredibly grating. But again, she tried—Blanchett is phoning it in, Hart has no business playing the straight man, and Greenblatt is doing the best she can with material that’s based on a white character doing a blaccent (which the film, thankfully, avoids). But even she can’t save a line read that requires her to say “badonkadonk” in the year of our lord 2024.<br></p><p>And also, not to be ageist, but why the fuck is everyone so <em>old</em>? Lilith is 22 years old in the original <em>Borderlands</em> game and Tannis is in her thirties—aside from the star power afforded by casting Blanchett and Curtis, the only reason for aging up these characters is so they can play matronly figures to Greenblatt’s Tina.<br></p><p>And therein lies the main problem: centering Tina. The plot revolves around her believing she is the child of Eridia and the key to opening the vault, and the film hinges all of the emotional weight on a character who wears a bunny-ear headband and throws explosive teddy bears at people while spewing one-liners like a sugar-crazed 11-year-old in a <em>Fortnite </em>lobby. She does not inspire any sort of empathy, even with Greenblatt’s valiant efforts and Blanchett’s only <em>real</em> acting taking place in their scenes together. It’s like making a <em>Gears of War </em>movie with a Carmine brother at the center—it’s going to be annoying from the jump.<br></p><p>All of this takes place in a weird CGI world that occasionally looks decent but is more often an illegible green-screen mess of explosions or muddy, dark, murky nonsense. Lilith’s flame-orange hair and comic book costume set against a dusty, bland landscape and broken-down industrial buildings is visually and tonally jarring—it’s like the filmmakers got halfway to making a movie inspired by the cel-shaded world of <em>Borderlands</em> and then dumped it all onto the sets used for the <em>Halo</em> series. Speaking of costumes, I’d love to know what the budget was for push-up bras. Tannis, Mad Moxxi, and Lilith all have their breasts pushed up so high they’re nearly in their throats—it is so desperately 2006, so reminiscent of the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, that I couldn’t help but giggle. Boobs, am I right?<br></p><p>By the time the film ends and Jack Black’s Claptrap pops up on screen during the credits to lament the loss of his Easter egg, I am ready to go home and cleanse my palate. I need some proper aughts trashiness, some expensive needle drops, and some questionable costumes. I get home, plop down on the couch, and turn on <em>Gossip Girl</em>. At least this has personality.</p><hr><p>The <em>Borderlands</em> movie isn’t so good it’s surprising, and it’s not so bad it’s worth a hate-watch. It is simply sad. It feels like the result of a bunch of suits who sat around a glossy mahogany table (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x01l_jMhjVM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x01l_jMhjVM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like in that one <em>Key and Peele</em> sketch</a></span>) and reminisced about the early aughts, a time before the financial crisis, a time when the term “cancel” was reserved only for television shows, a time when Muse was one of the biggest rock bands on the planet.<br></p><p>It is devoid of humanity and personality, despite trying very, very hard to establish that it is quirky.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-op-6-zombies-details-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Call of Duty’s latest blog post provides a barrage of Intel for the Black Ops 6 Zombies game mode. The upcoming title will feature the return round-based Zombie action, and the maps available at launch include Terminus and Liberty Falls.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-round-based-gameplay">Round Based Gameplay</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Zombies aims to provide the “most rewarding Round-Based experience Treyarch has ever made.” The round-based zombie maps will require players and their teammates to escape from a maximum-security prison surrounded by hordes of the Undead. The prison is situated on Terminus Island, and players will manage two main currencies in this mode: Essence and Salvage.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-essence-and-salvage">Essence and Salvage</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6’ round-based Zombies game mode will include additional routes which allow players to access previously blocked areas by unlocking doors or moving obstacles. To access these new paths, players will have to spend their Essence. To earn Essence, players will need to slay Zombies or find them in Dark Aether vials. Players can use Essence to purchase Perks, Ammo, Tactical Raft, upgrade armour and more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Salvage, on the other hand, has to be acquired by rummaging through piles of junk that are highlighted by green outlines. Players can then use Salvage to access Ammo Mods, upgrade Rarity Tiers, and buy specific Tactical, Lethal and Support equipment through the Crafting Table.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-zombies-main-quests">Black Ops 6 Zombies Main Quests</h2>



<p>Players will find a main quest on each Black Ops 6 Zombies Map. These quests allow players to explore the area and investigate their surroundings. Their investigations could sometimes lead to nothing and, at times, to an audio log, document, or strange artefact. Additionally, players will find a bunch of Easter Eggs as they dive deeper into their investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Additionally, Black Ops 6 Zombies is receiving an all-new guided mode, which allows newer players to get a handle on things. The guidance mode will have round caps to maintain progression, and all side quests and Easter Eggs will be disabled to prioritise the narrative. The devs will release this game mode later in the season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of their investigation, players will have the option to exfiltrate from the Zombies Map by calling in the Raptor One at the landing sight and coming back with better intel about the location. For the first time, players will be able to save and Quit in a solo match. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>About to hit your personal high-round record? Need to get some sleep?</p><p>For the first time ever in Zombies, you can Save &amp; Quit in a Solo match. Even if you disconnect, simply pick up where you left off. <a href="https://t.co/lZNhbn3ysM">pic.twitter.com/lZNhbn3ysM</a></p></div>— Treyarch Studios (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1821564838277263844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-zombimovement">Black Ops 6 Zombimovement</h2>



<p>Players will also receive a 360-degree range of motion in Zombies mode. Through Black Ops 6’s Omnimovement feature, players can sprint, slide and dive in any direction. Omnimovement will introduce a new range of manoeuvres that weren’t available before, allowing you to get out of situations more strategically when things are getting sticky. Moreover, players can switch from first person to third person perspective for the first time.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Nintendo and Capcom are both officially at PAX WEST, a convention from August 30 through September 2 for the Labor Day weekend. PAX WEST takes place at the Seattle Convention Center, for those who want to attend.</p>
<p>Not only has Nintendo been officially confirmed for PAX WEST, but Capcom will be celebrating PAX's 20th birthday with the first North American hands-on demo for Monster Hunter Wilds. In addition to a hands-on demo of Monster Hunter Wilds, fans will also get to participate in a hands-on demo of the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, as well as the first North American hands-on for Street Fighter 6's new character, Terry Bogard.</p>
<p>In addition to Capcom's hands-on demos, avid Street Fighter 6 fans will be able to participate in a tournament in the PAX Arena.</p>
<p>PAX has seen many huge announcements throughout the years, with PAX EAST <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-dlc-2-the-rising-tide-to-be-unveiled-at-pax-east-panel/">showcasing the second DLC for Final Fantasy XVI.</a> There is the potential for some really big announcements at PAX WEST.</p>
<p>PAX WEST has a packed line-up of exhibitors, with Nintendo being the latest to join the crowd. Studios such as Larian Studios, Capcom, Atari, and Bandai Namco are some of the biggest to join the exhibitors, with smaller indie studios such as Aggro Crab Games, Finji, and Serenity Forge also showcasing their talents in the exhibitor's hall.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://west.paxsite.com/en-us/schedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official schedule for PAX WEST</a> has been uploaded to the website, revealing what attendees can expect throughout their days at the convention. This includes events such as learning how to play Dungeons and Dragons, Crash Bandicoot 4 speedruns, plenty of tabletop events, and the ability to get autographs and photos with well-known voice actors.</p>
<p>At the moment, we don't know what games Nintendo plans to showcase at PAX WEST, but it is possible that attendees will see more of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. The Nintendo World Championships event will also take place at 8 PM on the first day of the convention.</p>
<p>In addition to in-person events, there will also be plenty of live streams over the PAX Twitch channels, where people can catch special announcements, panels, and any of the PAX Arena tournaments. There are four channels for PAX, giving people who aren't attending plenty of information despite not being able to attend in person.</p>
<p>The full weekend ticket is $250, with day tickets at $66. However, tickets are running out. So, if you want to go to PAX WEST and see what Nintendo plans to showcase at the convention, make sure to snap up a ticket while you still can.</p>

Hidden in an out-of-bounds spot on the map is a heartfelt and emotional dedication to fans that you won’t want to miss—and you’ll be rewarded with some cool gear in the process. Here’s everything you need to know about finding the secret area in <em>Cat Quest III</em>.</p><h2 id="h0"><a id=""></a><strong>Where to find the secret area and obtain The Gentlebros gear</strong></h2><p>You can access the out-of-bounds secret area at any point in <em>Cat Quest III</em>, including the very beginning of the game. To do so, simply head to the very bottom left of the map and skim the boundary until you reach the number 4. Here, you should see a tiny gap left over in the boundary, which will allow your ship to pass through.</p><figure id="" data-id="b4ee8762ae618a2487ea1e32824136dd" data-recommend-id="image://b4ee8762ae618a2487ea1e32824136dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The gap in the map to the secret location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The gap in the map to the secret location." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b4ee8762ae618a2487ea1e32824136dd" data-recommend-id="image://b4ee8762ae618a2487ea1e32824136dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The gap in the map to the secret location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After passing through the gap in the boundary, follow the white trail in the water for a while until you reach a group of Gentlebros hanging out in the water. They’d like to share a speech with you, but they’ve lost the papers it’s written on. As such, they’ll request that you find the three pieces of paper.<br></p><p>The first piece of paper is just to the left of the group, while the second is directly above them. Finding the third and final piece, however, will require you to ride your ship west just out of sight of The Gentlebros.</p><p>When you’ve found all three pieces of paper, Gentlebro Desmond (named after The Gentlebros CEO, Desmond Wong) will share an emotional speech filled with appreciation from the team for both the time they’ve been granted to work on the series, as well as the support of their loving fanbase.</p><p>But a heartwarming speech isn’t all you’ll receive for finding this secret area. Right before leaving, The Gentlebros will give you two pieces of Gentlebros gear to wear (snazzy!). And as a final reward, Gentlebro Desmond will return and leave a chest behind. Inside, you’ll find The Architect, a strong, ranged weapon with unlimited ammo. Pawsome!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-zombies-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>First things first: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s Zombies is a return to the fan favorite round-based co-op mode of 1-4 players surviving wave after wave of zombies that escalates in challenge and difficulty each round. The story picks up after the events of 2020’s Black Ops Cold War and continues the Dark Aether storyline with a cast featuring the returning Weaver, Grey, and Carver – who have been imprisoned – along with the new character of Maya as playable in Zombies. Each has their own storylines. Also returning is former villain William Peck, who acts as your guide, along with Oskar Strauss and Raptor One in support roles. What I can say is that I enjoyed my time playing Zombies. Treyarch seems to have established a strong balance of community requested features, level design, and progression that is shaping up to satisfy veterans and newcomers to the franchise.</p><p>Zombies will feature two maps at launch: Liberty Falls, set in West Virginia, and Terminus, an island set in the Philippine Sea. Terminus was playable during my hands-on time, and developer Treyarch is calling this one the biggest maps they have ever made: it’s filled with side missions, random dynamic encounters, environmental traps, and plenty of experiences left to discover and explore as you battle the zombie horde. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Treyarch’s motto for Terminus is “anywhere you can see, you can go.” The map will also introduce new enemies like the Vermin and Parasites that, once the main host is killed, will mutate and evolve into a more deadly foe. Players will have access to a drivable vehicle with the Project Janus Tactical Raft that we used during our play session to explore a smaller island that was visible from the main coastline. </p><p>Black Ops 6 Zombies will also see the return of Global Progression, Classic Prestige, Weapon Customization, map-specific intel systems, and fan favorite GobbleGums, a single-use item which you can store up to three GobbleGums at a time that provides in-game effects and abilities.</p><p>Wonder Weapons also make a return, with the all-new BeamSmasher that uses sound frequency and light energy types for unique and spectacular damage results. Elemental damage types also have effects and abilities against enemies weak to that damage type, with a fun example being making an enemy teleport and reappear high in the air and fall at a high rate of speed. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, the Augment Upgrade System brings a customized experience by allowing players to unlock three major and three minor upgrades per each item for every perk, field upgrade, and ammo mod. You will be able to equip one major and minor upgrade at a time. Augments are permanent upgrades that you earn by simply playing Zombies and you’ll have the ability to focus your progression towards a specific augment of the hundred augments that will be available at launch by utilizing the Research feature available via create a class. Melee Macchiato Perk was a favorite during my playtime, and it provides a strong punch attack in close combat and Support Injection that for a limited time transforms you into a force of nature smashing through hordes of Zombies with ease.</p><p>Also available in create a class are Zombie Builds, which allows you to save your custom weapon builds and make them available in game via the mystery box. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A few other new quality-of-life features are coming to Black Ops 6 too: “Save and Quit”, Third-Person mode, and Guided Mode. Save and Quit is a new feature that provides a limited pause in solo games and for longer breaks, you can save your status and resume – but only one save slot will be available to prevent multiple checkpoints as you chase those higher rounds. For co-op games, Treyarch is adding a “join matches at any time” feature for drop in/drop out flexibility to allow friends to join games in progress and/or after a disconnect from a session. Third-Person mode is available for the first time in a Black Ops game and can be toggled on/off at any time. HUD options that allow you to remove health bars and damage numbers will be available, plus preset options with choices such as: standard, legacy, mini map and a streamer mode which would allow room for a face cam or overlay.</p><p>But the feature I am most excited to see for players new to Zombies is Guided Mode. I sat down with the development team at Treyarch to discuss Guided Mode and was surprised to hear that a very low percentage of players finish the main quest, so the team decided to implement a guided version that removes side missions and the round-based ticking clock in order to provide a more welcoming and curated experience. It’s all in an effort to get more people to try and complete the main story. Guided mode will not be available at launch, though, and for hardcore players there will be an incentive to complete the main quest before the new mode launches in the form of a calling card.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>After 45 minutes of hands-on time with Black Ops 6, I thoroughly enjoyed fighting my way through the Zombie horde on the island of Terminus. The map is, as Treyarch promised, huge with plenty to discover. In my limited time, using my pre-configured loadout and using the Mystery Box I was able to try out a variety of weapons including shotguns, SMGs and assault rifles. As always, all the weapons had their advantages and disadvantages, but overall they felt good to use – as did augment upgrades to various perks and field equipment such as scatter mines and the enhanced melee abilities when surrounded in close combat scenarios. The difficulty does ramp up and as you progress, I noticed I was being downed frequently by mobs of enemies surrounding me as we advanced into higher rounds (mutated parasites will be a problem if not taken down quickly) and I really needed to start using more strategy and communication with teammates versus simply running and gunning – as I expect most new players will be inclined to do on initial play sessions. </p><p>There are A LOT of features being packed into Zombies this year – from exploring the island of Terminus, utilizing the GobbleGums, taking advantage of the Augment upgrades, customizing my weapons in Zombie builds, to using the Wonder Weapons to take down hordes of enemies. And this doesn’t even include things I haven’t mentioned yet, like Global Onimovement or the second map of Liberty Falls, which Treyarch promises to share more about in the coming weeks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Black Ops 6 Zombies is shaping up to be one of the most fully fleshed out examples of the mode that Treyarch first introduced in Call of Duty: World at War 16 years ago, and I’m genuinely looking forward to playing more of it when Black Ops 6 drops this Fall. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Splitgate 2 - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"It's fast-paced, like the movement and adding that slide mechanic sort of makes a world of difference when it comes to being able to run and gun," Kassa said of the game's movement mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">The Splitgate 2 gameplay trailer also clears up some of the confusion regarding the game's factions, a new gameplay feature that was absent from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splitgate/">original Splitgate</a>. Splitgate 2 will feature three factions:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Aeros: This is the class for the movement-lovers. Players who join this faction gain increased agility, with quicker reloads and faster sprinting.</li><li dir="ltr">Meridian: The Meridian faction is effectively a support class, giving players who join it the ability to heal themselves and their allies. Members of the Meridian faction can also use a scan function to see enemies through walls.</li><li dir="ltr">Sabrask: This faction is more focused on defense, and is ideal for players who are either new to using portals, or simply don't wish to focus their gameplay around them. While not as mobile as the other factions, players who choose to join Sabrask will gain access to helpful defensive tools like a damage-blocking wall and sticky grenades.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The four-minute trailer marks the first time players have gotten an extended look at Splitgate 2's gameplay. Although the game doesn't yet have an official release date, 1047 Games has confirmed that Splitgate 2 will launch on console and PC sometime in 2025. But players still have plenty to do while they wait for the game to go live--1047 has <a href="https://onelink.to/sg2faction" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released a quiz</a> to help players decide which faction best suits their playstyle, and is hosting a livestream later this month to give players another look at how the game plays. Portal fanatics can catch the stream on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Splitgate" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Splitgate 2's Twitch</a> channel on Wednesday, August 14 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intel%E2%80%99s-bios-updates-for-crashing-cpus-are-now-rolling-out.948288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216054/intel-msi-asus-bios-updates-crashing-13th-14th-raptor-lake-gen-cpus<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asus and MSI have both released beta BIOS updates today to address Intel’s crashing 13th and 14th Gen Raptor Lake desktop processors. While the BIOS updates won’t fix CPUs that are already damaged, they include Intel’s new microcode update that should help further address the instability issues.</p><p>If it works well, this could be a very big deal for Intel, which lost some of its reputation after its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation">flagship chips were found to crash</a> earlier this year and, after a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178751/intel-raptor-lake-crash-fix-etvb-not-yet">long investigation</a>, discovered there would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a">no true fix</a>, requiring customers to replace any damaged chips. Intel also isn’t having a great year, period, recently announcing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24210656/intel-is-laying-off-over-10000-employees-and-will-cut-10-billion-in-costs">layoffs of at least 15,000 workers</a> and stopping “non-essential work.”</p><p>Asus has <a href="https://rog-forum.asus.com/t5/intel-700-600-series/raptorlake-resources/m-p/1034564/highlight/true#M24284">released its beta BIOS updates</a> through its ROG forums for a variety of Z790 motherboards. These are also typically posted to Asus’ support pages a few days after they’re posted to its ROG forums. MSI’s BIOS updates can be found on the individual motherboard support pages for its motherboards:</p><p>While we wouldn’t normally recommend using a beta BIOS update, given that this addresses an “elevated operating voltages” issue, you might want to go ahead and install these as soon as possible.</p><p>If you use a board other than MSI and Asus, or the microcode BIOS update isn’t available for your particular motherboard right now, make sure you’re on the latest BIOS update either way. Even if they’re missing the latest fix, recent BIOS updates should already include Intel’s recommended power delivery profiles, which could reduce the likelihood of your chip getting damaged.</p><p>“Please help us get the word out to all Raptor Lake desktop users, especially i9 users, in big screaming headlines that they need to update their PC to the latest BIOS now to stop/prevent the CPU wear and hopefully avoid the need for an RMA,” said Falcon Northwest founder Kelt Reeves in an email to <em>The Verge</em> earlier this week.</p><p>If you have an Asus board and want to check that your BIOS is set to the right power profile, Falcon Northwest has a good overview we’ve embedded below. The very latest Asus BIOS updates should already default to Intel’s settings instead of the company’s own overclocking profile.</p><p>Intel reportedly said these BIOS updates <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-says-raptor-lake-microcode-update-will-not-affect-overclocking-and-performance-new-arrow-lake-battlemage-updates">shouldn’t cause</a> any performance loss, and reviewers are already gearing up to test Intel’s latest microcode to ensure there are no big changes for its 13th and 14th Gen chips.</p><p>We’re also still waiting on Intel to provide a tool to test existing machines for any processor degradation. Intel has also extended its warranty on a variety of 13th and 14th Gen CPUs by an additional two years. PC makers are largely passing on that warranty extension to consumers, and you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215440/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-integrator-warranty-lenovo-dell-hp-acer-asus">find out if your own system is covered right here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Applicants must have a playable prototype and should ideally be an "early-career or under-the-radar developer" who is part of an underrepresented group within the games industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"These grants are intended to support creators who are under-invested-in within today’s game industry or who do not receive much support from the existing structures," explains the Draknek website. There are no geographical restrictions to applicants.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Draknek defines a puzzle game as any title that is "primarily about thinking/logical reasoning–and not primarily challenging due to execution/timing elements."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Puzzle games cover a wide range of subgenres, e.g. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Patrick's Parabox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ElecHead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Myst</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Return of the Obra Dinn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Opus Magnum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are five games with very different gameplay, which would all be considered relevant," it adds. "However, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tetris</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a phenomenal game, it is not an example of what we're looking for due to its reliance on reaction speed. If in doubt, please apply."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers who have already secured the backing of a publisher or are fully funded might not meet eligibility requirements, but those who have so far only received a microgrant or incubator support will likely clear that bar. The studio will hand out six grants and explained the money can be spent on "anything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"From development tools to rent, the grant money is intended to help people interested in creating puzzle games in whatever way makes sense for the individual," it added. The grant will also provide mentorship opportunities, but won't burden recipients with specific deadlines or milestones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want you to feel involved in the cohort and the community, and you’ll be invited to present your progress at the end of the year. The key is your satisfaction and growth, not rigid timelines or predefined goals," added Draknek.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you don't finish your game by the end of the grant period, it’s not a problem. We understand that creative projects can take unexpected turns. We don’t want you to feel pressured to continue with something that no longer inspires you or makes sense for your development."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://grants.draknek.org/">Click here to learn more about the Draknek New Voices Puzzle Grant, including how to apply</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

            <p>
Vampire Survivors - the acclaimed (and still doggedly vampire-free) minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle - is finally launching for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 29th August.
</p>
<p>
Vampire Survivors launched into PC early access back in 2021, where it immediately set tongues wagging - partly because it cost an absurdly generous £3.99, but mostly because its mix of wave-based monster dodging and auto-bludgeoning is very blimmin' good indeed.
</p>
<p>
"Once this wave is done, once this boss is done, once I've unlocked a new character or item, I should really turn off the computer and go for a run. Maybe," wrote Christian Donlan in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-review-near-endless-rpg-popcorn">Recommended review</a>. "Or maybe one more go, one more choice, one more chance to confuse speed with damage with experience."

<p>
Since its early access debut, Vampire Survivors has received a 1.0 release, a heap of free and paid DLC (including collaborations with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-announces-among-us-dlc-collaboration">Among Us</a> and Contra), and it's spread its leathery wings to Xbox, Switch, Android, iOS, and Mac. Oh, and it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-wins-best-game-at-bafta-game-awards">won a BAFTA</a>. So while PlayStation is definitely a little late to the party, it remains, at least, a party worth attending.
</p>
<p>
Vampire Survivors' PlayStation release will include all free content released so far - adding up to over 40 playable characters and 80 weapons – and all four of its paid DLCs (Legacy of Moonspell, Tides of the Foscari, Emergency Meetings, and Operation Guns) will be available for purchase on PS5 and PS4 at launch.
</p>
<p>
Expect Vampire Survivors to cost £3.99/€4.99/$4.99 when it <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010458/">comes to PS4 and PS5</a> on 29th August, with its paid DLC priced at £1.59/€1.99/$1.99.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Enshrouded first went into Early Access in January 2024, and since then, it has been incredibly successful. Developed and published by Keen Games GmbH, this is the second game they created, with Portal Knights being their first. Since its release in January, it has reached over 30 million players, and the number is continuing to rise.</p>
<p><a href="https://enshrouded.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enshrouded</a> is a game worth the price tag, as there is much content for an Early Access game. There have been three major updates, all of which have added new features. In addition, it has seen 14 patches and 16 hotfixes, with the developers consistently working to ensure the game remains in its best possible state for players to get stuck into.</p>
<p>Considering the game has only been out since January, there is much content and fixes for players to explore. They are not even close to done with the planned content, as they have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-2024-early-access-roadmap-full-release-2025/">full roadmap</a> ahead of them. While most of their planned content is for 2025 and beyond, 2024 has already seen some major updates.</p>
<p>These updates include the instanced dungeons called the Hallowed Halls, which players can take on alone or in a group. Later this year, they will be adding Water to the game. While there is already Water you can drink, there is no form of flowing water or bodies of water to be found. Instead, it is just lava.</p>
<p>Upcoming updates include World Events and the ability to visit other players' bases. Looking ahead to 2024, Enshrouded has planned updates, such as a Weather System, new enemies and bosses, and enemy patrols.</p>
<p>Since its release in January, over 90 million hours of Enshrouded has been played, with nearly 150 million player deaths. Additionally, almost 700,000 players have reached the maximum level of level 25.</p>
<p>With Enshrouded's release in January, Keen Games GmbH has doubled in size. The longest-serving member of the team has worked there for 19 years, and the latest member joined in August to help bolster the QA.</p>
<p>This company takes its players' feedback seriously, with players able to suggest new items or events on the Enshrouded Feature Board. This has helped the company choose what to put on its roadmap, and some of the most voted-for features, such as the Hallowed Halls, have already made it into the game.</p>
<p>Keen Games GmbH hopes to have a full release of Enshrouded on PC in 2025, with the game also coming to consoles that year. So far, Enshrouded maintains a Very Positive overall review on Steam, and is continuing to rise in popularity.</p>

Four years later, Arkane would up the ante with <em>Dishonored 2</em>, an exceptional sequel that improves upon its predecessor in every possible way. If the first game was a proof of concept, <em>Dishonored 2</em> is that concept executed to perfection. <em>Dishonored </em>thrives when it lets you lose in a large sandbox with a set of tools to navigate challenges in any way you can think of. That freedom existed in the first game, with wonderful levels with multiple solutions, but <em>Dishonored 2</em> builds on that even more.<br></p><p>It begins with the dual protagonist set up of the sequel. In <em>Dishonored 2</em>, you can choose between playing as Corvo, the protagonist of the first game, or Emily Kaldwin, the now grown-up empress we saved when she was a kid in <em>Dishonored</em>. Each has a unique set of powers that unlock over the course of the game. While Corvo and Emily’s skills have a similar utility—both have abilities that allow for quickly traversing long distances, for example—no two skills are exactly the same. This means that you might find a completely unique solution to problems as Corvo that Emily can’t exactly replicate. Just by offering you this choice, the potential paths through every level in <em>Dishonored 2</em> become exponentially greater. It makes<em> </em>this agame about experimentation, improvisation, and learning to master your abilities to test the limits of the game’s design.</p><p>If you’ve only seen one thing about <em>Dishonored 2</em>, it is most likely the iconic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-closer-look-at-dishonored-2-s-clockwork-mansion-1789429571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-closer-look-at-dishonored-2-s-clockwork-mansion-1789429571">Clockwork Mansion</a></span>,a level set within an eccentric inventor’s home, which has been rigged with endless secret rooms, shifting walls, automaton enemies, and more. The lobby of the building is just one breathtaking moment you’ll encounter in it, as you can hit switches to unfurl different staircases that offer different starting paths through the mansion’s maze. If you are fast enough, you can even find yourself moving through the extensive series of tunnels and passages behind the walls and under the mansion’s foundation, unlocking an entire second layer to the level. </p><p>Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Clockwork Mansion is how early in <em>Dishonored 2</em> it occurs. As one of the first few missions you undertake, it’s a high bar that every subsequent level somehow continues to raise even further. Later levels add even more fascinating permutations for you to play with, like a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-made-dishonored-2s-time-travel-level-so-good-1819596566&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-made-dishonored-2s-time-travel-level-so-good-1819596566">time-traveling mission</a></span> that lets you move between a single space in both the past and present with your actions changing each timeline. To this day, you can still find <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/StealthGamerBR2/status/1816457333184016430&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/StealthGamerBR2/status/1816457333184016430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new paths</a></span> through levels or other unexpected ways the game’s systems interact because there are just that many possibilities. Every part of <em>Dishonored 2</em> is a showcase of just how impressive Arkane’s grasp on the immersive sim is. If WolfEye’s next game has a fraction of <em>Dishonored 2</em>’s greatness, there is still a good chance it will be excellent.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, it seems like a bug or other issue has actually made exotic class items harder to get. Players immediately noticed that Overthrow, an activity on the expansion’s new Pale Heart destination and the most popular way to farm class items, was not dishing out any additional drops. The likelihood of a drop was supposed to be going up more with each completion. Instead, it seemed to have ground to halt.</p><p>“I spent more than 2 hours and 3 full overthrow runs and did NOT get a drop,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1em70gn/exotic_class_item_farm_is_way_worse_then_before/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1em70gn/exotic_class_item_farm_is_way_worse_then_before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one player in a popular thread on the Destiny subreddit. “I just KNEW when they announced the changes that it was gonna be worse. At least revert back to the old way PLEASE BUNGIE. And actually fucking BUFF the drop rates instead of NERF them. Smfh...” Another <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1elqkqv/3_overthrows_for_1_exotic_class_item_this_is/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1elqkqv/3_overthrows_for_1_exotic_class_item_this_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>, “3 Overthrows for 1 Exotic Class Item, this is absurd.” </p><p>The other main way to obtain exotic class item drops is from the Dual Destiny exotic mission. At least one is guaranteed on the first completion each week, but it can otherwise be a long and tedious affair to keep grinding. Unfortunately, the new surprise nerf means that this suboptimal method is now the defacto best way to farm this specific type of loot.</p><p>“We’ve identified an issue impacting Exotic Class Item drop rates,” Bungie confirmed on August 7. “At this time, Tier 4 Overthrow Chests are not contributing to increased drop chances, nor can Exotic Class Items be awarded through them. We’re currently developing a fix, aiming for a near-term hotfix.  We are also looking into giving players a way to chase specific perks in a future update. More details as plans solidify.”</p><p>Players weren’t too forgiving. “So I WASN’T going crazy after 5 hours and only getting 2 drops,” one of them wrote back. Other <em>Destiny 2</em> fans feel the exotic class item situation, which is a core draw of the post-<em>Final Shape</em> end-game at the moment, needs more urgent attention. Some want the item to become craftable, while others just want Bungie to turn on the loot spigot and let them rain down on players. </p><p>That’s in part because morale in the community is in tatters after the latest round of deep cuts at Bungie and reporting that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-3-cancel-final-shape-expansions-bungie-payback-1851612404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-3-cancel-final-shape-expansions-bungie-payback-1851612404"><em>Destiny 2</em> is moving away from big expansions</a></span> with no fresh sequel coming anytime soon. The sci-fi MMO shooter’s future has never felt more up in the air, and it’s been a real whiplash moment for fans still coming off the high of the expansion that successfully wrapped up 10-years of live service storytelling. It’ll take more than just a new This Week At Bungie roundup to repair that trust, but fixing the exotic class item debacle would be a start. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It will also feature "50 unique levels" in five different worlds. Players will be able to explore locations from the books, such as City Hall, the Giant Marshmallow Factory, and others. The story will follow Dog Man pursuing a thief who stole the keys to the city.</p><p dir="ltr">Dav Pilkey has worked on various children's books, which include the Captain Underpants series, Dragon, Dumb Bunnies, Ricky Ricotta's Mighty Robot series, and more. Interestingly enough, Dog Man first appeared in Captain Underpants, but once the series ended, Dog Man became a spin-off series spawning several popular sequels. Dog Man tells of a person who has the head of a dog but the body of a human police officer who goes around stopping various crimes and saving the city.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347120-screen_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4347120" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347120-screen_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4347120"></a><figcaption>Dog Man in action</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347120-screen_1.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347121-screen_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347122-screen_3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347123-screen_4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347124-screen_5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4347121,1300-4347122,1300-4347123,1300-4347124" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1746/17463818/4347121-screen_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1746/17463818/4347122-screen_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1746/17463818/4347123-screen_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1746/17463818/4347124-screen_5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347121-screen_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347122-screen_3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347123-screen_4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4347124-screen_5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As of writing, Dog Man: Mission Impawsible doesn't have a release date, but it's set to launch on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Destiny 2 fans are still reeling from the news that developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/">Bungie laid off</a> around 220 people in July, or roughly 17% of its workforce. Speaking on an earnings call, Sony president Hiroki Totoki discussed the Destiny studio's restructure in greater detail, stating that it came from a desire to "optimize overall studio structure."</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://x.com/nib95_/status/1821437772038590691" rel="nofollow ">a report</a> of the call posted to social media, Totoki said that the back-office functions of Bungie will be integrated into other Sony studios, and that the studio's resources will be focused on Destiny 2 and the Marathon reboot. His comments would seem to indicate that Sony is taking a more-active role in the studio's direction, making it a more-integrated part of the existing constellation of SIE studios.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2 | The Journey Ahead</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time that Totoki has expressed a desire to see improvement from Bungie. Back in February, he said during a financial-results call (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-president-wants-bungie-to-be-better-at-assuming-accountability-for-development-timelines/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>) that while he was impressed with Bungie's creativity and knowledge of live service, he felt that the company needed to improve some areas of its business, including "use of business expenses" and "accountability for development timelines."</p><p dir="ltr">The timing of the large Bungie layoffs surprised many in the industry, especially since the studio had just shipped The Final Shape, its best-received content pack for Destiny 2 in many years. However, reports from Stephen Totilo's <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/" rel="nofollow ">Game Fille newsletter</a> and elsewhere claim that the circumstances of The Final Shape's release were largely irrelevant to the decision, due to Bungie missing Sony's financial targets since at least 2023. Several senior execs at Bungie were affected by those layoffs, including Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy; Bungie mentioned in its blog post announcing the departures that "most" of its senior staff were being let go. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-destiny-game-codenamed-payback-has-reportedly-been-cancelled/1100-6525485/">Bloomberg report</a> suggests that the next Destiny game, codenamed Payback, was also canceled a while ago.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-ip-will-continue-until-morale-improves.948243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. had its earnings call yesterday, where it revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaming revenue is down 41%</a> and <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/warner-bros-discovery-massive-write-down-after-losing-nba-package-1236033756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things aren’t looking good</a> in other parts of its sprawling business either. I’ll admit to feeling a bit of petty glee at this news: seeing David Zaslav, a man who seems to <a href="https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hate</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/rooster-teeth-shut-down-warner-brothers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything</a> his company makes, reap the consequences of his actions feels a little good, even if those consequences are, for him, stock price drops. For the rest of us, they could be more <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enshittification</a> and slop.</p><p>On the gaming side, some of this revenue drop can be blamed on the failure of <a href="https://aftermath.site/suicide-squad-discourse-impressions-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Suicide Squad</em></a> when held against the–sigh–success of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2023/01/23/hogwarts-legacy-jk-rowling-trans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></a>. Back in <a href="https://aftermath.site/give-me-janky-mid-tier-games-over-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March</a>, gaming head JB Perrette felt the way forward after <em>Suicide Squad</em> was <em>more</em> live service, leaning into the WB conglomerate of properties to make forever games off of. On yesterday’s call, that still appears to be the plan, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-discovery-wants-to-license-franchises-batman-harry-potter-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perrette saying</a>,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We know that our franchises, particularly in a world where the gaming industry-launching brand new franchises is getting harder and harder for a number of reasons, including <a href="https://www.epsilon.com/us/insights/idfa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IDFA deprecation</a> and more challenges with marketing and customer acquisition. And that franchises like the ones that we have are in high demand, and can help in launching games.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Perrette said that “one of the areas we are particularly leaning into, which is about half of the $200 billion games business, is the free-to-play space,” as evidenced by WB’s <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-studio-player-first-games-1236080155/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchase of <em>MultiVersus</em> developer Player First last month</a>. So buckle up for microtransactions, I guess.</p><p>Zaslav, meanwhile, said something that fills me with such dread that I’ll drop the whole quote here, with added emphasis, and then break it down:</p><blockquote><p>One of the strategic advantages of owning all our IP is, as the world has changed, it used to be you launch a movie or you launch a TV series, then you do a game. <strong>But one of the reasons that </strong><strong><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></strong><strong> was so successful and the #1 game last year, you went to </strong><strong><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></strong><strong> and you entered the game and you were able to become part of that world.</strong> That ultimately I think is a big piece of where this industry is going.<strong> That we'll create a movie, whether it's Batman or Superman or Harry Potter, and maybe there'll be a TV show, but the ability to go in that world and have that experience of spending time with all the characters is something that we still own.</strong> We have 11 studios here, and we have a lot of IP.<strong> And there's also a lot of interest among others in coming to take advantage of some of that IP for gaming, which we're looking at. Because as JB said, we need to get bigger</strong>, and the IP that we own and the value that it has in the gaming space is something we're looking to take advantage of.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>There’s no denying the appeal of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> was primarily that if you can somehow still stomach <em>Harry Potter</em> despite <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2024/04/03/what-has-jk-rowling-said-about-transgender-people-trans-views-tweets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JK Rowling</a>, you got to play a game in a world you recognize. <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I’ve written before</a>, that dopamine hit of recognition is one of the only two values the owners of these properties get from owning them (the other is money), so it’s no wonder they think it’s what the rest of us want from them too.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing Zaslav seems to be saying here is that WB’s movies and tv shows could be games, and vice versa. There’s no better example of this, for me, than WB-owned HBO’s <em>The Last of Us, </em>which showed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48WJNnNefvI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a trailer for its second season</a> last weekend. That series, an original idea in 2013 when the first game premiered, has become some kind of weird ouroboros: a game that felt like a movie becoming a tv show that looks just like the game, surrounded by multiple remasters of itself. It gets gamers into HBO, and HBO viewers into games, and if you were Zaslav and Perrette, with a stable of both movie and game studios at your disposal, of course you’d fall in love with how much value you could squeeze out of something without actually, essentially, creating anything new.&nbsp;</p><p>But Zaslav is also saying that, not only could WB squeeze its properties for everything they’re worth, but it could license them out to other companies too. So not only could WB pump out more movie tie-in games or game tie-in movies and shows, but <em>other </em>game studios, equally desperate, could start doing that too. And while I don’t necessarily fault any game studio looking to up their chances for a hit in these shaky times, I’m not sure spending a ton of money to license an IP is the first solution I’d look to when considering <a href="https://aftermath.site/big-budget-game-development-is-not-sustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ballooning AAA costs</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We're already seeing this happening in games. I might be one of the few people in the world who booed when Arkane Lyon <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/marvels-blade-reveal#:~:text=Arkane%20Studios%20has%20revealed%20Marvel's%20Blade%20at%20The%20Game%20Awards%202023." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> its <em>Blade</em> game in 2023; a studio who does things as risky and interesting as <em>Deathloop</em> and <em>Dishonored</em> making a Marvel game felt disappointing to me, even if I’m sure they’ll do a good job with a world I will cop to having zero interest in. Truth be told, I feel the same about <em>Hitman</em> developer IOI’s delve into <a href="https://ioi.dk/project-007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Bond</a>, or <em>Wolfenstein</em> developer MachineGames’ upcoming take on <a href="https://aftermath.site/whose-mouth-is-this" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones</a>. I don’t <em>want</em> these studios hampered by existing fandoms and a bible full of rules about how they’re allowed to portray famous characters or well-trod lore. I want to be in IOI’s world, or MachineGames’, or Arkane’s, not Marvel’s or George Lucas’. I want these studios to be <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-games-pc-2024-may-hades-2-little-kitty-1000xresist-manor-lords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uniquely</a> themselves, not at the service of existing culture. </p><p>But the end of Zaslav’s quote hits the nail on the head: “we need to get bigger, and the IP that we own and the value that it has in the gaming space is something we're looking to take advantage of.” He doesn’t mean “take advantage of” in the colloquial sense, but he doesn’t <em>not</em> mean it either. At the end of the day, all of this is just about growth for shareholders, and companies like WB are, as <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/tss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ed Zitron</a> describes them, simply “nihilistic engines for growth, anti-companies that create value by reducing what they contribute to the world.” The Zaslavian future will include games, sure, but not <em>new</em> ones; instead, we could see more games but less substance, more iterations on the same old things whose main purpose is just to put more money in men like Zaslav’s pockets.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a press release, the studio, which is led by Arkane founder&nbsp;Raphaël Colantonio, says that it's "just wrapped pre-production" on its newest project. This means the game, which currently remains nameless, is now "full steam ahead in production".</p>
<p>Prior to release (whenever that happens to be), Wolfeye says it will run an "exclusive and limited private alpha" for the game in order to gauge players' reactions and shape the development process with community feedback. The studio has also shared a first look at some artwork for the upcoming action RPG.</p>

<p>The untitled game does not yet have a publishing partner, but Colantonio says the studio is searching for one, and that the limited private alpha for the game will happen sometime next year.</p>
<p>If you're interested in participating, you can sign up for it <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/signup" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via Wolfeye's official website</a>, where you'll also find some rather evocative-looking artwork bearing the logo of a fictional company called "Candis Technologies".</p>
<p>Whatever this project turns out to be, it'll be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wild-looking-weird-west-is-wolfeye-studios-debut-title">second game developed by Wolfeye</a> after 2022's&nbsp;<em>Weird West</em>, which was an isometric action RPG that saw players taking control of five distinct characters rather than creating their own.</p>

<p>At any rate, it's nice to see ex-Arkane devs being given another chance. Perhaps if this game is successful, Wolfeye could poach some of the folks left jobless after Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">closure of Arkane Austin</a>, although there might be a bit of a geography problem in that regard. Only time will tell.</p>
