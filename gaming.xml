            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-summer-game-fest-2024-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Summer Game Fest is back this year with a number of new announcements looking to pad out the rest of 2024 and beyond. Host Geoff Keighley took to the stage to show off a number of new announcements including both new game reveals and updates on games we've seen before. While we were told to mute expectations somewhat (that means no Kingdom Hearts IV or other dream titles), there was still a lot to take in from studios big and small. Here's the full recap of what we saw during the two hour showcase.</p>

<h3><em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em></h3>
<p>The once rumored <em>LEGO Horizon</em> finally sees its reveal with a colorful announcement trailer showcasing Aloy, the franchise's lead gal and machine hunter. <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> will take Aloy and a crew of heroes through the lush wilderness on a quest to save the world and discover the secrets of her past. Co-developed by Guerrilla and Studio Gobo, <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> is a playful and light-hearted story inspired by the events of the world of <em>Horizon</em>.</p>
<p>Players will be able to dive into a grand adventure, customize parts as much as they like, and take on action-filled battles by themselves or with a friend using the game's co-op system. <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch this holiday.</p>

<h3><em>No More Room in Hell 2</em></h3>
<p><em>No More Room in Hell 2</em> is an 8-player horror experience currently in development by Torn Banner Studios with an expected release on Halloween 2024. This game is an intense, permadeath co-op journey into eerie, zombie-filled zones. As a first responder, it'll be up to you to survive, scavenge, stockpile, and fulfill your mission - and then do it all over again as each experience changes.</p>
<p>The announcement trailer runs through various in-game scenarios including gameplay and in-engine cinematics. No More Room in Hell 2 will be available for early access on Halloween this year, with a release expected on Steam and Epic Games Store.</p>

<h3><em>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</em></h3>
<p>Revealed last year and in various states of player testing during that time, Warner Bros. Games has finally put the date on <em>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions.</em> Featuring iconic locations from the series, as well as characters including Harry himself, Ron, and Hermione, as well as other references, the game will task players with flying across arena in the roles of a Beater, Chaser, Keeper, or Seeker in a number of modes. Those who own <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> will receive the Bonus Legacy Pack when they connect Quidditch Champions to their WB Games account.</p>
<p><em>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</em> will be available on September 3 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. Additionally, PlayStation Plus subscribers will get the game day one as part of their monthly releases.</p>

<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> isn't far off, but that didn't stop the developers at Game Science from showing off a new CG trailer meant to entice people to pre-order. This single-player action RPG is inspired by the classic story Journey to the West, and those familiar with that tale can see some of that brought to live in the new trailer.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/8/24174086/msi-claw-updates-review-addendum</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/msi-claw-after-more-updates-nope-it%E2%80%99s-still-a-dud.894381/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/8/24174086/msi-claw-updates-review-addendum<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">When I called the MSI Claw an embarrassment</a> in my May 18th review, one commenter pointed out they’d gotten higher benchmark scores than me. Sure enough: MSI had pushed out new graphics drivers and BIOS updates between the time I benchmarked and the time we published. </p><p>I’ve now tested those updates. In some of my tests, they’re better. In others, I actually found them worse! Overall, they don’t change my conclusion one bit: the MSI Claw is the worst pick from today’s crop of consumer handheld gaming PCs, and you should steer clear. </p><p>Below, you’ll find my new benchmark results in the same games, across all of the Claw’s standard power modes. In almost every test, you’ll see the Claw dramatically behind the competition in speed <em>while using more power</em>.</p><div><p><em>New results bolded. All tests at 720p low, save&nbsp;Dirt Rally&nbsp;at 720p ultra.</em></p></div><p>Worse, I’m still finding the Claw varies wildly between playable and completely unplayable in demanding games where the less expensive Steam Deck has no issues. In <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider,</em> I saw the game repeatedly and inexplicably dip to just 20fps in a cave with no enemies around at 720p and Medium spec, before recovering to a stable 60fps a little while later. </p><p>I saw something similar in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, even though the MSI Claw now generally has a higher framerate in that game after updates. </p><p>And I’m also now seeing some very weird behavior with the Claw when it comes to power modes. You might expect MSI’s “Performance” mode to be speedier than its “Balanced” mode, right? That’s not what I saw in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 — </em>and when I took a close look at the framerate dips, I noticed they always coincided with an unexpected power dip. </p><p>While the Intel Meteor Lake chip consumed a pretty stable 30 watts in Balanced mode, it tried to hit 35, 36, even 37 watts in Performance mode — and couldn’t maintain it, dipping down to 29 watts again and again. Plugged into USB-C power, the Performance mode worked better, continually pulling between 37 and 45 watts of power. Not that the extra power made an improvement in <em>Cyberpunk, </em>unfortunately. </p><p>And if you’re seeing higher scores than I am, I highly suggest you run that benchmark another three or four times, because it looks like MSI now runs its chip unsustainably faster for a while after you switch power modes, then throttles back down. The Asus ROG Ally does the same trick, and I always had to run my benchmarks a bunch of extra times there before I start counting, so I don’t throw off the average with outliers. I didn’t need to do that when I first reviewed the Claw.</p><p>To MSI and Intel’s credit, at least <em>Dave the Diver</em> feels playable now at a smooth 60fps with only occasional drops, unlike in my original review. </p><p>Overall, I think the MSI Claw should never have gone on sale. I’m glad I never had the urge to buy one when it first came out. I would feel cheated, just like the users <a href="https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?threads/are-you-kidding-me.397812/">in MSI’s own forums</a> <a href="https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?threads/new-msi-claw-8-ai-i-feel-so-cheated.397853/">say they feel cheated</a>, now that MSI has announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173763/msi-claw-7-lunar-lake-roadmap-claw-2-claw-3-claw-4">not one, but two improved versions</a> less than three months after the original came out. </p><p>It certainly doesn’t help that the company put it on sale before giving reviewers a chance to warn anyone.</p><p>If MSI is serious about the handheld space, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173763/msi-claw-7-lunar-lake-roadmap-claw-2-claw-3-claw-4">it sounds like the company is</a>, I think it should offer a trade-in program for buyers of the original Claw. If you want to fix this, MSI, let them pick one of this fall’s revisions at a massive discount. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>At Summer Game Fest 2024, Riot Games announced that its popular free-to-play 5v5 competitive first-person shooter game VALORANT will soon be available on consoles. A limited beta is set to kick off on June 12 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X players living in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan, with more regions possibly rolling out later.</p>
<p>Arnar Gylfason, Production Director of VALORANT at Riot Games, stated:</p>
<p><em>When exploring whether to bring VALORANT to additional platforms, we knew we had to be able to offer the same uncompromising, competitive experience that we’ve provided to PC players for years: a precise, team-based, tactical shooter. We were adamant that VALORANT’s core, competitive gameplay must feel natural on a controller; and - if we couldn’t deliver on that gameplay promise - we had to be prepared to walk away from it. We hope we nailed it, but ultimately, our players will have the final say.</em></p>
<p>Riot Games confirmed that due to the game's focus on competitive gameplay, there will be no cross-play with the existing PC version <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/valorant-professionals-wanted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched in June 2020</a>. However, all players will have a connected, shared inventory and gameplay progression tied to their VALORANT account. PC and console players will receive simultaneous platform releases of all live patch balances, new agents, maps, premium content, and additional live service features.</p>
<p><iframe title="VALORANT CONSOLE ANNOUNCE // Welcome Trailer - VALORANT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9i02_8aMV0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXq176aI7Mk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new developer diary</a>, Riot talked about the process of bringing the game to consoles and ensuring it would feel right with a controller:</p>
<p><em>VALORANT is a very mouse-focused game. It requires a lot of dexterity. One of the things we were really focused on when we were getting the game to feel really good on the controller was to manage the limitations of your trying to move through the environment with your right stick as fast as you can, but you also need to be hyper-precise.</em></p>
<p><em>Being able to do both things with one stick is a very challenging problem. When we first got our hands on VALORANT on console, it was a much different experience than we have right now. It was a bit clunky. We needed something to make it easier for players to slow down and hone in on gunfights when they need to. I think our switch to what we call a focus mode was a big turning point for us.</em></p>
<p><em>It's kind of the button you press before you take a fight. Your sensitivity drops down, you zoom in, you become precise. You should feel like you're about to be accurate when you're trying to hit the really long range shot.</em></p>

			<p>The action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-needs-a-rethink-creator-slitterhead-prototyping-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slitterhead</a> appeared with major news at Summer Game Fest 2024. Japanese Developer Bokeh Game Studio, founded by Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama following Sony's closure of Team Siren, revealed that Slitterhead would launch on November 8 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2631250/Slitterhead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and Epic Games Store), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>Here's the brief official description provided by Bokeh:</p>
<p><em>Set in the densely cluttered streets of "Kowlong," filled with obscurity and chaos, this battle action-adventure game casts players as the "Hyoki," an entity devoid of memory and physical form. His only motive is to eradicate the monstrous beings known as "Slitterheads" crawling around the city, disguising themselves as humans.</em></p>
<p><em>Hyoki's ability allows him to possess and control human bodies at will, turning the people wandering the city into his pawns. With this power, he can slip through barriers, assume the identity of specific individuals, and infiltrate dangerous areas and organizations. By rapidly switching hosts, he can also traverse the city at high speed.</em></p>
<p><em>Roaming the vibrant neon-lit cityscape, players must seek out allies among humans known as "Rarities," infiltrate and track dangerous organizations, and engage in battles harnessing the power of blood. While human bodies are fragile, Hyoki can burn their life force, turning blood into weapons to confront the ferocious Slitterheads. Even when critically wounded, he can continue fighting by switching hosts efficiently.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>By possessing "Rarities", specific humans who share high sync with Hyoki, he is able to unleash even more powerful attacks and activate various abilities. The cooperative relationship with these "Rarities" holds the key to uncovering the deepening mysteries in the city of Kowlong.</em></p>

		<p>It might be hard to remember the days of the Atari 2600. Some of you would have been minus 12 or a similar sort of negative age that makes me upset. I do remember though, as I had an Atari 2600. Admittedly is was a good while after the console came out, and it was because we were poor, but let’s not get into that right now. Still, the most wonderful thing about my Atari 2600 was its 52-game cartridge, an unbelievable pack of games with various styles and genres covered. It feels like the team behind UFO50 have similar memories, as we’re about to get the same type of wild, multi-game experience in 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="UFO 50 - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5wqZi1smZOg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mossmouth, the team behind the Spelunky games, have been working on UFO50 for a long time – it was announced 6 years ago! – and there’s a clear reason why: these are 50 fully-formed games. Narratively, they’ve created a retro game developer, UFO Soft, given them a timeline between the 80s and 90s, and then gone to work building the games that this fictional developer created. It’s mind-blowing when you think about it.</p>

<p>There’s various different genres here, from SHMUPS, classic 2D platformers and into-the-screen RPGs. Some are shorter, arcade-style experiences; others have narratives and expansive worlds to explore. If you’re a fan of retro-styled indie games, or this was the era of gaming that you grew up in, UFO50 looks like it will be a nostalgic and constantly surprising journey through a developer that you’ve never experienced before.</p>

<p>There’s not been too much through the Summer Games Fest to get excited about, but Day of the Devs showcased that we’re in safe hands with the indie creators out there. Every game in UFO50 includes a singleplayer mode, but if you also have fond memories of 8-bit and 16-bit multiplayer action you’ll be gald to know that over half of the games also offer local multiplayer as well.</p>

<p>UFO50 will be released on PC on the 19th of September, and I, for one, absolutely can’t wait! Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more news, previews and reviews as UFO50 is certainly one to watch.</p>

<p data-characters="141" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After months of requests from the community, <em>FC Mobile</em> Training Transfer will finally arrive in Ultimate Team as part of the upcoming update.</p> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">The new system could be a complete game changer, as it will help players reduce a lot of grind. Anyone who has played the game will know how important it is to train cards, but the process isn’t infinite. After a certain point of time, the resources become scarce, which also hinders squad development. The <em>FC Mobile</em> Training Transfer, as planned by EA Sports, will help to reduce many headaches.</p>
 <h2 id="h-fc-mobile-training-transfer-guide" data-injectable="false">FC Mobile Training Transfer Guide</h2> <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="247" data-injectable="false">The <em>FC Mobile</em> Training Transfer process will be pretty straightforward, and a new currency will be introduced for the same purpose. You’ll be able to earn Training Transfer points, which will be used to shift the XP from one card to another.</p> <figure data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Select Training Transfer from the menu.</li> <li>First, select the card from which the training will be transferred.</li> <li>Second, select the card which will receive the XP.</li> <li>Click on the ‘Transfer’ button to complete the process.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">There are still going to be a lot of strategies involved with the transfer process. First, the training transfer will be limited if the target player has a lower rank. In such cases, the extra XP will remain with the original card, and you can transfer it once the rank of the target card is high enough. Additionally, ranks of the cards won’t be affected by any transfer of training. </p>
 <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="247" data-injectable="false">You should also remember that 10% XP will be lost in each transfer. Training Transfer points, required in every exchange, won’t be infinite either. However, there will be plenty of in-game activities from which players can earn these points.</p> <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="false"><em>FC Mobile</em> Training Transfer will be available after the update on June 11. This update will also introduce a new <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fc-mobile-euro-2024-tournament-explained-release-date-rewards-and-more/">Euro 2024 tournament mode</a> in Ultimate Team. You can select any of the qualified nations and write your own history.</p>

			<p>In early 2021, Lever Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-gets-steam-page-ahead-of-coming-soon-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> No More Room in Hell 2, a sequel to the popular 2011 Source mod. The game was meant to launch soon after that announcement, but it went dark for a long time.</p>
<p>That changed at Summer Game Fest 2024 when we learned that Chivalry developer Torn Banner Studios acquired Lever Games and bolstered the team with some of its own veterans to finish developing No More Room in Hell 2, now slated to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_in_Hell_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/no-more-room-in-hell-2-ea1b5c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> early access this Halloween.</p>
<p>Steve Piggott, CEO and creative director at Torn Banner Studios, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>No More Room in Hell 2 continues the dark, grounded aesthetic and intense action horror approach of the original game while expanding its vision dramatically. We’re excited to be the new shepherds of a franchise we adored as fans and thrilled to take up the mission of capturing the iconic horror of classic zombie cinema. We want to blow people away with our first co-op game, pushing Torn Banner’s skill in multiplayer action to a whole new level.</em></p>
<p>The game is now being made with Unreal Engine 5. It is set on a huge map (the first one to be released will be a Power Plant), and most of all, it features permadeath, causing players to consider every step of the way. In each match, players will have to find their fellow companions on the map and will start with very little, having to loot new weapons and gear to increase their chances of survival. They will then move toward the final objective on the map's center and try to extract there.</p>
<p><iframe title="No More Room in Hell 2 | Official Announce Trailer - Summer Game Fest" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jkuwzUd9lGs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looting supplies levels up the player character, so long as they survive a mission. With every run, you can improve your chances for survival with access to equipment caches and starting gear. The developers also promise a 'dynamic gore system' that will make bashing zombies very satisfying.</p>

		<p>A new gameplay video gives PlayStation fans a closer look at upcoming action RPG, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/phantom-blade-zero">Phantom Blade Zero</a>. The new trailer, dubbed “The Blade is Drawn” made its debut during Summer Games Fest 2024, showcasing new weapons, enemies, and environments.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Blade Zero Gameplay Trailer - SGF2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cgBmIjaZraE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s still no word on a release date just yet, though a Phantom Blade Zero demo will be making its way around the globe at key gaming events and exhibitions in 2024.</p>
<p>Developed by Chinese developer S-Game, Phantom Blade Zero is currently due to launch on both PlayStation 5 and PC. First revealed during Sony’s PlayStation Showcase in May 2023, it promises a gritty Souslike experience that blends together elements of steampunk, Chinese mythology, and martial arts.</p>
<p>It follows the saga of Soul, an elite assassin framed for the murder of the leader of the enigmatic Order of the Mask. With a mere 66 days left to live, Soul must traverse a treacherous landscape filled with powerful foes and unravel a complex conspiracy to clear his name and find a cure.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the Phantom Blade Zero demo will be publicly playable in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-showcase-8-world-premieres-gears-6-new-doom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-showcase-to-feature-8-world-premieres-including-gears-6-and-new-doom-it%E2%80%99s-been-claimed.894321/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-showcase-8-world-premieres-gears-6-new-doom/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tomorrow's Xbox Showcase is said to feature 8 world premieres, including the rumored new Gears 6 and DOOM.</p>
<p>At least, that's what Spanish leaker 'eXtas1s' (who often <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> for outlet Exputer) said on X some hours ago. Although the event will feature more than eight games coming to Xbox (and possibly other platforms as well), the leaker writes to have heard about 8 titles that haven't been officially announced just yet. As mentioned by ''eXtas1s' on X, these titles include both first- and third-party games, and among them are the new Gears from The Coalition and Bethesda's rumored DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>
<p>"According to our sources, we can confirm that the Xbox Showcase <span>will have a total of 8 WORLD PREMIERES, that is, games</span> for which there is not even an official announcement, until the event", the leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1799098658203341301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X. He <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1799099198161428553" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a>, "This includes 1st and 3rd party games. We already know 2 of them, Gears 6 and Doom The Dark Ages."</p>
<p>Although this isn't a confirmation in any way, T<a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-unlikely-30-fps/">he Verge's Tom Warren also mentioned the announcement of the new Gears from The Coalition and the new DOOM from id Software some days ago. Interestingly enough, while DOOM: The Dark Ages is said to be a multi-platform title, Gears 6 will allegedly be Xbox exclusive.</a></p>
<p>Back in April of this year, several insiders and leakers <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-might-appear-at-xbox-showcase-people-arent-ready-for-how-good-it-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that Gears 6 might very well appear at Microsoft's Xbox showcase. Known insider Nate "shinobi602" Najda said that aside from the game looking very good, it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-unlikely-30-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely that it would run at only cinematic 30FPS on Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as reported last month, the new multi-platform DOOM is said to be called DOOM: The Dark Ages, and will feature a medieval setting. "Doom: The Dark Ages has been in development for roughly four years, which makes sense, as Doom Eternal came out in 2020", reputable insider Tom Henderson wrote last month. "The game was developed under the codename “Year Zero,” and The Dark Ages subtitle is quite literal, as the game is said to feature a “medieval inspired Doom world.”</p>

		<p>Hype surrounding the upcoming <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> DLC is currently at its zenith, with the major expansion planned to release on June 21st 2024 on PC and consoles. However, one dataminer suggests that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/21/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date-21-june-trailer/">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> will continue a disappointing <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> trend by not supporting the game with additional <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-trophies">trophies</a> or achievements.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree | Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qLZenOn7WUo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This update comes via reliable source <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1798320557706076525">PlayStation Game Size</a>, who also reveals that the major Elden Ring DLC will weigh in around 16.5GB with pre-loads taking place 2 days ahead of launch, on June 19th 2024. While the claim that there will be no additional PlayStation trophies or Xbox achievements has yet to be 100% verified, it’s extremely likely considering developer FromSoftware’s track record with the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> series doing the same.</p>
<p>It’s been a long wait for fans of the 2022 smash hit, with Elden Ring director Hidetaka Miyazaki first teasing the DLC during The Game Awards 2022, &nbsp;“As for Elden Ring, we have several more things we want to do” he commented. It was then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/28/elden-ring-dlc-confirmed-to-be-in-development/">confirmed to be in development in early 2023</a>, though development has been largely silent ever since then. While Elden Ring has sold tens of millions of copies, it shows impressive commitment to work on a DLC expansion for over two years – typically that kind of development cycle gets spun off into a sequel, as we saw with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The title has one multiple Game of The Year awards including trophies from DICE, The Game Awards, and it was our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/31/game-of-the-year-2022-overall-winner/">Overall Game of The Year winner here at TheSixthAxis.</a></p>

<p>We scored Elden Ring top marks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/23/elden-ring-review/">10/10 in our review</a>&nbsp;back in February 2022. “Elden Ring is the game Souls fans have been waiting for,” said Jason. “From the open world design, to riding into battle on Torrent’s back, and the dark narrative woven through the world, this is a clear Game of the Year frontrunner that will have us all ensnared for a long time to come.”</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/08/inside-out-2-disney-speedstorm-season-8/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inside-out-2-coming-to-disney-speedstorm-for-season-8.894300/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/08/inside-out-2-disney-speedstorm-season-8/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/gameloft">Gameloft</a> has confirmed that Season 8 of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/disney-speedstorm">Disney Speedstorm</a> will be inspired by upcoming Pixar sequel, Inside Out 2. Not only that, this new season has been dated for next week, launching on June 13, 2024, on all available platforms including PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disney Speedstorm - Season 8 Date Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sY-xdHHo8pM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p dir="ltr">Each new season in Disney Speedstorm brings with it new playable racers and tracks, as well as a battle pass refresh. In Season 8 – dubbed Journey of Emotions – fans of the free-to-play racer can expect a glut of new content based on Inside Out 2, which hits cinemas on June 14, 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">First up, we have 5 new unlockable characters including Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness. Gameloft is teasing that we’ll also see 2 mystery racers appear mid-season. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/disney-speedstorm-muppets-kermit-event-unlock/">The last mystery racer to join Disney Speedstorm was Kermit the Frog from the Muppets</a>. Journey of Emotions will also introduce a cluster of new tracks to the game as well as Crew Members, secondary characters that can be equipped to racers to increase both their base stats and the effectiveness of power-ups.</p>
<p>For long-time fans of the Disney kart racer, there’s even more exciting news. With Season 8 comes a new “Team Battle” game mode which should hopefully introduce a new dynamic and give characters with support-focused abilities some much-needed time under the spotlight. Gameloft will also be making changes to ranked play, saying that “Ranked Races will see major improvements designed to make the competitive Disney Speedstorm experience more rewarding for all players. A new Player Rank progression and reward system will work alongside the current individual racer and progression paths, giving players even more opportunities to unlock exciting rewards.”</p>

<p>Disney Speedstorm originally launched in 2023 and received a slew of seasonal updates, adding various Disney characters and circuits. The latest season – Sugar Rush – is currently live with a spread of new Wreck-It-Ralph content. In our recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/10/disney-speedstorm-review-2024-edition/">Disney Speedstorm review</a>, we scored it a 7/10, saying that:</p>
<p>“Despite being drenched in familiar IP, Disney Speedstorm isn’t the kind of idle kart racing shovelware older gamers grew up with. There’s a clear reverence for the characters it features and their fantastical worlds, evidenced by the passion in Speedstorm’s art direction and soundscape. When coupled with Gameloft’s previous racing hits, the result is something that caters for casual gamers and genre die-hards alike. Just beware that whilethis virtual Disneyland-on-wheels is free, some of its main attractions come at a cost, whether spending time grinding away in queues to meet your favourite Disney mascots, or paying cash for that VIP fast-track.”</p>
<p>You can download the game now on PC, mobile, and all major consoles, complete with crossplay.</p>

			<p>Nomada Studio's Neva has received a beautiful new gameplay trailer during the Summer Game Fest event.</p>
<p>For those in the unknown - Neva is the follow-up title to indie hit title GRIS, and from what we've seen, it's looking absolutely gorgeous. The new trailer shows off the game's art, combat, and majestic vistas. You can check out the brand-new gameplay trailer for Neva below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Neva | Gameplay Trailer | Coming 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRG8m0jBGEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Neva&nbsp;depicts the moving tale of a young woman, Alba, and her lifelong bond with a magnificent wolf as they embark on a thrilling adventure through a dying world.</em></p>
<p><em>Following a traumatic encounter with dark forces, Alba finds herself bound to a curious, mischievous wolf cub. Working together, the pair will help each other overcome increasingly dangerous situations.</em></p>
<p><em>The wolf will grow and mature over time—as will Alba's relationship with it as they traverse this cursed, decaying world.</em></p>
<p><em>Building on what Nomada Studio achieved with&nbsp;GRIS,&nbsp;Neva&nbsp;will feature platforming, puzzles and combat against monstrous enemies, with a minimal UI, delicate art, high quality traditional animation and haunting music.</em></p>
<p>Published by Devolver Digital, Neva was officially announced last year.&nbsp;Neva is slated for a release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch later this year. More information about the game can be found on the <a href="https://neva.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420660/Neva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Studio Nomada's hit title GRIS was among <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-best-indie-games-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our best indie titles of 2018</a>, and we spoke highly about the title in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gris-anything-but-grizzly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> back then. <em>"Not every game needs to be challenging or hard, and Gris proves that will spectacular grace. It feels like interactive art, like you are traversing a painting the size of a monument and taking it in one small frame at a time. Complimented by a beautiful, almost heartbreaking soundtrack (available for separate purchase&nbsp;on Amazon), GRIS is a fantastic, thoughtful experience, even if it doesn’t last very long."</em></p>

    <p><span>50 games from Spelunky studio Mossmouth.</span>

Explore a variety of genres, from <a title="Genres > Platformer [453 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer</a>s and <a title="Genres > Shoot 'Em Up [705 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shoot-em-up">shoot ’em up</a>s to puzzle games, <a title="Genres > Roguelite [173 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">roguelites</a>, and <a title="Genres > RPG [16,319 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a>. Our goal is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design.</p><ul><li><strong>50 Brand New Games</strong> – These are NOT minigames or microgames! Although the size of each game varies, every one is a complete experience with its own title screen, intro, and ending. Some are small arcade-style games but there are also larger open-world <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,521 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s and a <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,340 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> that could take many hours to beat.</li><li><strong>An Alternate Universe</strong> – According to the story of <em>UFO 50</em>, the games were all created by a fictional 80s video game company that was obscure but ahead of its time. Some games are sequels to other games in the collection and various characters appear in multiple titles as part of a shared continuity.</li><li><strong>An Instant Library</strong> – All 50 games are available to play at the start! The concept was inspired by multicarts, retro collections, and the experience of going to a friend’s house and perusing their game library. Jump in and out of games at a whim – exploring the collection is part of the fun!</li><li><strong>Authentic But Also Modern</strong> – We carefully chose what elements to modernize. Every game shares a unique 32-color palette and we took great efforts to make them look and sound like actual 8-bit titles from the 80s. On the other hand, it was important to us that <em>UFO 50</em> was fun and surprising for modern players, so we chose not to limit ourselves to the genres and design conventions of the past.</li><li><strong>Versus and Cooperative Play</strong> – Roughly a third of the collection features local multiplayer, including <a title="Genres > Co-Op [172 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play and versus. You can compete head-to-head in a new fighting or <a title="Genres > Strategy [176 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">strategy game</a>… or team up to beat a classic <a title="Genres > Arcade [52 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade game</a> from an alternate timeline. It’s great for groups!</li></ul><p>Here are some of games you’ll get to play in <em>UFO 50</em>:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong><em>Campanella 2</em></strong>&nbsp;– The sequel to Campanella (another game in <em>UFO 50</em>), <em>Campanella 2</em> features procedurally-generated levels where you can explore in your UFO but also hop out to enter shops and dangerous caves. You play as the intrepid treasure-hunter Isabell, but she hasn’t always been a hero – by playing the entire collection you can learn more about her past.</li><li><strong><em>Quibble Race</em></strong> – In this unique sci-fi “horse-<a title="Genres > Racing [184 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a>” game, the goal is to win more money than your opponents, but why stop at betting? Thanks to the seedy alien underworld, you can hire thugs to tamper with the race or even sponsor your own quibble to earn extra credits. But your opponents can do the same, so the question is… how well can you anticipate their actions? Up to three players can compete in this turn-based game of betting and bluffing.</li><li><strong><em>Pingolf</em></strong> – A fan favorite at PAX, <em>Pingolf</em> is another fun multiplayer game that mixes golf with pinball. As you navigate 18 holes filled with bumpers, trampolines, and other crazy obstacles, a dot matrix display will light up at the bottom of the screen to cheer you on!</li><li><strong><em>Seaside Drive</em></strong> – Sometimes you’ll want a break from long, <a title="Genres > Open-World [413 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world games</a> and challenging strategy titles, so why not jump into a straight-forward arcade-style <a title="Genres > Action [1,887 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> like <em>Seaside Drive</em>? But even in a popular genre, <em>UFO 50</em> brings something new to the table—in this case, Ojiro Fumoto (the creator of <em>Downwell</em>) designed a stylish car-based shoot ’em up where “drifting” across the screen is how you power-up your gun.</li><li><strong><em>Grimstone</em></strong> – Yes, there is a full blown JRPG in the collection! <em>Grimstone</em> follows many conventions from 8-bit console RPGs, but is streamlined for a modern audience. Also, to make combat more engaging, we added a skill-based component to battles and encounters on the overworld can be strategically avoided. The story takes place in the American Wild West, where somehow the land has been swallowed up by Hell! Creating your party from the ashes of a burned-down saloon, you’ll be looking for answers as to why it happened.</li></ul><p>And that’s just five games! Out of 50! So come join us and enjoy this collection of 8-bit classics from another dimension! There’s something for everyone!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new developer diary below.</p><h2><span>Day of the Devs 2024 Segment</span></h2><p><iframe title="Day of the Devs: UFO 50  #SummerGameFest" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MS0IbfGFIPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In fact, what we’ve seen in our testing so far is that players new to real-time strategy or less familiar with the genre have been able to learn <em>Battle Aces</em> and grow in skill more quickly than any real-time strategy our team has ever worked on before.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682180/Battle_Aces/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In the year 2651, humanity has claimed the solar system, but it teeters on the brink of turmoil. Despite significant advancements, human expansion beyond the solar system is halted by the vastness of space. Now, a breakthrough in teleportation technology has revolutionized warfare, shifting from traditional manned combat to sophisticated drone-based conflicts. In this new era, commander-mercenaries known as Battle Aces have risen as masters of tactical drone combat. Coveted assets among the system’s powers, they ignite fierce competition for their allegiance and serve contracts to claim territory and military objectives.</p><p>In a recent cataclysmic event, the mysterious destruction of Mercury has triggered a dire scramble for survival and contested resources. As society reels from the devastation, entrenched tensions escalate into a full-blown conflict.

Set during the twilight of the Age of Exploration, you embark on an arduous journey in search of rumored riches, but encounter the island’s mysterious wrath. Uncover the truth behind Aeternum’s dark secrets, navigate its strange inhabitants, and pursue perilous opportunities alongside your fellow <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,521 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>rs. What story will you bring to the Eternal Isle?

Join Game Director Scot Lane for an overview of what to expect.</p><p><strong>Explore the Eternal Isle</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The shipwreck was only your first step into the clutches of an island lost to time. Death does not exist here. An even worse sentence — a lose of memory, purpose, and self—awaits. For all immortality gives, it continues to take. The mindless hordes possessed by the insatiable evils of the Corrupted only accelerate this vicious cycle. Whether by coincidence or fate, you learn of an ancient order that stood against those seduced by whispers of power. Choose how to shape your journey as you unravel Aeternum’s mysteries and thwart the Corrupted before they drift beyond its shores.</p><p><strong>Forge Your Future</strong></p><p>Everything from your character to their outfit, weapons, tools, mounts, camp skins, and emotes are fully customizable. That flexibility extends to the rest of your journey as the entire story can be completed alone or with friends across all platforms. Learn various Trade Skills like <a title="Genres > Cooking [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">Cooking</a>, <a title="Genres > Crafting [16 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a>, Musical Instruments, and Fishing along the way for an even more immersive experience. Need stronger gear? Craft a sword and sell it at the nearest settlement. Want more coin to purchase a house? Play an instrument at the center of a bustling town for tips. There are multiple ways to progress and grow in power.</p><p>Factions are another way to forge your legacy. You can join either the Covenant, <a title="Games > Marauders [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/marauders">Marauders</a>, or Syndicate. Each steadfast in their beliefs, your allegiance will dictate your allies in <a title="Genres > Co-Op [172 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> activities. Together you can complete quests, fend off dangers in the open world, and even form a Company. Contribute to their reputation throughout Aeternum for additional rewards. Your fellow members might gift you gear for easier progression or revive you in chance encounters while traveling to their next destination. Lend a hand to help your Faction thrive.</p><p><strong>Play Your Way</strong></p><p>Discover your perfect combination of weapons, abilities, and skill trees to survive the island’s wild environment. Throughout the vast world, you’ll collect an arsenal of 15 distinct weapons. Finding the best one for your playstyle is part of the adventure. Early on you’ll select a character archetype. This will determine your starting weapons, better ease you into the dynamic, real-time combat, and include initial Trade Skill boosts. Regardless of your choice, you can freely switch between any of the following weapons after you find them:</p><ul><li>One-handed weapons: Hatchet, Rapier, Flail and Shield, Sword and Shield.</li><li>Ranged weapons: Blunderbuss, Bow, and Musket.</li><li>Two-handed weapons: Greatsword, Spear, Great Axe, and War Hammer.</li><li>Magical weapons: Void Gauntlet, Ice Gauntlet, Fire Staff, and Life Staff.</li></ul><p>Those that venture beyond the main story quest can enjoy a variety of activities. Interested in cooperative modes? Descend into Expeditions with friends and learn more about the island’s lore, team up with your fellow Adventurers in difficult trials against monstrous enemies like a colossal sandwurm, and fend off the Corrupted during Invasions. Feeling competitive? Join 1v1 Duels, 3v3 Arenas battles, 20v20 objective Outpost Rush games, and massive <a title="Genres > Open-World [413 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> Influence Races.

It quickly became apparent that M-Corp had a single priority: profit. Over the following long and painful decades, their growth-at-all-costs approach throttled the city’s once thriving creative and collective spirit. Fun and self-expression became a thing of the past. Skateboarding? Forget about it. If it wasn’t filling M-Corp’s coffers, it was out. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>*The fine folks at SV Legal would like us to state that any mention of alleged corruption or otherwise illegal activity is merely speculation.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2024, and it looks like M-Corp’s “alleged” misdeeds have finally caught up to them and, despite what Kook of The Castle Richie Dandle has been saying, it’s over for M-Corp and their reign of terrible vest.</p><p>That brings us to today and what comes next: a new era for San Vansterdam. Those guys made a serious mess, so things are a little nuts around here, but with the help of some old friends—and you—we’re confident we’ll be able to right the ship and get the city ready, (and knob-free!) for visitors in no time. </p><p>—Sammy (and friends)</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>An Update from M-Corp</span></h2><p><iframe title="An Update from M-Corp | skate." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCM3EfAz8FY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="126" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Gainax, the animation studio behind works such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-90s-anime-and-how-to-watch-them/">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/i-saw-the-first-episode-of-flcl-progressive-lets-talk-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FLCL</a>, </em>and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-main-character-of-net-high-still-totally-looks-like-gurren-laganns-kamina/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gurren Lagann</a></em>, has filed for bankruptcy. </p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">According to the <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/gainax-the-studio-behind-the-evangelion-series-goes-bankrupt-amidst-unmanageable-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automaton report</a> and translation, Gainax acknowledged a May 29 Tokyo District Court filing had been accepted. The company stated its cause for bankruptcy was due to mismanagement that began around 2012. Those troubles reportedly surfaced when management and executives began operating the company to suit their private goals, which involved various unprofitable ventures and taking out risky loans.</p>
 <h2 id="h-hideaki-anno-and-gainax" data-injectable="false">Hideaki Anno and Gainax</h2> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false"><em>Evangelion</em> series creator Hideaki Anno has always been known for having a <a href="https://kotaku.com/online-hate-took-evangelion-creator-hideaki-anno-to-a-d-1846533756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complicated relationship with his work and <em>especially </em>its fans</a>. The problem might’ve been caused or fueled by Gainax itself. Despite the success of <em>Evangelion,</em> Anno claims he <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2019-12-30/hideaki-anno-details-his-falling-out-with-gainax/.154892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ended up never receiving fair compensation</a> for the profits the series had earned. Anno ended up leaving the company in 2007.</p> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">Anno went on to form studio Khara, which then acquired the rights to <em>Evangelion</em> and made the <em>Rebuild</em> series. This all unfolded as part of Gainax’s attempt to stay afloat by selling its popular IPs, but that was far from the painless separation one might have anticipated. </p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">In 2019, Gainax president Tomohiro Maki was<a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2020/12/14/ex-gainax-president-maki-tomohiro-is-sentenced-to-more-than-2-years-in-prison-for-indecent-assault" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> arrested for sexual misconduct</a>. Anno had long departed the company, but was still associated with Gainax in the public eye. The<em> Evangelion </em>creator went on to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/neon-genesis-evangelion-creator-hideaki-anno-speaks-out-about-gainax-controversy.html/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly thank</a> those affected for speaking out.</p> <h2 id="h-the-slow-end-of-gainax" data-injectable="false">The slow end of Gainax</h2> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">Though the studio is known for animating a library of classics over its 40 years of existence, it was never a stranger to turmoil. Even back in 1992, when Gainax was seemingly at the top of its game during the heyday of <em>Evangelion</em>, it saw the departure of important figures such as Shinji Higuchi, the known filmmaker and namesake of <em>Evangelion’s </em>Shinji Ikari.</p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">Mismanagement caused Gainax to enter a slow decline in the 2010s, and what kept it from going under before was the support received from Anno’s Khara. Still, the company’s leadership was incapable of dealing with the large amount of debt that the company had accumulated over many years of poor decisions.</p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="false">It’s disappointing to see the studio fall, but ultimately, it had been in decline for years before its financial ruin. The Gainax of 2024 is a stark contrast from the days of<em> Evangelion</em>,<em> FLCL, </em>and <em>Gurren Lagann.</em> </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Geoff Mentions Layoffs, In The Most Geoff Way Possible]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/keighley-summer-game-fest-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geoff-mentions-layoffs-in-the-most-geoff-way-possible.894150/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/keighley-summer-game-fest-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the big questions leading up to Summer Game Fest has been if host Geoff Keighley would acknowledge the layoffs rocking the video game industry. After failing to respond to his own <a href="https://aftermath.site/one-week-and-2600-signatures-later-game-awards-havent-acknowledged-future-class-palestine-letter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Future Class’ demands</a> that he mention Palestine in 2023, and after his <a href="https://screenrant.com/tga-2021-geoff-keighley-activision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awkward pseudo-mention of the Activision Blizzard accusations at The Game Awards in 2021</a>, things didn’t look good. But tonight, he did it! Sort of.</p><p>After horrifying us all at the top of the show by letting us know it would be two hours long, Keighley said,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>But let’s also face it, this has been a tumultuous and difficult year, with company layoffs and studio closures which have disappointed all of us.&nbsp;</p><p>But there’s also something else happening: our industry is evolving and changing, and thanks to digital distribution, smaller teams and new creators are finding incredible success. Take a look at this list from <a href="https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1799185903300366414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameDiscover</a> of the top 10 best-selling new games on Steam so far this year. Two of them are considered, you know, big company games, but the other eight come from indie, mid-sized teams or solo developers.&nbsp;</p><p>I look at this list and I get inspired that new ideas, new teams and smaller creators can and will break through. It’s a reminder to big companies that they have to treat their developers right, because today there are many paths to sustainability and success, and that’s what makes this industry so, so great.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>First, the bad: Because he’s him, he said this mostly while smiling stiffly, his affect failing to quite match the severity of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10,000 layoffs</a> so far this year. “Disappointed” isn’t the <em>wrong</em> emotion, but it doesn’t quite feel like the main one to me. (I might suggest: Rage? Horror? <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1798905939497738456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sadness</a>? Is “late stage capitalism” an emotion?)&nbsp;</p><p>Also, I’m not quite convinced by his conclusion that these numbers are why big companies should “treat their developers right, because today there are many paths to sustainability and success.” Is he saying companies shouldn’t lay people off because they might just go indie instead? I’m not sure that’s a threat in the face of game studio layoffs, the outcome of which is getting rid of developers. You might imagine studios cutting hundreds of employees would <em>want</em> them to go indie–no severance!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the good: Maybe he’s saying these indie successes aren’t threats, but models for other ways studios could operate. He also said, “I look at this list and I get inspired that new ideas, new teams and smaller creators can and will break through.” And he’s right–as we’ve talked about here at Aftermath, 2024 has been awash in excellent indie and smaller-studio games, presenting an alternative to AAA’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-palworld-helldivers-manor-lords-aaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thin release calendar</a> and obsession with <a href="https://aftermath.site/give-me-janky-mid-tier-games-over-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live service</a>. As <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-games-pc-2024-may-hades-2-little-kitty-1000xresist-manor-lords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke wrote</a>,</p><blockquote><p>The industry might be struggling, but the medium is going strong. The last month has felt like a glimpse of what a possible (I'm sorry) aftermath to a second great video game crisis might look like. Most of the games I've mentioned above are small in comparison to their bloated AAA counterparts. They're mostly available on PC, mostly insulated from the whims of large publishers and platform holders.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>While I personally cringed at the line “thanks to digital distribution,” it felt nice to see him acknowledge what’s going on in games outside of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-many-game-awards-acceptance-speeches-could-have-taken-place-while-kojima-was-talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big names</a> that he loves to tout, and whose announcements, as we <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned this week</a>, keep his empire afloat. Combined with information this week that he gives<a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472?rev=1717690520392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> at least some free space</a> in his shows to indies, alongside seeing <em>Among Us</em> developer Innersloth’s <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/outersloth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of an indie fund</a>, I wouldn’t say indie games are the stars of Geoff’s empire, but I can admire the in-roads they’re making between Samsung ads and whatever the hell that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMH_SGJciQY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Supercell thing</a> was.</p><p>And hey: He <em>did</em> it! And straightaway at the top of the show, too–before, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-geoff-keighley-layoff-palworld-balatro-1851527203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku’s Ethan Gach</a> points out, pivoting into a trailer for “<a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-real-gameplay-ps5-pc-trailer-1851526168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></a>, co-developed by Guerrilla Games, one of the Sony studios that suffered several layoffs earlier this year.” I can sympathize, to a very small extent, for the bind in which he finds himself, trying not to alienate the giant audiences that make his shows worth advertising in <em>or</em> the companies who <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-summer-game-fest-price" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertise</a> in them. He responded to audience demands and acknowledged the most pressing thing happening in the industry I do believe he earnestly loves, and about which I’m sure, behind closed doors, his emotions are bigger than just being disappointed. So, all things considered, I’ll give him this one. You did it, man. It wasn’t quite what many of us wanted, but it was still a pleasant surprise.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>And there's a new trailer too.</p>

            <p>
Following Monster Hunter Wilds' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tU2XOxD9HM">latest trailer reveal</a> during Summer Game Fest, Capcom has been sharing more on what players can expect from the latest game in its hugely popular creature-battling series - confirming cross-play is in for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5, while still insisting cross-save is 'not possible'.
</p>
<p>
That information comes via a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/">new update on the Monster Hunter website</a>, which explains players on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam will all be able to match with - and become friends with - each other, regardless of platform. However, cross-play can be disabled if players prefer.
</p>
<p>
The news is considerably less positive for anyone hoping Capcom might finally pull its finger out and implement cross-save for Monster Hunter this time around. The publisher confirms save data - including the likes of game progress and paid DLC - will be managed separately on each platform. As such, it insists it will "not be possible" to share save data across platforms.

<p>
The good news, of course, is that Monster Hunter Wilds is currently expected to release simultaneously on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC - meaning the lack of cross-save should be less of an issue without the staggered platform releases seen with Monster Hunter World and Rise.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-first-look-at-monster-hunter-wilds-coming-in-2025">unveiled</a> during last year's The Game Awards, along with a vague release date of 2025. It features new mounts called Seikrets, some very chatty cutscenes, large migrating herds of smaller creatures, and multiple biomes. Not the most enthralling stuff, admittedly, but hopefully Capcom will share more substantial details soon.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds launches for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC next year.

            <title><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong Won’t Be On Xbox At Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-won%E2%80%99t-be-on-xbox-at-launch.894135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>While many expected Black Myth: Wukong to be on PlayStation 5 (PS5), Xbox Series X|S, and PC when it releases on August 20, that won’t be the case anymore. Instead, Black Myth: Wukong will only be available on PC and PS5 when it first releases.</p>



<p>The game was originally confirmed for Xbox Series X|S at The Game Awards 2023. However, after releasing a new trailer at Summer Game Fest 2024, it was revealed that the Xbox version of the <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game was being held back</a>.</p>



<p>“PC and PS5 users can enjoy the full game starting August 20, 2024,” developer Game Science <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says in its “pre-order FAQ”</a>. “We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards, so it won’t release simultaneously with the other platforms. </p>



<p>“We apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards.”</p>



<p>As far as an Xbox release date, that wasn’t confirmed by the company. Nor was there any hint as to when a release date would be revealed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Devolver Direct 2024: Everything Announced]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/devolver-direct-2024-everything-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/devolver-direct-2024-everything-announced.894132/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/devolver-direct-2024-everything-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Happy Volvy's birthday, I guess? Devolver Digital just wrapped its annual Devolver Direct which, among plenty of weirdness, included a number of big game announcements. We got two new game reveals, including one from the devs of Hyper Light Drifter, new DLC for games like Cult of the Lamb, and release dates for The Crush House and Anger Foot.</p><p>A time was certainly had by all, but if you missed the show and don't want to go back and watch a 30-minute video of a lonely man trying to prepare for a birthday party, here's a quick recap of the announcements:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Tenjutsu</h2><p>The first of two brand new games announced during the event, Tenjutsu comes from Dead Cells designer Sébastien Benard. It's a "rogue-jutsu" game set in a crumbling city, where you play as a renegade yakuza taking down her former colleagues. Tenjutsu looks to be something like a combination of Dead Cells, Streets of Rage, and Sifu — your goal is to take down four crime syndicates, which you can tackle in any order as you slowly improve your skills at a complex brawler fighting system. You can also use resources you collect to build up the city with shops and restaurants, but spending too much time preparing will result in stronger enemies. Tenjutsu is coming to PC and consoles, but no release date just yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Possessor(s)</h2><p>In Devolver's second game announcement of the evening, we took a look at Possessor(s). Art style look familiar? Yup, this is from Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash developer Heart Machine. It's a side-scroller action game with sci-fi horror elements where you play as Luca and her counterpart Rehm. The two explore a city wrecked by an interdimensional catastrophe. Possessor(s) has an open-ended world structure with multiple possible paths available at any given time, and focuses on tight combat, challenging bosses, and exploration. Possessor(s) is coming to PC and console in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>The Crush House</h2><p>I've been obsessed with The Crush House since it was first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-crush-house-preview-thirst-person-shooter">revealed earlier this year</a>. It's a novel premise for a game: you're a producer on the titular reality TV show set at a Malibu mansion. Every week, you select a four-person cast from 12 total actors and let them loose in The Crush House, filming spicy moments over several days to satisfy your drama-loving audience. When you're not filming, you'll likely spend your time obsessing over details like decorations, props, or other ways you can capture different audience segments...though you'll also quickly realize there's a deeper mystery going on beneath the brightly color veneer of the house. During today's Devolver Direct, we saw a new trailer for The Crush House capped with a release date: it's coming out on August 9 on PC, with a Steam demo available now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Anger Foot</h2><p>Free Lives, developers of Broforce, Gorn, and Terra Nil, were also at the Devolver Direct with their upcoming game, Anger Foot. We actually <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anger-foot-is-like-john-wick-with-some-extra-kick">went hands-on with Anger Foot</a> not long ago, and really enjoyed its compelling take on the stylings of Hotline Miami, but with a lot more kicking. It's a first-person...shooter? More like kicker. You kick your way through a place literally called Shit City, bringing down enemies, replaying levels with different types of kickers, and upgrading your weapons and sneakers as you go. Anger Foot is coming soon — it'll be out on PC on July 11.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>The Talos Principle 2 - Road to Elysium</h2><p>The Talos Principle 2 came out late last year, and we <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-talos-principle-2-review">praised its simultaneous exploration</a> of both puzzling and philosophy in our 8/10 review. But Croteam showed up to the Devolver Direct to expand on what it established in the base game with the Road to Elysium DLC, now with a release date of June 14. Road to Elysium takes place after the events of The Talos Principle 2, bringing back familiar characters and expanding on certain major moments from the game. It takes place over three distinct chapters, each with a different vibe and a different character perspective.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Cult of the Lamb - Unholy Alliance</h2><p>Finally, Cult of the Lamb stopped into the birthday party to share some news about an upcoming free update, Unholy Alliance. Unholy Alliance brings a new playable character, the Goat, to the game for the addition of local co-op. Local co-op brings with it certain new challenges, such as twists on existing minigames, the ability to swap weapons between the two characters, deal extra damage if fighting back to back, and plenty more. There are also new rewards being added to the game for solo players, so don't worry if you don't have a Goat buddy. Unholy Alliance will release on August 12 for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.</p><p>That's it for <s>Volvy's Birthday</s> the Devolver Direct! You can catch up on everything from Summer Game Fest and Day of the Devs earlier today with our round-ups here and here, and stick with IGN for everything else Summer of Gaming all month long.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

According to the developer, both the physical Deluxe and Collector's Editions will come with digital activation codes for the Digital Deluxe edition of the game, but will not have a disc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In an FAQ, Game Science explained that this was due to limitations on resources, but said it was looking into releasing discs in the future.</p><blockquote>It is the first time for Game Science to release a console game globally, and we are currently facing limitations in offline resources required for the import, export, transportation, distribution, and sales of physical discs. These factors have made it difficult for us to sell physical discs simultaneously with the official release of the game.</blockquote><blockquote>Our publishing team is actively working on resolving these issues and exploring options to offer physical discs.</blockquote><p>In the same FAQ, Game Science also announced its Xbox edition of the game would be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-ditches-xbox-series-x-and-s-version">released sometime after the PlayStation and PC editions</a>, as the studio is "currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards."</p><p>Last year, IGN wrote an extensive report examining a number of sexist remarks and attitudes made by Game Science founders and members over the last decade.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-interview-the-creator-of-silent-hill-explains-their-new-horror-game-exclusive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In December 2020, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-creator-remake-more-difficult-resident-evil">Keiichiro Toyama announced the establishment of Bokeh Game Studio</a>, a new development company he founded together with select cohorts from his days at Sony’s now defunct Japan Studio. With Toyama’s resume including beloved titles like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill">original Silent Hill</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/siren">Siren</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/gravity-rush">Gravity Rush</a>, many fans had been looking forward to seeing his next creation.</p><p>Now, four years later, Slitterhead is ready to release this November as Bokeh Game Studio’s debut title. I was fortunate enough to actually play the horror action adventure game, and you can read my impressions in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-exclusive-preview-a-combination-of-silent-hill-siren-and-gravity-rush">exclusive preview article</a>. Following my session with the game, I interviewed Toyama as well as producer Kazunobu Sato and game director Junya Okura.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Many fans have been eagerly awaiting a new horror experience from you. After playing the demo, I thought it was rare for a game that leans so heavily on horror elements to have a melee combat system. Could you tell us the reason behind this?</strong> </p><p><strong>Keiichiro Toyama, Founder, Bokeh Game Studio:</strong> We wanted players who enjoy modern action games to be able to enjoy Slitterhead, so we aimed for a game that is easy to familiarise yourself if you are used to playing recent games.</p><p><strong>Possessing and controlling multiple different characters functions as Slitterhead’s key mechanic. How did you come up with this idea?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>With Slitterhead, we wanted to reinterpret the concept we originally had for Siren. Over the years, Siren has become somewhat of a cult classic, and I’m always honored when I hear people say they want to see it get revived. In Siren, you could dive inside the brain of other characters through a feature we called sightjacking. We wanted to evolve this idea by making it possible to possess and freely move around as other characters. This became the core of Slitterhead’s game design.</p><p><strong>It’s unique and interesting from a gameplay perspective, but when you’re continuously possessing different characters, doesn’t it become difficult for the player to know what or who they are? How did you approach this idea from a narrative standpoint?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> That’s something we’ve become quite good at through our previous games. While there are elements that confuse the player, I am confident that players will enjoy Slitterhead’s story. At first you might not be sure of what you are, but as you advance through the game there's an interesting narrative and relatable characters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With Slitterhead, we wanted to reinterpret the concept we originally had for Siren</p></div><p><strong>While you are reinterpreting Siren’s game design in a modern way, the setting of Slitterhead is quite different from Siren’s Japanese village.</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> That’s right. Slitterhead is set in a fictional Asian city during the early 1990s. Nostalgia for a world long gone is one of the main themes we had for the city. For example, many of the neon sign boards that used to be so common in Asian cities are getting removed these days. If you take a city like Hong Kong, you can see how much has changed. The first time I visited Hong Kong was in the 2000s. If I had gone earlier, I could have seen airplanes fly right above the city to reach Kai Tak Airport, which was located in the middle of the city. Drawing inspiration from places we would have liked to see or go is something we did a lot in Slitterhead.</p><p><strong>Wasn’t it difficult to recreate sights and locations that no longer exist?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> It was definitely challenging as there wasn’t always a lot of documentation to work from. That said, our environmental artists were extremely passionate about recreating the scenes they were inspired by. Some members even applied to work with us because they wanted to design a city like this. Some of them were so devoted that they put real-world details into the game that I’m not even familiar with!</p><p><strong>Were you also inspired by Hong Kong movies from the ’90s?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>Definitely. When I was a student, Wong Kar-wai’s movies became popular. His movies changed the way I looked at Hong Kong cinema. When I was a kid, Jackie Chan movies were the first thing you would think about. I was captivated by the modernness and beauty of Wong Kar-wai’s movies.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Slitterhead Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><strong>I was impressed by the NPCs walking the streets. They were really detailed and their fashion and hairstyles perfectly matched the city’s atmosphere. I was even more surprised to actually be able to possess and walk around as them.</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> That’s great to hear. I think there are not many games that allow you to control this many characters. In the original proposal, I wrote that every person in the city should be a playable character. For game design reasons, we had to limit the amount of characters you can possess, but it’s still a lot. The motion differs depending on the character, so I hope players will enjoy feeling the difference.</p><p><strong>It’s a nice touch that the character you are possessing at that moment also appears during cutscenes.</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>Yes, we tried to do that as much as possible. There were a lot of difficulties upon doing this. For example, weird stuff would happen for characters with different heights.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>I got to play the beginning of the game which had me explore the city, and later the insides of a condominium building. Is Slitterhead an open world game, or does it take a stage-based structure?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>It’s stage based. Everything takes place within the city, but depending on the stage you get to see different situations and can experience the city from different angles. </p><p><strong>How long does the average stage take, and how long does it take to beat the entire game?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>Stages are about 30 minutes long. It should take players around 15 hours to see the credits roll. After that, you can enjoy the remaining challenges. </p><p><strong>The stages I got to play were both during the nighttime. Are there any stages that play out during the day?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>We narrowed the situations down to nighttime. It matches the atmosphere of the city better, and if we were to change the time of the day we would also have to change the atmosphere of characters, which would be a lot of work. Also, daytime situations are more challenging to fit in a horror game.</p><p><strong>Kazunobu Sato, Producer:</strong> In the original proposal we did have some daytime situations, but to make the experience more focused we decided to cut them.</p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> I think we had about two or three times the amount of situations in the original proposal.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In the original proposal we did have some daytime situations, but to make the experience more focused we decided to cut them</p></div><p><strong>Slitterhead has impressive city environments, horror elements, is narrowed down to nighttime, and you can reach the top of buildings. All this reminded me of Tango Gameworks’ Ghostwire: Tokyo. Did you notice the same similarities when that game was released in 2022?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>Yes. Both (Shinji) Mikami and producer (Masato) Kimura are good friends of ours. When I heard that they went through twists and turns to come up with the game they did, it was easy for me to understand. I was shocked how well Ghostwire: Tokyo’s Shibuya was crafted though… It’s kind of scary to think that people expect something of that quality nowadays.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>I personally thought that Slitterhead’s city had a similar amount of detail to it.</strong></p><p><strong>Sato: </strong>That’s great to hear. When Ghostwire: Tokyo released, we were in the midst of developing Slitterhead. Their final product was something that felt quite close to what we were doing. Ghostwire: Tokyo is a first-person shooter that takes place in Tokyo, while Slitterhead has melee combat in a culturally Chinese setting, so they’re obviously very different games. That being said, as a product there’s definitely a similarity which I think works to our benefit. During presentations etc, mentioning how <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghostwire-tokyo">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a> turned out was a convenient way for us to convey the image of Slitterhead.   </p><p><strong>The monsters in Slitterhead are based on Yegouzi, a supernatural being in Chinese folklore. How did you come up with this?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama</strong>: I was inspired by monsters that appear in Japanese comics. Monsters that eat humans appear quite often, but that alone wouldn’t differentiate us enough. After looking into it, I learned about Yegouzi, a Chinese monster that eats human brains, so I decided to flesh out that idea.</p><p><strong>Did the idea of Yegouzi come first, or did you already have the idea of an Asian city before that?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> The city came first. I wanted to make a game about an Asian city in which a mysterious incident occurs. When searching for an enemy that matches this setting, I learned about Yegouzi.</p><p><strong>Is there a wide array of enemy types in the game’s different stages?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>We developed a very rich and complex design for Yegouzi. We’re using this design as the base for all enemy types, but we created a lot of variation by giving it different looks, abilities and so on. Rather than creating a wide variation of enemy’s from scratch, we’re using one well-developed design in different ways. Slitterhead is Bokeh Game Studio’s first game, so this approach was more realistic for us.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/07/image-from-ios-1-1717803479104.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Keiichiro Toyama shows off Bokeh Ale.

Why did you decide to have an action-focused experience rather than focusing more on adventure and exploration?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> With games like FromSoftware titles, many gamers today are used to playing challenging and hardcore games. With that in mind, I thought that as long as we make the action feel good there would be the potential for more players to be interested in our game. Since I’m known as the creator of Silent Hill, I’m aware of the fact that many people are hoping for something closer to a horror adventure game. That makes me very honored, but the problem is that horror adventure games are kind of similar to extremely spicy food. People that are into it love it, but other people don’t really bother to try it out. </p><p>That’s why we decided to keep the essence of horror games while making a game that feels good to play. Of course we could have made a horror adventure game, but since many of our team members worked on the Gravity Rush series, we already had a team that knows how to develop good action gameplay. It is important to know what kind of game you want to make, but thinking about the potential and strengths of your team is important as well. With the team we currently have at Bokeh Game Studio, making a game focused on action just seemed like the right choice.</p><p><strong>While Slitterhead is mainly focused on action, I did get to enjoy some exploration elements during my playtime as well. The game started with a section in which I had to follow a visualized trail of scent as a stray dog, and later I had to roam the city to find lost memories of the spirit that I was controlling. What other types of exploration can players expect?</strong></p><p><strong>Sato:</strong> While indeed action is the game’s main element, there is some exploration as well. For example, there’s a part in which Yegouzi is hiding in human form, and you have to find out which human body it is hiding in.</p><p><strong>Junya Okura, Director:</strong> Since you don’t know what human body Yegouzi is hiding in, you have to go about and find out by talking to people and finding traces that lead to it. It’s kind of like an investigation part.</p><p><strong>Does the game have any side quests?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> With the limited budget we have, we decided to focus on the main experience rather than expanding the experience with optional content. </p><p><strong>During combat, you can attack, block, dodge and deflect, covering all the standard bases for a modern action game. What is it that makes Slitterhead’s combat unique?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> The fact that the character you’re controlling constantly changes. The main concept was my idea, but Okura – who was also the lead designer for Gravity Rush – created the game system based on that concept.</p><p><strong>Okura:</strong> Toyama said that he wanted me to utilize the possession mechanic as much as possible. It made me think of what would happen in a game in which you can freely possess different characters in a city. What kind of gameplay could we create based on that idea? Actually, we have a few main characters as well, and I came up with a system in which you switch between them. These main characters all have different characteristics and can use different skills.</p><p><strong>I got to play as a female character with claws as well as a character that uses Chinese martial arts. It was fun to be able to enjoy different movesets.</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama: </strong>Thank you. We gave each of these characters their own background. For example, one is a homeless guy who used to be a professional boxer. The motion of their attacks match their backgrounds, so I hope that players can enjoy that variety. Also, in the game’s proposal I wrote that the human body is weak and should be disposed of as you fight. This is something that Okura implemented in the game very well.</p><p><strong>Okura: </strong>The game expects you to dispose of the bodies that you have controlled. It works in your advantage to sacrifice them as you play.</p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> We noticed that many of the test players found this hard to get used to.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The 12 Best Horror Games on PC</h3></div></output><p><strong>You get attached to the old lady you’re controlling, right?</strong></p><p><strong>Okura:</strong> Yes, you get attached to them and try to keep them alive. But actually, sacrificing them works to your advantage.</p><p><strong>Sato:</strong> When playing with the same mindset as in other games, you tend to try to defeat the enemy using the same character. That’s why we make it clear during the tutorial that it’s OK to sacrifice bodies. It’s interesting to see players trying to protect the lives of the characters they control at first, and how they start to care less and less as they get used to the game. </p><p><strong>I played the game on Easy mode and had no real difficulties defeating the game’s enemies. How different are the Normal, Hard and Nightmare difficulty modes?</strong></p><p><strong>Okura:</strong> Depending on the difficulty mode, the frequency and damage of enemy attacks change. That means that combat becomes more challenging, but adventure parts stay the same. Normal is the difficulty that we think will suit the average player best, while Hard is the difficulty we originally wanted to go for. Nightmare is for people who want a real challenge. Actually, I’m making that one for myself! But it still isn’t so difficult that players won’t be able to beat the game.</p><p><strong>Sato:</strong> Are you sure about that? For me it’s too difficult!</p><p><strong>Okura:</strong> Well, I do die a few times myself (when playing on Nightmare mode)...</p><p><strong>What were some of the main inspiration sources for Slitterhead?</strong> </p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> There’s a lot, but I was especially inspired by manga like Gantz, Parasyte and Tokyo Ghoul. A lot of people die and the essence of horror is there, but at the same time these manga are focused on battle action, which I think makes them more accessible. Horror is quite a hardcore genre, so I looked at how these manga made horror more approachable for a wider audience. They have horror-like situations in which you’re worried that a certain character might die soon, but at the same time the battle action component makes it more entertaining for a casual audience. This is an approach unique to Japanese manga that I haven’t really seen overseas, so I wanted to bring that essence to video game format.</p><p><strong>You’re collaborating with Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka for the first in a long time. How did this come to be?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> We had been saying to each other that we wanted to do something together again for a long time, and with Slitterhead we finally got the chance. Working together with him again made me realize just how much of a genius he is. I hardly ever had to direct him into the right direction. Every song he composed was a perfect fit. For Slitterhead, he didn’t just compose music but was in charge of the game’s sound as a whole. The Cantonese pop song you hear during the opening of the game was composed by him as well. I really like that song. Yamaoka might be best known for dry rock music, but he’s actually really good at composing more ethereal songs as well. I think the latter is well represented in Slitterhead.</p><p><strong>Slitterhead is set to release for not just current gen consoles and PC, but also PS4. Are there any differences between the PS4 version and other platforms?</strong></p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> Slitterhead can be enjoyed in 4K with 60 fps on the other platforms, but it’s 1080p and 30 fps for the PS4 version. We didn’t want Slitterhead to be only playable on high-end PCs, but also on the middle end, which made it possible to make it compatible with PS4 as well. Since Slitterhead is not a AAA title, developing it as a game that would only be playable on the PS5 would have made it too expensive. We decided to develop it on a realistic scale and finish the game on time.</p><p><strong>I think it’s pretty rare to actually have a game released within three or four years after opening a new studio these days.</strong></p><p><strong>Sato:</strong> I’m happy to hear that. But indeed, if we had made something that only runs on PS5, we probably would have still been working on it right now.</p><p><strong>Toyama:</strong> I think that the fact that we didn’t try to make a game that can only be played on the newest hardware played a big role. It was the best thing to do given the size of our studio and it made the game accessible for more players at the same time.</p><p>Slitterhead is set to release on PS5\PS4\Xbox Series X|S/PC (Steam/Epic Games) on November 8, 2024.</p><p><em>Blogroll photo credit: Esra Krabbe / IGN Japan.</em></p><p><a href="https://x.com/RineD1987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.
