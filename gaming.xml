		<p>Quarantine Zone may not be released in November, according to an update from developer Brigada Games, but the studio is still aiming for a 2025 release. The change to the release date has come due to feedback from players who are testing Quarantine Zone in a closed playtest, and that feedback has led to the team needing to make changes before release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Quarantine Zone: The Last Check | Demo Gameplay Trailer | Demo releases on May 22nd, 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kH06uTaVMTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Brigada Games wrote, <em>“Hello, everyone! Some of you have seen that info on our Steam page was first changed from November to simply 2025. Currently we are running a closed playtest and while it is ongoing – us (the developer team) and the publisher will determine the exact release date but as of yesterday we’re still working toward a 2025 release. We might require some extra time to polish the game, thanks to the copius amount of feedback we are receiving and processing at the moment. The decision on the exact release date and price will be made soon, and we will update everyone the moment it is made. We apologize for the uncertainty but rest assured we’re furiously working on the game, taking in feedback, and working to figure out the best release date to get you all into Quarantine Zone!”</em></p>
<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is set in a world that is facing a zombie outbreak, and you are a checkpoint guard. Your job is to stop anyone infected with the zombie virus, as well as anyone carrying contraband, from passing your checkpoint to a safe zone. Fail and it could lead to catastrophe. As a guard, players are equipped with scanners to detect the virus, but other resources are limited so decisions will need to be made to keep the camp safe.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-yakuza-kiwami-switch-2-kiryus-debut-smoother-than-ever.1351621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It only feels like yesterday that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yakuza_kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> finally made its way onto the Switch, and yet here we are with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">a beefed-up Switch 2 version</a>. This new release is effectively the same game, but Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have taken advantage of the newer console’s specs for a much smoother, crisper experience.</p>
<p>Crucially, the frame rate has been greatly improved here, sticking to 60fps that (to my eyes, at least) never falters. It makes exploring Kamurocho all the more enjoyable, and even the busiest scraps with Yakuza thugs run smoothly. The resolution has been bumped up considerably in docked and handheld, bringing it more in line with launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>. It looks wonderful.</p>
<p>And yes, the game itself is still the same, which, in my opinion, is a good thing. There’s really nothing else quite like Yakuza, except maybe, well… other Yakuza games. You’ve got this super-compelling narrative at its core involving backstabbing criminals, corrupt politicians, and devoted friends that succumb to darkness, and it does a great job at keeping you engaged with superb Japanese voice performances (no Western dub here, though).</p>
<p>It’s stuffed with utterly ridiculous moments that, in anything else, would undoubtedly detract from the overarching plot, but it just works so well here. You can play bowling, pool, darts, and even sing karaoke. The juxtaposition between the serious narrative and the ludicrous sidequests is sublime – it’s just such a <em>video game</em>.</p>
<p>A lot of the focus is on melee combat, and with the combination of several distinct fighting styles with the option to purchase a plethora of upgrades throughout, it never quite loses its edge. Swapping between Rush, Brawler, Beast, and Dragon styles provides ample variety, and if you don’t fancy using your fists, you can always just pick up a bicycle and smash it into your foes' faces. Lovely stuff.</p>
<p>Some aspects can be a little grating, for sure. Boss fights go on for a little too long at times, while the overall pacing isn’t quite as satisfying as the aforementioned Yakuza 0. This is fundamentally a 2016 remake of a 2005 game, and the developers have taken great strides in subsequent years to polish the series further and ditch the features and mechanics that don’t <em>quite</em> work.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I’d still recommend starting with Yakuza 0 if you’re completely new to the series, but Kiwami is a perfectly fine place to dive in, too. It doesn’t feel quite so bloated as some of the later entries, yet it still flexes a peerless sense of style at every opportunity. Playing Kiwami portably on Switch 2 is a joy, and I sincerely hope Sega brings the entire series to the console. It’s found itself a great home.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-cosmetics-duos</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-to-lower-cosmetic-prices-duo-matchmaking-silently-tested-and-enabled.1351618/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>developer Embark Studios has revealed that it intends to lower the price of some of the extraction shooter's cosmetics soon, and that Duo-prioritized matchmaking has already been "silently tested and enabled".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> addressing some of the community's most common concerns, Embark says that its new system first prioritizes solo and squad players to play with those of their own kind, then "Duos to play with other Duos" and "Trios to play with Trios".</p>

<p>However, Embark says that the new system is "not 100% guaranteed", so it's possible you'll still find yourself running into "differing constellations of players other than your own". Still, given that this is one of the community's <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-players-plead-with-embark-studios-to-make-a-duos-mode-but-not-all-fans-of-the-new-shooter-are-convinced-this-game-isnt-meant-to-be-a-balanced-team-death-match/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">most-requested features</a>, it's a nice tip of the hat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arc-raiders-duos-cosmetics-aiming.jpg?itok=l6M-XOE4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arc-raiders-duos-cosmetics-aiming.jpg?itok=xVuNPjSs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>will now try to put Duos with other Duos in games.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as making things a little easier for duos, Embark says it will also lower the price of some of&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>' cosmetic items after hearing players' "feedback" on the matter.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "reviewed [its] prices and made adjustments to lower prices where applicable", and that new cosmetic item prices will come into effect tomorrow at 10:30 CET (that's around 4:30am Eastern).</p>

<p>If you've already bought the cosmetics in question, then you'll be compensated for the difference, with the Raider Tokens you've spent being "refunded back into your account automatically in the coming week".</p>

<p>Embark also says it will start to introduce new Raider Decks in the future, and that some of those decks will be paid, but that gameplay items will only be in free decks and that "no pay to win items" will be featured in premium decks.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is, it's a post-apocalyptic extraction shooter in which players must contend with deadly mechs and squads of other players as they loot areas and attempt to escape.</p>

<p>After multiple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-delay-pushes-release-date-to-2023" rel="nofollow">delays</a>, the game was released in late October, quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" rel="nofollow">racking up millions of sales</a>&nbsp;within the first two weeks of its launch.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-frame-is-a-surprising-new-twist-on-vr.1351609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve is about to launch a new virtual reality headset, and with it, a comprehensive new approach to what a VR device should be. Most VR headsets I’ve tried have ended up collecting dust after the novelty wore off, and I thought I had sworn off VR for good. But after trying Valve’s new headset for myself at the company’s headquarters, I was nearly ready to put down my credit card before I walked out the door.</p><p>The new headset is called the Steam Frame, and it’s trying to do several things at once. It’s a standalone VR headset with a smartphone-caliber Arm chip inside that lets you play flat-screen Windows games locally off the onboard storage or a microSD card. But the Frame’s arguably bigger trick is that it can <em>stream</em> games directly to the headset, bypassing your unreliable home Wi-Fi by using a short-range, high-bandwidth wireless dongle that plugs into your gaming PC. And its new controllers are packed with all the buttons and inputs you need for both flat-screen games <em>and</em> VR games.</p><p>The pitch: Either locally or over streaming, you can play every game in your Steam library on this lightweight headset, no cord required. I think Valve may be on to something.</p><p>As I explored an industrial level in <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, jumping from floor to floor and blasting headcrabs, I couldn’t tell at all that the game was being streamed to me from a nearby PC. I felt like I was playing it through a hardwired connection or natively on the headset itself.</p><p>The dongle, which comes in the box with the headset, streams your games over 6GHz spectrum — that’s its only job. It means that the experience has “low latency, high bandwidth, and lots of robustness,” Valve hardware engineer Jeremy Selan tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>When you’re streaming, to make what you’re looking at appear sharp and with low latency, the Frame uses a technique Valve calls “foveated streaming.”</p><p>You might be familiar with foveated <em>rendering</em>, which, in VR, enhances what’s directly in front of your eyes and lowers the resolution in your peripheral vision to optimize the performance of a headset. With foveated <em>streaming</em>, the Frame instead uses its two eye-tracking cameras to make it easier to sling compressed images from your PC. “Anywhere the user is looking, we spend as many bits as possible to give them a very high-fidelity, super-high-quality representation of where they’re looking, and we’ve borrowed those bits from everywhere else in the image,” Selan says.</p><p>It’s “always on and always active,” so game developers don’t have to do anything to make it work. The headset checks the position of your eyes more than 80 times a second.</p><p>At one point, Valve staffers entered a special command that placed a square in front of wherever my eyes were focused. While it was on, I couldn’t tell that the bits around the square were lower-fidelity, and as I whipped my eyes all over the virtual room, the square kept up without any discernible lag.</p><p>It was extremely impressive, and it means that, depending on your PC, the Frame could let you play high-end VR games on a light headset. The Frame weighs 440 grams with the headset and battery strap, roughly half as much as the approximately 809-gram Valve Index, which, unlike the Frame, also needed to be physically wired to a PC. Valve’s headset is also lighter than the 560-gram PSVR 2 and the 515-gram Meta Quest 3.</p><p>It’s nice to wear right out of the box, too, with an especially plush and silky face cushion and well-balanced counterweight thanks to the battery being placed on the back of the head strap. The strap also contains speakers — two per side, Valve says, spaced apart so they can cancel out their own vibrations before they affect the headset’s positioning sensors.</p><p>The comfort might come at the cost of performance, though. While it might seem like a Steam Deck for your face, the Frame won’t hit Steam Deck-levels of performance and battery when you’re playing on its own lightweight Arm system.</p><p>The Frame runs SteamOS on a last-generation phone chip, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it has to recompile Windows x86 game code on the fly using an emulator, named Fex, to let titles run on Arm. And at 21.6 watt-hours, the Frame’s battery is about half the capacity of an original Steam Deck, though you can plug any sufficiently powerful USB-C battery (45W) into the headset to extend its life. Valve is working to make streaming battery life “as efficient as possible,” Selan says, though playing six hours of <em>Hades II</em> over streaming would be “unlikely.”</p><p>In one demo, I played the standard x86 version of <em>Hades II</em> installed on the Frame on a big, 2D virtual theater screen, and I noticed a couple small gameplay stutters I never see on my Steam Deck or my Nintendo Switch 2. In a later demo of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, I noticed more stutters right away — and to my surprise, a Valve employee brought them up proactively, calling them “hitches.”</p><p>According to Valve hardware engineer Gabe Rowe, the company plans to let you download preconverted versions of the code when you start up a game to help get rid of those hitches, similar to how the Steam Deck downloads precompiled shaders for many games before you even launch them.</p><p>Right now, the performance in those games felt a little worrying, and I didn’t get to try anything that might tax the headset even further. However, Selan told us after our visit that the choppiness we saw was actually a bug and that Valve expects performance and stability to improve leading up to and after launch.</p><p>Valve is also planning a Steam Frame Verified program, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22947274/steam-deck-verified-playable-compatibility-games-feature">the Steam Deck Verified program</a> that adds green checkmark on the Steam store pages of games that play well on the Steam Deck with no modifications, so you can know which games run well locally.</p><p>But playing games locally isn’t the main point of the device — it’s mostly designed for streaming.</p><p>“Steam Frame is a wireless streaming headset, first and foremost,” designer Lawrence Yang tells <em>The Verge</em>. “That is what we’ve optimized a lot of things and a lot of decisions around, not only for hardware, but also in terms of software.”</p><p>Assuming Valve gets the issues worked out, the Frame could be a decent place to locally play lower-end games. Most of the time, it seems like you’re going to want to stream your games from a PC to the headset instead.</p><p>Regardless of how you boot up your games on the Frame, its two new included controllers should give you everything you need to actually play them. Between the controllers, you have access to two drift-resistant TMR joysticks, a D-pad, four face buttons, two bumpers, and two shoulder triggers, all of which should serve you well for flat-screen games. For more immersive VR games, the controllers also have two triggers on the grips and enough sensors to enable five-finger capacitive sensing. The controllers run off of AA batteries, and Valve says they can get up to 40 hours of battery life. (The headset supports Valve’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">new Steam Controller</a>, too.)</p><p>Valve isn’t sharing a price for the Frame yet. The company plans to reveal that in early 2026, and it’s only telling us that it’s targeting a price that’s less than an Index — Valve’s previous headset, which cost $999. But there are other hints that Valve’s new headset won’t be as expensive as competitors.</p><p>While the Frame does have pancake lenses with an up-to-110-degree field of view and LCD screens with a 2160 x 2160 per eye resolution, that’s no longer class-leading. The Frame offers monochrome passthrough, but Apple’s and Samsung’s expensive headsets have more impressive micro-OLED displays and <em>color</em> passthrough, which can help with more immersive mixed reality experiences. Even the $299.99 Meta Quest 3S has color passthrough and outward IR illuminators so it can track in dark rooms.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>A Steam Frame prototype with a clear case. Valve isn’t selling this version, unfortunately.</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The Frame’s four outward-facing monochrome cameras and IR illuminator seem to provide excellent tracking, though in a brief demo, the black-and-white passthrough view wasn’t useful for much except getting a general idea of my surroundings. Rowe says sticking with monochrome passthrough was an intentional choice because color passthrough would have added to the Frame’s price. “The core focus of the device is the gaming,” Rowe says.</p><p>For those who want color passthrough and other changes to the headset, Valve has made its headset modular, including a dedicated expansion port in the nose piece designed to support extra cameras. The expansion port offers 2.5Gbps of bandwidth via MIPI and one lane of PCIe data.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET. Drop your questions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">here</a> and we’ll do our best to answer them.</p></blockquote></div></div><p>The entire core compute module is modular as well. While Valve has nothing to announce right now, Selan suggests that people might want to have things like a hot-swappable battery, a battery in a different location, or different styles of audio, and says it’s “very easy to imagine” that with the Frame’s modular design, “we would be able to accommodate those different needs in the future.”</p><p>Valve plans to share specs and external CAD files so that people can make accessories for the port and alternate head straps. There will also be a partner program for companies that want to sell official accessories.</p><p>But right now, that modularity is just a footnote about the Frame. This device, at least from what we’ve seen, is much more a flexible vehicle to play your existing library of Steam games.</p><p>I said at the top of this piece that I was <em>nearly</em> ready to put down my credit card for the Steam Frame. I’m still not sure if I’d prefer kicking back at home with <em>Hades II</em> on the Frame’s screen instead of on my Steam Deck or on a TV. But the Frame seems like a winning combination of ingredients that just make it a nice place to play Steam games — <em>and</em> it won’t require a physical tether. That might be enough to make it my first VR headset that doesn’t just gather dust.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve is about to challenge the Xbox and PlayStation on their home turf. Ten years to the month after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9705234/valve-steam-machines-controller-link-launch">Valve’s original Steam Machines</a> went on sale, the company is announcing… the Steam Machine.</p><p>I flew to Valve’s headquarters to try the company’s new PC-based game console, alongside a brand-new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">Steam Controller</a> and the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Steam Frame</a> gaming headset. It’s the culmination of Valve’s hardware and software efforts over the last decade, and it looks a lot like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">leaks that have been coming out over the past year</a>.</p><p>Here’s what the new Steam Machine is all about.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="the-promise"><h2>The promise</h2></p></div><p>Shipping early 2026 in every region where the Steam Deck is sold today, Valve’s new living room box is best thought of as a far more powerful, stationary version of the same technology. It’s a 6-inch cube that runs Windows games, but without Windows at the helm. Like the Steam Deck, it runs Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS operating system, using a compatibility layer called Proton to make games <em>think</em> they’re running on Windows and translate their API calls.</p><div><p>If that sounds like a huge compromise, you should know that countless happy Steam Deck users disagree. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">The Steam Deck has dramatically outsold Windows handhelds</a> through word of mouth alone, because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/807711/xbox-ally-sleep-fail-bazzite-fix-performance">Linux now runs Windows games better than Windows</a>, and because Windows is <em>far</em> from the Steam Deck’s pick-up-and-play console experience. I’ve heard many lapsed gamers say the Steam Deck brought them back.</p></div><p>But the Steam Machine has two things the Steam Deck does not: raw power, and the promise that you’ll never be waiting around for a game to update. “The Steam Machine has the ability to keep all your software, your OS, your games, and your cloud saves updated in the background … so the games are always ready for you to play,” says Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat.</p><p>While the Steam Deck is more powerful than a Nintendo Switch, it’s nowhere near a PS5. Big-budget games are beginning to leave it behind, and even the Nintendo Switch 2 can provide better 4K-upscaled TV graphics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/703058/steam-deck-vs-switch-2-power-performance">in its docked mode</a>.</p><p>The Steam Machine is Valve’s answer, bringing the Deck experience to your TV with far more powerful guts. Valve says it offers six times the power of a Steam Deck, and it looks like it’ll offer at least PS5-level performance and possibly beat the PS5 Pro.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="two-chips-for-ps5-plus-performance"><h2>Two chips for PS5-plus performance</h2></p></div><p>Under the hood, you get not one but two AMD chips along with 16GB of DDR5 RAM: The CPU is a six-core AMD Zen 4 chip with up to 30 watts of headroom and 4.8GHz boost, while the graphics are a semi-custom discrete AMD RDNA 3 “Navi 33” GPU, with 28 compute units, up to 130-watt TDP, and 8GB of GDDR6 memory. These are unusual components for a gaming PC, but they might work well together!</p><div><p>While the former sounds a lot like <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/8000-series/amd-ryzen-5-8540u.html">the entry-level AMD Ryzen 5 8540U laptop chip</a>, right down to its two big cores and four small ones, there’s no direct equivalent to that GPU: the closest are AMD’s <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Radeon-RX-7600M-XT-vs-Radeon-RX-7700S-vs-Radeon-RX-7600M_11550_11554_11552.247598.0.html">Radeon RX 7700 and 7600 mobile parts</a>, which have almost exclusively appeared <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152087/ayaneo-plans-ornate-ag01-graphics-starship-egpu-dock">in <em>external</em> graphics cards</a> (with two <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">notable</a> <a href="https://www.minisforum.com/products/atomman-g7-pt">exceptions</a>) and offer similar or better theoretical performance to the PS5 Pro’s graphics.</p></div><p>While I didn’t have time for robust testing at Valve’s headquarters, my first impressions were promising. On a 4K TV, the demanding <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> benchmark averaged a smooth 65fps at medium settings with basic ray tracing turned on, while being upscaled to 4K from a native 1080p output using AMD’s FSR 3.0. The benchmark never dipped below 58 frames per second, and when I took the controls for a spin in one of the more demanding regions of the game, the lowest I saw was 55fps in a quick firefight. It looked nice and crisp from about 9 feet away.</p><p>The prototype didn’t do nearly as well at native 4K — just 24fps average — but consoles generally don’t play the most demanding games at native 4K, either. I also benched with the same 720p settings I use to test every handheld and saw a solid 131fps, though the low resolution looked pretty ugly on a 4K TV!</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="compressed-steam"><h2>Compressed steam</h2></p></div><p>How did Valve fit PS5 power into a box around <em>half</em> the size of a PS5 at just 3.8 liters, including an internal power supply so you don’t need a separate brick? When Valve hands me a peeled-apart Steam Machine to let me peek inside, the answer is: there’s almost no wasted space within.</p><p>Aldehayyat says the team designed the entire Steam Machine around its cooling system — starting with a whisper-quiet 120mm PC fan with custom blade geometry. “We probably have more computational fluid dynamics time on this than an F1 team in a calendar year,” he jokes. “We have a lot of wind tunnel time on it as well.”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</strong><span><figcaption><em>Gallery: Peek inside Valve’s new Steam Machine with our photos.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>Then, Valve and component partners built a massive finned heatsink just as tall as that fan, with embedded heat pipes — and made it pull double duty as the RF shielding between the motherboard and its <em>four</em> dedicated antennas, including two for Wi-Fi 6E, one for Bluetooth, and one just for connecting to its new Steam Controllers. Below the custom motherboard is a custom Chicony power supply that <em>also</em> doubles as RF shielding for the Steam Machine’s bottom components, including a full-size M.2 2280 SSD bay that also accepts the smaller M.2 2230 drives the Steam Deck uses.</p><p>It’s all sandwiched together into an incredibly dense, weighty package where the main gaps are all dedicated to airflow: the space around the massive heatsink’s fins, the vents on the bottom, and the multiple vents in front. Aldehayyat says Valve knew it couldn’t count on a lot of airflow in the living room, so it designed a lot of redundancy. “It’s really hard to block every single one of those vents.”</p><p>Plus, those vents on the front are where the Steam Machine’s swappable magnetic front panel lives. While the basic design is plain black, Valve shows me a wood panel that gives the Steam Machine <a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/terra/terra/terra-graphite/">a Fractal vibe</a> and a <em>Team Fortress 2</em>-themed panel, and I even spot a panel with an embedded e-paper display which reveals that the Steam Machine is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr#:~:text=a%20codename%20Fremont%20living%20room%20console%20too">codenamed “Fremont” after all</a>.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="expandability"><h2>Expandability</h2></p></div><p>Valve won’t necessarily sell any of those extra panels, but says it’ll release the CAD files so you can design and 3D print your own. “I’m sure someone will make a [<em>Portal</em>] Companion Cube out of this, but we did not,” Valve engineer Steve Cardinali tells us when we ask. Below the panel, Valve also has a customizable RGB light bar that it plans to turn into a progress indicator for downloads and updates.</p><p>And this Steam Machine will finally be (optionally) sold with a gamepad that’s both familiar <em>and</em> worthy of playing PC games from the couch. The new Steam Controller is no longer a bulbous experiment in precision but now a comfortable, familiar, and powerful twist on a traditional gamepad (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">read my colleague Jay Peters’ story</a> for more).</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The downside of Valve’s impressive sandwich is that the Steam Machine isn’t really upgradable beyond the SSD and — if you dig deep — the 16GB of memory, which does come on standard laptop memory sticks. But the upside is an incredibly tiny game console that can alternatively double as a full desktop PC.</p><p>The Steam Machine has twin display outputs (HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4) so you can hook up two desktop monitors at a time or daisy-chain DisplayPort for a third. Across the front and back are four USB-A ports (two USB 2, two USB 3) for peripherals, with both a 10Gbps USB-C port and Gigabit Ethernet around back.</p><p>You should be able to plug in just about anything — including Valve’s new 6GHz dongle that gives the console a direct wireless connection to the Steam Frame headset — and you can install Windows if you really want.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET. Drop your questions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">here</a> and we’ll do our best to answer them.</p></blockquote></div></div><p>If this exact Steam Machine is not your cup of tea, the company hints that other versions might be available through partners in the future. While Valve won’t repeat history, letting companies go wild and create a ragtag band of various kinds of Steam Box like it did a decade ago, Valve says it’s willing to let end users try desktop SteamOS on their own PCs — and selectively work with companies, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">like it did with Lenovo</a>, to bring future Steam Machines to market.</p><p>But partners probably will want to see how Valve’s own Steam Machine fares first, designer Pierre-Loup Griffais suggests to me.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="the-burning-question"><h2>The burning question</h2></p></div><p>In the two weeks since I set foot in Valve’s headquarters, there’s only been one big question on my mind: What will this cost? Will Valve price it like a console, putting the Steam Machine toe-to-toe with PS5 Pro? Or will it be priced like a PC, making buyers weigh a heftier price against the opportunity to tap the PC’s wider library of games?</p><p>Valve says it hasn’t finalized pricing yet. But when I explicitly ask if the console will cost more than a PS5 Pro, the answer is: “Steam Machine’s pricing is comparable to a PC with similar specs.” When I listen to my interview audio, I find an additional hint from Griffais: “We intend for it to be positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space, but to be very competitive with a PC you could build yourself from parts.”</p><p>Poking around the web, I find I could probably assemble a computer with this performance for $800, not including labor. But it could easily consume half the room under my TV. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/minisforum-atomman-g7-pt-mini-pc-review/">A compact system with a similar GPU</a> can cost $1,000 <em>without</em> storage, memory, operating system, or a gamepad.</p><p>But hey, everything about buying video games is getting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive">more confusing and expensive these days</a>. If Valve can deliver a pick-up-and-play console that supports decades of inexpensive PC games, I know people who’ll put down PC amounts of money to get it.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement]]></content:encoded>

They’re here to make sure we don’t stray — because I’m visiting Valve’s headquarters, a place few journalists ever get to go. The guards help escort me to a tiny demo room, where a pair of Valve engineers show me their pride and joy: a glowing 6-inch cube, barely bigger than a box of Kleenex, that they hope might be the future of video game consoles.</p><p>For a moment, I feel like I’m watching history repeat itself. Twelve years ago, in a different Valve office half a mile away, the maker of <em>Half-Life</em> and <em>Portal</em> showed me what ultimately became one of the biggest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019">technology flops of the decade</a>, a new gaming system called the Steam Machine.

Most VR headsets I’ve tried have ended up collecting dust after the novelty wore off, and I thought I had sworn off VR for good. But after trying Valve’s new headset for myself at the company’s headquarters, I was nearly ready to put down my credit card before I walked out the door.</p><p>The new headset is called the Steam Frame, and it’s trying to do several things at once. It’s a standalone VR headset with a smartphone-caliber Arm chip inside that lets you play flat-screen Windows games locally off the onboard storage or a microSD card. But the Frame’s arguably bigger trick is that it can <em>stream</em> games directly to the headset, bypassing your unreliable home Wi-Fi by using a short-range, high-bandwidth wireless dongle that plugs into your gaming PC. And its new controllers are packed with all the buttons and inputs you need for both flat-screen games <em>and</em> VR games.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE1MDYx" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">Valve’s new Steam Controller might be my dream controller</a></h2><div><p>One of the best parts of the Steam Deck is its many different controls, and how you can customize them to let you do whatever you want with every single one of your games. Now, Valve is bringing that same level of flexibility into a new gamepad. I recently got to try it at Valve’s headquarters, and it feels like the controller I’ve always wanted.</p><p>Today, Valve announced the second-generation Steam Controller. It’s a Bluetooth controller that works with any device that runs Steam, including Valve’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Steam Machine PC</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Steam Frame VR headset</a>, and comes with a puck that serves as a low-latency wireless connector and doubles as a charging station. It will launch in early 2026 for a price that’s yet to be announced, though Valve is aiming to make the price competitive with other controllers with “advanced inputs,” according to hardware engineer Steve Cardinali.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Here’s the secret Steam Machine that Valve probably used to test headsets.</p><p>Jon Bringus isn’t saying how he obtained this unicorn, but it looks completely legit!</p><p>It self-IDs as a “Valve Steambox,” fires up a Steam screen, makes Steam hardware sounds, and natively pairs with Steam Controllers!

The operating systems performed similarly in benchmark tool Geekbench 3, but tests involving <em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> and <em>Metro: Last Light Redux</em> yielded frames per second gaps that ranged from 21 to 58 percent.</p><p>The timing of the analysis isn’t ideal for Valve.

The confusion is partly because “Steam Machine” is more a label for console-like gaming PCs than a discrete product. Along with the controller, Steam Machines are largely defined by Steam OS, a Linux-based operating system that any manufacturer can adopt, whether it’s making a super-cheap machine or a top-of-the-line gaming powerhouse. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/4/8728813/valve-steam-machine-preorder-release-date">Preorders finally opened</a> this summer, with a limited number of customers getting their devices in mid-October before the official release.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9705234/valve-steam-machines-controller-link-launch">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Mzg0NTY4" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/12/5992547/alienware-alpha-console-will-steam-to-your-living-room-this-november">Alienware’s Alpha console will bring Steam to your living room this November</a></h2><div><p>If you’ve been wanting to get Steam games into your living room — and don’t want to wait for <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/23/4762370/steam-box-os">Valve’s official Steam OS</a>— Alienware is now ready to take your money.

The touchscreen seen on <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/27/4762318/valve-steam-box-controller">the original model</a> has indeed been scrapped entirely in favor of four separate directional buttons on the left side and four face buttons on the right. They’re labeled X, Y, A, and B — just like Microsoft’s Xbox controller — and Valve’s buttons also share the same arrangement and color scheme. Similar to the Xbox One, Valve’s latest iteration of the Steam Controller features a logo that glows white when powered on. That round button is centered between two smaller ones labeled with icons for stop and play.</p><p>“These analog buttons are offered in addition to the touch pads featured in the original prototypes,” Valve said in a statement. The design of this latest version seems to have been finalized only recently; Valve says it’s in the process of assembling demo units that it will bring to the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco next week. “We’re excited to get some feedback from our customers on these latest changes,” the company said.

Valve is building a game streaming solution right into its free Steam game platform, so you can sling games from your beefy desktop PC to laptops as thin as a MacBook Air. Late last week, Valve invited a host of new users into the Steam In-Home Streaming beta, and we made it in. Read on for our first impressions.</p><p>The first, most striking thing about Steam In-Home Streaming is how little setup it requires. You don’t even need to be in front of both computers to pair them together. As long as both computers are signed into your Steam account and connected to the same network, you’ll automatically have access to any game or program in either computer’s Steam library. That means you can stream Windows games to a Mac or Linux machine, and Valve is planning to add support for the reverse, too. If you’ve got a copy of a game that works on both operating systems, you can pick whether to stream it or run it locally, or even start installing it on the remote computer. You can even launch some non-Steam apps, like Adobe Photoshop and Media Player Classic, if you add them to Steam. They don’t properly display their menu bars, though.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/26/5345364/steam-in-home-streaming-preview-a-short-range-slingbox-for-your">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NDA1Mzc1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5312452/steam-controller-ditches-the-touchscreen-for-better-backwards">Steam Controller ditches the touchscreen for better backwards compatibility</a></h2><div><p><figcaption>Gallery Photo: Steam Controller and Steam Machine press pictures</figcaption></p></div><div><p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future">The Steam Controller</a> is going to change. According to two game developers tweeting from Valve’s Steam Dev Days developer summit, Valve has decided to remove the controller’s central touchscreen. While it sounds like the gamepad’s twin trackpads will remain intact, the touchscreen was deemed redundant and possibly even distracting from games, as Valve wants players looking at the television instead of their hands. That doesn’t mean there won’t be customizable controls in the center of the gamepad, though. Players will simply use a feature that Valve’s calling “ghost mode.”</p><p>We saw an early demo of “ghost mode” at Valve’s headquarters a few months ago, and it’s fairly simple: when you move your thumb on the Steam Controller’s touchpad, you can see a ghostly image of your thumb on your TV screen as well, and you can press virtual buttons placed there.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5312452/steam-controller-ditches-the-touchscreen-for-better-backwards">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NDA1NDY3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5312224/alienwares-steam-machine-will-arrive-in-september">Alienware’s Steam Machine will arrive in September</a></h2><div><p><figcaption>alienware steam machine stock 1020</figcaption></p></div><div><p>Alienware has <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281824/steam-machines-are-here-how-alienware-is-realizing-valve-console-dream#">perhaps the most exciting Steam Machine</a> coming to market, and now we know when it will arrive.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> is, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">in Dominic's own words</a>, "merely okay." I haven't played it myself, so I can't comment there, the general consensus seems to be in agreement on that point however. The Chinese Room are working on turning that around at least! Today they released a new patch for the RPG, containing a bunch of fixes, and offered up a small roadmap of improvements and DLC to come.
</p>
<p>
Let's start with what this patch, patch 1.0.4, offers up. The big one is that previously, if you would exit to the main menu or quit the game, the game wouldn't save, resulting in a lost of lost hours of playtime. Now, the game does autosave, updating progress for collectables, blood resonance, and ability points.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, there's just a whole bunch of general fixes. Most of them are for specific sections of the game, like one where an enemy would clip out of bounds meaning you couldn't kill it in A Kiss From Prospero, and multiple cases of the player character falling out of bounds after performing certain actions in particular places have been fixed. You can read the full list in this handy <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/bloodlines-2-hotfix-1-0-4">blog post</a>.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what's next, before the end of the year patch 1.0.5 should be in your hands. This one will add in an FOV slider and motion blue toggle, and progress saving should be improved too. Then, in the winter update, there'll be some Christmas-themed cosmetics, and a custom difficulty mode will be added in. You won't be able to engage with this feature until after beating the game, however. It's been framed as a sort of new game plus type situation, just one where you can toggle specific things like your starting health or enemy awareness.
</p>
<p>
After that, in early 2026 a Valentine's update will arrive, with the game's Loose Cannon and The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flower">Flower</a> and the Flame DLC coming throughout the year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been five years since the PS5 was released, and here are the statistics it has accumulated during this time frame. </p>



<p>There is still a long way to go before we see the next generation of PlayStation consoles, the PS6, which is reportedly set to arrive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime in 2027</a>. As we await the next generation of PlayStation consoles, let’s take a look back at what the PlayStation 5 has accomplished since its release. </p>







<h2 id="h-from-2020-to-2025-here-s-how-the-ps5-has-grown-over-the-past-five-years">From 2020 to 2025, Here’s How the PS5 Has Grown Over the Past Five Years</h2>







<figure></figure>



<p>Starting in 2020, the console was released with a high-speed SSD, immersive 3D Audio, and the DualSense wireless controller. It also debuted features like Share Screen, which allows players to watch friends’ gameplay in real-time. The feature was used more than&nbsp;1.6 billion&nbsp;times, totaling over&nbsp;900 million hours of usage. Regarding accessibility, the console has expanded from 11 features at launch to 20 by 2025. </p>







<figure></figure>



<p>The following year, we saw innovation towards Share Play, with cross-gen share-play allowing PS5 players with PS Plus to virtually ‘pass the controller’ to friends using PS4. The feature has been used over 700 million times since launch. M.2 SSD storage expansion was introduced for players to grow their libraries further. </p>



<p>PS5 Game Captures received the ability to be shared through the PS App, resulting in 5.6 billion captures uploaded and over 1 billion voice chat sessions conducted through the app. The Midnight Black and Cosmic Red colour variations for the DualSense were also released in 2021. </p>



<h3 id="h-2022-vrr-new-ps-plus-tiers-and-more-colors">2022 – VRR, New PS Plus Tiers, and More Colors</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Then the next year, PlayStation 5 received variable refresh rate or VRR, which helped enhance visual performance by minimizing visual artifacts for smoother, crisper gameplay. 96% of players with VRR-compatible monitors use this feature regularly. We also saw PlayStation Plus being turned into a three-tier service: Essential, Extra, and Premium/Deluxe. “The total gameplay hours for Game Catalog and Classic Catalog have also increased – cumulatively hitting&nbsp;14 billion hours.”</p>



<p>Three more galaxy-inspired color variations were introduced for the DualSense in 2022: Nova Pink, Starlight Blue, and Galactic Purple.</p>



<h3 id="h-2023-playstation-vr2-playstation-portal-dualsense-edge-and-more">2023 – PlayStation VR2, PlayStation Portal, DualSense Edge, and More</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>2023 was the year of accessories; we first saw the release of the PSVR2, which featured eye tracking, headset feedback, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers through the PSVR2 Sense Controllers. Discord voice chat has been introduced to the PS5, with more than 1 billion voice chat sessions taking place on the platform, averaging 105 minutes per session.</p>



<p>Then, the next device, PlayStation Portal, was introduced to redefine their remote play features, with the device accounting for over 50%&nbsp;of all PS5 Remote Play sessions. Innovation was also introduced to the controller space with the high-performance, ultra-customizable DualSense Edge and the Access Controller, designed to make games more accessible. </p>



<p>Cloud streaming for PS5 games also introduced new options for PlayStation Plus Premium members to stream supported PS5 digital games from the Game Catalog, Game Trials, and purchases made on the PS Store directly on their PS5 console. Lastly, a whole line of audio products was released with planar magnetic drivers, PlayStation Link technology, and lightning-fast, lossless audio connection. </p>







<h3 id="h-2024-community-game-help-welcome-hub-and-ps5-pro">2024 –  Community Game Help, Welcome Hub, and PS5 Pro</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>2024 was the year when Community Game Help was introduced, allowing players to share gameplay hint videos generated by opt-in contributors. The Welcome Hub was also added this year to bring a personalized PS5 home screen space with customizable widgets and backgrounds. Lastly, the mid-gen update, PS5 Pro, and the PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection were also released that year. </p>



<h3 id="h-2025-here-s-where-everything-adds-up">2025 – Here’s Where Everything Adds Up</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>2025 marks the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/12/five-years-of-play-the-evolution-of-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">5th Anniversary</a> of the PS5, and it has racked up some huge numbers in this time span. The console has sold over 84 million units globally, and if players “lined up every PS5 ever sold, together they’d stretch over&nbsp;28,600 kilometers”. Moreover, over 7,500 PS5 games have been published by more than 4,000 creators. </p>



<p>The top 3 multiplayer games on the PS5, based on playtime, are Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto V, and Call of Duty Modern Warfare II. The top 3 single-player games on PS5 are Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, God of War Ragnarök, and Hogwarts Legacy. Combined, players have acquired over 40 billion Trophies and 110 million Platinum Trophies. Last but not least by any means, across the five years, PS5 players have&nbsp;logged a total of 100 billion hours of gameplay.</p>



<p>In other news, a PS5 &amp; PC cross-buy option has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-ps5-pc-cross-buy-option-has-been-discovered-verified/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered and verified</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Valve also tells Ars that streaming to the Steam Frame will be “as efficient as possible,” maximizing battery life from the included 21.6 Wh battery. “Standalone battery life will be much more variable, depending on the game and its settings,” Valve Engineer Jeremy Selan and Designer Lawrence Yang told Ars via email.</p>


<p>While a wired PC connection would go a long way toward addressing those battery-life and extra latency concerns, Valve said the Steam Frame won’t even support it as an option. “We’re focused on a robust wireless streaming experience, which is why we included a dedicated wireless adapter, have a dedicated radio on the headset just for streaming, and invented a new streaming technology to optimize the streaming experience (Foveated Streaming),” Selan and Yang told Ars.</p>
<h2>A low-weight modular “core”</h2>
<p>All told, the Steam Frame comes in at just 440 grams, a welcome and sizeable reduction from the 515 grams of the Quest 3. Interestingly, Valve’s spec sheet also specifically calls out the 185 gram “core” of the headset hardware, which comprises all the main components besides the battery, headstrap, and speakers (e.g., lenses, displays, motherboard, cooling, processor, RAM, tracking system, etc).</p>
<p>That core weight is important, Selan and Yang told Ars, because “it’s designed to be modular so one could imagine other headsets connecting to this core module that bring different features.” So tinkerers or third-party headset makers could theoretically build modified versions of the Steam Frame with lighter batteries or streamlined headstrap/speaker combos, for instance. The Steam Frame’s monochrome passthrough cameras can also be accessed via a front expansion port with a standardized Gen 4 PCIe interface, Valve said.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting potential direction for new hardware that will launch into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/what-happened-to-the-virtual-reality-gaming-revolution/">a more niche, less irrationally exuberant VR market</a> than Valve’s previous virtual reality headsets. But with companies like Apple and Meta <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/metas-799-ray-ban-display-is-the-companys-first-big-step-from-vr-to-ar/">pivoting toward augmented reality</a> and/or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/hands-on-with-apple-vision-pro-this-is-not-a-vr-headset/">mixed-reality hardware</a> of late, it’s nice to see Valve continuing to cater to the small but dedicated market of gamers who are still interested in playing in fully immersive VR environments.</p>

<p>Nearly four years after the Steam Deck <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/">changed the world of portable gaming</a>, Valve is getting ready to release SteamOS-powered hardware designed for the living room TV, or even as a desktop PC gaming replacement. The simply named Steam Machine and Steam Controller, both planned to ship in early 2026, are “optimized for gaming on Steam and designed for players to get even more out of their Steam Library,” Valve said in a press release.</p>
<p>A Steam Machine spec sheet shared by Valve lists a “semi-custom” six-core AMD Zen 4 CPU clocked at up to 4.8 Ghz alongside an AMD RDNA3 GPU with 28 compute units. The motherboard will include 16GB of DDR5 RAM and an additional 8GB of dedicated DDR6 VRAM for the GPU. The new hardware will come in two configurations with 512GB or 2TB of unspecified “SSD storage,” though Valve isn’t sharing pricing for either just yet.</p>

          </p>
  </div>

<p>Those chips and numbers suggest the Steam Machine will have roughly the same horsepower as a mid-range desktop gaming PC from a few years back. But Valve says its “Machine”—which it ranks as “over 6x more powerful than the Steam Deck”—is powerful enough to support ray-tracing and/or 4K, 60 fps gaming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amds-fsr-4-upscaling-is-exclusive-to-90-series-radeon-gpus-wont-work-on-other-cards/">using FSR upscaling</a>.</p>
<p>Externally, the Steam Machine is housed in a stark black cube measuring 160 mm (~6.30-inch) on each side, making it slightly larger than the old Nintendo GameCube (sans handle). The front of the Machine sports two USB-A ports, an SD card storage expansion slot, a power button, and a “customizable LED bar” that can change to reflect when the system is booting up, downloading updates, etc. A huge fan vent takes up most of the rear of the unit, alongside three additional USB ports (including one USB-C port) and HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.4 outputs.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<h2>Taking control</h2>
<p>While the Steam Machine will be able to connect to standard USB and Bluetooth PC controllers and peripherals, it has been designed with a brand-new Steam Controller in mind. And while both pieces of hardware will be sold separately, they will also be available in a bundle for gamers who want an all-in-one living room gaming solution.</p>

    <p><span>If it weren't for those touchpads, it would be hard to distinguish this gamepad from a lot of other modern controllers.</span>

                  </span>

  </div>

<p>The new Steam Controller (not to be confused with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/steam-controller-steamvr-steam-machines-valves-hardware-push-in-photos/">the identically named old Steam Controller</a>) will make use of a proprietary 2.4 Ghz wireless connection that allows for around 8 ms of end-to-end latency between a button press and the resulting signal received by the system. A radio for that connection will be built into the Steam Machine but will also be available via an included “plug and play” Steam Controller Puck that can support up to four wireless controller connections.</p>
<p>Without the puck, the new Steam Controller can still connect to PCs (including portable gaming PCs) and smartphones via Bluetooth or a wired USB connection. And while console connections are technically possible, Valve Software Engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais and Designer Lawrence Yang told Ars via email that it would “require collaboration with the vendor” that the company would be “happy to discuss… if it came up.”</p>
<p>The most striking feature of the Steam Controller is the dual touchpads underneath the thumbsticks, mirroring the similar, somewhat underutilized control options on the Steam Deck. Each touchpad will come with its own haptic motor for “HD tactile feedback” that should feel akin to rolling a clicky trackball under your thumb (two more haptic motors in the grips handle force feedback output from the games themselves).</p>

<p>Aside from that, the Steam Controller seems a lot more standardized than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/steams-living-room-hardware-blitz-gets-off-to-a-muddy-start/">Valve’s last attempt at a controller</a>. It features thumbsticks, a d-pad, face buttons, and shoulder buttons pretty much where you’d expect them, plus four programmable “grip buttons” on the back side of the controller. The familiar Steam, View, Menu, and QAM (aka “three dots”) buttons also come over from the Steam Deck for quick access to useful SteamOS functions.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Internally, the Steam Controller will use <a href="https://customercare.scufgaming.com/hc/en-us/articles/38740238950289-FAQ-TMR-vs-Hall-Effect-What-s-the-Difference">magnetic TMR thumbstick sensors</a>, which should hopefully limit the kind of stick drift we see with the mechanical sticks on the Nintendo Switch, for instance. A six-axis IMU will allow for gyro-based tilt controls as well, and a “grip sensor” can help make sure those controls turn off when you’re putting the controller down or picking it up.</p>
<h2>Let’s try that again</h2>
<p>Software-wise, the Steam Machine will of course run SteamOS, the custom Linux-based operating system popularized by the Steam Deck and recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/bye-bye-windows-gaming-steamos-officially-expands-past-the-steam-deck/">officially expanded to other handhelds</a>. Valve says that means fast suspend/resume features, easy access to your Steam cloud saves, “and all the other Steam features you’d expect.” It also means the ability to boot to a Linux desktop mode or install Windows with the help of <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6121-ECCD-D643-BAA8">drivers available on Valve’s website</a>, Griffais and Yang told Ars.</p>
<p>Crucially, the new SteamOS offers compatibility with the vast majority of games made for Windows <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">via Proton</a>, a key feature that was missing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">the last time Valve pushed Linux-based “Steam Machines” hardware</a> roughly a decade ago. Recent versions of SteamOS can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/">actually boast better in-game performance than Windows</a> on some games and hardware in Ars’ testing.</p>
<p>“One of our biggest learnings [from the first Steam Machines effort] is that it’s a tall order to ask developers to port their games to run on Linux—so we have done a bunch of work on Proton to the point where almost all games just work out of the box,” Griffais and Yang told Ars. “Since that time, we’ve gained valuable experience in manufacturing, made big improvements to Steam, Steam Input, and SteamOS, and we are excited to bring our own first party Steam Machine and the new Steam Controller to market.”</p>

<p>Valve’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">ill-fated Steam Machines hardware rollout 10 years ago</a> also relied on third-party manufacturers to handle the actual construction of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/gallery-the-13-steam-machines-and-all-of-their-glorious-variety/">a wide range of branded Linux boxes</a>. This time around, Valve is handling the manufacture and distribution of a singular Steam Machine on its own, following the success of a similar rollout for the Steam Deck. And while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/">we’ve seen leaked “Powered by SteamOS” branding</a> suggesting third-party SteamOS living room boxes might be in the works, Valve hasn’t announced anything official yet.</p>
<p>“We’re always happy to chat with companies who are interested in making their own SteamOS powered devices,” Griffais and Yang told Ars. “We are working on broadening support, and with the recent updates to Steam and SteamOS, compatibility with other devices has improved, starting with other AMD powered PC handhelds.”</p>
<p>But while the Steam Deck filled an obvious market need for portable access to PC games, it’s harder to know where the new Steam Machine will fit in the already crowded market for living room gaming (not to mention the highly modular desktop gaming market). That’s especially true since the Steam Deck and its imitators can already serve as passable living room gaming devices when plugged into any number of third-party USB-C docks.</p>
<p>A lot will depend on pricing details and just how simple and convenient the new hardware makes the experience of playing PC games on the living room TV. We’ll keep you posted as more information comes in and when we’ve had a chance to get some hands-on time with Valve’s newest swing at the hardware market.</p>

                <p>For the Arc Raiders Turnabout quest, Celeste has asked you to visit the North Trench Tower in Spaceport and upload some blackmail files. It sounds like risky business, but that's par for the course in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. In this guide, we'll fill you in on what you need to know about the Turnabout quest and how to complete it.</p><p>Note that when you accept this quest, Celeste will provide you with one Spaceport Trench Tower Key. <strong>This key must be in your inventory during the raid to complete this quest</strong>. Since you'll be heading to a quest area that may be populated with other raiders, it's probably best to <strong>toss your Spaceport Trench Tower Key in a safe pocket</strong>.</p><p><strong>If you lose the Spaceport Trench Tower Key, you'll be unable to complete the quest until you obtain another</strong>. As with nearly all keys in Arc Raiders, the drop rate is fairly low and random--though many players seem to have their best luck finding keys in residential areas. If you've lost your key, we're wishing you luck on finding a new one soon, raider.</p><p>When you're ready to complete Turnabout, follow the steps below.</p><h2>Where to find the North Trench Tower and upload the blackmail files</h2><p>The North Trench Tower is located at the very northern tip of the Spaceport map. It's often populated by other raiders looking to complete the quest--or steal your loot--so be mindful when approaching this spot. It's not uncommon for a Bastion to roam below the POI as well, or for Rocketeers to patrol the skies. In other words, it's not the safest location and should be approached with caution.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600474-share_20251111_0525471.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600474" data-ratio="0.55991840897501" data-width="1961" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600474-share_20251111_0525471.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600474"></a><figcaption>North Trench Tower</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600474-share_20251111_0525471.jpeg"></figure><p>As long as you have the Spaceport Trench Tower Key in your possession when you arrive, you can head up the stairs on either side of the building at the North Trench Tower and unlock the door.</p><p><strong>Be certain you're at the North Trench Tower before using the key, as the Spaceport Trench Tower Key can also open the South Trench Tower, which could waste your key!</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600475-share_20251111_0525472.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600475" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600475-share_20251111_0525472.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600475"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600475-share_20251111_0525472.jpeg"></figure><p>Immediately after unlocking and entering the door, head up the stairs on your left or right (depending on whether you unlocked the left or right North Trench Door). In the room above, <strong>you'll find a glowing yellow terminal you can interact with to upload the blackmail files to Celeste</strong>, which completes your quest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600771-share_20251111_0643520.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600771" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600771-share_20251111_0643520.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600771"></a><figcaption>Upload the blackmail files at this terminal.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600771-share_20251111_0643520.jpeg"></figure><p>With Turnabout complete, you can now extract whenever you'd like--perhaps most easily at the Central Elevator. While you're at the North Trench Tower, however, you should definitely go ahead and loot everything you can find within. It's a great spot for loot and worth returning to if you get another Spacesport Trench Tower Key in the future.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s Simpsons season, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-battle-pass-for-simpsons-season-all-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-7205/" data-ref-id="2900-7205">took over Battle Royale</a> last week with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-simpsons-map-full-springfield-map-and-all-named-locations/2900-7204/" data-ref-id="2900-7204">new Springfield-themed island map</a>, got a welcome injection of new cartoonish weapons you can wield against your enemies in this week's update. The loot pool now includes Bart's Slingshot, which leaves a poison cloud where it lands, Moe's 5 Gun, which is five guns in one, and the Deodorant Applicator, which is a mid-range laser gun.</p><p>When Fortnite's Simpsons season began, it had a very noticeable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-simpsons-season/2900-7206/" data-ref-id="2900-7206">lack of Simpsons-themed weapons</a>. The loot pool had tons of Simpsons healing items, like Krusty Burgers and Super Squishees, but the weapons were all old Fortnite guns aside from the Mr. Blasty revolver.</p><p>But that changed in a big way in Week 2. Now there are four Simpsons weapons instead of one, including a rare combo gun with Moe's 5 Gun. That one is more or less a new version of the Pump and Dump, which was a shotgun and SMG that you could dual-wield during Chapter 6 Season 2. The Slingshot and Deodorant Applicator, meanwhile, both have unlimited ammo, but they have a durability stat that wears down as you use them.</p><p>These new weapons aren't the only major change Epic added this week. The Springfield map is now experiencing Donut Storms randomly during matches--these storms rain giant donuts from the sky that destroy buildings and do plenty of damage to any players who get in their way. That's pretty wild, and we're only in Week 2. There are still two more weeks of major changes expected.</p>

                <p>Most <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> quests send you topside to investigate, gather resources, or obtain some type of intel. This trend continues with Reduced to Rubble, which begins with asking you to do the simplest thing you've done in the game so far: take a photo. Hey, sounds easy enough, right? Let's find out.</p><p>Luckily, you won't need to extract to complete Reduced to Rubble, so you should bring in a free loadout if you're not familiar with the Blue Gate map or feel a bit nervous about losing any of your good loot. With the above-average amount of ARC roaming about on this map, things can go bad in the blink of an eye, so it's better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>When you're ready to complete Reduced to Rubble, here's how to make it so.</p><h2>Where to take a photo of the collapsed highway</h2><p>To find the collapsed highway, you'll need to head to the southern region of the Blue Gate map. This area is normally pretty quiet, but keep an eye out for other raiders working on the same quest. Give them a friendly wave and keep moving if possible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600429-19a711beaac90-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600429" data-ratio="0.56472428627298" data-width="2557" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600429-19a711beaac90-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600429"></a><figcaption>Take a photo in this area at the Highway Collapse POI.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600429-19a711beaac90-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the Highway Collapse POI, you'll need to take a photo in this area. Refer to the image above as a general idea, but there will be multiple spots in this little section of the map that can pop a prompt to take the photo--both on the ground and on the collapsed highway itself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600430-arcraiders_20251110225720.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600430" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600430-arcraiders_20251110225720.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600430"></a><figcaption>Look around the Highway Collapse POI for locations where you can take a photo. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600430-arcraiders_20251110225720.jpg"></figure><p>When you find one of the right spots for taking a photo, you'll get a yellow prompt on your screen that says "Take Photo," so press the appropriate button to complete this portion of the quest. These spots are easy to find and plentiful, so once you're in this section of the map, it shouldn't prove challenging to round up this prompt.</p><p>When you're done taking the photo, you'll be tasked with heading to the Broken Earth POI. Reaching this area requires you to move northeast through the Olive Grove, which is a more populated area where you're far more likely to encounter raiders and ARC, so tread carefully.</p><h2>Where to investigate the unknown ARC machines in Broken Earth</h2><p>As you reach the Broken Earth POI, you'll be asked to follow the trail of destruction, then investigate the unknown ARC machines. Continue northeast to the point on the map below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600431-arcraiders_20251110225225.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600431" data-ratio="0.56335797254488" data-width="1894" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600431-arcraiders_20251110225225.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600431"></a><figcaption>Here's where to investigate the unknown ARC machines.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600431-arcraiders_20251110225225.jpg"></figure><p>Here, you'll find a giant destroyed ARC. Interact with the bottom of it to complete your investigation into the unknown ARC machines. Subsequently, this completes the Reduced to Rubble quest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600432-arcraiders_20251110225209.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600432" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600432-arcraiders_20251110225209.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600432"></a><figcaption>Interact with this spot to complete the quest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600432-arcraiders_20251110225209.jpg"></figure><p>With the quest complete, you're now free to continue looting--or just extract whenever you'd like. The Overlook Airshaft is a great spot to get out if it's still open by the time you finish questing. When you return to Speranza, turn your quest in to get moving along on the next. You're far from done, raider.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>Former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida has suggested that it was the original PlayStation that brought us From Software as a developer and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Bloodborne</a> as a game.</p><p>Speaking to Simon Parkin on <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console?utm_source=Social+Media&amp;utm_medium=Social+Post&amp;utm_campaign=MPC+Acast+Page" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the latest episode of his My Perfect Console podcast</a>, Yoshida said the industry's jump from cartridges to CDs enticed From Software to transition from a business software company to a game software company. As Yoshida recalled, Sony, a newer entrant in the console-making business, was attempting to court the likes of Atlus and Namco to bring their games to the OG PlayStation system. Cartridges were expensive and small in data capacity. CDs, Yoshida said, were much cheaper, quicker to manufacture, and capable of storing larger sets of data. From Software thus saw an opportunity to try something new.</p>

<p>"They didn't have to wait for two or three months to restock their games," Yoshida said. "If the game is successful, the CD-ROM can be delivered [within] three or four days. So one of these companies was From Software. From Software was a business software company. But when they saw a CD-ROM game system like PlayStation, they [said], 'Oh, we can become a video game publisher.' So that's how they invested, they entered into the video game industry.”</p><p>Parkin interjected to say that we then got Bloodborne "eventually." Yoshida agreed, stating that "eventually," yes, this all led to the masterpiece that is Bloodborne.</p><p>However, Yoshida wasn't shy about the games that paved the way for Bloodborne to come into existence. He said it wasn't easy to convince companies like Atlus to take a chance on the fledgling PlayStation console, but the CD's powerful 3D capabilities did all the talking.</p><p>"The industry people were saying that between PlayStation and Sega Saturn, probably Sega Saturn will become more popular because of Sega's experience," Yoshida said. "However, it was a combination of the 3D graphics capability of PlayStation and the CD-ROM's new business opportunity. Of course, the Sega Saturn offered the same kind of opportunity in terms of CD-ROM. However, Namco provided a really good library of 3D games, starting with Ridge Racer. But other companies, like Capcom, came up with Resident Evil, and eventually, you know, Squaresoft released Final Fantasy VII. That was the most critical title."</p><p>Yoshida explained that producer Hironobu Sakaguchi, who wanted to create cinematic experiences, grew frustrated with Nintendo for sticking with cartridges between the SNES and Nintendo 64 generations. This helped Sony convince Squaresoft to bring Final Fantasy VII to PlayStation, which Parkin noted was originally planned for the SNES or N64. However, Sakaguchi and other Squaresoft folks saw an opportunity with CDs.</p><p>“The combination of, from a creative standpoint, Sakaguchi-san wanted a cinema movie like Final Fantasy," Yoshida said. "And also, from a business standpoint, they saw the attractiveness of the CD-ROM medium. And between Sega and Sony, I don't know how they decided, but we had a really good schmoozer, my boss from Sony Music Entertainment Company."</p><p>When asked about his reaction to acquiring Final Fantasy VII on PlayStation, Yoshida said it was "amazing." He couldn't remember Nintendo's response but noted that the company "must've been pissed."</p><p>This is all well and good, but unfortunately, Bloodborne doesn't appear to be making a comeback anytime soon. According to industry insider Jeff Grubb, a PC port of the Lovecraftian-RPG--or a remake or remaster or anything pertaining to Bloodborne--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloodborne-could-be-on-ice-for-a-long-time-report/1100-6534886/" data-ref-id="1100-6534886">has made zero progress</a>. Anything is possible, of course, but for right now, we'll have to wait with bated breath to see if From Software brings the cult favorite back from the PS4 grave, as Yoshida <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">theorized in January 2025 that creator Hidetaka Miyazaki may be too busy</a> to focus his attention there.</p><p>From Software is hard at work on a Nintendo Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-for-switch-2-delayed-to-2026-due-to-performance-adjustments/1100-6535648/" data-ref-id="1100-6535648">which was delayed to 2026 for additional polish</a>) and the Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-duskbloods/" data-ref-id="5000-671285">The Duskbloods</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of their launch later this week, NVIDIA has reminded players of a few more titles that will be launching with support for NVIDIA's DLSS 4, including Anno 117: Pax Romana, Assetto Corsa Rally, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Assetto Corsa Rally is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-rally-revealed-launches-early-access-november-2025/">new rally racing game from Supernova Games Studios and 505 Games</a>, which also marks the first time the Assetto Corsa series has ventured into the world of rally racing. It was built on an adapted version of KUNOS Simulazioni's physics engine that has been the foundation for the entire Assetto Corsa series. Assetto Corsa Rally is also the second Assetto Corsa release of the year after Assetto Corsa EVO.</p>



<p>Assetto Corsa Rally will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation when it launches in early access on November 13, 2025, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 needs no introduction as the latest entry in the long-running annual shooter series, which is launching this coming Friday, November 14, 2025, with support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana is another new entry in a long-running series, though a very different kind of game from Call of Duty. This new city-builder and strategy game puts players in Ancient Rome and charges them with deciding between instituting Roman traditions in its new Celtic colonies, or if you'll kick off a new era of Ancient Rome, letting Celtic traditions mix with Rome's to create something entirely new.</p>



<p>It'll arrive on PC on November 13, 2025, and with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Lastly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332430/Chip_n_Clawz_vs_The_Brainioids/">Chip n' Clawz vs. The Brainoids</a> is a new action-strategy game from developer Snapshot Games and publisher Arc Games from the creator of XCOM, Julian Gollop. It's a mix of third-person action and real-time strategy gameplay, and after launching earlier this year in August, it'll add support for DLSS Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana, Black Ops 7, and Assetto Corsa Rally will <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-add-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-anno-117-pax-romana-in-november-2025/">also be available to play through NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</a>.</p>

            <p>Ye gads, there’s three of them. You <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-valves-forty-majillion-secret-hardware-projects-is-called-the-steam-frame-probably">may have heard</a> that a Valve hardware announcement was on the cards, but the Steam custodians’ biggest  metal-and-circuits reveal since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> actually concerns a power trio: a new Steam Machine, a new Steam Controller, and the Steam Frame hybrid VR headset. They're all official, and all coming (pricing and exact dates TBA) in early 2026.</p>
<p>I’ve had some quality hands-on time with them myself, having been mysteriously summoned to Valve HQ late last month (flying/accommodating on our own dime, before anyone gets clever). Full thoughts can be found in the links below, and I’ll say this up front: all three have a clear Steam Deck influence, be it the design language, the value of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-proton-the-reason-most-steam-deck-games-work-has-a-version-100-beta-to-try">Proton</a>-aided game compatibility, or simply the pleasure of a quality thumbstick. If you liked the handheld then... well, you might not <em>necessarily</em> like the Steam Machine, Controller, or Frame, but you’ll have already read the shorthand on where they’re coming from.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more features and insights coming later today and this week, based on interviews with Valve’s in-house designers and engineers. In the meantime, let’s do some specs lists here as well. Why not, eh. The Steam Machine is set to be Valve’s most powerful in-house hardware piece thus far, leaning on a discrete AMD GPU to run modern games at upscaled 4K, while the redesigned Steam Controller sacrifices some of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/goodnight-sweet-steam-controller">original model’s idiosyncrasies</a> in pursuit of better all-roundedness. The Steam Frame is perhaps both the most ambitious and the riskiest: its modular design, groundbreaking support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-arm64-game-testing-points-towards-new-steam-hardware-if-vaguely">Steam games on ARM hardware</a>, and combination of quality PC VR with standalone headset play all show great promise, but not the kind that seemed imminently fulfillable at the time of my preview session.</p>
<h3>Steam Machine (2026) specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> 6-core AMD Zen 4</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Semi-custom AMD RDNA 3 with 28 Compute Units, 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</li>

<li><strong>SSD:</strong> 512GB or 2TB</li>
<li><strong>Ports:</strong> 1x microSD, 2x USB3, 2x USB2, 1x USB Type C, 1x DisplayPort 1.4, 1x HDMI 2.0, 1x Ethernet</li>
<li><strong>Wireless:</strong> Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth, integrated Steam Controller receiver</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> SteamOS</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steam Controller (2026) specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thumbsticks:</strong> 2x TMR magnetic thumbsticks</li>
<li><strong>Trackpads:</strong> 2x capacitive trackpads with haptics</li>
<li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 2.4GHz (over Steam Controller Puck), Bluetooth, USB</li>
<li><strong>Gyro controls:</strong> Yes, with capacitive ‘Grip sense’ sensor</li>
<li><strong>Battery life:</strong> 35h</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> SteamOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, Ios/Android with Steam Link</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steam Frame specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>SoC:</strong> Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</li>
<li><strong>Lenses:</strong> Pancake optics, LCD, 2160x2160 per eye</li>
<li><strong>Field of View:</strong> 110 degrees</li>
<li><strong>Refresh rate:</strong> 72-120Hz (144Hz in Experimental mode)</li>
<li><strong>Tracking:</strong> 4x external cameras for controller and headset tracking, 2x interior cameras for eye tracking</li>
<li><strong>Audio:</strong> Dual speaker drivers (per ear), integrated into headstrap</li>
<li><strong>SSD:</strong> 256GB or 1TB</li>
<li><strong>Ports:</strong> 1x microSD, 1x PCIe expansion port with camera passthrough</li>
<li><strong>Wireless:</strong> Dual Wi-Fi 7/Wi-Fi 6E </li>
<li><strong>Battery:</strong> Rechageable 21.6Whr Li-On</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> SteamOS</li>
<li><strong>Controllers:</strong> Full 6-DOF tracking and IMU support, traditional gamepad inputs, capacitive finger tracking, haptic feedback, AA batteries (40h life)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, there’s no concrete release date or pricing for these yet, though Valve engineer Jeremy Selan told me that the while the Steam Frame specifically would be a "premium" VR headset. it'll still likely be priced "less than [the] Index." That's the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-index-review">Valve Index</a> headset, the full kit of which remains at the same £919 / $999 pricepoint it launched at in 2019. We'll report any further details ahead of release next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After a lot of online speculation and leaks, Valve has officially announced the long-rumored Steam console. This <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ioletsgo.gay/post/3m5h6fhof622z">follows leaked images that popped up</a> before the official reveal on Wednesday.</p> <p>On November 12, Valve revealed three new pieces of video game hardware: Steam Machine, Steam Controller, and Steam Frame, which is a new VR headset. The company didn’t reveal any prices, but did confirm a 2026 release date. According to Valve, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">new Steam Machine</a> has six times the “horsepower” of the Steam Deck and can play nearly all of the games in your Steam library. It also comes with a cute LED strip that can be used for various functions, including letting you know a game has been installed or updated.</p>

 <p>The Steam Machine is small, too. Valve claims it can be hidden under a banana. And while it’s obviously not actually going to be hiding under the yellow fruit that monkeys love, it’s shockingly small for something that boasts so much power. Valve says it’s roughly a 6-inch cube, or about 160mm. Tiny!</p>

 <p>The new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamcontroller">Steam Controller</a> can wirelessly sync up to the new Steam Machine easily, but it can also be used with any PC via an included puck that also acts as the controller’s charger. The new gamepad features advanced thumbsticks, “high definition rumble,” touch pads, motion controls, and built-in grip buttons. The idea is that this thing should be able to play most games you throw at it, including strategy games and shooters. Like the Steam Machine, it’s set to arrive sometime in 2026.</p>

  <p>Also announced on Wednesday was the Steam Frame, Valve’s new virtual reality headset. Unlike the Valve Index from a few years back, the Frame is a self-contained VR headset like Meta’s Quest 2. It runs SteamOS and can play many of your favorite VR games natively without hooking up to a PC. However, the advanced headset, which uses inside-out tracking and no longer requires sensors set up around your room, can also be plugged into a PC or connected wirelessly to a Steam Machine to play even more powerful games and experiences. And you guessed it, this is also arriving in 2026.</p> <p>“We’ve been super happy with the success of Steam Deck,” said Gabe Newell, President of Valve, “and PC gamers have continued asking for even more ways to play all the great titles in their Steam libraries. Our work over the years on other hardware and even more importantly on SteamOS has enabled Steam Controller, Steam Machine, and Steam Frame to do just that.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The rumors were true after all. Valve has announced the Steam Frame VR headset, it’s first headset since the Valve Index was released in 2019. </p>



<p>The Steam Frame is scheduled to release in early 2026. Unfortunately, no firm date nor pricing has been made public just yet.</p>







<p>Rumors and reports around the Steam Frame have been around for some time, but they really began to pick up steam in September when a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-new-vr-headset-might-have-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trademark filing discovered</a> the likely name of the device. Then, in October, it was reported that the headset had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valves-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entered mass production</a> while files on Steam were updated that signaled a release was imminent.</p>



<p>The Steam Frame features the ability to play both VR and non-VR games. Valve’s biggest claim is that the device “is a PC” that allows you to install your own apps, browse the web, and more. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Steam Frame Layout via Valve</figcaption></figure>



<p>With it being a PC, the Steam Frame will allow players to play stand-alone without the need to be connected to a computer. It features a 4nm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 CPU and up to 1TB of on-board storage with additional storage available via a microSD slot.</p>

<p>Valve is back in the “console” business. The Washington-based company has officially announced its next-gen Steam Machine to the world.</p>



<p>The Steam Machine is scheduled to launch in early 2026, though no firm date nor pricing has been confirmed.</p>







<p>Known internally as “Fremont”, this new console has been rumored for a long time. This summer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benchmarks for the device</a> even appeared on Geekbench.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">system will run</a> SteamOS and features a built-in power supply, storage of up to 2TB, and the ability to play at 4K with 60FPS on a “semi-custom” AMD CPU and GPU. </p>



<h6>More Steam: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-controller-2-announced-by-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Controller 2 Announced By Valve</a></h6>



<p>In addition to being designed for Steam, Valve says that users will be able to install their own operating system and apps on the device. They also say that it “enough horsepower” to stream to your Steam Deck, Steam Link, or even your new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-the-steam-frame-vr-headset/">Steam Frame VR Headset</a>.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time Steam has tried the standalone box. Back in 2015, the first generation of Steam Machines were released, but they didn’t perform too well and were quickly discontinued. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rockstar is facing legal troubles due to recent firings, with the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) taking matters into their own hands. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the GTA 6 developer recently fired employees for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giving out company secrets</a>. The fired workers then arranged a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-workers-protest-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protest</a> outside Take-Two’s London office with IWGB, claiming they were fired “in a blatant act of union busting”. Now, IWGB has issued a legal claim against Rockstar for the recent firings. </p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-due-to-alleged-union-busting">Rockstar Hit With Legal Claim Due to Alleged Union Busting</h2>



<p>In a legal statement shared with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the IWGB reveals that they are representing employees who Rockstar Games recently fired. IWGB believes that they were dismissed in circumstances that “amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity.” The statement adds that despite IGWB attempting to meet Rockstar and “resolve the matter through negotiation”, the latter has refused to meet and “persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful.”</p>



<p>Therefore, IWGB has “issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants.” The president of IWGB, Alex Marshall, added that they are confident that this is a case of “plain and simple union busting” and they will “mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers.” </p>



<p>The statement added that “Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law.” Marshall concluded, stating that “this case stands as a warning to any employer in the games industry and beyond who thinks they are able to act with impunity against organised workers – we will not be intimidated.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-arc-raiders-map-open-breaking-new-ground/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-arc-raiders-map-will-open-after-%E2%80%98breaking-new-ground%E2%80%99-community-event.1351510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has lifted the lid a little further on the North Line update, which kicks off tomorrow. Over the next few days, players will be challenged with a new Community Event, called ‘Breaking New Ground’. In this event, the Raiders will need to contribute crafting materials to collectively fuel the push into the new map, Stella Montis.</p>



<p>The faster the Raiders complete the challenge, the sooner the new map will be unlocked, Embark Studios has confirmed.</p>







<h2 id="h-breaking-new-ground-comes-to-arc-raiders-tomorrow">Breaking New Ground Comes to ARC Raiders Tomorrow</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has a new community event that effectively kickstarts the North Line update, dropping tomorrow on all platforms. This update will see the game’s first new map arrive in Stella Montis, a cold and sterile facility dug deep into the mountains above all the other maps.</p>



<p>The update also ushers in two new ARC enemies, the Matriarch and the Shredder. It has been said that the Matriarch makes the Queen look friendly, and the Shredder poses a challenge in tight environments.</p>



<p>For Breaking New Ground, players need to contribute the following to the collective effort:</p>



<ul>
<li>Metal Parts</li>



<li>Fabric</li>



<li>Chemicals</li>



<li>Rubber Parts</li>



<li>Plastic Parts</li>
</ul>



<p>This event also introduces Merits, a new currency type that ‘will fuel the next phase of progression’. Once the tunnel leading to Stella Montis has been opened up, Staking Our Claim, a new progression path, will open.</p>







<p>Embark Studios has also confirmed that new gameplay items and weapons are being added to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/arc-raiders-loaded-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> with the North Line update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New legendary weapon</li>



<li>Three new mines</li>



<li>Two new grenades</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders’ post-launch roadmap starts here and unravels further in December with the Cold Snap update, which in turn brings about the Flickering Flames event.</p>



<p>It’s also when players will have the first opportunity to reset their accounts, <strong>and </strong>it’s when snow blankets the game.</p>

If you've been hoping to save on video games during the seasonal sale event this year, there's already been plenty of worthy offers popping up. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> is one that's crossed our radar recently, as its PS5 version has received its first discount of 10% off at Amazon (<a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrxvg?object_uuid=9b073de0-1fb0-40a0-929f-3000e51b48da&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0FJHS8TH5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it here</a>).

Our 8/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">Battlefield 6 multiplayer review</a> from Justin Koreis said its action is, "expertly crafted, wrapped in a wonderful layer of destructibility that both looks great and materially affects the flow of combat." On top of that, "The gunplay is excellent, with weapons that are accurate enough to reward skilled shooting, but have just enough sway to promote a bit of careful thought while you take aim."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we inch closer to Black Friday, more video game deals are bound to drop.
