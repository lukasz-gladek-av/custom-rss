            <p>PlayStation maker Sony is suing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> for allegedly ripping off its Horizon video game franchise.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent development studio Polaris Quest revealed Light of Motiram</a>, a post-apocalyptic open-world survival crafting game with mechanised animal-like creatures which looked remarkably similar to Guerrilla and PlayStation's Horizon series.</p>
<p>Now, Sony is suing Tencent for copyright and trademark infringement in California federal court, calling Light of Motiram a "slavish clone" of the Horizon games.</p>

<p>The complaint by Sony alleges Tencent's Light of Motiram is unlawfully similar to both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, which was originally released in 2017, and its sequel Forbidden West, which came out in 2022. Not only that, the filing revealed that Tencent began working on Light of Motiram in 2023, before it approached Sony in 2024 with a pitch to create its own Horizon game in collaboration with the PlayStation maker. However, when Sony rejected this proposition, Tencent "continued secretly developing Light of Motiram", before announcing its game later that year.</p>
<p>Allegedly, Sony approached Tencent informally to resolve the copyright dispute once it became aware of Light of Motiram's existence. However, Sony said when it approached Tencent about the issue, Tencent once again tried to obtain a licence to use Horizon assets, which Sony again declined. Tencent then continued on regardless.</p>
<p>"Sony is thus forced to file this action and seek judicial relief to protect its valuable and hard-earned intellectual property rights in the Horizon franchise," the complaint reads.</p>
<p>Sony's complaint states Tencent's promotional materials including trailers and screenshots for Light of Motiram "misappropriated protectable elements of [Sony Interactive Entertainment's] copyrights in the Horizon franchise" to a "significant degree". This includes gameplay, story themes, characters, landscapes and other artistic elements. Sony noted the music used to promote Light of Motiram is also "highly similar" to Horizon's own.</p>
<p>The complaint goes on to additionally cite community comments as well as various headlines from websites, which all point out the striking similarities between Light of Motiram and the Horizon games. One screenshotted comment  from Light of Motiram's Steam page shared within the complaint reads: "Not only does it look like a copy of the Horizon games, but you had the cheek to copy the cover art as well."</p>
<p>Sony says Tencent has "confused" consumers with its promotional material, with many assuming Light of Motiram is affiliated with the Horizon series. Sony additionally shared several examples showing just how similar Light of Motiram's promotional material is to Horizon. You can see some of the shared examples below.</p>

<p>As for Horizon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">earlier this year Sony announced an upcoming film adaptation of Guerrilla's games</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-will-get-%E2%80%98durin%E2%80%99s-folk%E2%80%99-expansion-soon.1255701/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During a panel hosted at San Diego Comic-Con 2025, Free Range Games and North Beach Games announced Durin's Folk, an expansion to the survival game The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. Not many details were revealed at this point, except for an expanded end-game story, 'exciting' new game mechanics, and many more yet-to-be-revealed secrets.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™ - Durin's Folk - SDCC Exclusive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dR3nlac_v90?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As you might recall, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-is-out-october-24-for-pc-ps5-features-john-rhys-davies-as-gimli/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in October 2023</a> for PC and PlayStation 5. Initially, it was a console exclusive for Sony's console and a PC exclusive for the Epic Games Store. That changed in August 2024, when Free Range Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-now-available-on-steam-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released it</a> on Steam and Xbox Series S|X with cross-play between all platforms.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria was updated to optionally support dedicated servers. They can either be rented for a fee from a third-party provider or hosted by users. Owners of a dedicated server can then tweak specific settings to their liking, such as:</p>



<h4 id="h-difficulty-settings"><em>Difficulty Settings</em></h4>



<p><em><strong>setdifficulty</strong>&nbsp;- sets all of the server's difficulty settings to use a preset</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>setdifficulty story</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>setdifficulty solo</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>setdifficulty normal</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>setdifficulty hard</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>setdifficulty custom</em></strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>‍<strong>setcustomdifficulty [name] [value]&nbsp;</strong>- sets the specified difficulty setting [name] to the given value. Eg.&nbsp;setcustomdifficulty [combatdifficulty] [verylow]</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>Names:&nbsp;</em></strong>
<ul>
<li><em>combatdifficulty&nbsp;</em></li>



<li><em>enemyaggression</em></li>



<li><em>survivaldifficulty</em></li>



<li><em>miningdrops</em></li>



<li><em>worlddrops</em></li>



<li><em>hordefrequency</em></li>



<li><em>siegefrequency</em></li>



<li><em>patrolfrequency</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em><strong>Values</strong>:&nbsp;</em>
<ul>
<li><em>verylow, low, default, high, veryhigh&nbsp;‍</em></li>



<li><em>Not all of the named settings have the same range of values - some don’t have&nbsp;<strong>verylow, veryhigh</strong>&nbsp;so if those value are chosen, it will be set to&nbsp;<strong>low or high</strong>&nbsp;instead.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>If the Durin's Folk expansion is truly to launch soon, the developers may try to match the second anniversary of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, which is in around three months from now, on October 24, to be exact. Anyway, we'll keep you updated on any official announcements from Free Range Games.</p>

<p>Following a previous update, the development team has now confirmed the DLC characters Venom, Unika and Lucy will be made available for the Switch in <strong>Fall 2025</strong>. This version of the game is also expected to bring the Nintendo version "up to speed with the latest version".</p>
<p>This includes balance adjustments, ranked matches, and also plans to address some text issues. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h3>Guilty Gear Strive Nintendo Switch Edition Update (Fall 2025)</h3>

<p>Unlock a new theme next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>DK is back in his latest outing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and apart from new merch and promotions in mobile games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, he's also getting his very own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_99">Tetris 99</a> event.</p>
<p>Yes, Nintendo's Switch Online-focused battle-royale <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/tetris">Tetris</a> game will be hosting a special event between <strong>1st - 4th August, 2025</strong>. In this limited-time Maximus Cup, you'll be able to unlock a theme including special art, music and Tetrimino designs once you've accumulated 100 event points.</p>
<p>This event marks the 48th Maximus Cup event. If you haven't played Donkey Kong Bananza yet, you can check out our review here on Nintendo Life. Here's a quick sample:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza is an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play. The punching and crashing is a passing novelty that, once you get your fill, quickly becomes just another way of exploring the wonderfully varied and beautifully presented layers."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This latest update for Tetris 99 follows a Maximus Cup in June, which saw the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/tetris-99s-new-maximus-cup-sees-the-return-of-four-nintendo-themes">four Nintendo themes</a>.</p>

<p>If there's anything significant going on behind the scenes of this latest update, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Alongside this update, Nintendo has also released a new game for the SNES digital library today, and it makes use of mouse support (including the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode). Nintendo also added mouse support to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-a-mouse-game">few other games in the same library</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Nintendo is kicking off its Switch Online Playtest today in select locations. You can find out more about this in our previous coverage.</p>

<p>Mario Paint is finally back!!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you've been waiting to see the Super Nintendo title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> make a return, we've kind of got some exciting news today.</p>
<p>The game has officially been added to the SNES app for Switch Online users. The catch is, it requires a mouse. On Switch 2, you can use the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls to play the game, and for original Switch users, you can simply plug in a compatible USB mouse.</p>
<p>Here's Nintendo's official description for Mario Paint and you can see the game in action in the video above. Japan has received the <a href="https://youtu.be/uBn3orcH6O0">same update this week</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 1992 Super NES game turns your system into a canvas, with an array of colors and drawing tools available to create digital works of art. You can even animate your drawings and compose music to craft your own video creations! Get ready to unlock your inner artist using the Joy-Con 2 controller’s mouse functionality on Nintendo Switch 2, or by using a compatible USB mouse (sold separately) on a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch – OLED Model system.</p>
<p>And just like in the original game, you can access the Coloring Book featuring fun designs and character art or play the Gnat Attack training game for some extra mouse control fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this release, Nintendo has also added the Mario Paint soundtrack to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app today. All up, it features 19 tracks with a total runtime of 28 minutes.</p>
<p>To access Mario Paint on the Switch 2 or Switch, you'll need to have an active Switch Online membership. This will also allow you to listen to the game's album on Nintendo's Music app.</p>
<p>And to top it off, this update for the SNES app has <a href="https://youtu.be/BFpqxvRw9qI">also added mouse support</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario Super Picross</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/nobunagas_ambition">Nobunaga's Ambition</a> (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/mario-paint-gets-surprise-nintendo-switch-online-release-features-mouse-controls/">via Nintendo Everything</a>). Today's update to the 'Nintendo Classics' library <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/rumour-nintendo-may-be-looking-to-add-snes-mouse-support-to-switch-online">follows a rumour last year</a> about Switch Online getting mouse compatibility.</p>
<p>Today's digital SNES library update has taken place alongside the latest Switch 2 and Switch firmware update, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-3-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">bumping the systems up to Version 20.3.0</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/board-game-arena-subscription-plans</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-you-need-to-know-about-board-game-arena.1255611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting a group of friends together to learn and play a board game can be a daunting task. Not only does it require everyone in-person, but between setting up, learning the rules, and actually playing through the game it can end up taking multiple hours. Thankfully, there's an online solution that solves many of these issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena might be one of the best-kept secrets, despite having more than 10 million registered players. Still, the flexibility to play many of the most popular games today whenever you desire makes it a must for board game enthusiasts. With a massive catalog spanning every genre, it's got plenty to offer for both casual and hardcore players alike. Check out our full breakdown below to learn more about Board Game Arena, some of the included games, pricing, and what devices are supported.</p><p id="what-is-board-game-arena"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is Board Game Arena?">What Is Board Game Arena?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena is a <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> that allows you to play more than <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/gamelist" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,000 popular board games</a>—completely free. What's the catch? Surprisingly, there isn't one. It really is as good as it sounds. A metaphorical board game buffet just waiting to be devoured.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The browser-based website is pretty lightweight, allowing it to run seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. You can play games in real-time with players from across the world or set up a turn-based match that lets players take turns when it's convenient for them. While this significantly increases the time it takes to complete a game, it's a flexible option that's perfect for those with a busy schedule who can't dedicate the time it takes to sit down and play longer games.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">How it works</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Most games include a step-by-step guided tutorial, which is the perfect way to learn a new game that doesn't require combing through a massive rulebook. Many also have links to educational videos if you prefer to learn by watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best part about Board Game Arena is that the entire experience is automated. That means no more worrying about the rules or players potentially cheating. Each game features a simple interface that clearly indicates which moves you can make at any given moment. This also helps games move along at a brisk pace, as there's no setup, teardown, or fiddling with components.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can create digital tables and indicate the number of opponents they are looking for before starting a match. Generally, finding players is quick, with tables often filled in a matter of seconds. Some games even include expansion content, which you can decide to enable when setting up your table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each game features a built-in text chat option to interact with your friends or opponents. And, if you want to host a virtual game night and get the full experience, optional voice and video chat are also available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because many board games require a lot of time and commitment, Board Game Arena leverages a <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/news?id=304" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reputation system for all players</a>. Anyone who takes too long to make a move or leaves a game before it's finished receives a penalty. This allows you to quickly identify potential problem players and avoid matching with them to ensure a positive play experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For players looking to test their ability, Board Game Arena also offers ranked matches and tournaments for every game. This is a great way to face off against some of the best players in the world and improve your skill.</p><p id="subscription-tiers"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Subscription Tiers">How Much Does Board Game Arena Cost?</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena is available in two tiers: free and Premium. The free tier only requires that you create a free account in order to access the catalog of games. However, you'll quickly find that many of the most popular games have the "Premium" badge on them, which means you can't start a table unless you have a paid subscription. If you're patient, though, you can wait for another premium member to set up a table and join for free.</p><div catalogid="9b93e6b9-077f-4e03-9675-f0d3733462be" id="225356"><div id="225356" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Board Game Arena</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, to experience the best of Board Game Arena without any restrictions, you'll want to sign up for a Premium account. Like most <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-subscription-services">game subscription services</a>, you can pay monthly or yearly, with the latter being a bit cheaper in comparison. Board Game Arena's is priced at <strong>$5 per month</strong> or <strong>$42 per year</strong> (which works out to about $3.50 a month). For less than the price of a new board game you can experience more than 1,000—with more added every week.</p></div><p id="games-included"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Games Included">What Games Does Board Game Arena Include?</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/25/wingspan-board-game-review-1674676696680.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena features some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">most popular board games</a> available today, including: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building games</a> like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review">Wingspan</a>, Splendor, and Res Arcana; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family games</a> like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/azul-board-game-review">Azul</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/15/ticket-to-ride-review">Ticket to Ride</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harmonies-board-game-review">Harmonies</a>; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative games</a> like Pandemic, Sky Team, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-review">The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick-Taking Game</a>, and many, many more. The best part—new games are added weekly, so there's always something to look forward to and play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more experienced players, there are plenty of longer, more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic games</a> that typically need a well-versed group to play including Terraforming Mars, Ark Nova, and Terra Mystica. While these games can take hours in-person, the instant setup and automated turn structure helps them move much faster than their real-world counterparts, making this the ideal way to play many of these heavier games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although most games require two or more players to enjoy, Board Game Arena has a vast catalog of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo games</a> for players who prefer that format. Many modern games also include a solo variant, allowing you to play against an <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/2414/blogpost/109521/what-is-an-automa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automa</a> and learn the strategy without the pressure of additional players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you only have a few minutes to spare, Board Game Arena also features dozens of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick board games</a> that can be played on your phone to give you your fix.

<p>A new trailer has also dropped</p>

<p><strong>Update #3 [<time datetime="2025-07-29T00:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Tue 29th Jul 2025, 1:30am</time>]:</strong> Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a>'s developer Siactro confirmed this latest entry would arrive on <strong>8th August 2025</strong> for <strong>$4.99</strong>. To go with this announcement, we've got another trailer.</p>
<p>Although the game is releasing on the original Switch, it will also be playable and purchasable on the Switch 2.</p>
<hr><p><strong>Update #2 [<time datetime="2024-12-08T07:00:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Sun 8th Dec 2024, 7am</time>]:</strong></p><p>Following the delay of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a> last month, developer Siactro has now released a brand new gameplay trailer featuring the music track Blackbird Down (Toree Saturn OST) by KB. This game will arrive on Switch and PC in "early 2025".</p>
<hr><p><strong>Update #1 [<time datetime="2024-11-24T13:35:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Sun 24th Nov 2024, 1:35pm</time>]:</strong></p><p>Although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a> was scheduled to arrive this year on the Switch, developer Siactro has announced the game has now been delayed until early 2025. The quality would have apparently "suffered a lot" had it been released next month. Here's the message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am sorry, but I have to delay Toree Saturn into early 2025. A december release was possible, but the quality would have suffered a lot. I worked with really incredible people on this and I am not going to treat their work with a low quality release. I am very sorry!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>When we get a release date update, we'll be sure to let you know!</em></p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>A new trailer and PC demo for the upcoming release <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/toree_saturn">Toree Saturn</a></strong> have been released, with the developer Siactro also reconfirming the new entry will arrive at some point in <strong>2024</strong>. This latest update mentions a Nintendo Switch release, too.</p>
<p>When this new project was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/09/toree-saturn-looks-set-to-provide-even-more-adorable-low-poly-platforming-next-year">originally announced in September last year</a>, there was no Nintendo announcement at that point, so there you go!</p>

<p>Here's a brief rundown about what to expect from the latest entry in this speed-based 3D platformer series (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2549240/Toree_Saturn/">via Steam</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Run through linear levels from point A to B with a double jumping bird while avoiding enemies, collecting stars (if desired), and getting all kinds of little speed boosts along the way."</p>
<p>- Toree has two new moves! The player can now use a grounddash in mid air to descend faster and get a speedboost when impacting on the ground, as well as homing in on special stars to get a height and movement boost.​​</p>
<p>- New Looks! Toree Saturns artstyle tries to be a combination of late 90s 3D with some of the more crazy looks of the early Y2K era. It's like a natural evolution of the artstyle of the previous games... I hope.​​</p>
<p>- Controlling Toree got way easier!​<br>
No more Run-Button, meaning players don't have to hold down the right trigger for ages.​<br>
Most actions (except for the trigger for the ground dash) only use the Jump button.​<br>
Ground Dash is performed by the now freed Right Trigger of your controller (LMB if K&amp;M)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has integrated an optional age verification system in the UK to comply with the newly implemented Online Safety Act, with the long-term consequence being that some social features on Xbox will be limited in the UK for those that do not verify starting in early 2026.</p>
<p>As outlined on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/">Xbox Wire news story</a>, from today, “players who indicate their account age as 18 and over, based in the UK, and signing into an Xbox experience with a Microsoft account will begin seeing notifications encouraging them to verify their age.”</p>


<p>“Starting early next year, age verification will be required for these players in the UK to retain full access to social features on Xbox, such as voice or text communication and game invites. Players who don’t verify their age between now and early 2026 can continue to play and enjoy Xbox. However, starting early next year, their use of social features on Xbox will become limited to friends only until they complete the age verification process. Whether a player verifies their age will not affect any previous purchases, entitlements, gameplay history, achievements, or the ability to play and purchase games, however we encourage players to verify their age via this one-time process now to avoid uninterrupted use of social features on Xbox in the future.”</p>
<p>What’s amusing here is that game purchases will not be affected in the slightest. Little Timmy can buy at 18-rated game like Grand Theft Auto 5 without verifying his face – perhaps using gift cards – but won’t be able to chat to other people online. Except he still will be, because social features to friends will still be possible, and there must surely be some kind of facility for under-18s to make friends through chat and invites.</p>
<p>Age verification will be possible using “proof of government-issued ID, age estimation, mobile provider check, and credit card check,” and Microsoft assures that “The information players provide during the age verification process is protected with industry-standard encryption and is not stored or used for any other purpose.”</p>

<p>Microsoft has partnered with Yoti for the facial age estimation, which was not fooled by Norman Reedus’ face as rendered by Death Stranding over the weekend.</p>
<p>The UK Online Safety Act was voted and given royal assent under the previous Tory government in 2023, with the scheduled implementation of July 2025 meaning that it is now coming into effect under the current Labour government. It might be egregious and, for the time being, exceptionally fallible for all the main things it was trying to block, but it’s also potentially a precursor to similar legislation that is being proposed in other countries and regions – the EU and US are both considering similar, we’re just so forward thinking and futuristic in the UK.</p>
<p>Microsoft says that “we’ll continue to evaluate how we can keep players around the world safe and learn from the UK process. We expect to roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to player safety, so these methods may look different across regions and experiences.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b3eb7ef1-31bd-43e4-bd15-aa4e8990ab75" href="https://techraptor.net/games/starrupture" rel="nofollow"><em>StarRupture</em></a> is an open-world, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e2fac55-7c08-4df9-8cd3-a855c0dff7df" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-games-why-we-keep-on-coming-back-for-more" rel="nofollow">survival crafting game</a> set in space from indie studio Creepy Jar. This is the studio's second survival game, having produced&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d60f8f93-57ae-418f-9999-eebdf6c54d21" href="https://techraptor.net/games/green-hell" rel="nofollow">Green Hell</a>.&nbsp;</em>Taking more of an automation route with their space title, you'll explore a strange world within the Ruptura system.&nbsp;Your mission: gather resources and ship products to various companies. The only catch is you're a prisoner and you're on this planet to pay off your debt.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>StarRupture</em>&nbsp;Preview | Space Based Survival</h2>

<p>For the playtest, you only have one&nbsp;prisoner option: the Scientist. The details of your crime are marked confidential. How much you owe isn't listed anywhere, so you don't actually know what you need to earn to be free. You don't even learn much about the program you're in, which makes a free future possible.</p>

<p>What you do know is that dying increases your debt. This is due to each death triggering a new sleeve, a fresh body, to be fabricated. While the body is also referred to as a shell in some conversations, sleeve is the primary way to refer to it. This reminds me directly of&nbsp;<em>Altered Carbon</em>, which could be an inspiration for&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>.&nbsp;</p>

To finish any of the available shipment lines for a company, you'll have to construct multiple crafting buildings, including smelters, fabricators, furnaces, and more. The assembly lines, known as rails, may cross much of the area by the end of your experience. This makes it similar to games like&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ad287941-87b4-47ba-9bfa-1184bd27b53c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/satisfactory" rel="nofollow"><em>Satisfactory</em></a>&nbsp;that combine survival with crafting automation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to the region you can explore, there are multiple environments you can interact with, giving you a taste of the different biomes you may experience throughout the full title. There are ponds, a radiation zone, a meadow area that drains your movement and health, as well as the rocky crags where you'll often find large ore veins. There are strange rock pillars you'll discover, holes that are currently covered by vines but have something glowing within, and two different ruins you can pillage.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starrupture-rock-pillar.jpg?itok=QkWh5tPD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starrupture-rock-pillar.jpg?itok=t_Xyl8S6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is where the mystery comes in. In the remaining buildings, you'll find notes about body enhancements gone awry, other prisoners that've worked on the planet, and a potential murder. None of the questions brought up are answered. It's assumed these will be explored when you have free rein in Early Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, the playtest had few bugs, the largest one focusing on the enemies, the Vermin. At times and typically affecting only the easiest variety of the creature, you'll see them flickering, as if a broken light was illuminating their bodies. This makes it hard on the eyes and harder to aim shots at them. The only other issue I ran into was that, upon respawn, I would get momentarily stuck in the regeneration pod and have to jump out of it instead of just walking.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starrupture-basic-vermin-enemy.jpg?itok=GlltlFN9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starrupture-basic-vermin-enemy.jpg?itok=Rch9Vw_Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are more than just the basic vermin. You can encounter up to four additional types. The blue exploding ones emit infection, green ones spit venom, others have viscous claws, and the final type combines venom with burning for a rapid death. The basic variety is the sole one affected by the flickering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are the only enemies you'll run into while playing. They often attack in swarms and can be difficult to deal with initially. Once you get a pistol and grenades, they are easily negated. With little in the way of a challenge, the<em>&nbsp;</em>playtest can feel less like a survival title and primarily a crafting automation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along with the flickering bug and lack of challenge, the dialogue may use AI-generated voices at some points. This is the most obvious when listening to an audio recording concerning a female prisoner. The voice of Harvey Summers is flat, with no emotion and an odd cadence, all pointing to AI. On the Steam page for the game, there is no note of AI usage in the title, nor is there anything listed on the website. Whether this is a simple placeholder oversight or lackluster voice acting is unknown.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suspected-ai-audio-starrupture.jpg?itok=CoEE62OE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suspected-ai-audio-starrupture.jpg?itok=DLGYFY90 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another issue with the audio is when a Rupture is about to hit. There are dueling lines playing at the same time. It's disrupting to the gameplay and can make it hard to actually understand what's happening during the first instance. It doesn't impact the overall playtest, however, as you can read what's being said to know how to react.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>&nbsp;has a mystery, all it presents in the playtest are small tidbits to reel you in. What's known of the story is well written. The gameplay is straightforward survival mechanics utilizing automation to achieve objectives. There's just not enough to differentiate it from other titles on the market at this time. I am intrigued to see how the story and world expand when it finally releases into Early Access.&nbsp;</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is suing Tencent to attempt to stop the release of <em>Light of Motiram</em>, which Sony describes as a “slavish clone” of its <em>Horizon</em> series of games, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/">as reported by <em>Reuters</em></a>. <em>Light of Motiram</em> was announced last year with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTMxBhy2dp0">a trailer</a> featuring an aesthetic that’s quite similar to the <em>Horizon</em> franchise — including huge robot animals and even a title font that resembles the <em>Horizon</em> games.</p><p>In its complaint, Sony alleges that “unlawful copying of the protected audiovisual elements of the <em>Horizon</em> games, as well as its deliberate adoption of a confusingly similar character mark, constitutes both copyright and trademark infringement that should be enjoined immediately.”</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Tencent started developing <em>Light of Motiram</em> in 2023. At the Game Developers Conference in March 2024, Tencent allegedly pitched Sony on a proposal that would have its Aurora Studios subsidiary “develop a <em>Horizon</em> sequel game under the requested license,” which Sony rejected. “Apparently, Tencent was undeterred by SIE’s refusal to license its <em>Horizon</em> intellectual property,” Sony says.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3319630%2FLIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM%2F" rel="sponsored">game’s Steam page</a>, <em>Light of Motiram’s</em> developer and publisher is Polaris Quest. In the lawsuit, Sony alleges that “Upon information and belief, Tencent Shanghai does business under the names ‘Aurora Studios’ and/or ‘Polaris Quest.’”</p><p>Sony says that it “had discussions with Tencent” to informally try to “resolve its concern that <em>Light of Motiram</em> violated its intellectual property rights.” However, Sony alleges that Tencent “again sought to license the <em>Horizon</em> intellectual property,” to which it “communicated clearly and unequivocally that it would not license the <em>Horizon</em> assets to Tencent, objected to <em>Light of Motiram</em>, and insisted that it be withdrawn.”</p><p>Tencent didn’t reply to a request for comment.</p><p>This isn’t the only high-profile lawsuit over allegedly similar video games. Last year, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">against <em>Palworld</em>-developer Pocketpair</a>. Pocketpair said in May that it had to remove features from the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/663210/palworld-updates-feature-removed-nintendo-lawsuit">due to the lawsuit</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/714870/sony-tencent-horizon-clone-lawsuit]]></content:encoded>

		<p>We've snuck in a bunch of extra podcast recordings in anticipation of my departure and while I won't be on Remap Radio or livestreams for a minute (though you'll hear and see me this week!), I will haunt you from afar while navigating the tube. A huge thanks to the many folks who have reached out with recommendations on what to do while my family is in London and Paris. I'm now in that weird period where I keep putting devices into my backpack, because even though the trip isn't for a few days, it feels weird to put it back into a drawer? What if I forget my Switch?? Which would never happen?? But what if???????</p><p>A preview of what's coming:</p><ul><li>Sports! ✅</li><li>My Turn: Big Fan (feat: Austin Walker) ✅</li><li>The State of Nintendo (feat: Kat Bailey) ✅</li><li>HOA Mailbag ✅</li></ul><p>-pk, who managed to get access to <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>early 😈</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>The week!</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong><em> Sports!</em> – Folks, the Chicago Cubs are <em>really good</em> right now. Which is why we had to invite 404 Media's Jason Koebler on to talk about how much it sucks to be a fan of his team, the disappointing Baltimore Orioles. In the first half of the podcast, though, we talk about 404 Media’s excellent reporting on tech’s takeover of politics, the rise of Silicon Valley on the right, the newfound obsession over the R-word in those circles, and, eventually, if the pitch clock was a good idea.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Peak</em> – We've done a few <em>Peak</em> streams, and the key to doing another one is having to mix up the lineup. Knock on wood, we should have myself, Rob, and Chia together to see if we can make it to the end again. (lol)</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> – The crew weighs in on what they've been watching, playing, listening to, reading, etc.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Timberborn</em> – While I'm gone for a hot minute, Chia will also be off for a few days. At my insistence, I think Rob's going to try solo streaming some time with <em>Timberborn</em>, the city building game with beavers he's obsessed with.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – I'll have spent more time hours with <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, I've now finished <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> (spoiler cast coming when I'm back from my trip!), and besides first impressions of <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, Janet and I will be able to read to finishing<em> And Roger</em>.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – Topic TBD.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-world-is-conspiring-against-me-legally-experiencing-the-fragrant-flower-blooms-with-dignity.1255497/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fragrant_Flower_Blooms_with_Dignity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity</em></a> at the top of my manga and anime list for a long time. However, the powers that be at Netflix and Kodansha—exclusive owners of its anime and manga—turned my genuine interest in checking out the series into a frustrating comedy of errors this weekend, and I need to vent about it.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/82024665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity</em></a> is a cute romance series. In it, Rintaro Tsumugi, a “mean-faced” high school delinquent with a heart of gold, and Kaoruko Waguri, the quintessence of “must protect at all costs” honor student at a prestigious high school, strike up a tumultuous Romeo and Juliet love story. As a lover of romance anime (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-self-aware-harem-anime-must-finish-its-story-2000560926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trashy or otherwise</a>) that waves its <a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">male shojo-josei fan flag</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/solo-leveling-impressions-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scoffs at shonen</a>,<em> Fragrant Flower</em> is extremely my shit.&nbsp;</p><p>And what’s not to love? It’s a charming manga by <a href="https://x.com/_mikami_saka_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saka Mikami</a>, a creator who <a href="https://pocket.shonenmagazine.com/article/entry/kaoruhana_20220414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used to be an assistant</a> on <em>Wind Breaker</em>. The series allows the characters to just talk to each other, subverting frustrating, tropey misunderstandings. It also has a mature exploration of growing out of implicit class biases, questions the eagerness of young people to jump into relationships before establishing friendships with the opposite sex, and simply being a kind, empathetic person. The anime is animated by <a href="https://en.cloverworks.co.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloverworks</a>, a studio deep in its bag, having also brought <em>Wind Breaker</em>’s anime to life. Alongside an anime that <a href="https://aftermath.site/wind-breaker-shonen-anime-toxic-masculinity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">challenges toxic masculinity</a>, Cloverworks is delivering a fantastic follow-up to its rom-com, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs4FGjG58OM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>My Dress Up Darling</em></a>, in tandem with <em>Fragrant Flower</em>’s release.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Wind Breaker © Satoru Nii/Kodansha Ltd/The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity © Saka Mikami/Kodansha Ltd.</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, <em>Fragrant</em> <em>Flower</em>’s anime release schedule is the first inconvenience in my effort to watch the series this weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>To call <em>Fragrant Flower</em> a Summer 2025 anime in the West is a misnomer. Despite it airing on July 6 and being advertised as Netflix’s latest exclusive, the show is only airing in Asia. <a href="https://x.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1941587890145747166" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It won’t air in other regions, such as the U.S., until September 7th</a>. This shit sucks especially hard because this isn’t the first time Netflix has fucked up a show’s release.</p><p>Famously, when Netflix became the exclusive home for <a href="https://kotaku.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure-stone-ocean-netflix-binge-watch-1849846467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean</em></a>—the first and only epic in Hirohiko Araki’s long-running series with a female protagonist—the streamer replaced Crunchyroll’s weekly release with a binge drop of the anime that it didn’t even promote. It was a move that, at the time, I criticized because it eliminated the show’s once-coveted online status as a weekly topic of online conversation. Before there were <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dan Da Dan </em></a>Thursdays and <a href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em></a>’s Machu Tuesday, there were JoJo Fridays. During this fan-designated day, fans would look forward to creating fan art and discussing the week-to-week developments from the previous season, <em>Golden Wind</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney+ : Where Anime Goes to Die" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQe6z02M9OY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While Netflix seemed to learn from its mistakes by releasing its popular shonen series weekly, it adopted another frustrating trend in anime, made famous by Disney+, known colloquially as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SummerTimeRendering/comments/u5wtqk/about_the_disney_jail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Disney Jail</a>” with <em>Fragrant Flower</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>As fellow anime enthusiast Geoff Thew pointed out, “Disney Jail” has caused otherwise hyped shows like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDs0VfNNeMw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Heavenly Delusion</em></a>, <em>Summertime Rendering</em>, and <em>Tokyo Revengers</em> to lose popularity because of their staggered exclusive releases on Disney+ and Hulu, which takes them out of the conversation with other shows they’re supposed to be airing alongside. “Disney Jail” has become such an annoying issue that it has united even the most red-pilled MAGA manosphere online anime critics in a rallying cry against it. Because yeah, it fucking sucks.&nbsp;</p><p>But fine. Whatever. Netflix, in all its infinite wisdom, is playing a Tortoise and the Hare game, sabotaging the hype of a promising non-shonen show by stifling its Western momentum through staggered releases for reasons only known to God. All of this would’ve been easier to stomach if Netflix hadn't been flaunting the show in my face by posting clips from its new episodes on social media that I couldn’t watch.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity | Official Clip | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qy5Zw_g9jVU?start=37&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I’d resigned myself to remaining steadfast and not going to the high seas to watch the show until it premieres in September. It’s a virtuous decision on my part. I’m <a href="https://aftermath.site/netflix-password-sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paying Netflix an exorbitant fee</a> to watch and be denied access to an anime because of my spawn point on this bitch of an Earth. However, the second act in my weekend's gripe with heaven and earth, which prevented me from experiencing <em>Fragrant Flower </em>legally, was marked by the insidious introduction of false hope.</p><p>On July 25, K Manga, Kondansha’s manga reading app, retweeted a post from anime news account animetv_jp, announcing that all chapters of <em>Fragrant Flower</em> would be free to read on its app and webpage this weekend. In the past, I’d criticized K Manga as <a href="https://aftermath.site/heres-the-dumb-shit-you-have-to-put-up-with-to-read-manga-these-days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the more frustrating manga reading apps of all time</a> because of its ticketed gacha gamification, which made reading manga feel like a series of hoops to jump through. I countered this system by logging into the app every morning and saving five tickets, which could be used to read one chapter of a manga.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="K MANGA - Tickets System Explanation" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UsOz7exvN4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>However, I gave up months ago when I forgot to keep up with my routine—my tickets (about 100) expired. Yep, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/all-my-apes-gone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all my apes gone</a>. A couple of weeks ago, I tried, unevenly, to rebuild my ticket stash, but like falling out of a gacha game, it’s hard to get back into the habit or see the point once the spell’s been broken.&nbsp;</p><p>But hark, descending through luminous god rays breaking up my manga-reading thunderclouds, K Manga recognized that Netflix fumbled the bag with Western anime fans and was throwing a life raft to folks like me by stopping its poor practices and letting me read this weekend as a cosmic apology.&nbsp;</p><p>This, too, was a lie.</p><figure><figcaption>K Manga premium ticket, mocking me. <span></span><span>Kodansha</span></figcaption></figure><p>While reading chapters of <em>Fragrant Flower</em>, I noticed that clicking on new chapters—despite being labeled as free—still required me to click on the ticket to “rent” a chapter I was reading. Too generously, I gave K Manga the benefit of the doubt, thinking the website, which would briefly show a Windows Internet Explorer 9-era browser clicking out of a full-screen view before snapping to Windows 11, had some sort of coding snafu not taking into account its chapters being free. But the more I read the slow-burning manga, which admittedly moved its plot along brisker than other romance manga that often shy away from having their characters discuss their feelings, I noticed my K Manga ticket count dwindle.&nbsp;</p><p>Surely, they weren’t still charging me to read <em>Fragrant Flower</em> by using my tickets during its free weekend? I endeavored to keep reading until I ran out of my tickets and see if K Manga would still let me read more of the manga, which was again advertised as being free to read this weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>NOPE.&nbsp;</p><p>Once I hit chapter 25, Kodansha informed me that I’d run out of premium tickets to read <em>Fragrant Flower</em> manga chapters, and they did so on my weekend dedicated to reading chapters of <em>Fragrant Flower</em> digitally on K Manga with the promise of all chapters (“except for the latest chapter”) being free on the weekend.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>K Manga screenshot alerting me that I'm out of free tickets to read free chapters.<span></span><span>Kodansha</span></figcaption></figure><p>In an era where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simulcast</a>—English and Japanese releases of episodes—have become the norm, why would Netflix, a streamer that has been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-20/sony-s-crunchyroll-finds-its-early-lead-in-anime-under-attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eating Crunchyroll’s lunch</a> in both <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/netflix-disney-anime-dentsu-study-1236446772/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viewer numbers and quality over quantity</a> with its careful curation of anime shows in its growing library, stifle itself by staggering a show’s release and almost forcing fans to go to the high seas to experience a show that has been teasing them by posting clips when folks can’t watch it on their platform?&nbsp;</p><p>By the time the show premieres on Netflix in September, all momentum and conversation about <em>Fragrant Flower</em> will be a shadow of Disney Jail and Netflix’s binge model, shaking hands like Dutch and Dillon, killing the cute show’s chances of being in the conversation it so desperately deserves.

Why must you conspire to make it impossible to experience this cute series legally?</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/anime-manga-disney-jail-netflix-fragrant-flower]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it’s the difficulty of gathering your game group together consistently, you prefer playing solo, or you're just looking for new players to test your strategies against, physical board games and tabletop experiences may not be enough. Luckily, some fantastic games have been adapted into digital formats that allow for gaming wherever your gaming group may be and for tense matches whenever you want. It really is an exciting time to be a fan of tabletop games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This guide will point you in the direction of digital adaptations that will scratch that itch you have to play some board games, but also serve as learning resources to introduce new titles into your game night rotation.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Just a note: This list won’t include digital adaptations for TCGs such as Magic: The Gathering or Virtual Tabletop platforms for TTRPGs; it focuses solely on board games. </em></p><p id="root"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Root">Root</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225994"><div id="225994" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Root</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Root from Leder Games disguises rich asymmetric area control under the facade of cute and cuddly woodland critters. Anywhere from one to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a> struggle against one another, attempting to take control of areas and complete unique faction-specific goals to earn Victory Points. Whoever reaches 30 points first wins. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This digital adaptation successfully captures the visual style of Kyle Ferrin’s art and benefits from different aspects being automated. Root offers both Local and Online play in addition to some wonderful tutorials, which are especially helpful and a great resource in learning all of the factions. Speaking of factions, developer Direwolf Digital (expect to see that more on the list) continues to release expansions, unlocking new maps and playable factions.</p></div><p id="dune-imperium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dune: Imperium">Dune: Imperium</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225995"><div id="225995" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dune: Imperium</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With the physical version winning <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/news/2022/2022-sxsw-gaming-awards-winners-announced/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SXSW’s Board Game of the Year in 2022</a> and the digital adaptation recently winning <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3508413/19th-annual-golden-geek-winners-for-2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BoardGameGeeks' 2024 Golden Geek</a> award for Best Board Game App, Dune: Imperium is an easy recommendation. This mixture of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-worker-placement-board-games">worker placement</a> and deck-building title set in the Dune universe is a modern classic that offers a fun time for board game hobbyists while not being overly complicated to get into for newcomers. Players take turns placing their spies around Dune, improving their standing with different groups, and waging war in an effort to earn enough points to trigger the end game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's really neat about this digital version is that not only does it feature a good tutorial, solo play against computers, and online play (ranked, events, and casual options), but you can also test your skills with special Challenge games with unique rules. Regardless of how you play it, anyone even remotely interested in board games should try Dune: Imperium – or its sort of 2nd Edition, Dune: Imperium - Uprising – at least once. Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review">Dune: Imperium board game review </a>for more details about the game itself.</p></div><p id="spirit-island"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Spirit Island">Spirit Island</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225996"><div id="225996" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Spirit Island</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You are a powerful spirit, and your island and its inhabitants, the Dahan (who are also your worshippers), are in danger from foreign invaders who are laying claim to portions of your home. It’s up to you and your fellow spirits to deal with this problem. Spirit Island is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> deck-building and area control game, where you and your friends will have to use your spirits’ special abilities and build out a power deck to force these colonists off your island. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This digital implementation streamlines the process, offloading all of the upkeep between turns like spawning more colonists and moving them around, making this feel like an overall much faster game. Despite being a cooperative title, this game can be challenging, but luckily, the various spirits are ranked in terms of complexity, so even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">board game beginners</a> can have a good time. Adding in the expansions will provide you with even more spirits to choose from, more customization choices for your island, with Horizons of Spirit Island designed as the ideal jumping-in point for those learning Spirit Island. </p></div><p id="machi-koro-with-everyone"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Machi Koro with Everyone">Machi Koro with Everyone</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225997"><div id="225997" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Machi Koro with Everyone</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s even better than getting one digital board game? Getting two! Machi Koro with Everyone is a digital bundle that provides players with both the first and second versions of this delightful and charming game. In Machi Koro, players spend coins to buy new properties for their small cities and roll dice to try to earn money, with the end goal of being the first person to build three special buildings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This adaptation features colorful art and cute customizable avatars. It is an excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">board game for families</a> to enjoy, thanks to its local play functionality and short game time of approximately 20 minutes. When you’re ready, though, you can go online and test your skills against other players around the world. Machi Koro with Everyone is the easiest game to learn on this list, and arguably one of the most charming.</p></div><p id="scythe-digital-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Scythe: Digital Edition">Scythe: Digital Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225998"><div id="225998" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Scythe: Digital Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in an alternate version of the 1920s Europe where giant mechs exist and help with farming (and war), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/scythe-board-game-buying-guide">Scythe</a> is an engine-building / worker placement game where players manage not only gathering resources but also waging war on one another. This digital adaptation of the game captures all of the tense moments and rich strategy that players have fallen in love with in the physical board game, but speeds things up thanks to the automation of various systems that only a digital game can provide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a nifty added bonus, Sythe Digital allows you to customize the paint scheme of your units. If you're looking to play against your friends instead of just the computer or random folks online, Scythe: Digital Edition features crossplay, allowing you to play with others regardless of the platform.</p></div><p id="gloomhaven"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225999"><div id="225999" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gloomhaven</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be argued that one of the games that has defined this new era of tabletop was 2017’s behemoth of a game, Gloomhaven. This sprawling campaign title featuring 95 unique scenarios, branching storylines, a ton of characters, and intricate card-based combat has left it’s mark on the scene, but one thing that has always held it back somewhat are the space it takes up and the large amount of time investment it takes to get to the end. Thankfully, Gloomhaven has a digital version that allows you to play online with your friends, instead of trying to organize 50 in-person game nights with friends, regardless of what platform someone may own the game on. If you find yourself a master Gloomhaven player already, then you can take on the 100 special Guildmaster missions or build your own levels with the game’s built-in level editor, and share with the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our love for Gloomhaven here at IGN is well established, being featured on a number of our various board game buyer’s guides including “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games">The Best RPG Board Games Worth Playing</a>”, “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">The Best Campaign Board Games</a>”,  “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-games-like-dungeons-and-dragons">11 Board Games Like Dungeons &amp; Dragons Worth Playing</a>”, and now you can add one more to the list. The game really is just that good, and this is the easiest way to play, including its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Jaws of the Lion expansion</a>. And there is no better way to get ready for the upcoming digital version of its follow-up, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frosthaven-board-game-review">Frosthaven</a>!</p></div><p id="dominion"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dominion">Dominion</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="226000"><div id="226000" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dominion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The progenitor of the deck-building genre of board games, Dominion is the perfect game to bust out when you have a little time to kill. In Dominion, players take turns buying cards from a shared pool of available options, determined by the expansions and sets they have, creating unique scenarios. What makes this game beloved is how different card effects and triggers play off of one another, requiring you to plan out not only what cards you will purchase, but also the order in which to play them from your hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This digital version continues to see strong support, with many of the physical game’s expansions seeing release in this format as well, and with the option to play not only against computer opponents of various difficulties, you can also play online against friends and random players around the world, regardless of the platform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that the base game, which can provide hours of fun on its own, is completely free, when paired with just how many expansions you can also get for this digital game, make it an easy inclusion on the list, and we have also featured Dominion on some of our other lists too, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games"><u>best deck-building games</u></a>.</p></div><p id="werewolf-mafia"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Werewolf / Mafia">Werewolf / Mafia</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="226001"><div id="226001" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>One Night: Ultimate Werewolf</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">How well can you tell when your friends are lying, and how well can you hide when you are?

If your family or game group is one of those who adores collecting these feathered friends, this digital version of Wingspan is a must-have. Wingspan is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building game</a> in which you attract different types of birds to roost on your board, lay eggs, and earn points.

A vast majority of the games on BGA (917 currently) come with in-depth step-by-step tutorials to help you learn the game, too. This is a handy tool for individuals who want to make sure they like a game before spending a bunch of money on the physical product. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want access to the entire catalog that Board Game Arena offers, you will have to pay to get a Premium account, but at only $5 a month or $36 a year, the price is well worth it just for the additional games you get alone.

                <p>Xbox has expanded its game streaming perk for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. Starting today, July 28, players can now stream their Xbox library to their PCs directly through the Xbox PC app.</p><p>In recent years, Microsoft has added the ability to stream your Xbox library to many devices, including Xbox consoles, smart TVs, and browsers. It <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-july-update-more-ways-to-play/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> today that this functionality has finally been added to the Xbox app on PC, meaning that most Xbox-related functionality should now be available in the app.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4539563-7798981786-July-.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4539563" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4539563-7798981786-July-.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4539563"></a><figcaption>Your Xbox library has gotten a fresh coat of paint across devices.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4539563-7798981786-July-.jpg"></figure><p>Streaming Xbox games isn't just a neat way to access your Game Pass library when you're away from your console or home PC. It also lets PC-only players access Xbox console exclusives that haven't made their way to PC yet.</p><p>Microsoft has also rolled out a bunch of other upgrades for the Xbox PC app. These are highlighted by efforts to consolidate and streamline the cloud gaming process. The app surfaces cross-device play history, meaning that you can start playing a game on Xbox and pick up your progress via game streaming in the app. The app update also adds a more cohesive game library, combining all games available to stream across consoles, including both purchased games and those available via Game Pass. Both of these changes are currently available for members of the Xbox Insider program, which is <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free to join and open for everyone.</a></p><p>Finally, the Xbox PC app now has an easier way to track Microsoft Rewards. Microsoft states that the new system will surface Rewards progress as you play, allowing you to track points across play sessions.</p>

That’s where the Banandium Root resides. Believing it has the power to grant wishes, Donkey Kong and Pauline set out to claim it for themselves. The journey takes you through 16 different layers of the world before you finally get there, collecting Banandium Gems, unlocking new skills, and defeating members of the evil mining company VoidCo along the way. It’s long, especially if you take your time to hunt down hidden bananas and other secrets on every level. </p><p>I wasn’t expecting its story to pay off with any particularly big surprises, but  right before you reach the Planet Core, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> reveals the true final boss that’s been waiting in the wings: King K. Rool. The Kremlin leader hasn’t been in a Donkey Kong game since the 2007 spin-off <em>Donkey Kong: Jungle Climber</em>. He’s not in any of the marketing for <em>Bananza</em> and fans have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1ltjofn/k_rool_discussions_from_15_years_ago_following/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1ltjofn/k_rool_discussions_from_15_years_ago_following/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debating for months</a></span> whether Nintendo would actually bring him back after all this time.</p><figure id="" data-id="65053e9ec1c1a938c01dd5af22b66c61" data-recommend-id="image://65053e9ec1c1a938c01dd5af22b66c61" data-format="png" data-width="1476" data-height="803" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="King K.

In a big arena surrounded by golden Banandium, he whips out his iconic Blunderbuss to fire off Kannonballs just like old times.  Being surrounded by all that Banandium lets DK stay transformed the whole time to make use of all of his powers, and the elephant form proves to be particularly useful, letting DK snort up all the rot and fire it back at K. Rool. When the Kremling King tries to suck DK up in his Blunderbuss, you can launch boulders at it to make it explode on him. It’s an excellent showdown that riffs on the final boss fight in <em>Donkey Kong Country 2 </em>while using all of <em>Bananza</em>’s modern, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>-inspired tricks.</p><figure id="" data-id="86ff1253b5762f182d9cfcaa9212e08a" data-recommend-id="image://86ff1253b5762f182d9cfcaa9212e08a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="DK flies over lava.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It would be cool enough if everything stopped there, but in keeping with its tribute to <em>Donkey Kong</em>’s past, <em>Bananza</em> pulls a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9ppmP7eG2Q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9ppmP7eG2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>DKC1</em>-style credits fake-out</a></span> to lead into phase two of the fight. Except that instead of a harder redux of what just transpired, <em>Bananza</em> goes full <em>Uncharted</em> and turns the final stretch of the game into one long set piece. First DK and Pauline have to ride a massive pillar of bananas to the surface, fighting a flying K. Rool along the way. Fending him off, they finally break through the planet’s surface only to find themselves in New Donk City from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, where we first met grown-up Pauline back during the launch year of the original Switch. </p><p>New Donk City would have been a wild reveal for an after-credits stinger. Instead it’s just the prelude to one final platforming section as Banandium rot fills up the entire city and DK races to K. Rool’s fortress in the sky. It’s a bit like the final level in<em> Super Mario 3D World</em> where Bowser becomes a cat and has you chase him up the side of his tower. How many residents of New Donk City were harmed as the streets flooded with molten banana mush? Too many. But the action finally culminates in a second boss fight that’s even more spectacular than the first. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> runs decently most of the time on Switch 2, but there are moments when K. Rool coats the entire arena in Banandium rot that sent my framerate crashing into the single digits in handheld mode.</p><figure id="" data-id="d115899b9c1562400bcea903f989b1d9" data-recommend-id="image://d115899b9c1562400bcea903f989b1d9" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="DK punches a big cannon ball.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s only one snag in this roller coaster ride, and that’s the checkpointing. Instead of letting you load directly into fights, you have to do the brief platforming sections right before them again each time you die. Turn off the game and you’ll have to start the New Donk City portion all over again. With the right power-ups the fight isn’t nearly as hard as the <em>DKC2</em> one that inspires it, but if you’re out of items or didn’t upgrade your elephant transformation enough, you might be in for a rough time. I’ll also say that while the music is properly cinematic and sweeping, it’s nowhere near as iconic as the original boss fight melodies from <em>DKC1</em> and <em>DKC2</em>.</p><p>All that said, the ending of <em>Bananza</em> might still be my favorite ending to a Nintendo game since at least the start of the original Switch era. <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> also had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-perfect-mario-odyssey-moment-1820478948&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-perfect-mario-odyssey-moment-1820478948">a big surprise waiting for players</a></span> after its final fight, too. Like a lot of other pieces of that game, it feels like <em>Bananza</em>’s ending takes some of those ideas an expands them, while playing to the strengths and leaning into the fan service elements unique to <em>Donkey Kong</em>. Unlike <em>Mario</em>, who gets big new games every console generation, DK’s been on the bench for over a decade, and King K. Rool even longer. The end of <em>Bananza</em> offers fans of both a well-deserved payout. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-ending-final-boss-odyssey-1851787178]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>When Tencent revealed Light of Motiram. everyone, and we mean <em>everyone,</em> said just one thing –&nbsp; “That looks a LOT like Sony’s Horizon franchise”. From the design of the characters to the metal beasts, some of which are almost identical to those which Aloy battles, the game was clearly a copy.</p>
<p><iframe title="LIGHT OF MOTIRAM | Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bABDo5r5fg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tencent were never going to get away with it and Sony have now filed a lawsuit against them, but there’s an added detail we did not know before. It turns of Tencent had been pitching a Horizon game to Sony in 2024 but it had been rejected. It seems they just went ahead and made a copy instead.</p>
<p>Sony’s lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California last week, on July 25, 2025, and in it it states that Light of Motirm is a “slavish clone” of its games that copies multiple elements that would confuse consumers. They also reference many video games websites that noted the similarities. They have asked the court to award unspecified damages and block the release of Light of Motiram.<br>
</p>
<p>“Light of Motiram will be free to play and is coming to PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, assuming Sony’s lawyers don’t get to it first,” we noted <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/01/tencents-light-of-motiram-looks-very-very-familiar/">when the game was announced.</a> Should have put money on that.</p>

<p>NCSoft’s Horizon MMO was been cancelled before it was announced, another casualty from Sony’s ill-fated live service push. However, a Horizon movie was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/">announced at the start of the year.</a></p>
<p>By all counts, Horizon Forbidden West sold well, it just maybe didn’t meaningfully outpace the original. Having launched in February 2022, Horizon Forbidden West had sold over 8.4 million units by April 2023 (13-14 months after launch), not too far removed from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/28/horizon-zero-dawn-sells-7-6-million-copies-to-be-sonys-biggest-new-franchise/">7.6 million that Horizon Zero Dawn sold by its first anniversary</a>.</p>
<p>The series has seen plenty of activity since then with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-review/">Burning Shores</a>&nbsp;story expansion later in 2023, the PC port launching in 2024, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review/">Horizon Zero Dawn remaster</a>&nbsp;late last year as well. In an unexpected move, Sony also produced a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/lego-horizon-adventures-review/">Lego Horizon Adventures spin-off</a>&nbsp;that launched across PS5, PC and Nintendo Switch.</p>

In November, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/light-of-motiram-adds-ps5-ios-and-android-versions-reveal-trailer-and-16-minutes-of-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tencent even claimed the game</a> would be released on Sony’s PlayStation 5 console.</p><p>In the lawsuit, which was filed Friday in the Northern District of California court <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and first reported by Reuters</a>, Sony says it’s filing the lawsuit to “prevent the imminent release of <em>Light of Motiram</em>,” a game it called a “slavish clone” of Sony’s Horizon games. Sony says that nearly all parts of the game are copied from either <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> or <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>. As the lawsuit tells it, Tencent began work on <em>Light of Motiram</em> in 2023 before approaching Sony with a pitch in 2024 that Tencent should develop a Horizon game. “Sony rejected the idea and considered the matter closed,” lawyers wrote in the complaint, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/894196514/Sony-vs-Tencent-via-Aftermath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which you can read in full here</a>.</p><figure><figcaption><em><em>Via Sony Interactive Entertainment's </em>complaint</em></figcaption></figure><p>“Apparently, Tencent was undeterred by SIE’s refusal to license its Horizon intellectual property,” lawyers wrote. “Tencent continued secretly developing <em>Light of Motiram</em>, evening announcing a forthcoming game.”</p><p>The details of Horizon’s world seem everywhere in the marketing material that’s been made public so far — the character bears a strong resemblance to Aloy, from the character’s design and clothing; the world is near identical, blending lush forest environments with mechanical creatures and technology; and even the game’s title text uses similar detailing. Sony’s lawyers spend several pages of the 48-page complaint outlining the ways in which <em>Light of Motiram</em> is a copy of Horizon, including pulling headlines from news outlets and comments from forums and social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony claims it approached Tencent again this year to “informally resolve its concern that <em>Light of Motiram</em> violated its intellectual property rights,” per the complaint. That’s when Tencent <em>again</em> tried to license the Horizon IP, and Sony apparently rejected the ask a second time. That’s why Sony filed the lawsuit, it says in the complaint. To put it bluntly, Sony also says — later in the lawsuit — that <em>Light of Motiram</em> “is the result of the development project that Tencent previously pitched.”</p><p>The suit includes parts of the pitch deck Tencent approached Sony with. In that meeting, lawyers wrote that Tencent’s Aurora Studios development team said its members were “die-hard fans” of the franchise and included screenshots to prove it — the pitch deck has a slide that shows all the trophies the team has earned playing Horizon.</p><figure><figcaption><em><em>Via Sony Interactive Entertainment's </em>complaint</em></figcaption></figure><p>The pitch deck posited a version of a “games-as-a-service” expansion of the Horizon series that brings in Eastern aesthetics – the pitch deck included a slide with an image of Aloy on the Great Wall of China – and survival game elements like crafting and pets. Tencent didn’t share that they already had <em>Light of Motiram</em> in development, Sony’s lawyers say. Shortly after, in 2024, Tencent put up its Steam page for <em>Light of Motiram</em> and described it like this:</p><blockquote><p>“In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting&nbsp; from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy the machination, survive with mechanimals.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><figcaption><em><em>Via Sony Interactive Entertainment's </em>complaint</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sony says in the suit that if you swap out the words “Motiram” in the description of the game on its Steam page and put in “Old Ones,” (the lost civilization in Horizon) that the description may as well have been one for Horizon. There’s a lot of images in the complaint to back up the claims of <em>Light of Motiram</em> being a copy — again, of the technology being overtaken by overgrowth, hulking machines that resemble animals, and even the red grass that Aloy blends in with to hide, because of her red hair. (The grass in <em>Light of Motiram</em> doesn’t need to be red, Sony says, because the character in one screenshot shown in the lawsuit doesn’t have red hair. But the game's character does indeed have red hair.)</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p><em><em>Via Sony Interactive Entertainment's </em>complaint</em></p><p>Another piece that Sony pulls out as an example is the Horizon games’ “focus” device, a mysterious piece of tech that Aloy wears in her ear. It’s used to scan the environment for different points of interest, but a big piece of the story, too. The piece of tech is called Angelos in <em>Light of Motiram</em>.</p><p>Sony says in the complaint that Tencent will release a “beta version” of the game for American players “imminently,” before the full release “soon thereafter.” The lawsuit doesn’t mention the potential for a PlayStation 5 release, and the game doesn’t have a PlayStation 5 game page. Neither Sony nor Tencent have responded to Aftermath’s request for comment.</p><p>Sony is asking the court for injunctions that would prevent the release of <em>Light of Motiram</em> and for damages of up to $150,000 per infringement, among other penalties.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/anime-manga-disney-jail-netflix-fragrant-flower"><h3>The World Is Conspiring Against Me Legally Experiencing The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity</h3></a><p>The enshittification of manga and anime have reached absurd new heights, courtesy of Netflix and Kodansha’s collective bullshit.
