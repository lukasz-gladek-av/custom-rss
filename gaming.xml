		<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is kicking off Season 3 with the build up to the&nbsp;FedExCup Playoffs, but what’s this? You can now be a magician?</p>
<p><iframe title="PGA TOUR 2K25 Season 3 Trailer I 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZXz5V3IkMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Well kind of. Instead of pulling rabbits out of bunkers, making golf balls come out of people’s ears or drawing endless linked handkerchiefs out of your pocket, this is a new playing archetype. The Magician is a player type that’s able to get out of sticky situations, with the featured pro players that exemplify this being Max Homa, and the “World’s Greatest Golfer” Chris McDonald.</p>
<p>Through Season 3, players that choose this archetype will have specific quests to try to complete, and then once their MyPlayer character has reached an OVR of 85, they’ll learn the Recovery shot type.</p>
<p>Regardless of your player type, Season 3 of PGA TOUR® 2K25, is all about the FedExCup playoff championships, including the FedEx St. Jude Championship at TPC Southwind and the TOUR Championship at East Lake Golf Club. There’s themed quests and ranked tour events that will take place through the season as well, and alongside new apparel and equipment in the PGA Tour Superstore, the Wear and Earn event will boost VC earnings to help you afford it.</p>

<p>There’s also the Challenges mode, which adds new skill-based challenges with rewards, new themed maps that will be added through the season, and Clubs can now be upgraded to Diamond Tier to let you improve your kit even further. A new free and premium Clubhouse Pass is also available, including the Lob Shot, which can be unlocked for free by reaching Tier 25.</p>
<p>We had a good time with this latest iteration of HB Studios’ golf game, with Nick saying, “While not striking the same feeling of EA’s golf games of old, PGA Tour 2K25 is HB Studios’ best effort yet. There’s enough here to keep you going for a while and if the PGA Tour 2K series continues on this trajectory, might just have the best take on golf games in years to come.”</p>

<p>When we woke up this morning, all we knew was that this game about telling people where to stick their bottoms would be coming out in August - a vague window previously announced during June's Whole Direct. Now, it be here.</p>

<p>"We are thrilled to finally release our debut game," devs Ausiàs Dalmau Roig and Sergi Pérez Crespo wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3035120/view/545616987916599655?l=english">Steam post</a>. In doing so, making official the release they'd revealed with a fresh trailer in Nintyland. "Over the past two years, we have worked hard to bring you Is This Seat Taken? We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!"</p>
<p>As you might have gleaned from the name, the game's all about pleasing little shape-people -  who each have different wants and demands - by seating them in the appropriate spots, with the infinite whims and limited chairs in each scene forming the challenges you'll bang your head against. Well, relatively. It looks pretty chill.</p>

<p>If you want a taste of what it offers before dropping your hard earned cash, the demo our Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-stress-free-logic-puzzles-of-is-this-seat-taken-make-for-my-favourite-demo-in-ages">played earlier this year</a> is still free to grab on Is This Seat Taken?'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/">Steam page</a> as of writing.</p>
<p>"I'm almost positive it's a very ancient of genre of game and/or basically an elaborate GCSE Maths test question, although I'm struggling to think of any comparisons off the top of my head," the Reuben wrote of his time with said demo, "The world's first Seatlike? No, that's terrible. Either way, its nice to be surprised by something that also feels quite traditionally designed."</p>
<p>So, there you go. It's like the video game version of a nun's robe that's secretly concealing a strap-on. Or maybe that's not quite what he meant there. You can see why when I ask Is This Seat Taken?, the answer's often a look of disdain, can't you?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-this-seat-taken-i-hope-not-because-the-sitting-themed-logic-puzzler-is-out-now]]></content:encoded>

              <p><i><span>War of the Worlds</span></i><span> isn’t one of those films that unravels, revealing its dreadfulness as it begins to fall apart. Instead, it begins by falling apart, and then just gets worse and worse and worse.</span></p> <p><span>Amazon Prime’s latest movie could so easily have been a modern take on H.G. Wells’ all-time classic novel, employing found footage and gonzo documentary-style reporting to revive the spirit of Orson Welles’ notorious 1938 radio production of the story. There’s the sense that at some point, somewhere during production, this was the intent. It is, after all, cobbled together from video feeds, cell phone calls, surveillance footage, webcam views of people’s faces, and all the other sorts of very modern lenses through which we now parse reality. There’s an imagined version of this film that has the vibes of the original </span><i><span>Cloverfield </span></i><span>if its events had been</span><span>&nbsp;perceived by people with more agency, more expertise.</span></p> <p><span>But that’s not the film we get. Instead, what we have here looks like an in-house corporate video, complete with perfectly lit footage of perfectly made up people, slickly delivering Amazon commercials in between the potential end of the world, with the most atrocious script you could ever imagine.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000616279" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616279"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616279">© Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The immediately credulous plot begins as government worker Ice Cube sits in front of his monitor for a day’s…staring at </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> of the surveillance camera feeds in central DC? He leaps between cameras placed at various recognizable landmarks, listening in to three seconds of a random person’s phone call, before bouncing off to stare at a nondescript stretch of road to listen to about seven words of conversation someone’s having in some randomly chosen car, in between zooming in on a police officer stationed outside the White House to receive the improbable information that this cop has never exhibited any suspicious activity and has no known “breaches.” It’s </span><i><span>Watch_Dogs</span></i><span> levels of improbable nonsense, but performed by a bored man sipping coffee, flitting across an entire city as if this scattershot invasion of privacy could or would achieve anything, ever.</span></p>

 <p><span>This one man doing the watching—his name is William Radford—appears to be responsible for monitoring activity at the Pentagon, the White House, an airport, all roads, pregnant ladies who walk through parks, and the NSA. Incredible. However, midway through his morning blitz, Eva Longoria calls him from NASA. I know she’s at NASA because of the model space rockets on the table beside her, and the (I swear) giant NASA logo on the side of the stairs outside her window. She’s calling to ask Radford if he’s seen the crazy weather that’s going on. “Any noise about it on your end?” she asks, while showing him crisp 4K videos of a ludicrously busy electric storm, then jumping to a mega-tornado of the sort that would make </span><i><span>Twisters </span></i><span>jealous. “Nope,” says Mr. Cube. “I watch people, not weather.” Duh, Eva Longoria. Who—and again I’m not making this up—is credited on the movie as “NASA Scientist Sandra Salas.”</span></p> <p><span>“I’ve never seen global storms like this,” NASA Scientist Sandra Salas says to William Radford, not pausing to explain what a “global storm” could possibly be. “We can’t figure out what’s causing this atmospheric phenomena.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That was enough to bring Radford around. “All right, that’s crazy right there,” he says, having watched a montage of exquisitely well-shot and streamed thunderstorm videos, which are apparently affecting everywhere in the world </span><i><span>except for</span></i><span> Washington DC. (It wasn’t even raining on his surveillance feeds.) And then come some lines that made me certain I was going to be in for a riveting ride.</span></p>

 <p><span>“All of NASA’s satellites are blind,” says NASA Scientist Sandra Salas. </span><span>“We haven’t been able to see anything for two days.”</span></p> <p><span>I have only awe. Someone convinced Amazon to give them enough money to make a movie, albeit a desperately cheap-looking one, cast proper actors like Clark Gregg, Andrea Savage, and Iman Benson, and yet was cool with NASA just beginning to worry something might be wrong after </span><i><span>two days</span></i><span> of </span><i><span>none of their satellites working</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Oh, but bad news, Radford’s lost interest. “Yeah,” he sneers. “Well, I got bigger fish to fry than watching clouds.” DHS Dir. Briggs has just messaged him on Microsoft Teams, “FBI team on standby for Disruptor raid.” Some hacker is about to maybe do something, see.</span></p>

 <p><span>We are three minutes and twenty-one seconds into this film.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000616280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616280"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616280">© Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While simultaneously spying on both his adult son and pregnant daughter, to the level of monitoring what food his daughter orders in cafes (his surveillance tools can do this automatically, including listing the protein content of the ordered food), Radford gets on with his proper job: trying to bring down baddies. We find out that the evil terrorist action he needs to thwart is this mysterious hacker, Disruptor, who’s planning to reveal a secret government surveillance program called Goliath. The one Ice Cube is using? Incredibly, no, it’s a different one. A worse one, one capable of doing </span><i><span>more</span></i><span> spying than being able to listen in to any call, take over any phone, track all card purchases, and profile any human from their face. Disruptor has posted a YouTube video saying he will soon release the proof, so Radford begins tracking his possible locations by—hold on tight—right-clicking and looking at the page source for his YouTube video, copying out a random string of letters and numbers, and then pasting those into an IP search. Like I said, awe. And then meteors start raining out of the sky.</span></p> <p>People, the aliens are coming. The meteors–they’re used to take out our satellites and create those dreadful storms, all so the beastly beings can sneak up on us for their invasion. As in the original story, the creatures crash to earth in spherical rocks that break open to reveal the tripod aliens within. Unlike in the original story, this doesn’t take days of tension-building mystery to occur, but instead (genuinely) about two minutes. Crash, crack, skyscraper-sized aliens.</p>

 <p><span>We perceive all of this through Radford’s computer, and it really should be fun that Ice Cube uses a huge array of familiar programs and applications, from a large range of companies. It’s a Windows operating system, but he uses both Teams and Zoom, messages and calls his kids with WhatsApp and FaceTime, loads live news feeds from CNN, Fox News, and the BBC via Chrome…That sort of real-world inclusion usually gives disaster movies a grounding in our own reality, showing us outrageous fiction through the framing by which we understand our own world. But here, it’s so crass, so obviously phony, that it all looks like commercials. It probably is.</span></p> <p><span>And god damn, the plot holes. We learn from news reports that </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> satellites were out for two days before the attack, but we see Radford use a live CIA satellite feed of Earth, seen from space. Radford, a man whose job appears to be spying on individuals, is somehow suddenly the person advising the actual president on the military response to the attack. A hacked Tesla he remotely controls to save his injured daughter needs to go on a one-mile journey, but only has battery for, um, two miles, so there’s a panicked sequence to set it to a super-low-battery mode. And, desperate to help his daughter, Ice Cube shrieks that he’s coming to save her, runs to the door of his office, gives it a gentle pull and declares, “Dammit! Locked in!” And just goes sit down again. It was a glass door. I mean, I’m not claiming to be father of the year, but I’d maybe give it a slightly more energetic wobble.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s a constant treat to see how time functions in this movie. Radford advises the president on his military response, after which the world’s governments unite to fight back, then we see footage of this new strategy, troop deployment, and their new tactics taking down tripods all around the world—and then we cut back to the Tesla. Yup, all that happened during the car’s one mile drive. .</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000616281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616281"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616281">© Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The script is so adorably abysmal. There’s no room for nuance, nothing left for subtext. When Radford can’t get out of the office, his daughter literally says out loud, “The irony. You wouldn’t leave your office when you could, and now you can’t leave…” At another point his son says, “You know, for someone who spends their life watching, you sure do miss a lot.” A revoltingly mawkish plot about Radford’s dead wife is told via the medium of writing it on a baseball bat and repeatedly smashing it into your face, but in case you couldn’t understand that a man might be sad about losing his kids’ mother, people make sure to say it out loud too.</span></p> <p><span>But that’s all as nothing compared to the movie’s twist on </span><i><span>War of the Worlds’</span></i><span> themes. Look, I need to pause to be positive for a moment, because as awful as this film looks in almost every scene, the alien tripods are </span><i><span>amazing</span></i><span>. The CG is great, they have that ideal mix of robotic and organic, and they look truly menacing as they stomp through the streets in the various news clips. Like in the book they kill indiscriminately, adding to their malevolence, and somewhere out there there’s an SFX team who got </span><i><span>screwed </span></i><span>by having their fine work put into this garbled drivel. But to ensure it’s more woefully wasted, the big original concept here is that the aliens aren’t after our water, but instead our </span><i><span>new</span></i><span> most precious resource (I know it’s our most precious resource because at least two different voices describe it as our most precious resource), data. Yes, they eat data. Because…because they </span><i><span>do</span></i><span>!</span></p>

 <p><span>This is demonstrated by Ice Cube looking at his dead wife’s Facebook page, only to see a message declaring that his “memories” are being deleted, and then watching as the jpegs disappear from the screen one by one. The last voice note she left him, the banal message about the garbage, corrupts and vanishes. You know, because of the way websites are live feeds of images being endlessly beamed from a server, such that when the server is drained, the pictures go away. That’s how it works! The alien invaders are desperate for our Facebook jpegs, all their killing just a distraction from their true goal of draining data centers, because of all that yummy binary code. And so Goliath?! That </span><i><span>extra</span></i><span> bad surveillance tool? That’s gotta be the tastiest data ever!</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000616282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616282">© Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It’s tempting to really lay into Ice Cube’s acting, because it is quite spectacularly terrible. His faux-horrified reactions play out like a Lonely Island sketch, that under-performed awkwardness making everything sound completely insincere. At one point he says, “DNA? Oh my God,” and it could absolutely be </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt2OVAgkHBc"><span>Just 2 Guyz</span></a><span>. Except, you know, he’s trying his best. But at the same time, </span><i><span>everyone’s</span></i><span> terrible in this. Andrea Savage, who was utterly perfect in the incredible </span><i><span>I’m Sorry</span></i><span>, flounders like she’s never seen a camera before. Iman Benson, whose performance in </span><i><span>Midnight Club</span></i><span> was breathtaking, just seems bored. And Clark Gregg, who is Hollywood’s most reliable government man in a suit, sounds like he’s reading out loud for the first time.</span></p> <p><span>A lot of this might be because everyone is mostly alone when filming, speaking into the camera, obviously not having any real dialogue with the other actors. The result is stitched together, and badly. No one comes off looking good, not even stalwarts like Michael O’Neill.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000616284" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616284"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616284">© Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>And yes, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-ad-drone-scene-horrible-bad-review-2000614752"><span>there’s that Amazon drone commercial</span></a><span>. Radford’s daughter’s boyfriend is an Amazon delivery driver, see, and we frequently see him in his van, with his Amazon shirt. Right at the crucial moment, when all is lost unless Radford can get a thumb drive, he whips out an Amazon Air drone from his bag and declares, “It’s the future of delivery.” Then, beyond all credibility, adds, “I need you to place an official order on Amazon to activate the drone.” Apparently, despite all the rest of the internet having been eaten by aliens, Amazon’s website is still fine, jpegs and all. It does seem something of a self-own to suggest that Amazon is so gross that not even data-hungry alien invaders would want to touch it.</span></p>

 <p><span>Nothing in the entire film makes a lick of sense. It’s sewn together from plot holes, something established in one scene is entirely forgotten in the next, and it has the most outstanding fairy tale ending imaginable. Look, spoilers, but during this film nearly all of human data is deleted (apart from Amazon), the global stock market and all of banking is erased, millions upon millions are killed, all power is wiped out around the world (apart from when it isn’t), and entire cities are leveled, but after our friends successfully upload a virus (because it didn’t have a better idea than copying </span><i><span>Independence Day</span></i><span>), that’s all better! Seriously, everyone’s happy and sharing photos online again and life’s immediately back to normal! </span><i><span>Incredible</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>This is truly one of the most terrible films I’ve ever seen. Even awful low-budget amateur horror flicks try to have some sort of central conceit that’s consistent from scene to scene. But this is gibberish from start to finish, despite a solid team of B-list actors and Amazon money behind it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I swear, I’ve typed out and deleted so many other glaring plot issues, because I needed to get them out of my system more than I needed for you to read them. It seems fully credible that this disaster of a movie might genuinely only exist to contain the Amazon adverts within, despite also heavily featuring products by Microsoft, Google and others, and everything else that happens in the other 80 minutes of a mercifully short film is an aside.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000616283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616283">© Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>What upsets me here isn’t that someone made a shitty movie—that happens all the time! What is so bothersome is that the ingredients and the money were there for something far better. A film that portrays a terrifying alien invasion through the lenses and applications with which we currently interpret our world could offer an uncanny and chilling vision. Found footage, live-streamed video, news broadcasts, all of it, that’s a great medium for this story. But perhaps to deliver that, someone involved would have had to actually want to say </span><i><span>something</span></i><span>. Instead, this is incoherent hypocrisy, a film about how wildly invasive surveillance is good but also bad, and how we should think twice about how we share our data, but also we should order from Amazon and be grateful that our data can save us from aliens.</span></p> <p><span>This isn’t “so bad it’s good,” but it is “so bad it’s </span><i><span>fascinating</span></i><span>.” It’s hard to wrap my head around how anything can be this dreadful. I cannot wait until enough time has passed that the inside stories come out, and we can learn how something so awful came to be. In the meantime, maybe read the book. It’s available on Amazon!</span></p>

<section><p>Collective Shout's campaign--and censorship in general--will only make video games worse.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>We live in an era of unmitigated excess and constant suppression. The wide proliferation of machine learning image generation means that anyone can make <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/718975/xai-grok-imagine-taylor-swifty-deepfake-nudes" rel="nofollow ">creepy porn of their celebrity of choice</a>. Expressions like "gooning" are widespread slang. Games like Marvel Rivals and Street Fighter 6 sell themselves on their pin-up characters. Meanwhile, books for children and teens like Genderqueer and All Boys Aren't Blue are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-life-and-style/author-gender-queer-one-banned-books-us-addresses-controversy-rcna8991" rel="nofollow ">banned for being "pornographic</a>." In July, the UK introduced an <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/uk-online-safety-act-age-verification-social-adult-sites-how-it-works" rel="nofollow ">age-verification requirement for internet access</a>, ostensibly protecting kids, but mostly violating the privacy of adults. All these things, though disparate, represent a siloing of acceptable eroticism and thereby a siloing of life and art.</p><p dir="ltr">Independent video games are the latest front of this suppression. In July 2025, anti-porn non-profit Collective Shout pushed multiple payment processors to stop facilitating payments for some "adult titles" from Steam and Itch.io. In an attempt to halt the immediate loss of business,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/"> Steam removed Itch de-indexed thousands of not-safe-for-work games from the storefront</a>. To be clear, this means removed from search results--the games in-question are still available if you can find them. On August 1, Itch <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content" rel="nofollow ">re-indexed free NSFW games</a>, sidestepping the participation of payment processors altogether. The quick changes have led to no shortage of confusion.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mastercard-responds-to-censorship-allegations-after-forcing-storefronts-to-remove-adult-games/1100-6533641/">Mastercard has since denied its direct involvement</a> in <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch</a>'s mass de-listing, stating, "Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations." The statement did claim that Mastercard “require[s] merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.” Mastercard did not clarify whether any of the games removed from Steam were illegal. Additionally, Valve contradicted its account,<a href="https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393" rel="nofollow "> stating that Mastercard communicated through payment processors and acquiring banks</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever exactly happened, and however big a role Collective Shout played in it, the consequences are clear: Indie developers are considering moving their work off of itch or supplementing it with their own storefronts; the International Game Developers Association (IGDA)<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/international-game-developers-association-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-delisting-of-games/1100-6533536/"> is now pleading with payment processors</a> for "transparency;"<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gog-launches-nsfw-game-giveaway-to-raise-awareness-on-censorship-in-gaming/1100-6533652/"> GOG launched a NSFW giveaway</a> to "[take] a stand against the quiet erasure of creative works from digital shelves;"<a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal" rel="nofollow "> Developers and artists have started a mass calling campaign</a> to pressure payment processors into changing their position. The mass delisting and removals on both Steam and itch have spurred both fear and action.</p><p dir="ltr">Mass de-indexing has caused such a fervor because it is tied to broader cultural conflicts. There is no question that this silencing resembles the book bans in libraries and public schools across the US. The Trump administration uses feminist language to boost anti-trans policies in the name of protecting children and women, even as it suppresses information about the president's well-documented ties to sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. An abstract concern for "the children" or "women" drives a suppression of even the most inoffensive and benign explorations of gender, sex, and identity, all while the most extreme offenders go free.</p><p dir="ltr">The members of Collective Shout might argue that this is not their intention. Their campaign's <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history" rel="nofollow ">explicit target</a> is "rape and incest games," extreme examples of taboo sexual material, and a category that most of the games de-indexed from Itch do not fall into. On one hand, games like No Mercy, a game in which players specifically commit rape and incest and the initial subject of Collective Shout's campaign, are misogynistic. But it is also a niche product, and one that most people have only ever heard of because of Collective Shout's campaign against it. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/win-itch-pulls-abuse-games" rel="nofollow ">Collective Shout’s statement on Itch’s mass deindexing</a> states that, “thousands of games glorifying rape, torture, and sexual violence against women and girls were delisted from gaming platform itch.” The statement equates every deindexed game to No Mercy, regardless of whether they resemble it or not.</p><p dir="ltr">It is easier than ever to find upsetting material and to extrapolate that upset to a fundamental societal ill. When the personal is political, everything is public. In her essay,<a href="https://internetprincess.substack.com/p/west-elm-caleb-and-the-feminist-panopticon" rel="nofollow "> "west elm caleb and the feminist panopticon,"</a> Rayne Fisher-Quann discusses the urge to hold ordinary individuals uniquely responsible for societal woes. She writes, "the crucifixion of these individuals is ultimately a system of smoke and mirrors that obfuscates true systemic change while providing us with enough satisfaction to stop aiming higher." Though the work of Collective Shout takes place in a different context, it is driven by a similar impulse. Most generously, Collective Shout chases the cultural and consumptive symptoms of patriarchal violence while doing little to stop its material harms or to aid victims. Founder Melinda Tankard-Reist's own<a href="https://mimidoshima.neocities.org/main/posts/2025/collectiveshout/" rel="nofollow "> ties to religious, right-wing politics</a> bear this out. When you cannot address causes, you are left fighting battles that don't matter.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Collective Shout targets titans of softcore porn like Playboy and obscure pornography in equal measure, its campaign has more directly harmed the obscure. This is a dynamic that has played out over and over again. The work of Robert Yang--full of a playful, artistic eroticism--is still banned on Twitch. Meanwhile, big-budget games like Cyberpunk 2077--which include sex just as explicit--can be broadcast with a change or two in the settings to remove nudity and copyrighted music. The difference in scale between Steam and Itch illustrates this. Valve took down specific games that represent a fraction of the overall business on the storefront. Itch de-indexed every NSFW game on the site. The force this kind of puritanism has on smaller games is far greater than it will have on multi-million companies. And it has far more effect than just “rape and incest games” or even just pornographic games. Vile: Exhumed, a narrative game about sexual assault, <a href="https://dreadxp.com/vile-is-banned/" rel="nofollow ">was among the games which Valve removed from Steam</a>. Even if you accept Collective Shout's logic as a given, a game like Grand Theft Auto 6 shapes culture in a far more direct way than even the most vile niche game ever could. Yet, for the moment anyway, it remains untouched.</p><p dir="ltr">But the deeper problem is that anti-porn crusades are terrible at actually protecting and helping victims of abuse. Campaigns like Collective Shout treat rape and sexual abuse as deviant and abnormal, the product of twisted media distorting ordinary minds. But sexual violence is not horrifying because porn-addled monsters do it. It is horrifying because there is no category of person immune from involvement. Because these are broad, societal-level issues, it is outside of the scope of an article like this to articulate causes. But I can tell you this: I have lived in a culture where “thought leaders” policed porn consumption and sexual behavior. It did not protect women, but instead made men better able to hide, less accountable to the women they hurt, and more capable of blaming victims. If prudishness was an effective way of combating abuse, churches would be bastions of safety for women and children. They are not.</p><p dir="ltr">If art and video games can have any real role in combating structural misogyny, they must get stranger and more frank. The consequences of Collective Shout's campaign is already that games will struggle to address the things that really matter, that thoughtful examinations of complex and taboo issues will be equivocated with purulent misogyny, and that marginalized demographics will struggle to find platforms while powerful men can say whatever they want. This censorship has already made the world of games worse.</p>

But according to dataminers, that grind is going to be a little bit slower this season, with Epic reportedly making it so players now learn less passive XP, which is XP that you periodically receive just by playing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1953447404377657430" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">NEW XP VALUES (They nerfed all lol)<br>Creative: 3350 XP -&gt; 2300 XP <br>Lego Odyssey: 3475 XP -&gt; 2250 XP <br>Reload: 2350 XP -&gt; 1200 XP <br>OG: 650 XP -&gt; REMOVED <br>Ballistic: 2950 XP -&gt; 1750 XP <br>Lego Brick Life: 3475 XP -&gt; 2250 XP <br>BR: Still REMOVED <br>Jam Stage: 3850 XP -&gt; 2300 XP <br>Lego… <a href="https://t.co/6cPDm5bCXb" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6cPDm5bCXb</a></p>  — SpushFNBR (@SpushFNBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpushFNBR/status/1953447404377657430?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The amounts listed in the tweet are XP per minute for each mode, with most modes losing 30-50% of the passive XP rates they offered in Season 3, while OG has had its passive XP removed entirely. Standard Battle Royale had its passive XP removed last week, with someone apparently jumping the gun on that one.</p><p>This change may not look or feel great at first, but there are a couple reasons why this change isn't as impactful as you might initially think. First is that other sources of XP, like completing quests and defeating enemies, are still intact, so there's still plenty of XP to be had.</p><p>Second is that Season 4 is going to run until November 1, making it a month longer than last season was. Since the number of levels you need to gain to complete the pass, and the amount of XP required per level, have both remained the same in the new season, it's not particularly surprising that Epic would try to slow down player progress a bit. For folks who play regularly, it's doubtful the change will have much of an impact.</p><p>There's a lot of new stuff happening with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-shock-n-awesome/2900-6853/" data-ref-id="2900-6853">the launch of Chapter 6 Season 4</a>, including a full refresh of the main Battle Royale mode and a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-palm-paradise-lego-pass-all-builds-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-6864/" data-ref-id="2900-6864">Lego pass</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-og-pass-season-5-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6862/" data-ref-id="2900-6862">OG Pass</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6856/" data-ref-id="2900-6856">battle pass</a> full of cosmetics to unlock.</p>

<p>Exploring <i>Monster Hunter Wilds</i> can feel pretty on-rails at first. It’s hard not to spend your time traveling directly from objective to objective when you have the convenient option of letting your Seikret automatically run towards the monster you’re hunting or any known resources. Although it’s easy to assume that various maps of the game are barren, each one has a fair selection of hidden areas.</p> <p>Some of these secret areas are easily missed pop-up camps for you to fast travel to or <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094">rest in</a>, while others are caves that are only accessible if you crawl or swim. Either way, these locations are surrounded by good loot to farm and incredible views to enjoy.</p> <h2><span id="windward-plains%e2%80%99-area-three-platform"></span>Windward Plains’ Area Three Platform<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616330"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616330">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You’re told early on that some places will only be accessible with your Seikret. You can find a great example of this early on in the Windward Plains. Located right above the Area Three South Pop-up Camp is a spot with Mining Outcrops, Fulgurite Shards, and the very rare Nightflower Pollen-granting Ephemeral Blossom. The quickest way here is to fast travel to the campsite and then ride your Seikret next to its food trough behind the tent. Jump off the mount and your hunter will climb up the ledge.</p>

 <h2><span id="windward-plain%e2%80%99s-best-mining-outcrop-farm"></span>Windward Plain’s Best Mining Outcrop Farm<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616331"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616331">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This next spot requires you to leave your Seikret behind. Located near the entrance to Rey Dau’s nest in Area 17 is a Mining Outcrop. Directly next to it is a small opening that your hunter can crawl under. On the other side are three ascending platforms accessible by climbing long sets of vines or using multiple Wedge Beetles. All together, you’ll be able to gather from four to eight additional Mining Outcrops.</p> <h2><span id="scarlet-forest%e2%80%99s-area-six-camp"></span>Scarlet Forest’s Area Six Camp<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616332" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616332"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616332">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>One of the best missable spots in the Scarlet Forest is the Area Six Flowering Rocks Pop-up Camp. Situated between Areas Two and Three, it’s only accessible by going through some tree roots on the south side of Area Six. Aside from being a safe camp in a convenient part of the map, there is also a nice fishing area with Glass Algae to gather and potentially two Ancient Wyvern Coins to find.</p> <h2><span id="scarlet-forest%e2%80%99s-underwater-area"></span>Scarlet Forest’s Underwater Area<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616335" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616335"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616335">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Every video game should have hidden caves behind waterfalls. Finding the <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-giant-downy-crake-location-item-1851784123">Grand Hub’s Gigacrake</a> is a fun secret in itself, but the Scarlet Forest takes it even further with two waterfall caves. What is arguably the coolest lies just north of the Area 12 Northeast camp. If you’ve already encountered Lagiacrus after Title Update Two, you want to go towards the monster’s nest in the unlocked Area 19.</p>

 <p>This spot doesn’t seem like much besides an aesthetically pleasing fishing spot at first glance. The trick is approaching the end of the mound and pressing Circle/B to dive into the water. Your hunter’s swimming path is on rails, but you can use your Slinger to gather numerous Weathered Treasures and Glass Algae. Even more Weathered Treasures await you in the small stone structure at the end.</p> <h2><span id="oilwell-basin%e2%80%99s-crimson-rivulet-camp"></span>Oilwell Basin’s Crimson Rivulet Camp<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616336" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616336"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616336">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I rode past this location many times before I discovered its existence in the Oilwell Basin. When traveling to Area 16 from Area 12, there is a small path on the right side with a steep drop. At the bottom of this trail is the Area 12: Crimson Rivulet Pop-up Camp. On top of being situated in a convenient location, it’s also near a relaxing pool of water where you can fish.</p>

 <h2><span id="iceshard-cliffs%e2%80%99-watchtower"></span>Iceshard Cliffs’ Watchtower<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616337" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616337"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616337">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Your Seikret is a must for this one. Connecting Areas Seven and Eight is a slope between two ledges. Climbing in from the former’s direction, ride your Seikret left to find a small gap next to an Adamant Seed pick-up. Jumping across and climbing up the vines leads to the Area Seven Watchtower Pop-up Camp.</p> <p>There are a couple of Mining Outcrops and occasionally a crab holding an Ancient Wyvern Coin, but the real joy is the view to the left. You can see all across the Forbidden Lands from up here.</p>

 <h2><span id="iceshard-cliff%e2%80%99s-sinkhole"></span>Iceshard Cliff’s Sinkhole<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616338"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616338">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Within the hallway between Areas Eight and 16 is a small hole in the wall. Inside is a massive sinkhole leading down to the Area 18 Sinkhole camp. Not only is this a safe camp in a great spot, but there is a nice variety of gatherables here and in the tiny cave right behind the camp.</p> <h2><span id="ruins-of-wyveria%e2%80%99s-secluded-ruins"></span>Ruins of Wyveria’s Secluded Ruins<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616339"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616339">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The Ruins of Wyveria can feel like the tiniest map due to its vertical orientation, which makes Area Six feel ostensibly large in comparison. There are three campsites in this area, however, the most interesting is on the north side near two Vespoids. Along the wall will be a thin stretch of vines leading up to a pipe. On the other side is the Secluded Ruins Pop-up Camp and a lovely view of the Lost Path of Wyveria that connects to the Iceshard Cliffs.</p> <h2><span id="ruins-of-wyveria%e2%80%99s-gap-in-rubble"></span>Ruins of Wyveria’s Gap in Rubble<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616340" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616340"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616340">© Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It wouldn’t feel right if there wasn’t another random hole in the wall. You can find just that on the West side of Area Eight, literally next to the number “8” when viewing the map. This hole leads to the appropriately named Gap in Rubble Campsite where you can find some Blackened Fossils and a handy fishing spot.</p>

Fifteen years after Avyanna freed Nevendaar from the tyrannical grip of the gods, <em>Disciples: Domination</em> returns you to a realm hanging in the balance. In this dark fantasy strategy RPG with turn-based combat, take your place on Queen Avyanna’s throne—and attempt to hold together a crumbling kingdom.</p><p>The fire of doubt burns scorching within her, sparked by the crushing weight of the throne in Yllian and stoked by twisted dreams of becoming one of the very monsters she once defied—and destroyed. Paralyzed by fear and haunted by her own power, Avyanna’s rule begins to crack. Allies disappear and abandon her. An unknown force spreads strife and madness through her realm.</p><p>The choice is yours—shape the future, for salvation or ruin. As you chase the truths behind the ceaseless conflicts, dark magic and lurking conspiracies infecting your rotting empire, you’ll face betrayal, strife, and shadowy schemes.

There is no word yet on a PlayStation release for Winter Burrow.</p><p>Described as a "cozy woodland survival game," Winter Burrow tells the story of a city mouse returning home to restore the burrow in which they grew up that's now in ruins.

                <p>In an era where cross-platform releases between Microsoft and Sony are more common, Helldivers 2 is one of the rare PlayStation-published properties heading to Xbox Series X|S.

Replying to a thankful message from a fan, Jorjani replied: "It was all PlayStation. Send them your thanks! We were all in support of course."</p>

      </div>
<p>Xbox players (and even PlayStation fans) heavily<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-published-game-helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-in-august/1100-6532942/" data-ref-id="1100-6532942"> advocated for a version of Helldivers 2</a> on Xbox since the game's launch, but the prospect appeared unlikely at the time. While Microsoft-owned games such as Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 5 were making it to PlayStation 5, the inverse wasn't happening. Finally bringing Helldivers 2 on Xbox should increase the game's player count and grow its existing community, a prospect that excites the game's fanbase.</p><p>The decision also makes sense when considering that Helldivers 2 is one of Sony's few successful online multiplayer titles, with Concord being a very public failure. Expanding the Helldivers player base can only strengthen the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-admits-its-live-service-games-have-been-rocky-acknowledges-negative-news-about-marathon/1100-6533758/" data-ref-id="1100-6533758">company's shaky live-service efforts</a>. Putting popular PlayStation-published single-player games like The Last of Us and Marvel's Spider-Man, however, still might be a far-fetched scenario.</p><p>Xbox players can join the fight for Super Earth when Helldivers 2 lands on Xbox Series X|S on August 26.The Xbox-published <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/" data-ref-id="1100-6531314">Gears of War: Reloaded releases on PlayStation 5</a>, along with Xbox and PC, on the same day.</p>

		<p>Fortnite is becoming a bug-riddled mess these days… but not in a bad way. No, Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock ‘N Awesome has littered the Battle Royale Island with bugs as part of The Hive, and is tasking you with joining the O.X.R. (Onimorph eXtermination Rangers) to blast them all away.</p>
<p>And who better to blow up some bugs than UNSC Spartans from the Halo franchise, and the Power Rangers?</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock 'N Awesome | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yGqbypEMcVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>New for the Battle Royale Island are some locations themed after this battle, with the OXR HQ there to dish out orders and sell you weapons, while the Ranger’s Ruin is a former OXR weapons lab that has now been overrun. You’ll face off against Swarmers, Bombers, and burrowing Queens, grabbing new weapons like the Leadspitter 3000 minigun, Sweeper Shotgun, O.X.R. Rifle, Wrecker Revolver and a&nbsp;Bug Cannon, and getting to the Hammerhead Choppa to rain fire down from above.</p>
<p>It’s all tied together by the new Battle Pass. Purchasing the pass auto-unlocks the UNSC Spartain, while progression will get you the Green Ranger and, from 16th September, you’ll be able to complete quests to unlock a&nbsp;Dino Megazord Outfit.</p>

<p>Also in the Battle Pass are <span>Yoo-mi, </span><span>Agent Patch, </span>Battle Gamer Mae, Lt. Ripp Slade, and the totally not just a panda version of Nick Fury, Onyx Winter</p>
<p>The rest of the Power Rangers will be kept for a Mighty Morphin Bundle that will hit the Shop in August and includes Red Ranger, Black Ranger, Pink Ranger, Yellow Ranger and Blue Ranger Outfits.</p>

		<p>Jackbox Games has revealed the fifth and final game that will be included with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-jackbox-party-pack-11">Jackbox Party Pack 11</a> later this year, with Cookie Haus a drawing game that will be sure to be a hit with sweet-toothed artists out there.</p>
<p>Cookie Haus is a cozy drawing game where you decorate cookies to match the prompts, adding layers of icing and sprinkles to match prompts like “a cookie who’s <em>seen</em> some things.” Once cookies have been created, you can then name them and the group you’re playing with with then vote on their favourites &nbsp;for each prompt.</p>
<p><iframe title="The final game in Party Pack 11 is..." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kb0p6mUjApM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“The core thing that sets Cookie Haus apart from our other drawing games is that the drawing interface is built from the ground up to feel very physical,” said Director Chase McClure. “There is something about placing icing and sprinkles on a cookie that makes it more familiar to someone who doesn’t consider themselves an ‘artist.’ But, it also gives this whole new challenge to the Drawful veterans of the group.”</p>

<p>Also included in Jackbox Party Pack 11 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suspectives</strong> – There’s been a crime, one player secretly did it, and the evidence comes from your own survey answers! Study the clues, defend your innocence (even if you’re lying), and put your friends on trial.</li>
<li><strong>Doominate</strong> – Take all that is perfectly lovely and destroy it in a head-to-head joke game where the funniest answer is exalted.</li>
<li><strong>Legends of Trivia</strong> – Are you looking for a fantasy trivia game with RPG-inspired elements? Oh boy, do I have some good news for you!</li>
<li><strong>Hear Say</strong> – In Hear Say, you’ll be putting your pipes to work to create hilarious soundscapes. Use your phone as a controller, just like all Jackbox party pack games. But in this one, you get to use the microphone on your phone to get real sound effects that work in the game!</li>

<p>Picture Purrfect</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last year's delightful cat sim, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_kitty_big_city">Little Kitty, Big City</a>, made a surprise appearance in today's Indie World showcase to reveal the upcoming 'Picture Purrfect' update, set to land on Switch on <strong>27th August</strong>.</p>
<p>The headline addition in this one is a photo mode, hence the name, but the newbie that we're most excited to see — like, punching the air excited — is a all-new cat customisation menu, where you can tweak your cat's looks however you please.</p>
<p>Will we making our own cats and immediately filling our screenshot albums with hundreds of pictures of them? You bet we will be! It looks like there are options for markings, eye and fur colour, coat softness and more, so expect to find us closely examining our cats as if we were a fine artist preparing to paint their model.</p>

<p>The Picture Purrfect update also includes new spots in the neighbourhood to visit, a collection of new characters and, of course, even more hats for you to stick on your kitty.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks adorable, and it's completely free! For more information on the base game, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/little-kitty-big-city">our full review</a> below.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-nuclear-disarmament-unlocked-legitimately/">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a> multiplayer features have been expanded this week by a new mod, which introduces a co-op mode that promises to make the experience more fun than ever before, even with its issues.</p>



<p>The mod, which can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/unknown321/dynamite">developer's unknown 321 GitHub page</a>, has been in the works for some time, and its development was far from simple, as the developer behind the project had to address many issues, as detailed in a <a href="https://github.com/unknown321/dynamite/blob/master/docs/MAKING_OF.md">making-of document.</a> Ultimately, some couldn't be addressed, but the developer decided to release the mod in a semi-working state with some of the planned features missing as well as they believed this could be a solid foundation for a new generation of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain mods that could possibly make the modded co-op mode as fun as the official mode in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is. Before downloading the mod, you can check it out in action in the video below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@caplag">caplag.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is currently the final entry in the series, and the last one to be directed by Hideo Kojima, the series seems to be far from done. In October 2023, Konami released the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-4k-resolution-support/">Master Collection Vol. 1</a>, including the first three 3D entries in the series as well as the classic first 2D entries in the series, which could be followed by a <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-metal-gear-solid-4/">second collection</a> that may also end the PlayStation 3 exclusivity of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. In addition, the third entry in the series, which is considered one of the best entries in the series to date, is returning to modern PC and consoles later <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/">this month</a> with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a remake built in Unreal Engine 5 by Virtuos that aims to <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/">improve the game</a> without altering what makes it such a beloved stealth title.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-and-xbox-ally-x-will-reportedly-launch-on-october-16-2025.1264671/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X</a>, the new handheld PCs built from a collaboration between ASUS and Microsoft will reportedly launch this coming October 16, 2025. </p>



<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">Billbil-kun over at Dealabs</a>, the reliable leaker who has previously correctly leaked release date times and retail prices for multiple devices, who also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-prices-leaked/">recently reported the prices</a> for the handhelds, with the cheaper ROG Xbox Ally listed at €599, and the more expensive ROG Xbox Ally X at €899. </p>



<p>Billbil-kun also recently reported that<a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-pre-orders-go-live-gamescom-2025/"> pre-orders for the handhelds</a> would start at Gamescom 2025, which lines up with the official confirmation from Microsoft that it would be giving players their first chance at going <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">hands-on with the handhelds during Gamescom 2025</a>. </p>



<p>And as Billbil-kun mentions in their report, this October release date lines up with previous rumors from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WPdijzg6Ug">eXtas1s</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-launching-october-price/">others</a> who have already identified October as a release window for the device. Dealabs is now the first to put a specific date to the leak. </p>



<p>So, as it stands, the official word from Microsoft is that we'll get the chance to try out the handheld at Gamescom 2025. Billbil-kun, who has now built up a strong reputation for reporting accurate retail information on videogame products ahead of their official reveal, has pegged pre-orders to kick off at Gamescom, along with the price reveal, and a release date, the final piece of the puzzle. </p>



<p>Save for the ROG Xbox Ally being at Gamescom, while everything else technically remains in rumor territory, Billbil-kun and their sources have so rarely missed the mark, that it's worth betting we'll see a full official reveal of the price and release date for these handhelds during Gamescom ONL on Tuesday, August 19, ahead of the Gamescom festivities that'll occur throughout the rest of the week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework has built a name for itself by taking the locked down world of laptops and making them modular, upgradable, and repairable. So it’s surprising — and maybe even controversial — the way that Framework has approached its first desktop: it’s made a PC that’s actually <em>less </em>modular than most.</p><p>Don’t worry; this isn’t a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289730/apple-mac-mini-m4-review">Mac Mini</a> situation, where mere mortals are not meant to touch the innards of such a brilliant little computer. But it’s not a traditional small form factor PC, either.</p><p>The Framework Desktop is impressively small for what it offers. It’s around the size of a couple hardcover novels standing on your desk. Its black-and-silver case is just large enough to fit a mini-ITX motherboard, a cooler, and a power supply — plus two modular front ports and a customizable array of 21 plastic tiles on the front panel, just for fun. And its AMD Strix Halo APU is surprisingly powerful. Even the base configuration is capable of respectable gaming frame rates at 2.5K resolution, and the highest-end spec, with a more powerful processor and 128GB of shared memory, is enough to run beefy local large language models like Llama 3.3 70B.</p><p>Yes, you can buy or build a bigger, more powerful small-form-factor desktop, and it’ll actually be more upgradeable than the Framework. And if you just want a tiny desktop for the basics, there are plenty of brands offering cheaper prebuilts. But none of them are quite like the Framework Desktop. It’s a simple, compact computer that’s good enough for serious gaming or content creation and doesn’t come with a shred of bloatware. It’s incredibly easy to assemble (you don’t even have to apply thermal paste), competently powerful, and its design is endearing and unmistakably Framework.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->1099</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Tiny 4.5-liter desktop PC</li><li>One of the easiest building and upgrading experiences</li><li>Enough graphics power for 2.5K gaming</li><li>Configurable with 128GB of RAM for working with local AI models</li><li>Not a lick of bloatware (aside from Windows itself)</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Not for 4K gaming unless you bump settings way, way down</li><li>CPU, GPU, and RAM are all integrated and can’t be upgraded outside of changing the mainboard</li><li>No x16 PCIe slot</li><li>Similarly priced prebuilt PCs get you more gaming performance</li></ul></div></div></div><div><p id="configurations-and-build-quality"><h2><strong>Configurations and build quality</strong></h2></p></div><p>The <a rel="sponsored" href="https://framework.pxf.io/c/482924/1459308/17284?u=https%3A%2F%2Fframe.work%2Fproducts%2Fdesktop-diy-amd-aimax300%2Fconfiguration%2Fnew">Framework Desktop</a>’s mainboard is built around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">AMD’s Strix Halo APU</a>: a single, beefy chip that contains both CPU and graphics cores. The base config starts with a Ryzen AI Max 385 chip (8 CPU cores, 32 graphics cores) and 32GB of shared RAM for $1,099. The Max Plus 395 models (16 CPU cores, 40 graphics cores) come with 64GB or 128GB of RAM for $1,599 and $1,999, respectively. At each level, that price gets you the mainboard with a preinstalled cooler and Wi-Fi module, the case, and a 400W FlexATX power supply.</p><p>Adding a power cord, Cooler Master CPU fan, two modular front expansion cards, a Windows license, a 512GB SSD, and the requisite front-panel tiles, will run you at least $287 more. Of course, you can spend extra for more storage (which you should, given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283801/comcast-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-large-downloads">the size of modern games</a>), a higher-end fan like a Noctua, or additional front-panel cards. Aside from Framework’s proprietary hot-swappable expansion cards, you can source all those components yourself if you already have them or find them cheaper elsewhere.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>At just under seven pounds, it’s easy to transport this little guy to any LAN party or BYOC event, especially if you get the handle.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Our $1,600-ish review unit came with the Ryzen AI Max 385 mainboard, two 1TB SSDs, a base fan, optional carry handle (“coming soon”), translucent side panel, Windows 11 Pro, a power cord, and a variety of expansion cards and fun tiles for the front. Framework also sent the Max Plus 395 mainboard with 128GB of RAM (which can also be purchased separately for <a rel="sponsored" href="https://framework.pxf.io/c/482924/1459308/17284?u=https%3A%2F%2Fframe.work%2Fproducts%2Fframework-desktop-mainboard-amd-ryzen-ai-max-300-series%3Fv%3DFRAFMK0006">$1,699</a> to put into your own Mini-ITX case) and a third 1TB SSD, so I could benchmark the higher-spec config and try the DIY upgrade.</p><p>Like Framework’s DIY Editions for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/650608/framework-laptop-13-review-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300">Laptop 13</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/688959/framework-laptop-12-review-modular-touchscreen-intel">Laptop 12</a>, the Desktop is a partially prebuilt affair. You’re just installing the fan, up to two NVMe SSDs, two front expansion cards, front panel tiles, and attaching the carry handle (which I think is a must-buy for the fun of it, though it’s not yet available for order, and Framework has yet to confirm its price). The OS install will likely take you longer than the initial hardware setup.</p><p>Build quality is top-notch all around, and the shell and inner frame of the case are intuitively designed. It’s just big enough to hold the motherboard and power supply, with the 120mm CPU fan pulling in air through the perforated side panel and over the APU cooler’s large radiator, from which it exhausts from the rear panel. There’s also a spot for a 80mm fan under the front magnetic cover, if you favor a little more positive airflow.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->13</strong><span><cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The outer panels are plastic, but they’re securely fit with easily unlockable clips — just remove the top panel’s thumb screws and everything else easily unlocks by hand. The decorative front is attached magnetically, and its 21 interchangeable tiles easily pop out for simple rearranging. Inside the chassis, the included screwdriver with Torx and Philips heads are all you need to install / change out the fan, SSDs, and mainboard.</p><p>Framework’s step-by-step guide on swapping out mainboards was not available to me during our review period, but I figured it out on my own and changed from a 385 to the 395 in a little under an hour. That’s how well put together and logical the desktop’s chassis design is: if you’ve worked on PCs before (even if, like me, the last time you built one was 2013), then you can easily putz around and find your way. It was simple to remove the clearly labeled screws securing the board and top rail of the chassis frame. The CPU cooler and even the rear I/O shield are attached to the mainboard, so they all come out together. The only moment that gave me pause was realizing the Wi-Fi module mounted to the rear of the board — which I had to swap from one mainboard to the other — needed a fresh thermal pad, but luckily I had some extras from an old SSD enclosure.</p><div><p id="ryzen-ai-max-385-max-plus-395-benchmark-performance"><h2><strong>Ryzen AI Max 385 / Max Plus 395 benchmark performance</strong></h2></p></div><p>I first tested the Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 APU in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/621947/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-laptop-amd-strix-halo-review">Asus ROG Flow Z13</a>. This is the chip that proved to me integrated graphics aren’t just a laughingstock — it could even hold its own in 2.5K gaming. But that was on a tablet, and this is a desktop PC, with a 400W power supply and much better cooling, and that makes a difference. The Framework Desktop’s lower-end 385 chip came close to or even beat the higher-end 395 chip in the ROG Flow Z13. Both its 385 and 395 chips bested the ROG Flow tablet in various game benchmarks, like <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, despite the Asus still managing to take them in a few single-core tests like Geekbench and Cinebench.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>System</h3></th><th><h3>Framework Desktop / AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 / 8C / 32C / 32GB / 1TB</h3></th><th><h3>Framework Desktop / AMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 / 16C / 40C / 128GB / 1TB</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Flow Z13 / AMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 / 16C / 40C / 32GB / 1TB</h3></th><th><h3>Mac Mini M4 / 10C / 10C / 16GB / 512GB</h3></th><th><h3>MacBook Pro 16-inch M4 Pro / 14C / 20C / 48GB / 2TB</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Single</td><td>2944</td><td>2961</td><td>2986</td><td>3889</td><td>3976</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Multi</td><td>13673</td><td>17484</td><td>19845</td><td>14915</td><td>22615</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 GPU (OpenCL)</td><td>82536</td><td>86948</td><td>80819</td><td>37256</td><td>70018</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Single</td><td>114</td><td>115</td><td>116</td><td>176</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Multi</td><td>1065</td><td>1927</td><td>1450</td><td>945</td><td>1744</td></tr><tr><td>PugetBench for Photoshop</td><td>9726</td><td>10951</td><td>10515</td><td>Not tested</td><td>12374</td></tr><tr><td>Premiere 4K Export</td><td>3 minutes, 5 seconds</td><td>2 minutes, 34 seconds</td><td>Not tested</td><td>Not tested</td><td>2 minutes, 13 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>3DMark Time Spy graphics score (1080p)</td><td>14940</td><td>17620</td><td>12043</td><td>Not tested</td><td>Not tested</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In the Framework, the higher-end chip was 16 percent faster on average in gaming benchmarks than the lower end one. I don’t think that justifies spending an additional $500 if you’re interested in the Framework mainly as a small gaming rig. The top-end Strix Halo chip is billed <a rel="sponsored" href="https://framework.pxf.io/c/482924/1459308/17284?u=https%3A%2F%2Fframe.work%2Fdesktop%3Ftab%3Dgaming%23%3A~%3Atext%3DAn%2520APU%2520that%2520punches%2520above%2520its%2520weight.">by Framework</a> as offering RTX 4070 laptop-level graphics performance without the need for a discrete GPU, and that bears out against our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison">Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</a> tests from last year — which ran the RTX 4060, one rung below the 4070. Both the 385 and 395 Desktop mainboards handily beat <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"><em>The Verge’s</em> perennial</a> darling of a gaming laptop. The 385 falls just shy of matching the newer 2025 version of the <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-oled-3k-120hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-270-16gb-lpddr5x-geforce-rtx-5060-1tb-ssd-platinum-white%2F6629420.p" rel="sponsored">Zephyrus G14 with an RTX 5060</a>, while the 395 still edges it out. Impressive.</p><div><p id="everyday-performance"><h2><strong>Everyday performance</strong></h2></p></div><p>When it comes to actually playing games, you can expect solid frame rates at 2.5K (2560 x 1440 or 1600) resolution at low-to-medium settings, depending on the game. Your indies and live service games like <em>Fortnite</em> that work on most anything should run easily at high frame rates. I played a bunch of <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> on the Framework, and it ran just fine. FromSoftware games are not the best optimized titles, but I could play on the 385 mainboard with medium settings at 2560 x 1440 and stay in the 50fps range. Playing it on the 395 allowed a crisper 4K resolution at medium for a similar 50-or-slightly-below fps — or I could keep it at 2.5K and maintain the game’s 60fps ceiling.</p><p>I assumed indie breakout <em>Peak</em> would play great even at max settings at 4K, but I underestimated the resource demands of its big mountain. I had to keep <em>Peak’s </em>cartoony graphics set to medium, as well, but that ensured my comedic in-game falls were running well above 70fps to 80fps at 4K resolution. On the 395, I could push to high settings for about the same.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Outside of gaming, the Framework Desktop in any of its mainboard configurations is more than capable for everyday productivity stuff and my usual work. The fan often goes whisper quiet when multitasking across simple mixed-use tasks like messaging apps, working in a document, and listening to music or streaming a YouTube video with a bunch of Chrome tabs open. You’ll hear it spin up for some short stretches, but it quickly quiets back down until you’re doing something more intensive. And I’ve yet to encounter any thermal throttling that impacts performance. As much as I love laptops, a compact and quiet desktop that’s flush with ports is such a treat, especially when I can choose those front ports.</p><p>The Framework is also a solid mini workstation for creative apps. Both the 385 and 395 chips beat out the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks">14-inch MacBook Pro M4</a> in our Premiere Pro 4K video export test. And the 395 board trailed the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro chip by just 21 seconds. The 395 and all that RAM spoiled me a bit when importing 60-megapixel RAW photos into Lightroom Classic. It zipped through that import and a quick light-touch edit without any noticeable slowdown — though the fan was quite audible.</p><div><p id="the-framework-desktop-vs-alternatives"><h2><strong>The Framework Desktop vs. alternatives</strong></h2></p></div><p>I mentioned earlier that the Framework Desktop is actually less modular than most desktops. That has its benefits and its drawbacks. It uses a standard mini-ITX motherboard form factor, but because it uses a mobile APU with integrated memory, you can’t upgrade the chip or RAM without replacing the whole board. And you can’t upgrade the graphics, either; there’s no PCIe x16 slot, and while there’s an PCIe x4 connector, the default case doesn’t give you any room to use it.</p><p>The Strix Halo chip in the Framework Desktop is as good as integrated graphics get right now. If you want better gaming performance in a small form factor, you’ll need to get a traditional mini-ITX motherboard and find a 10- or 15-liter case that fits a desktop GPU and processor. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">accommodating that GPU and a desktop CPU is a pain in the ass</a>, from component selection to cable management to cooling. It’s no wonder that many owners give up and leave off side panels or just say “eff it” and cut holes in cases — they’ve even made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffspc/">a subreddit to commiserate</a>.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>With the Framework Desktop, you give up some of that potential in exchange for a desktop that’s dead simple to build and maintain. But it’s a truism that you can get more power for less money if you go bigger.</p><p>Even prebuilts in the $1,000 range rocking a <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/cyberpowerpc-gamer-xtreme-gaming-desktop---intel-core-ultra-5-225f--nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060---windows-11-home--32gb-ram--2tb-ssd.product.4000375234.html" rel="sponsored">low</a>-to-<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/ibuypower-y40-liquid-cooled-gaming-pc---amd-ryzen-7-9700x----geforce-rtx-5070---windows-11---32-gb-ram---2tb-ssd---black.product.4000366690.html" rel="sponsored">mid</a> 50-series desktop card are going to beat the Framework Desktop in games. Just look at this stormtrooper of an <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-omen-16l-gaming-desktop-intel-core-ultra-7-265f-16gb-ddr5-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-gddr7-1tb-ssd-panda-metal%2F6620426.p" rel="sponsored">HP Omen 16L</a> with an RTX 5060 Ti as an example. A 16-liter case is decently compact, and if you’re just looking for an affordable turn-key gaming machine, it’s likely a-ok. But 16L is more than three times the 4.5L Framework Desktop. And many prebuilt machines are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-d8P_7gqp0">notorious for cutting corners</a> or having limitations to what further upgrades you can put into them.</p><p>When it comes to desktops the size of the Framework or smaller, you’re in <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fus%2Fdisplays-desktops%2Fnucs%2Fall-series%2Ffilter%3FSeries%3DNUC-Mini-PCs" rel="sponsored">Asus NUC</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/">Mac Mini</a> territory. There are also thin clients, like the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fdesktops%2Fthinkcentre%2Fm-series-tiny%2Flenovo-thinkcentre-m75q-gen-5-tiny-amd%2Flen102c0051" rel="sponsored">Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny</a>, but they are more enterprise-focused, with modest specs. And several other small-form-factor Strix Halo desktops are beginning to crop up. HP already has its <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-z2-mini-g1a-workstation-desktop-pc-wolf-pro-security-edition-p-bn8e0ua-aba-1" rel="sponsored">Z2 Mini G1a</a> that’s smaller than the Framework, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/desktop-computers/715282/corsair-ai-workstation-300-framework-desktop">Corsair recently announced</a> an upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/desktop-computers/715282/corsair-ai-workstation-300-framework-desktop">AI Workstation 300</a>, but none of these are upgradeable like the Framework Desktop.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The Framework Desktop is an adorably fun PC that makes building and owning a small form factor computer dead easy. Sure, it can’t stack up to the performance of full-size builds, small form factor gaming PCs with discrete GPUs, or prebuilts in the same price range. However, it’s a unique alternative if you want a tiny PC for lighter / 2.5K gaming, media creation, or running local AI models. Like a lot of Framework stuff, it’s slightly niche, there’s nothing else quite like it, and though it’s affordable-ish, you’re still paying a bit of a premium compared to more conventional alternatives.</p><p>Having such a tiny thing sit on my desk and deliver solid gaming performance got me to start rethinking my neverending pursuit of higher graphical fidelity. Do I really need to endure the constant fan noise of a gaming laptop or worry about a power-hungry GPU in a full-size desktop adding to my monthly electricity bill? Maybe a fun little machine that delivers good enough graphics is, well, good enough.</p><div><div><p id="framework-desktop-specs-as-reviewed"><h2>Framework Desktop specs (as reviewed)</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 (8 CPU cores, 32 graphics cores) / AMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 (16 CPU cores, 40 graphics cores)</span></li><li><span><strong>Shared memory:</strong> 32GB (AI Max 385) / 128GB (AI Max Plus 395)</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 x 1TB SSD</span></li><li><span><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth</span></li><li><span><strong>Rear ports:</strong> HDMI 2.1, 2x DisplayPort 2.1, 2x USB4, 1x RJ45 ethernet, 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, 3.5mm combo audio jack</span></li><li><span><strong>Front ports:</strong> 2x modular expansion card slots (USB-C based)</span></li><li><span><strong>Weight:</strong> 6.83 pounds / 3.1kg</span></li><li><span><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 3.81 x 8.09 x 8.9 inches / 96.8 x 205.5 x 226.1 mm</span></li><li><span><strong>Price (Ryzen AI Max 385):</strong> $1,099</span></li><li><span><strong>Price (Ryzen AI Max Plus 395):</strong> $1,999</span></li></ul></div></div><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Forza Motorsport’s</em> social media account seems dead. <em>Castle Crashers</em> is getting new DLC. And <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta is a smash hit that seems to indicate EA’s choice to recreate <em>Battlefield 3</em> was a smart one. Plus an ugly Atari 2600 and some cool <em>Kotaku</em> stories you might have missed. Yes, folks, it’s time once again for Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news, trailers, and cool shit.</p> <h2><strong>The <em>Battlefield 6</em> Open Beta Is A Massive Hit On Steam</strong></h2> <p>I knew there was a lot of excitement for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, which is launching this October on Xbox, PS5, and PC, but I didn’t realize just how many people were apparently ready for a new, grounded <em>BF</em> game. Turns out a lot of people want to play this new installment in EA’s military sim shooter series. On Steam alone, the open beta has already hit over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">330,000 concurrent players</a>. And this is despite <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953403767107264869?">numerous server issues and long queues</a>. Also, keep in mind that this session of the “open” beta isn’t actually open. You need an early access code to join in right now. I imagine <em>Battlefield</em> devs (and EA as a whole) are very excited about the high numbers. We’ll see how much higher the player count goes later this week when the beta goes truly open.</p> <h2><strong><em>Castle Crashers</em>‘ First New DLC In A Decade Is Out Now</strong></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Castle Crashers: Painter Boss Paradise DLC Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6OYpEUMQhz8?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>2008’s <em>Castle Crashers</em> is getting some new DLC today. <a href="https://kotaku.com/castle-crashers-first-dlc-in-12-years-lets-you-make-you-1851606535">As previously announced,</a> the beloved cartoon brawler from the XBLA days is getting a big upgrade via the Painter Boss Paradise DLC. This $4 expansion is available now on Steam and adds a new world map, a new official character named Paint Junior, some quality-of-life changes, and the ability to create your own playable characters, too.</p>

 <h2><strong>What’s Up With The<em> Forza Motorsport</em> Twitter Account?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>So here’s something odd. The official <em>Forza Motorsport</em> Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1943342994662310309">hasn’t tweeted anything since July 10.</a> This is strange, as <em>Forza Motorsport</em> is a live-service game that, in theory, is frequently being updated with new content and events. You’d think Xbox or Turn 10 would want to keep people updated on the game’s status or at least tweet something here and there to remind people that the game is alive and still active. <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1953142509238198413?t=Z_WE72dEIAGv86xMmehTBA&amp;s=19">But as pointed out by Destin Legarie,</a> it seems the account has gone dormant. What does that mean in the wake of <a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">layoffs at Turn 10 and Xbox</a>? Probably nothing good.</p> <h2><strong>A very yellow Atari 2600 is now available for pre-order</strong></h2> <p>A new, version of the Atari 2600+ (a modern spin on the retro console that can play the old carts) is now available for pre-order. But it doesn’t feature the console’s iconic faux wood veneer.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-2600-pac-man-edition-console-wireless-joystick-bandai-namco-game-preorders/1100-6533716/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f"> Instead, it is painted a bright, obnoxious yellow in honor of </a><em>Pac-Man.</em> This special edition of the console arrives in October and will cost you $170. It does come with a wireless controller and two different versions of <em>Pac-Man.</em> First is a new game, <em>Pac-Man 7800</em>, which is a fresh port of the classic arcade game. The other included cart is the 2600 version of <em>Pac-Man</em>, which might be the worst way to play the game in 2025. Yay? Anyway, if you want a really ugly Atari 2600+, you can pre-order this now.</p> <h2>Park building sickos should check out this <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> trailer</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic World Evolution 3 | Shaping Your Parks | Feature Focus" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6PYojm22uV0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The first two <em>Jurassic World Evolution</em> games had totally serviceable terrain modification tools and options. But the upcoming <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> is going to the next level, letting you build waterfalls and even use cliffs and valleys to contain your various dinos. This trailer has me so excited to spend many, many hours digging holes and placing individual trees in my digital parks. I’m going to lose a large chunk of my life to this game, and I’m so fucking excited.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043">We’ve learned a lot about <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s multiplayer since its reveal last week</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043">Nintendo of America at one point in time wanted to give Pikachu big boobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">Take a look behind the scenes of a massive AAA video game reveal</a></li> </ul>

            <title><![CDATA[DICE Clarifies How Bots Work In Battlefield 6 Beta]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Battlefield 6 launches, it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-bots-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected that AI bots</a> will be used to fill out matches should there not be enough players. In the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, however, AI bots won’t be everywhere.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the official Battlefield 6 communications team clarified how bots, or “AI soldiers” will work during the game’s beta.</p>



<p>“AI Soldiers are only present on the “Training Grounds” playlists within the Open Beta,” <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953431583223943500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the team said</a>. “This week is ‘Breakthrough Initiation’.</p>



<p>“Breakthrough Initiation is a playlist that allows you to experience Breakthrough alongside 15 other players, with additional AI Soldiers filling up the match thereafter.”</p>



<p>DICE says that Training Grounds playlists are available to “introduce people to the core elements of Breakthrough, and offer a smoother experience than a full lobby.”</p>



<p>“Additionally, you can experience Breakthrough without AI Soldiers by playing Breakthrough from the “Featured” playlist row,” they added. “Training Grounds is only available for the first 15 ranks, at which point it will disappear from the front end.”</p>



<p>Currently, Battlefield 6’s Beta is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-game-servers-full-players-queue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being filled by hundreds of thousands</a> of players ahead of the official start of the “open” portion on August 9. If players were worried about bots being a part of traditional matches, it appears that won’t be the case.</p>



<p>As mentioned, however, the game is expected to use bots to fill up lobbies should there not be enough players for a match. They can also be used, as DICE’s Jac Carlsson said, when creating a custom game mode in Portal that allows players to practice and improve at the game.</p>



<p>Are you playing the Battlefield 6 beta this weekend or next? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>Framework’s main claim to fame is its commitment to modular, upgradeable, repairable laptops. The jury’s still out on early 2024’s Framework Laptop 16 and mid-2025’s Framework Laptop 12, neither of which has seen a hardware refresh, but so far, the company has released half a dozen iterations of its flagship Framework Laptop 13 in less than five years. If you bought one of the originals right when it first launched, you could go to Framework’s site, buy an all-new motherboard and RAM, and get a substantial upgrade in performance and other capabilities without having to change anything else about your laptop.</p>
<p>Framework’s laptops haven’t been adopted as industry-wide standards, but in many ways, they seem built to reflect the flexibility and modularity that has drawn me to desktop PCs for more than two decades.</p>
<p>That's what makes the Framework Desktop so weird. Not only is Framework navigating into a product category where its main innovation and claim to fame is totally unnecessary. But it’s actually doing that with a desktop that’s <em>less</em> upgradeable and modular than any given self-built desktop PC.</p>
<p>The Framework Desktop has a lot of interesting design touches, and it's automatically a better buy than the weird AMD Ryzen AI Max-based mini desktops you can buy from a couple of no-name manufacturers. But aside from being more considerate of PC industry standards, the Framework Desktop asks the same question that any gaming-focused mini PC does: Do you care about having a small machine so much that you would pay more money for less performance, and for a system you can't upgrade much after you buy it?</p>
<h2>Design and assembly</h2>

<p>My DIY Edition Framework Desktop arrived in a cardboard box that was already as small or a bit smaller than my usual desktop PC, a mini ITX build with a dedicated GPU inside a 14.67-liter <a href="https://ssupd.co/products/cases-meshlicious?variant=37165949616312">SSUPD Meshlicious</a> case. It's not a huge system, especially for something that can fit a GeForce RTX 5090 in it. But three of the 4.5-liter Framework Desktops could fit inside my build's case with a little space leftover.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The PC itself is buried a couple of layers deep in this box under some side panels and whatever fan you choose (Framework offers RGB and non-RGB options from Cooler Master and Noctua, but any 120 mm fan will fit on the heatsink). Even for the DIY Edition, the bulk of it is already assembled: the motherboard is in the case, a large black heatsink is already perched atop the SoC, and both the power supply and front I/O ports are already hooked up.</p>
<p>The aspiring DIYer mainly needs to install the SSD and the fan to get going. Putting in these components gives you a decent crash course in how the system goes together and comes apart. The primary M.2 SSD slot is under a small metal heat spreader next to the main heatsink—loosen one screw to remove it, and install your SSD of choice. The system's other side panel can be removed to expose a second M.2 SSD slot and the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module, letting you install or replace either.</p>
<p>Lift the small handles on the two top screws and loosen them by hand to remove them, and the case's top panel slides off. This provides easier access to both the CPU fan header and RGB header, so you can connect the fan after you install it and its plastic shroud on top of the heatsink. That's pretty much it for assembly, aside from sliding the various panels back in place to close the thing up and reinstalling the top screws (or, if you bought or printed one, adding a handle to the top of the case).</p>

      The Framework Desktop includes a beefier version of Framework's usual screwdriver with a longer bit.

<p>Framework includes a beefier version of its typical screwdriver with the Desktop, including a bit that can be pulled out and reversed to be switched between Phillips and Torx heads. The iFixit-style install instructions are clearly written and include plenty of high-resolution sample images so you can always tell how things are supposedto look.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The front of the system requires some assembly, too, but all of this stuff can be removed and replaced easily without opening up the rest of the system. The front panel, where the system's customizable tiles can be snapped on and popped off, attaches with magnets and can easily be pried away from the desktop with your fingernails. At the bottom are slots for two of Framework's USB-C Expansion Cards, the same ones that all the Framework Laptops use.</p>

<p>By default, those ports are limited to 5 Gbps USB transfer speeds in the BIOS, something the system says reduces wireless interference; those with all-wired networking and accessories can presumably enable the full 10 Gbps speeds without downsides. The front ports should support all of the Expansion Cards <em>except</em> for display outputs, which they aren't wired for. (I also had issues getting the Desktop to boot from a USB port on the front of the system while installing Windows, but your mileage may vary; using one of the rear USB ports solved the issue for me.)</p>
<h3>Standards, sometimes</h3>

<p>What puts the Framework Desktop above mini PCs from Amazon or the various gaming NUCs that Intel and Asus have released over the years is a commitment to standards.</p>
<p>For reasons we'll explore later, there was no way to build the system around this specific AMD chip without using soldered-on memory. But the motherboard is a regular mini ITX-sized motherboard. Other ITX boards will fit into Framework's case, and the Framework Laptop's motherboard will fit into other systems (as long as they can also fit the fan and heatsink).</p>
<p>The 400 W power supply conforms to the FlexATX standard. The CPU fan is just a regular 120 mm fan, and the mounting holes for system fans on the front can take any 92 mm fan. The two case fan headers on the motherboard are the same ones you'd find on any motherboard you bought for yourself. The front panel ports can't be used for display outputs, but anything else ought to work.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Few elements of the Framework Desktop are truly proprietary, and if Framework went out of business tomorrow, you'd still have a lot of flexibility for buying and installing replacement parts. The problem is that the soldered-down, non-replaceable, non-upgradeable parts are the CPU, GPU, and RAM. There's at least a little flexibility with the graphics card if you move the board into a different case—there's a single PCIe x4 slot on the board that you could put an external GPU into, though many PCIe x16 graphics cards will be bandwidth starved. But left in its original case, it's an easy-to-work-on, standards-compliant system that will also never be any better or get any faster than it is the day you buy it.</p>

<p>The interior of the Framework Desktop is built of sturdy metal, thoughtfully molded to give easy access to each of the ports and components on the motherboard. My main beef with the system is the outside.</p>
<p>The front and side panels of the Framework Desktop are all made out of plastic. The clear side panel, if you spring for it, is made of a thick acrylic instead of tempered glass (presumably because Framework has drilled holes in the side of it to improve airflow).</p>
<p>This isn't the end of the world, but the kinds of premium ITX PC cases that the Desktop is competing with are predominantly made of nicer-looking and nicer-feeling metal rather than plastic. It just feels surprisingly cheap, which was an unpleasant surprise—even the plastic Framework Laptop 12 felt sturdy and high-quality, something I can't really say of the Desktop's exterior panels.</p>
<p>I do like the design on the front panel—a grid of 21 small square plastic tiles that users can rearrange however they want. Framework sells tiles with straight and diagonal lines on them, plus individual tiles with different logos or designs printed or embossed on them. If you install a fan in the front of the system, you'll want to stick to the lined tiles in the top 9 x 9 section of the grid, which will allow air to pass through. The tiles with images on them are solid—putting a couple of them in front of a fan likely won't hurt your airflow too much, but you won't want to use too many.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Framework has also <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Framework-Desktop">published basic templates</a> for both the tiles and the top panel so that those <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/what-i-learned-from-my-first-few-months-with-a-bambu-lab-a1-3d-printer-part-1/">with 3D printers</a> can make their own.</p>

<h2>PC testbed notes</h2>
<p>We've compared the performance of the Framework Desktop to a bunch of other PCs to give you a sense of how it stacks up to full-size desktops. We've also compared it to the Ryzen 7 8700G in a <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/B650I-AORUS-ULTRA">Gigabyte B650I Aorus Ultra</a> mini ITX motherboard with 32GB of DDR5-6400 to show the best performance you can expect from a similarly sized socketed desktop system.</p>
<p>Where possible, we've also included some numbers from the M4 Pro Mac mini and the M4 Max Mac Studio, two compact desktops in the same general price range as the Framework Desktop.</p>
<p>For our game benchmarks, the dedicated GPU results were gathered using our GPU testbed, which you can read about in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/review-at-349-amds-16gb-radeon-rx-9060-xt-is-the-new-midrange-gpu-to-beat/">our latest dedicated GPU review</a>. The integrated GPUs were obviously tested with the CPUs they're attached to.</p>

<h2>Performance and power</h2>
<p>Our Framework-provided review unit was the highest-end option; it has a 16-core Ryzen AI Max+395 processor, 40 graphics cores, and 128GB of RAM. At $1,999 before adding an SSD, a fan, an OS, front tiles, or Expansion Cards, this is the best, priciest configuration Framework offers. The $1,599 configuration uses the same chip with the same performance, but with 64GB of RAM instead.</p>
<p>All 16 of those CPU cores are based on the Zen 5 architecture, with none of the smaller-but-slower Zen 5c cores. But its total TDP is also limited to 120 W in total, which will hold it back a bit compared to socketed 16-core desktop CPUs like the Ryzen 9 9950X, which has a 170 W default TDP for the CPU alone.</p>


<p>In our testing, it seems clear that the CPU throttles when being tasked with intensive multi-core work like our Handbrake test, with temperatures that spike to around 100 degrees Celsius and hang out at around or just under that number for the duration of our test runs. The CPU package uses right around 100 W on average (this will vary based on the tests you're running and how long you're running them), compared to the 160 W and 194 W that the 12- and 16-core Ryzen 9 9900X and 9950X can consume at their default power levels.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Those are socketed desktop chips in huge cases being cooled by large AIO watercooling loops, so it's hardly a fair comparison. The Framework Desktop's CPU is also quite efficient, using even less power to accomplish our video encoding test than the 9950X in its 105 W Eco Mode. But this is the consequence of prioritizing a small size—a 16-core processor that, under heavy loads, performs more like a 12-core or even an 8-core desktop processor.</p>
<p>The upside is that the Framework Desktop is quieter than most desktops either under load or when idling. By default, the main CPU fan will turn off entirely when the system is under light load, and I often noticed it parking itself when I was just browsing or moving files around.</p>




<p>Based on our gaming tests, the Framework Desktop should be a competent 1080p-to-1440p &nbsp;midrange gaming system. We observed similar performance from the Radeon 8060S integrated GPU when we tested it in the Asus ROG Flow Z13 tablet. For an integrated GPU, it's head and shoulders over anything you can get in a socketed desktop system, and it easily ran three or four times faster than the Radeon 780M in the 8700G. The soldered RAM is annoying, but the extra speed it enables helps address the memory bandwidth problem that starves most integrated GPUs.</p>
<p>Compared to other desktop GPUs, though, the 8060S is merely fine. It's usually a little slower than the last-generation <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/review-radeon-7600-xt-offers-peace-of-mind-via-lots-of-ram-remains-a-midrange-gpu/">Radeon RX 7600 XT</a>, a card that cost $329 when it launched in early 2024—and with a performance hit that's slightly more pronounced in games with ray-tracing effects on.</p>
<p>The 8060S stacks up OK to older midrange GPUs like the GeForce RTX 3060 and 4060, but it's soundly beaten by the RTX 5060 or the 16GB version of the Radeon RX 9060 XT, cards currently available for $300-to-$400. (One problem for the 8060S—it's based on the RDNA3.5 architecture, so it's missing ray-tracing performance improvements introduced in RDNA4 and the RX 9000 series).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<p>All of that said, the GPU may be more interesting than it looks on paper for people whose workloads need gobs and gobs of graphics memory but who <em>don't</em> necessarily need that memory to be attached to the blazing-fastest GPU that exists. For people running certain AI or machine learning workloads, the 8060S's unified memory setup means you can get a GPU with 64GB or 128GB of VRAM for less than the price of a single RTX 5090 (Framework says the GPU can use up to 112GB of RAM on the 128GB Desktop). Framework is <a href="https://frame.work/blog/using-a-framework-desktop-for-local-ai">advertising that use case pretty extensively</a>, and it offers a guide to setting up large language models to run locally on the system.</p>
<p>That memory would likely be even&nbsp;<em>more</em> useful if it were attached to an Nvidia GPU instead of an AMD model—Nvidia's hold on the workstation graphics market is at least as tight as its hold on the gaming GPU market, and many apps and tools support Nvidia GPUs and CUDA first/best/only. But it's still one possible benefit the Framework Desktop might offer, relative to a desktop with a dedicated GPU.</p>
<h2>You can’t say it isn’t unique</h2>

<p>In one way, Framework has done the same thing with the Desktop that it has done with all its laptops: found a niche and built a product to fill it. And with its standard-size components and standard connectors, the Framework Desktop is a clear cut above every Intel gaming NUC or Asus ROG thingamajig that’s ever existed.</p>
<p>I’m always impressed by the creativity, thoughtfulness, and attention to detail that Framework brings to its builds. For the Desktop, this is partially offset by how much I don’t care for most of its cheap plastic-and-acrylic exterior. But it’s still thoughtfully designed on the&nbsp;<em>inside</em>, with as much respect for standards, modularity, and repairability as you can get, once you get past that whole thing where that the major functional components are all irrevocably soldered together.</p>

        <div>
          
          
<p>The Framework Desktop is also quiet, cute, and reasonably powerful. You're paying some extra money and giving up both CPU and GPU speed to get something small. But you won't run into games or apps that simply refuse to run for performance-related reasons.</p>
<p>It does feel like a weird product for Framework to build, though. It's not that I can't imagine the kind of person a Framework Desktop might be good for—it's that I think Framework has built its business targeting a PC enthusiast demographic that will mainly be turned off by the desktop's lack of upgradeability.</p>
<p>The Framework desktop is an interesting option for people who want or need a compact and easy-to-build workstation or gaming PC, or a Windows-or-Linux version of Apple's Mac Studio. It will fit comfortably under a TV or in a cramped office. It's too bad that it isn't easier to upgrade. But for people who would prefer the benefits of a socketed CPU or a swappable graphics card, I'm sure the people at Framework would be the first ones to point you in the direction of a good-old desktop PC.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solid all-round performance and good power efficiency.</li>
<li>The Radeon 8060S is exceptionally good for an integrated GPU, delivering much better performance than you can get in something like the Ryzen 7 8700G.</li>
<li>Large pool of RAM available to the GPU could be good for machine learning and AI workloads.</li>
<li>Thoughtfully designed interior that's easy to put together.</li>
<li>Uses standard-shaped motherboard, fan headers, power supply, and connectors, unlike lots of pre-built mini PCs.</li>
<li>Front tiles are fun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Power limits keep the 16-core CPU from running as fast as the socketed desktop version.</li>
<li>A $300-to-$400 dedicated GPU will still beat the Radeon RX 8060S.</li>
<li>Cheap-looking exterior plastic panels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>

            <p>
A mere seven days after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">third-party-focused partner showcase</a>, Nintendo has given indies a turn, detailing exactly what Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> players can look forward to in between those bigger-budget releases. And while its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJXXKFrxT_U">latest Indie World Showcase</a> was certainly a brisk affair, it still managed to pack a lot in, so if you missed it live - or simply want a refresher - here's everything featured this time around. And to avoid an overwhelming sense of crushing disappointment, I'm just going to tell you now: there wasn't even a whiff of Silksong.

<h3>Mina: The Hollower</h3>
<figure>

<p>
But as starters go, Mina: The Hollower set a high bar. It's the latest game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a> developer Yacht Club, and sees the titular mouse embarking on a retro-tinged quest to save a cursed island. Mina was actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shovel-knight-devs-reveal-new-project-mina-the-hollower">announced all the way back in 2022</a>, but it finally has a suitably spooky release date. It's heading to Switch eShop on 31st October and a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mina-the-hollower-switch-2/">demo's out today</a>.

<h3>Well Dweller</h3>

<p>
Coming from Crypt Custodian and Islets developer Kyle Thompson, Well Dweller is a "dark fairytale metroidvania" charting the adventures of a tiny bird named Glimmer. Armed with a matchstick, players must brave the kingdom's perils in order to save Glimmer's siblings from the queen - who's determined to make them part of her gown. This one's coming to Switch sometime next year.

<h3>Neverway</h3>

<p>
If you're an indie showcase connoisseur, you'll probably be more than familiar with Neverway by now. It's a "nightmarish life sim RPG" that follows protagonist Fiona as she quits her job, makes a fresh start on a farm and, in something of a departure for the genre, gets recruited as the immortal herald of a dead god. It's got all the usual stuff - fishing, farming, crafting, romancing, and so on - but unspeakable horrors are beginning to leak into this reality and it's up to Fiona to fight back using her sword, hookshot, and other abilities she'll gain as players start to bond with the townsfolk. Neverway still doesn't have a release date, but it's coming to Switch next year.

<p>
Herdlings is the latest adventure from developer Okomotive, the studio behind the well-received Far: Lone Sails and its sequel Changing Tides. It sees players embarking on a "tale of beauty and companionship" as they shepherd a steadily growing herd of mysterious creatures across its striking vistas of mist-shrouded forests, forgotten valleys, snowy plateaus, and more. Amid all that traversal, there's promise of challenges and threats to overcome, alongside light puzzling, and it's coming to Switch's eShop on 21st August.

<p>
In Poti Poti Studio's "pleasant" logic puzzler Is This Seat Taken?, the goal is to satisfy the demands of a particularly fussy group of chair occupiers and establish a seating plan that'll keep everyone happy. You'll be re-arranging bottoms across a host of environments - from the bus to a banquet to the office to a picnic - and if that appeals, you won't have long to wait. Is This Seat Taken? is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/is-this-seat-taken-switch/">out today on Switch</a>.

<p>
Here's a quick one for you. Little Kitty, Big City - the feline-focused open-world adventure from Double Dagger Studio - is poised to bring its latest free update to Switch. There's talk of new story content, a new neighbourhood to explore, and new characters to meet. That's alongside new photo mode options, a new cat customisation feature, and more. There's no specific release date for all this on Switch yet, but it's due later this year.

<p>
Content Warning, the co-operative horror romp that become something of a surprise internet sensation when it launched for PC last year, is making its way to Switch - and there'll be a Switch 2 version too. The gist, if you're unfamiliar, is that you and three friends must descend into nightmarish depths and capture the horrors within on camera. At least one of you must survive long enough to escape so you can upload your footage to the fictional SpöökTube in a bid to rack up the views and become a viral sensation. It's a fun time and is coming to Nintendo's platforms next year.

What happens if you combine the classic arcade brick-breakers of yore with base-building, grimy fantasy, and roguelite survival? Ball x Pit, from developer Kenny Sun and publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a>, is your answer. Inspired by the likes of Loop Hero and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, players battle their way though auto-scrolling levels, using brick-breaking-style ball attacks to smash their way through barbaric hordes of oncoming enemies and massive bosses. Completing levels earns resources used to expand a settlement which in turn unlocks new bonuses characters, new power-ups, and more. Ball x Pit launches for the original Switch on 15th October, with the Switch version due this "autumn".

<p>
Ultimate Sheep Racoon is a game of tumbling, side-scrolling, bike-riding action, where up to eight players can work together - either locally or online - to create perilous obstacle courses and then battle for chaotic supremacy. If the name sounds familiar, that's because is the spiritual successor to Clever Endeavour Games' Ultimate Chicken Horse, and it's coming to Switch and Switch 2 - complete with cross-platform play support - this "winter".

<h3>Glaciered</h3>

<p>
65 million years have passed and the world has frozen over, sealing the oceans beneath a thick layer of ice. That's the starting point for Glaciered, a "chill" underwater action game from Studio Snowblind said to be inspired by the rich ecosystems and cold climates of Hokkaido, Japan. Playing as a Tuai, an avian species evolved from dinosaurs that can control heat and cold, players are tasked with traversing the diverse underwater world in order to fend off the creatures threatening the Everwinter. Appropriately enough, Glaciered comes to Switch 2 this "winter" and is a timed console exclusive.

<p>
And that's mostly it. However, in typical Nintendo fashion, the company squeaked in some blink-and-you'll-miss-it exciting reveals in one final lightning-fast montage. Alongside appearances from the likes of Winter Burrow, Undusted: Letters from the Past, Tiny Bookshop, Strange Antiquities, Opus: Prism Peak, and Go-Go Town, we also got word that developer Freehold Games' superb retro roguelike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/caves-of-qud">Caves of Qud</a> - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/caves-of-qud-review">earned itself a five star Eurogamer review</a> last year - is also heading to Switch, alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ufo-50-review-a-rangy-confounding-and-audacious-proposition">equally wonderful UFO 50</a>. The latter (essentially a collection of 50 new games designed to look like very old games from the team behind Spelunky) is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/ufo-50-switch/">surprise-launching onto Switch today</a>!
