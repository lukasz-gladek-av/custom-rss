            <p>
EA has reportedly cancelled its single-player Black Panther game and closed the studio behind it, resulting in an unspecified number of layoffs.
</p>
<p>
EA Entertainment president Laura Miele shared the news in an email to staff <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">seen by IGN</a>, insisting today's Black Panther cancellation, the closure of Cliffhanger Games, and the resulting job losses - as well the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-lays-off-over-300-employees-cancels-new-titanfall-game">recent cancellation of other projects</a>, including an unannounced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game at Respawn - would help the publisher "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."
</p>
<p>
EA declined to comment on the number of employees impacted by its latest round of layoffs when approached by IGN (these will reportedly also affect members of the publisher's mobile and central divisions), but the website says it understands fewer individuals will be affected compared to the 300 job cuts recently made across Respawn and several other teams.
</p>
<p>
"These decisions are hard," Miele wrote. "They affect people we've worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We're doing everything we can to support them - including finding opportunities within EA, where we've had success helping people land in new roles."
</p>
<p>
EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-single-player-black-panther-game-from-new-studio">announced its Black Panther title</a> back in 2023, confirming it would be handled by its then-new Cliffhanger Games studio in collaboration with Marvel Games. Although few details were shared at the time, it was described as a third-person title set in an "expansive and reactive" version of Wakanda, and still "early in development". Nothing has been seen of the project since then, but a job listing in 2024 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-black-panther-game-will-be-open-world-recruitment-ad-suggests">indicated it would be an open-world game</a>.
</p>
<p>
Black Panther's cancellation follows EA CEO Andrew Wilson's comments last year that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">publisher would be moving away from "future licensed IP"</a>. And while Miele insisted EA will continue to invest in developer Motive's Iron Man project and Respawn's third Star Wars: Jedi game, she suggested the focus will now be on a small number of its own franchises, specifically Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. That's in addition to Bioware's next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>.
</p>
<p>
Notably, EA also recently announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-its-pausing-development-on-future-rally-games-as-wrc-partnership-ends">ending its licensing partnership with the World Rally Championship</a> and "pausing development" on all future rally games - a move which resulted in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-it-is-reducing-roles-at-codemasters-and-redeploying-as-many-as-possible">undisclosed number of additional layoffs</a> at Codemasters.
</p>
<p>
A second Black Panther project - publisher Skydance Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, which is being penned by Uncharted writer Amy Hennig - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed into next year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Electronic Arts has just cut up one of it's marquee upcoming games, the <em>Black Panther</em> game that Cliffhanger Games had been working on.</p>

<p>First reported by IGN, the information came from an email sent by EA Entertainment president Laura Miele, who shared that this change alongside others was to put their focus where they thought there was the opportunity for the most growth. Beyond Cliffhanger Games, and other recent cancellations like with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Respawn Layoffs Part of Wider EA Staff Cuts, Titanfall Project Reportedly Axed">Respawn and an untitled <em>Titanfall</em></a><em> </em>project, people have been laid off on its mobile, and central teams. While this is believed to be less than was laid off last month's 300 people, it is still a significant amount.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-panther-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Black Panther Game Officially In The Works From New EA AAA Studio">Cliffhanger Games was announced in 2023 </a>along with the announcement of the <em>Black Panther</em> project, although formation of the team began in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ex-monolith-vp-kevin-stephens-starting-new-ea-studio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ex-Monolith VP Kevin Stephens starting new EA studio">2021 with Kevin Stephens</a>, formerly of Monolith Productions tagged as the studio lead. From the getgo, the goal was to target an area that EA has seemingly had some trouble with - the open world adventure category, particularly with sandboxes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stephens, a former VP at Monolith, brought experience working on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor"><em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> </a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-review-nemesis-reborn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Middle-earth: Shadow of War Review - A Nemesis Reborn"><em>Shadow of War</em> </a>games which were successes in the genre, with <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> a particularly innovative title. Rumors that it was a <em>Black Panther</em> game they were doing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumor-black-panther-open-world-game-apparently-in-development" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" [Rumor] Black Panther Open World Game Apparently In Development">began circulating in 2022</a>, a year before it was revealed.</p>

<p>According to Miele, EA will be helping people find opportunities within EA, meaning that we may see less people laidoff than we would otherwise, instead merely having to uproot their lives at the whims of corporate decisions. The email also tells us a bit of what we can expect from EA Entertainment (Sports is it's own division): a focus on a handful of franchises. Those will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-battlefield-dev-diary-gunplay-movement" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" EA Details New Battlefield's Gunplay and Movement in First Dev Diary"><em>Battlefield</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sims-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Sims 4"><em>The Sims</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" EA's New Skate Game Won't Let You Play It Offline"><em>Skate</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/Apex%20Legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/games/apex-legends"><em>Apex Legends</em></a>. Miele states that the <em>Iron Man</em> game in work at Motive Studios will continue, as will the third <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/Star%20Wars%20Jedi:%20Survivor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor"><em>Star Wars: Jedi</em> </a>game, and&nbsp;Bioware's work on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-teases-new-mass-effect-epsilon-as-direct-sequel-to-me3-with-cryptic-video-hints" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="BioWare Teases New Mass Effect as Possible Sequel to ME3 With Cryptic Video &amp; Hints ">next <em>Mass Effect</em> game</a>. This comes also after they announced the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-rally-games-pausing-codemasters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" EA &quot;Pausing Development on Future Rally Titles&quot;">pausing of various racing games </a>that had been in the works earlier this month.</p>

<p>One missing game from that list however is the third unannounced Marvel game that EA signed a deal for back when they announced <em>Iron Man</em> as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/eas-iron-man-just-start-of-three-game-marvel-deal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" EA's Iron Man Just The Start Of Three Game Marvel Deal">3 game deal</a>. Whether that game continues, or if it is never to even be announced is unknown with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Electronic Arts to Lay Off 5% of Its Workforce, Star Wars FPS Action Game by Respawn Canceled">EA souring on work with licensed properties</a>. Of course, we should take any future plans with a grain of salt - only two months ago Cliffhanger Games was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cliffhanger-games_hiring-jobalert-jobopening-activity-7303112096915902466-2xDw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAWFcNgBTnKdYM4ShDjI2C0H2DackkNIFLU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cliffhanger Games Hiring People">looking to fill a number of roles</a>, and now it's shutting down.</p>

<p>Thus we can add <em>Black Panther</em> to the long list of games we'll never see, with its brief teaser being almost all the public footage that there is of it.</p>

When asked for an exact number of individuals impacted, EA declined to comment. IGN understands the total number of affected individuals in this wave is less than the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn">roughly 300 roles cut last month</a> across Respawn and EA's Fan Care teams - but cannot confirm by how much. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These decisions are hard," Miele wrote. "They affect people we’ve worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them — including finding opportunities within EA, where we’ve had success helping people land in new roles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with past rounds of layoffs, EA is endeavoring to place affected individuals in other roles across the company. The company has made use of this placement program with each round of layoffs in recent years, an effort that remains possible despite the constant team cuts likely due to EA seemingly drastically increasing headcount on other teams at the same time. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Per Game File's reporting</a>, EA employed 800 more people as of March of this year than it did the same time in 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Miele's email continues, the company is focusing on a small handful of franchises going forward: Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends. Miele also reassures EA will continue to invest in its Iron Man game at Motive and the third Star Wars: Jedi game, as well as it maintain its mobile business despite today's cuts, while Bioware works on the next Mass Effect. Additionally, last year, CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/continuing-to-evolve-our-business-and-teams" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced the company would be</a> "moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The email doesn't mention EA Sports, but this is due to Miele running EA Entertainment, while EA Sports is a separate division. IGN understands that the sports division is unaffected by these changes for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Marvel and EA's agreement for Black Panther was part of a three-game deal that included Iron Man and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-and-ea-sign-three-game-deal-starting-with-iron-man">a third, unannounced title</a>. Little has been shown of Black Panther so far since its announcement in 2023, though we know from a job listing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eas-black-panther-appears-to-be-an-open-world-sandbox-based-on-job-posting">it was to be a single-player, action-adventure, open-world game</a>. Black Panther was being developed by the newly-formed, now-closed Cliffhanger Games, which was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-ea-studio-dedicated-to-open-world-action-adventure-will-be-led-by-former-monolith-studio-head">formed in 2023</a> with some former developers of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-from-some-of-the-developers-behind-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">headed up by Kevin Stephens</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cuts come on the heels of multiple other rounds of layoffs and cancelations at EA over the last few years and especially in 2025. Just last month, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn">laid off roughly 300 individuals</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted">around 100 at Respawn, while canceling an in-development Titanfall game and another incubation project</a>. Earlier this year, EA restructured BioWare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">moving some developers to other projects</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">laying off others</a>. In 2024, there was a massive restructuring at EA that resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">670 workers</a> laid off company-wide, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-hit-by-layoffs-amid-eas-ongoing-reductions">around two dozen workers at Respawn.</a> And in 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">50 jobs were cut at BioWare</a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs">unknown number were cut at Codemasters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, EA recently implemented <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">mandatory return-to-office for all workers,</a> a move that some employees told IGN has left many currently remote workers with concerns about what will happen to their roles long-term.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked for comment on the exact number impacted, the reasons for these repeated cuts, or if more cuts are expected in the near future, EA referred IGN back to Miele's email.

                <p>Microsoft announced today that it is rolling out a beta version of Copilot for Gaming to mobile platforms. Testers on iOS and Android can now try out Microsoft's first attempt at integrating an AI assistant with its Xbox platform.</p><p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/28/copilot-gaming-test-xbox-android-ios/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Microsoft shared that users of the beta version of the Xbox app for mobile can now try out Copilot for Gaming's chatbot functionality. The AI assistant is designed to link into your Xbox account and be able to answer questions about your Xbox history, current gameplay, games in general, and other topics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4502812-wire-article-flat-1430x800-1-1a8597dc612fc468b83f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502812" data-ratio="0.559375" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4502812-wire-article-flat-1430x800-1-1a8597dc612fc468b83f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502812"></a><figcaption>Copilot for Gaming is now in beta on the Xbox mobile app (via Microsoft).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4502812-wire-article-flat-1430x800-1-1a8597dc612fc468b83f.jpg"></figure><p>Microsoft suggests that Copilot will be able to answer particularly specific or context-sensitive questions, such as advice on certain encounters in games, guidance on improving your Gamerscore, or particularly rare Achievements in certain games. Right now, Copilot incorporates your Xbox profile with information gathered from Bing searches, but Microsoft says that deeper personalization is in development. It's currently unclear exactly how often and in what way Copilot will be gathering information from profiles, and Microsoft has yet to explain how its answers might cite sources that it crawls while searching Bing. Finally, while Copilot is currently reactive--it waits for you to ask it something--Microsoft also states that <em>proactive </em>guidance for in-game activity is in the works.</p><p>The Copilot for Gaming beta is available in <a href="https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/05/Full-Region-List-for-Copilot-for-Gaming-Beta-Early-Testing-on-Mobile-Devices.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a bunch of countries</a> (including the US and Canada), but it has yet to launch in the UK and Europe. The company is working on bringing it to more regions in the future.</p><p>Microsoft has been quite active in announcing AI functionality coming to games. Earlier in May, for instance, it shared its plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-putting-its-copilot-ai-into-games-like-minecraft/1100-6523588/" data-ref-id="1100-6523588">integrating Copilot directly into Minecraft</a>. The tech giant has also increasingly proposed using AI to generate game content, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-carmack-defends-microsofts-ai-generated-quake-ii-level/1100-6530678/" data-ref-id="1100-6530678">its creation of a Quake II level using an AI model</a>.</p>

                <p>A new first-person, open-world RPG is climbing the Steam charts, and it may be a good choice for those who have already blasted through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">Oblivion Remastered</a> and are looking to continue scratching that Skyrim itch.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon/" data-ref-id="5000-522553">Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon</a> is $45 and fully released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466060/Tainted_Grail_The_Fall_of_Avalon/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on May 23, having been in early access since 2023. It looks to have found an audience on Steam in particular, where as of writing it's the number three best-selling game and is only a few spots below Oblivion Remastered on the most-played charts. It also sports "Very positive" reviews on the platform.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hDQNtPceEQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3hDQNtPceEQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Heavily influenced by first-person RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-like-skyrim/2900-5554/" data-ref-id="2900-5554">games like Skyrim</a> and Oblivion, Tainted Grail takes place in a dark fantasy world inspired by Arthurian legend. It features branching storylines and morally ambiguous choices where players will shape the future of King Arthur's now ruined kingdom, according to the game's Steam page.</p><p dir="ltr">Those looking for a massive open-world RPG to sink their teeth into will find plenty to do here, as the game's Steam page states Tainted Grail is 50-70 hours long and features over 200 side quests, spread out across the game's three distinct zones. When it comes to combat and character creation, players can freely swap between melee weapons, shields, magic, and throwable items.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Questline, a studio of about 50 people, makes clear that players can create various archetypes ranging from a "blacksmith-mage summoning undead hordes" to a "stealthy archer lurking in the shadows." Just like in The Elder Scrolls, there is also crafting in the form of blacksmithing, alchemy, and cooking, as well as farming, journaling, fishing, and more. Also like Like in Elder Scrolls, Tainted Grail can technically be played in third-person, but was built for first-person in mind. Questline called the third-person option "playable but far from perfect."</p><p dir="ltr">The developer has already outlined some of the updates players can expect following the game's launch, including bug fixes, mod support, and additional content. It's also working to improve the game's performance on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-steam-deck-games-to-play-right-now/2900-4083/" data-ref-id="2900-4083">Steam Deck</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For those curious whether Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon could be their next life-consuming RPG, a free demo is available on both Steam and consoles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games.1201044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Almost two years ago, at the time of writing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/">EA and Cliffhanger Games confirmed</a> that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-open-world-game-rumor-ea-studio-shadow-of-morder-vets/">rumors</a> of a new Black Panther game coming from EA were true, and that the team at Cliffhanger was working on a new single-player, third-person action game with Black Panther as the main character.</p>
<p>Today, a new report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">IGN</a> revealed that EA has <strong>canceled</strong> its Black Panther game and shut down the studio working on it, Cliffhanger Games. It's the latest batch of layoffs from Electronic Arts after the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">laid off 300-400 developers last month</a> and canceled an incubation project at Respawn. It also recently announced that it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/">sunsetting its remote work policies</a> and moving to push employees back to working in the office.</p>
<p>According to the report, the layoffs extend to members of EA's mobile and central teams, but the company would not share exactly how many developers were impacted. In an email from Laura Miele, EA Entertainment president, she reportedly called the decision, and the other recent layoffs that EA has suffered, "<em>hard</em>" choices, but that they are choices being made to "<em>sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities.</em>"</p>
<p>Miele also wrote that the company is doing "<em>everything we can to support them, including finding opportunities within EA, where we've had success helping people land in new roles</em>." She also continues to say that moving forward, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">EA's Entertainment division</a> will focus on: The Sims, Skate, Battlefield, and Apex Legends.</p>
<p>Respawn will still work on the upcoming third installment in the Star Wars Jedi series, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-game-will-be-written-by-squirrel-girl-writer-ryan-north/">Iron Man game from Motive Studio</a> is still happening, though with this cancellation, it's worth not putting too much stock in Miele's reassurances about the Iron Man game, especially when considering what EA's chief executive officer, Andrew Wilson, said last year about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">EA moving away from games based on licensed IP</a>.</p>
<p>It's upsetting to see more developers lose their jobs, and an additional sad point with Cliffhanger Games's closure is that it's the latest part of the tragedy of Monolith Studios. Cliffhanger was founded by former Monolith developers who worked on the Shadow of Mordor games, and helped develop the nemesis system that players still rave about today. Now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith is gone</a>, and the studio founded by Monolith veterans is also gone.</p>

Here’s hoping they come back around often and not just during seasonal events. At the time of publication, the Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is not actively available. We expect strategies against this monster to be very similar, however, should specific Event Quests return.</p><h2 id="h26702"><a id=""></a>Arch-Tempered Rey Dau’s Weaknesses</h2><figure id="" data-id="e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-recommend-id="image://e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy page for Rey Dau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy page for Rey Dau." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-recommend-id="image://e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy page for Rey Dau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is more intense than its weaker variants, the general faults are the same.

An important distinction is that bringing weapons with an ice element as well as armor with high thunder resistance is more of a requirement than a recommendation this time around. We’ll want to end this as soon as possible, especially with the beast’s abundant health and higher resistance to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-wounds-hunter-mode-solo-co-op-1851771276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-wounds-hunter-mode-solo-co-op-1851771276">wounds</a></span>.</p><p>Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is also far more aggressive than its Tempered variant, attacking more frequently and stringing together many of its moves. It’s a common occurrence to be hit by one attack and then by another while trying to get up. Remember to call your Seikret for a quick pick-up before you get sent back to camp! Your Seikret is the perfect asset that shouldn’t be overlooked during intense hunts like these. Taking a break from the action to heal up is a lot better than doing so within Rey Dau’s proximity.</p><p>What might be the most notable difference is that many of this monster’s attacks will attract lightning strikes. These increase the likelihood of being stunned and make it more difficult to get some hits in. Hunters who enjoy using weapons with counterattacks will need to keep their guard up a bit longer. A successful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743">Offset Attack</a></span> works fine, but other counters will usually be interrupted and leave you defenseless for a more damaging attack. Bringing gear with the Evade Extender skill can be a big help for dodging the lightning as well.</p><p><strong>If you need a break from these aftershocks, destroying the blue Fulgurite crystals along its wings and tail will disable them for around three minutes.</strong> It’s not a permanent solution as the crystals will come back, and you’ll be dealing less damage by not focusing on the head, but this is an ideal tactic if you’re having trouble with these follow-ups.</p><p>Not counting the extra lightning, Arch-Tempered Rey Dau does come with a brand-new move. Standing too close can trigger it to shoot lightning directly beneath it. This is an important attack to be mindful of, since Rey Dau’s underside is a safe spot in previous hunts. Being hit by this will leave you open for a potential follow-up charged beam that can faint you. My advice is to dodge out of the way as soon as you notice it charging up and looking down. You’ll likely have a second at most to react.</p><p>Destroying tempered wounds is still a fantastic way to knock your target down. Coming at odds with this is Arch-Tempered Rey Dau’s high wound resistance. Besides a weak spot that appears after performing its strongest charged beam, there aren’t many opportunities to land a focus strike and some nice damage. Knocking Rey Dau down will mostly require <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">mounting</a></span>, traps (pitfall and vine traps specifically), and the occasional Flash Pod when it’s flying in the air.</p><p>There isn’t much more to the fight than chasing after it to new locations. The electric wyvern is basically enraged the entire fight, so it’s purely a matter of survival. Always prioritize your health to best avoid any one-hit KOs. If you’ve been carted once or twice already, remember that capturing the monster is an option. No shame in finishing this hunt early.</p><h2 id="h26704"><a id=""></a>Arch-Tempered Rey Dau’s Exclusive Rewards</h2><figure id="" data-id="4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-recommend-id="image://4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The post-hunt rewards screen for A Silent Flash, highlighting a Rey Dau Certificate Y." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The post-hunt rewards screen for A Silent Flash, highlighting a Rey Dau Certificate Y." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-recommend-id="image://4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The post-hunt rewards screen for A Silent Flash, highlighting a Rey Dau Certificate Y." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of the rewards and drops you receive will be the same as the Tempered version. <strong>The biggest difference for Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is that instead of receiving </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176"><strong>Hunter Symbol III</strong></a></span><strong>, you’ll receive the new Rey Dau Certificate Y material.</strong> This is needed to forge the new Rey Dau Gamma armor for your hunter and Palico, as well as upgrade to the new Defense Charm V and Power Charm III talismans.

                <p>Electronic Arts has confirmed it's cancelling its upcoming Black Panther game and closing its developer. Cliffhanger Games, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-with-marvel/1100-6515782/" data-ref-id="1100-6515782">only opened in 2023 to make the Black Panther game</a>, is now shuttered. EA previously signed a deal with Marvel for multiple games, and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iron-man-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531545/" data-ref-id="1100-6531545">Iron Man title</a> is still coming.</p><p>EA boss Laura Miele said in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-studios" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memo obtained by IGN</a> that the company is cancelling the game and closing the studio to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4502908-eabp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502908" data-ratio="0.55793450881612" data-width="1588" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4502908-eabp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502908"></a><figcaption>EA's Black Panther game is not going forward.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4502908-eabp.jpg"></figure><p>Additionally, EA is laying off staff on its mobile and "central" teams, though the exact number of affected staff is unknown. This follows on from a previous round of layoffs in April that affected around 300 people and led to the reported <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/" data-ref-id="1100-6531200">cancellation of a Titanfall game</a>.</p><p>"These decisions are hard," Miele said in a memo to staff. "They affect people we've worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them-- including finding opportunities within EA, where we've had success helping people land in new roles."</p><p>In 2024, EA laid off nearly 700 people and said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-laying-off-around-670-people-sunsetting-unspecified-games/1100-6521460/" data-ref-id="1100-6521460">wasn't sure how much more it would invest in licensed IP going forward</a>. Due to this commentary, some wondered if any of EA's Marvel projects would be affected. EA previously signed a multi-game deal with Marvel, and now, the only confirmed project from that partnership is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iron-man-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531545/" data-ref-id="1100-6531545">new Iron Man game from Motive Studio.</a> When the deal was announced, EA said it covered <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/ea-marvel-entertainment-multi-title-collaboration" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">at least three games.</a></p><p>Cliffhanger was led by Kevin Stephens, who oversaw the production of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Middle-earth: Shadow of War at Monolith Productions. He joined EA in 2021. Other members of the team at Cliffhanger worked on Halo, God of War, and Call of Duty.</p><p>It is unknown how far along in development the Black Panther game was. When the game and the studio were announced in 2023, EA said the game was "still in early development with a long road ahead." EA and Cliffhanger were attempting to make what they said was a "definitive and authentic Black Panther experience."</p><p>Outside of EA's superhero games, Warner Bros. was making a Wonder Woman game based on the iconic DC character, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-wonder-woman-legend-was-working-on-canceled-game-offers-heartfelt-tribute/1100-6529718/" data-ref-id="1100-6529718">that game was also canceled.</a></p><p>Going forward, Miele said that EA would focus on Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends, while development will continue on Iron Man and the next Star Wars: Jedi game. EA's mobile game projects remain intact, while BioWare continues to make the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">next Mass Effect</a> as well. And of course, EA's sports catalog will continue as well, including EA Sports FC, Madden, College Football, and NHL.</p><p>Despite all of EA's recent layoffs and closures, the company's headcount continues to grow. As of March 2025, EA had <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 800 additional people on staff</a> than it did the same time a year prior.</p><p>EA is making these dramatic cuts and closures as the company rakes in money. For the last three months alone, EA pulled in <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$1.9 billion in revenue and made a profit of $254 million</a>. For the latest fiscal year, however, EA's revenue slid from $7.562 billion to $7.463 billion, with net profit falling from $1.273 billion to $1.121 billion. </p>

As it is in our world, there are tons of skills that every sim can hypothetically learn over the course of their lives, and every new expansion adds a small pile of new ones. It can be a lot to keep track of; even folks who've been playing The Sims 4 since launch have probably forgotten about some of these. There are more than four dozen skills that adult sims are able to learn at this point, and that's not even counting the many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-sims-4-mods/2900-5275/" data-ref-id="2900-5275">Sims 4 mods</a> that add more.</p><p dir="ltr">Every skill in The Sims 4 has related activities that you can do to learn them, but there are also universal methods. There are several aspiration rewards you can take that will make your sim gain skills faster--Night Owl and Morning Sim will increase your skill gains at night and in the morning, respectively, and Savant will give you a 25% boost to all skill gains permanently.</p><p dir="ltr">Every skill also has corresponding skill books you can read to jumpstart your skill gains, though you won't be able to max out any skill just by reading about it--learning theory will only take you so far. Likewise, you can learn skills by taking college classes, or by using a research terminal at a library. But eventually you'll have to practice for real.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4502904-thesims4skillsgardening.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502904" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4502904-thesims4skillsgardening.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502904"></a><figcaption>Gardening is one of the dozens of skills your sims can learn in The Sims 4.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4502904-thesims4skillsgardening.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And that's why we're making this list. Below you'll find every single skill in The Sims 4, from vanilla through the most recent expansion, Businesses &amp; Hobbies, along with the unique activities you can do to improve them and the emotional state that's best for each.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a

			<p>The Lonesome Guild is a colorful action RPG where you play as a Ghost trying to bring six animal misfits together to try and save the world from a corrupting mist, and it just got a new gameplay trailer as part of the <a href="https://www.actugaming.net/ag-french-direct/?mc_cid=0f1b47ab9d&amp;mc_eid=22f0f6c8d6">AG French Direct 2025</a> event.</p>
<p>While the animals you bring together start off as lonely, they don't end up that way as you build relationships with them and work to recover the memories you lost from your life, now that you're squarely in the afterlife as a ghost.</p>
<p>Fittingly, The Lonesome Guild is all about "<em>fighting</em> <em>loneliness</em>," and the trailer showcases how you and your animal companions work together to use the power of the new friendships you're forging to fight against the large robotic contraptions you'll face on your journey through Etere.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Lonesome Guild | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8AHqZlR2vQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If anything about The Lonesome Guild seems like it would be your kind of game, you can test that theory by playing the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1486450/The_Lonesome_Guild/">demo</a> that publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Don't Nod</a> and developer Tiny Bull Studios just released. Though the full game will release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, the demo is only available on PC for now. It's also currently set to arrive on all platforms sometime in Fall 2025, but there's no specific release date as of yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/does-the-new-playstation-vr2-deal-finally-make-it-worth-buying<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">PSVR 2 is back down to its all-time low price.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The PlayStation VR2 headset has dropped to match its all-time low price thanks to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-days-of-play-sale-2025-live">PlayStation Days of Play sale</a>, so if you've been considering picking one up for yourself, right now would be the time to do so. But the question is: Should you actually buy one in 2025? The PSVR2 originally launched for a whopping $599, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-psvr2-headset-price-cut-deal-is-now-live">Sony dropped the price</a> down to just $399 back in March. The latest discount brings that price all the way down to only $349 for both the stand-alone headset and the Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The PlayStation VR2 Headset Is On Sale at Amazon Today</h2><div catalogid="f4357a55-1b57-400c-ac5d-2dc92766936f" id="221877"><div id="221877" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PSVR 2: Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The new $50 discount on the PSVR2 bundle is certainly tempting if you've been wanting to get into VR, but there are a few things to consider before you buy. This is likely the lowest price we'll see on this headset for quite some time and it is the only VR option for PS5 owners. If you want to play Horizon Call of The Mountain, owning a PSVR2 is currently the only way you'll be able to do that. Just last year Sony also released the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-review">PSVR2 PC adapter</a> that allows you to connect it to your PC and play VR games there as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-cuts-investment-in-vr-development-only-two-first-party-vr-games-currently-in-development-report">Sony isn't really investing </a>much into first-party VR games anymore. And with the price drop back in March and the release of the PC adapter, it definitely seems like PS5 owners aren't going to be seeing a slew of new and exciting VR games any time soon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is It Worth Buying a PSVR 2 in 2025?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that the PSVR 2 is cheaper than the standard Meta Quest 3 <em>and</em> has PC compatibility, it's worth considering if you're looking to get into VR. Since it is really the only VR option for PlayStation, this price definitely makes it worth it if you have both a PS5 and a PC that can handle VR games. You do have to purchase the PC adapter if you want to access your SteamVR library, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-connect-ps-vr2-headset-to-a-pc">connecting to PC is a fairly simple process</a> overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't own a PS5 and are just looking for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-vr-headsets-for-pc">decent VR headset for PC</a>, the PSVR 2 probably isn't worth your money. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a> is still cheaper and doesn't require any sort of extra adapter to start playing games. Since the PSVR 2 isn't a standalone VR headset, you'd also be better off going with the Quest 3 if you don't have either a PS5 or a PC to connect to.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 28, 2025 5:55 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It may be tough to believe, but The Sims 4 was out for four entire years without seasons, weather, or holidays. That changed, finally, when the Seasons expansion pack dropped in 2018--and it's been considered the single-most essential expansion for The Sims 4 since. If you're just diving into the worlds of The Sims 4, Seasons is the first pack you need to buy.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's not the most feature-packed expansion in terms of how much stuff there is to do in it, Seasons makes two fundamental additions to the world that we can't imagine living without: dynamic weather, with each world having its own unique climate; and holidays, including the ability to make your own. Let's look closer at the weather first.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Basic_Sims_4_weather_tips">Basic Sims 4 weather tips</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_change_the_weather_in_The_Sims_4">How to change the weather in The Sims 4</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_use_cheats_and_mods_with_Sims_4_weather">How to use cheats and mods with Sims 4 weather</a></li><li><a href="#Sims_4_Worlds_and_Climates">Sims 4 Worlds and Climates</a><ul><li><a href="#Willow_Creek">Willow Creek</a></li><li><a href="#Oasis_Springs">Oasis Springs</a></li><li><a href="#Newcrest">Newcrest</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Magnolia_Promenade">Magnolia Promenade</a></li><li><a href="#Windenberg">Windenberg</a><ul><li><a href="#San_Myshuno">San Myshuno</a></li><li><a href="#Forgotten_Hollow">Forgotten Hollow</a></li><li><a href="#Brindleton_Bay">Brindleton Bay</a></li><li><a href="#Del_Sol_Valley">Del Sol Valley</a></li><li><a href="#StrangerVille">StrangerVille</a></li><li><a href="#Sulani">Sulani</a></li><li><a href="#Glimmerbrook">Glimmerbrook</a></li><li><a href="#Britechester">Britechester</a></li><li><a href="#Evergreen_Harbor">Evergreen Harbor</a></li><li><a href="#Mt__Komorebi">Mt.

Extreme hot or cold can kill your sims--they can freeze to death if they don't wear a coat during a blizzard, or they can overheat themselves by exercising too much or hanging out near a fire when it's really hot (I've literally had a sim die because the fireplace was lit in their house during a heat wave). Likewise, if they spend too much time outside during a storm they might get struck by lightning. So be careful.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond dressing and behaving appropriately for the weather, there are lifetime aspiration reward perks you can unlock that will help your sims deal with these effects. There are acclimation perks for hot and cold weather (500 points each) that will allow your sim to feel the effects of the extreme temperatures without being in danger from them, and you can take things all the way with the Heatproof and Iceproof perks (2000 points each) to avoid the issue entirely. The Storm Chaser perk (1000 points), which makes a sim enjoy thunderstorms rather than be scared of them, will actually make your sim more likely to be struck by lightning, but it will simply make them energized when it happens instead of causing any harm.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4502870-sims4weatherstorms.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502870" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4502870-sims4weatherstorms.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502870"></a><figcaption>The addition of weather in The Sims 4: Season is a literally game-changer.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4502870-sims4weatherstorms.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_change_the_weather_in_The_Sims_4">How to change the weather in The Sims 4</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, you are not at all at the game's mercy when it comes to weather, as you can change the local weather whenever you want using Dr. June's Weather Control Device, which you can buy for 1500 simoleons in build mode. Once it's placed in your home, just click the device and pick the weather you want.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_use_cheats_and_mods_with_Sims_4_weather">How to use cheats and mods with Sims 4 weather</h2><p dir="ltr">In a rather unusual twist, there aren't any working weather-related cheats in The Sims 4--there used to be console commands, but they don't work anymore for some reason. But if you're playing The Sims 4 on PC, you can use a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-sims-4-mods/2900-5275/">Sims 4 mod</a> to restore those cheats. Fortunately, it's a mod you may already have, the immensely popular <a href="https://deaderpool-mccc.com/" rel="nofollow ">MC Command Center</a>, which adds several utilities for granularly controlling your game world. Once you've installed the mod and have it running, you can click on any mailbox, select the MC Cheats option to open the MCCC menu, then select Seasons for all your weather-related choices.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Sims_4_Worlds_and_Climates">Sims 4 Worlds and Climates</h2><p dir="ltr">Just as on the real Earth, each region in The Sims 4 has its own climate and range of temperatures--some places are hot, some places are cold, and some places get the full spectrum of weather.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tales-of-valiant-players-guide-2-graces-kickstarter-today<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kobold Press has launched a new crowdfunding campaign for <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>. The aptly named <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 campaign introduces expanded player options for the studio's fantasy TTRPG, including new subclasses and spells.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deepmagic/players-guide-2-new-power-for-5e-and-tov-players/description" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter page</a>, <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 offers players more customization options for their characters. This includes over 40 subclasses for pre-existing classes alongside three new classes: the Vanguard, Witch, and Theurge. Since <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> uses the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 5e <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-updated-dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-at-end-of-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SRD</a>, that means all material in the book is also compatible with Wizards of the Coast's TTRPG.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-valiant-players-guide-2-vanguard-promo-screenshot.jpg?itok=5Ku8J7Eu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-valiant-players-guide-2-vanguard-promo-screenshot.jpg?itok=P5tBqj08 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some of these new player options are available in a free-to-download preview PDF. This preview showcases the Vanguard, which can be described as a support martial character. They can deploy banners and use stratagems to protect and aid their allies. An example stratagem is Close Ranks, which makes your group immune to critical hits and from being forcibly moved for a turn.</p>

<p><em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 is a 250+ page supplement that includes the three new classes, 48 subclasses, 150 new spells, a magical tattoo system, rules on new downtime activities, customizable base-building rules, and new vehicle upgrades. Additionally, the campaign features a 32-page character journal, custom dice bags and luck tokens, and VTT support for Shard, Fantasy Grounds, Foundry, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/alchemy-rpg-kickstarter-fully-funded-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy</a>.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for Tales of the Valiant Player's Guide 2 are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Player's Guide 2 PDF for $29:</strong> A PDF of Player's Guide 2</li>
	<li><strong>Player's Guide 2 Hardcover and PDF for $59:</strong> PDF and physical copy of Player's Guide 2</li>
	<li><strong>All Digital: PDF + Choice of VTT for $69:</strong> PDF and your choice of VTT license for Shard, Fantasy Grounds, Foundry, or Alchemy</li>
	<li><strong>Limited Edition Hardcover, PDF &amp; Journal for $129:</strong> A limited edition physical copy and PDF of Player's Guide 2 and three physical character journals</li>
</ul><p>The campaign for <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 addresses the concern of US <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a>. As mentioned earlier, books are exempt from the tariffs; however, Kobold Press has fallback printers in the EU and Canada in case this situation changes.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;$132,955, almost triple its initial funding goal of $50,000. the campaign ends June 27.</p>

And in <em>Last Epoch</em>, it can take a player anywhere from 25 to 50 hours to fully delve into all of the game’s mechanics and reach the endgame. For that journey, you’re likely to stick with a single class instead of swapping between characters. For Season Two—Tombs of the Erased—I decided to forego my usual spellcaster for something different, the Sentinel. I’m not disappointed in the least bit.

With its hard-hitting melee abilities, high defense, health regeneration, and the strength to wield two-handed weapons with immense power, the Sentinel is a top choice for new and returning players alike who want to slaughter mobs with reckless abandon.</p><p>Some of the base skills you’ll want to prioritize as a Sentinel include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Lunge</strong>: “<em>Dash to a nearby enemy and strike it with your weapon.</em>” This is an excellent skill to close the distance with a single target or, more often than not, mobs to sweep up with Warpath.</li><li><strong>Warpath</strong>: “<em>Spin towards the mouse while you hold down the ability key, striking nearby enemies as you move.</em>” With the right weapon and passive points invested, you can clear entire mobs without wasting mana or taking damage.</li><li><strong>Rive</strong>: “<em>Every third consecutive attack with Rive slashes in a full circle around the character, lacerating enemies it hits.</em>” I like to wield Rive as a main ability, especially with bleed capabilities from its passive tree, to help tackle tougher enemies, like elites and bosses.</li></ul><h2 id="h741966"><a id="2"></a>Void Knight Master Class will see you through endgame</h2><figure id="" data-id="b5f2f8e5bf15a2d5f298e60e261a8b2b" data-recommend-id="image://b5f2f8e5bf15a2d5f298e60e261a8b2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mastery Classes for the Sentinel class in Last Epoch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mastery Classes for the Sentinel class in Last Epoch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Eleventh Hour Games / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b5f2f8e5bf15a2d5f298e60e261a8b2b" data-recommend-id="image://b5f2f8e5bf15a2d5f298e60e261a8b2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mastery Classes for the Sentinel class in Last Epoch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The combination of Strength and Vitality allows the Void Knight to go toe-to-toe with nearly any enemy in the game, with few exceptions—so long as you place your passive points properly. Investing in additional damage dealt, more health, health regeneration, and armor will create a tank with few weaknesses. Pair the Mastery Class’ innate abilities with the time-warping skills, allowing you to send enemies back and forth through the void, and you have a class capable of clearing zones, destroying bosses, and rushing endgame.</p><p>As for Void Knight-specific abilities, focus on:</p><p><strong>Devouring Orb</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>“<em>Creates a devouring orb at the target location that casts a void rift whenever something dies nearby, dealing void damage to enemies nearby the orb. Each successive rift has 12-percent increased damage and area of effect, capped at an increase of 100-percent.</em>”</li></ul><p><strong>Volatile Reversal</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>“<em>Returns you to the position you were at two seconds ago, reverting changes to your current health and mana since then</em>.”</li></ul><p><strong>Abyssal Echoes</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>“<em>A nova that echoes from enemies it hits and applies Abyssal Decay. Enemies with Abyssal Decay take Void Damage over time for 6 seconds, if they take a hit, all the damage from Abyssal Decay is dealt to them immediately.</em>”</li></ul><p><strong>Erasing Strike</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>“<em>A melee attack that hits all enemies in a large area in front of you. Enemies killed by the hit are erased from existence, replaced by void rifts</em>.”</li></ul><hr><p><em>Last Epoch</em> Season 2 is on now, with players rushing the endgame already, on Windows PCs.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Along the way, there’s the most astonishingly intricate storyline, a vast cast of bonkers characters, and a kerjillion (I counted) items to craft.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>OK, so not much about the above perhaps sounds fantastically original, and sure, I get that. But what makes <em>Crashlands</em> and its recent sequel stand out from the crowd is that it plays like an action-RPG. Combat is very lively, all about getting in a hit, dashing and rolling, throwing in a bomb, mixing up ranged and melee combat, and all from a comfortable isometric view.</p><p>Each enemy type, of which there are approximately infinity, requires a unique tactic, often with two or three of them getting mixed up in a brawl at the same time. That latter situation is the best, because they all want to fight each other as much as they want to kill you, so luring them toward each other can create a splendid showdown, with you lobbing in explosives from the sidelines. There’s rarely a moment when you aren’t whacking at something, whether it’s rocks, plants or vicious creatures, usually while running to your next quest or destination.</p><p>I really encourage you to play both games, but I’m focusing on <em>Crashlands 2</em> today because it came out just last month, and it’s occupied so many of my evenings and spare moments that it just feels silly not to share that with you. It’s one of those games I’m playing purely for pleasure, looking forward to after a busy day of playing other games, and not even thinking about how I could turn it into work (even though I now accidentally have). I’ve accidentally stayed up far too late far too many nights over the last couple of weeks, thinking I’ll just get another couple of quests ticked off, get the ingredients for the next dagger upgrade, and see about clearing out that one robot base, and then discovering it’s somehow&nbsp;2 a.m. and I have the school run in the morning.</p><p>You play as Flux Dabes, an intergalactic trucker who has been screwed over by her corporation, and finds herself (in both games) dumped on an alien planet—Woanope—without the means to leave. She’s once again accompanied by Juicebox, a floating, um, robotic juice carton, who provides color commentary and endless wry remarks, and the two become intricately involved in the lives of the local intelligent lifeforms and their battle against the same corporation you’ve recently quit.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-recommend-id="image://4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux Dabes runs up a purple and orange path, surrounded by dark violet water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flux Dabes runs up a purple and orange path, surrounded by dark violet water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-recommend-id="image://4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux Dabes runs up a purple and orange path, surrounded by dark violet water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What’s more extraordinary than anything else about these games is their <em>size</em>. They are so, <em>so</em> big. As you play, your explorable area endlessly grows, gated by the strength of more distant enemies and occasionally by the need to develop means of traveling that you’ve yet to craft. In <em>Crashlands 2</em>, you also build a little home for yourself and your inventive companions packed with research benches for them to work at, where they tirelessly dream up new devices, weapons, nets, bombs, fertilizers, staffs, fishing rods, helmets, wall types, baits, armors, and pieces of decor for you to craft from the billions of items that drop when you hit stuff. Plentiful teleporters mean the ever-growing scale doesn’t become too daunting, and the constant sense of progress is unrelentingly rewarding.</p><p>I really cannot express to you how large this game is. I remember in 2016's <em>Crashlands</em>, thinking I was about to end the game, before discovering I had only explored one landscape out of two. Something similar happened in the sequel, when after a packed 15 hours or so of playing I was wrapping up the storyline, defeating a tougher boss, and thinking I was about to roll credits, only to discover it was teasing me, I wasn’t even halfway. And, crucially, I was delighted! I wasn’t ready for it to be over.</p><figure id="" data-id="9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-recommend-id="image://9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is surrounded by green noxious fumes, while slapping a floaty creature." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flux is surrounded by green noxious fumes, while slapping a floaty creature." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-recommend-id="image://9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is surrounded by green noxious fumes, while slapping a floaty creature." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I think a large part of why I didn’t want it to be done, even though I’d gone through a satisfying arc that’d be easily worth the entry fee, is because of the game’s constant positive feedback loop. You’re <em>always </em>progressing, always ticking off something from one of its many lists, and each time experiencing a meaningful difference. Beefing up your knuckles weapon, and then equipping it with a bunch of trinkets and buffs that complement it, means thwacking a tricky enemy is going to be much easier. Boosting your HP with new armor makes you feel so much tougher. Crafting a new workbench suddenly opens up your opportunities in multiple directions.  More means more fantastically animated enemy types, more silly story, more quests to complete, more locations to uncover, more boxes to tick and items to craft and progress progress progress.</p><p>Flaws? Well, weirdly—given how much love is poured into it—I would say the writing. It’s really good! It’s just that there’s far too much of it. Conversations to get a new quest can end up going on for 20, 30 exchanges of speech-bubble text, and while it’s all superbly written and often very funny, I find myself frustrated by just wanting to know what I’m supposed to be doing next. I have, I confess, committed the cardinal sin of clicking through it all and then just checking the quest log. I don’t want to! But honestly, <em>Crashlands 2 </em>is so  wildly overwritten. It needed a detached, heartless editor to cut swathes from it, keep the great gags, and get to the point. </p><p>But&nbsp;when that’s my major complaint about such a detailed and expansive game, you know it must be doing an awful lot right. And all of this in a paid-for game that has no in-app purchases or extra fees. These games could be monetized to utter misery, and instead they don’t even dip a toe in that mire.</p><figure id="" data-id="66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-recommend-id="image://66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is chatting with some locals in a building, stood around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flux is chatting with some locals in a building, stood around a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-recommend-id="image://66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is chatting with some locals in a building, stood around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This does make <em>Crashlands 2</em> that most unusual of games: a mobile app that costs money up front. There’s a PC version too, and it’s splendid, but it’s pricier at $25. (And totally worth it. There’s at least 35 hours of game here!) The iOS/Android version is $10, despite being the same game, and while that discrepancy always feels odd, it’s important to note that mobile prices <em>are</em> just a different market: choosing to charge customers at the point of purchase, rather than exploit them ever-after, can be devastating for attention. As such, rather than the million-plus downloads a game like this would get if it were “free-to-play,” it currently sports “5K+” downloads on Android. I really want to express how this is worth every penny, for me one of the most essential games on my tablet, and how important it is to support excellent games that use non-exploitative payments.</p><p>I really don’t know why this isn’t on Xbox or PS5. It’d be the perfect couch game, absorbing your late evening hours, perfectly paired with a light-hearted podcast. But it still sits so well on my Android tablet, one of those games (like the very different <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/faheys-top-10-games-of-2015-1749761792&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/faheys-top-10-games-of-2015-1749761792"><em>Gems of War</em></a></span>) that makes the device feel worth owning. <em>Crashlands 2</em> is such a treat, no matter which device you play it on, a game that feels so endlessly generous and involved.</p><p><em>Crashlands 2</em> is on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401730/Crashlands_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401730/Crashlands_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crashlands-2/id1528199331&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crashlands-2/id1528199331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bscotch.crashlands2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bscotch.crashlands2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a></span>, created by the unimprovably named small indie team Butterscotch Shenanigans.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-of-atlan-launches-may-28-and-shakes-up-mmorpg-combat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Crystal of Atlan is an action MMORPG from developer VI-Games that wants to put its own unique spin on the gameplay of the genre. It features a focus on class-based build diversity, fast-paced aerial combat, and chaining together abilities to build up your combo meter. It's available to <a href="https://coau.onelink.me/Kb3c/rqg5e02q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">download for free</a> right now, but if you're looking for more info before you dive in, we've got you. Let’s start with the classes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Diverse Class Paths for Personalized Builds</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are five base classes available at launch, all unlocked for free at the start of the game: the melee damage dealing Swordsman, ranged attacker Musketeer, magical Magister, martial artist Fighter, and summoner Puppeteer. Each class branches into specialized subclasses, with a total of 11 subclass options and more than 20 unique abilities to experiment with and tailor to your preferred style.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-1-1747937274930.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the Swordsman branches into the Magiblade or Berserker. They’re both melee damage dealers, but the Magiblade adds magical abilities (which you could probably guess from the name), and the Berserker can sacrifice health to generate shields and increase power as you get closer to death. Regardless of the subclass you choose, each of the skills you unlock have individual cooldowns. You can mix and match those skills at any time, letting you come up with unique character builds and find skills that chain together well to build combos.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-puppeteer-subclass-1747937366873.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Seamless Ground-to-Air Combat Innovation</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditional MMO combat focuses on ground-based attacks with a fairly simple stand-and-attack style. Crystal of Atlan differentiates itself by including a heavy focus on the Z-axis, introducing a system that encourages you to seamlessly transition between ground and aerial combat.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-platforming-1747937405449.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can attack and dodge in mid-air, allowing you to pull off aerial combos and adding a new dimension to each battle and a level of responsiveness to moment-to-moment gameplay. You can jump to avoid attacks, then chain that into aerial combos to keep the pressure on enemies. So you’re rewarded for staying on your toes, reacting quickly, and using all your abilities to fluidly chain attacks together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That focus on ground and air combos also informs the design of Crystal of Atlan’s varied environments. All of the game’s maps, from the fantastical Wonderland to the mechanical Chrome Military Factory, have an open 3D layout to allow freedom of movement. Couple that with smooth animations and you get a combat system that’s fluid and fast-paced.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-2-1747937438520.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Cooperative Challenges and Social Progression</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect from an MMO, there are a variety of dungeons you can tackle with other players. You fight through packs of normal enemies before getting to the end and facing off against a boss with unique mechanics. That’s all pretty standard, but Crystal of Atlan mixes things up by requiring synchronized team coordination.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-3-1747937464007.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There are numerous dungeons with interaction-based mechanics that require teamwork to solve problems. Naturally, if your whole group is tackling such a dungeon for the first time, you’ll need to communicate and help each other figure out what to do. Once you’ve gotten the hang of it, you can take on a mentor role in future runs, but everyone will always need to work together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a fleet system, which is basically like guilds you’ve probably experienced in other games. It’s a key part of Crystal of Atlan's social ecosystem, allowing you to link up with friends to tackle co-op gameplay together or just hang out and chat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Competitive PvP and Creative PvE Challenges</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re the competitive type, there are also options for PvP combat. There are 1v1 and 3v3 battles, with attributes, skill damage, and skill cooldowns balanced so there’s no competitive advantage. It’s all about skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Crystal of Atlan is an MMO at heart, it has plenty of content for solo players too. In classic MMO style, there are hub areas where you can see lots of other players. These areas are where you’ll find quests to complete and new zones to explore.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-magiblade-subclass-1747937517467.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Adventure Mode takes you through the game’s main story, which unlocks in stages. You can tackle these stages solo, and they have a variety of different goals. Some will be focused on combat, where you need to defeat groups of enemies or take on a boss. Others introduce new elements, like requiring you to use stealth to sneak past enemies or use platforming to progress through the area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of other modes you can tackle solo or co-op. The main one is the Arena, where you can fight alone or with a partner and gradually work your way up through tiers of opponents, earning escalating rewards as you do. If you manage to get through all the tiers, you can reach the Finals for the ultimate reward.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-4-1747937545618.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To sum it all up, Crystal of Atlan is an MMORPG that mixes together classic staples of the genre with evolved gameplay to keep things fun, fast, and fluid. It launches May 28 on PC, PS5, iOS, and Android, with crossplay across all platforms. The PS5 version has an optimized HUD layout to avoid clutter and utilizes the haptic feedback of the DualSense controller. It also has a remapped UI for controller input, using a function wheel you’re probably familiar with from other games. There’s HDR support for enhanced lighting, and PSSR is enabled on the PS5 Pro for sharper visuals and more stable frame rates.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/21/crystal-of-atlan-ps5-command-wheel-1747849581064.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For more info on the world, classes, and features of Crystal of Atlan, you can check out <a href="https://coa.nvsgames.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">the official website</a>.
