			<p>We’ve all heard of Pokémon cards. The Pokémon TCG, as it’s officially called, is a longstanding and much-loved trading card game that dates back to my childhood. I spent many hours battling and trading with my school friends, despite teachers quickly deciding they were contraband and enlisting the dinner ladies who patrolled the playground, cruelly trying to part me from my foil Gyarados.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve dabbled with the TCG, trying the different digital offerings that the company puts out. The latest such release is Pokémon TCG Pocket — a stripped-down version of the game available on Apple and Android phones. The question is, is it any good, or is it just another way to part you from your money?</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket: Triumphant Light | Coming February 28!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/urmBeWH0bxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The basic idea of Pocket TCG is that you can open two packs of five Pokémon cards per day for free — or more if you spend money. You slowly build a pool of cards from which you can build decks to battle real or digital opponents, getting XP and completing collection missions along the way.</p>
<p>The battle rules have been simplified, too. You have a 20-card deck instead of 60, while Energy is now automatically generated once per turn, helping keep your deck as slim and streamlined as possible. Finally, you only need to defeat up to three rival Pokémon to secure victory, instead of the usual six.</p>

<p>So far, so good —&nbsp;it’s a Pokémon card gatcha machine that you can play for free, or dump money into if you want to quickly pad out your collection. But is it worth trying to play free-to-play?</p>

<p>I’ve been playing the game since launch, well aware that games like this ultimately come in two flavours: one all flash with no depth. It tastes amazing and the additives get their hooks in you. But what burns hottest burns quickest, and you can’t have too much of it without getting bored.</p>
<p>The second flavour is the tried and tested favourite that you will keep coming back to. There’s less intensity, but a depth and complexity that is actually compelling. It’s the kind of thing you’ll keep coming back to, enjoying it just as much every time you do.</p>
<p>I’m happy to report, after a few months with the game, that playing Pokémon TCG Pocket is like eating a premium scoop of mint choc chip ice cream. Whenever it feels that it’s getting samey, you get a nice chunk of something new and exciting to keep you going.</p>
<p>As with all card games, batches are released in sets and expansions. The first set in the game, Genetic Apex, was split between three different packs for Charizard, Pikachu and Mewtwo respectively, while Space-Time Smackdown added Dialga and Palkia in January. Each has a unique card pool, which means you need to swap back and forth to collect ‘em all.</p>

<p>Every 12 hours, you can open one pack of cards for free. While you may not always get the card you want, you might open a signature card that unlocks a ‘rental’ deck that you can play for free 10 times. Collect three linked Pokémon, say the three Legendary Birds or the same Gardevoir five times, and you’ll win Emblems, Avatars, Shop Tickets and Wonder Hourglasses — the latter of which can net you free cards by Wonder Picking from someone else’s pack.</p>
<p>With enough cards (or a rental deck), you can battle the game’s AI or other real players, winning Pack Hourglasses that will reduce the time needed to open the next new pack of five cards.</p>

<p>The problem is that there are some obvious best decks in the meta — as per all TCGs. However, there’s no guarantee that you will open that Gardevoir for your Mewtwo EX deck, or get the Moltres EX for your Charizard EX deck. This means opening more packs, either relying on dumb luck or saving up Pack Points earned with each opening to try to ‘buy’ the single you need. At 5 points per pack, and 2500 points for the fanciest stuff, you’re going to be opening a lot of packs if you genuinely want to collect ‘em all.</p>
<p>And then there’s the ill-fated trading mechanic — it was so bad that fans at launch demanded the game takes the ‘T’ out of its name.</p>
<p>So, as you can imagine, you could burn money on this game. However, this isn’t at all necessary, and the game is fun to dip in and out of a couple of times per day, even without owning all the most powerful cards.</p>

<p>After downloading the game on a whim, curious to see what the latest offering from the Pokémon TCG looks like, I am pleasantly surprised and still engaged with this game. After an initial flash of excitement with Genetic Apex, this has settled to a slow burn. I still enjoy opening the app a couple of times per day and seeing what I open. If I have 10 minutes to spare, a quick battle against the AI is still fun.</p>
<p>The game clearly wants your money, but it doesn’t hound you for it, and it’s perfectly playable without spending a penny. It won’t keep your attention for hours on end, and that’s fine. As far as slow games go, Pocket TCG is very good. I’m just thankful this doesn’t exist for Magic the Gathering, as I’d be far more ready to part with my money…</p>

            <p>There comes a time in every cat owner's life where they must ask themselves: how large would this creature need to be before it attempted to bat me around like a catnip mouse? I suspect the answer is "only as large as it needed to be", so it's fortunate that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' Palicoes are apparently bred for helpfulness. Is installing a mod to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> that makes them tall as humans a form of gene splicing? Don't worry, hunter. Gene splicing is how nature heals itself.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/35">The mod is called 'Kitty Big'. </a>There isn't much to say about it beyond that. You don't need to continue reading now, so here's a little story for anyone left.</p>
<p>Once, a peaceful and prosperous hamlet was terrorised by a beast that demanded regular sacrifices, lest it drag its lumpen form down from its mountain dwelling and drain the lifeblood from the villagers.</p>
<p>Not just any sacrifice would appease its capricious tastes, however. Some days, it demanded the flesh of storied warriors. Others, humble farm hands. Occasionally, it wanted those little cocktail sticks with pineapple and cheese on, which was bollocks because where do you even find pineapples in this climate?</p>
<p>One day, the people of the hamlet decided they'd had enough of catering to the beast's whims, especially since the one thing the creature was useful for - dispersing snippets of wisdom in response to specific queries and occasionally reverse image searching a nice shirt you didn't know where to buy - had recently been borked by a colony of parasites taken up residence in the monster's brain stem. So they refused to make any more sacrifices. And they all got eaten.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is that sometimes you just have to give Google what it wants. Today, that's the words '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' followed by whatever mildly interesting nugget of disposable information I can dig up between my first and second morning coffee. Nice mod, though. I'll probably use it once I buy the game, which won't be until <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">they've sorted out the performance</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Split Fiction is an intertwining narrative from the creative mind of Josef Fares. It requires you to guide two unique characters from start to finish, but we’re here to see if you can only play the game in co-op or if solo play is permitted.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a> is firmly behind us now. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios has a new game called Split Fiction</a>. We’ve been treated to periodic trailers and footage since its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal at The Game Awards 2024</a>. Anyone familiar with It Takes Two or A Way Out should instantly feel at home with Split Fiction.</p>



<p>It has tons of mini-games and tandem gameplay sections, and requires teamwork to succeed. Many co-op games allow you to play with an AI partner, so let’s see if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> is the same.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-split-fiction-be-played-solo">Can Split Fiction be Played Solo?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A co-op boom is happening. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><strong>Split Fiction cannot be played solo and is a co-op title requiring a human companion.</strong></strong></p>



<p>This is how Josef Fares wants his games to be experienced. It Takes Two was such an emotional gut punch as you felt every story twist alongside a real player. A Way Out was the same, and Split Fiction continues this thematic direction by requiring two real-life players—not AI.</p>



<p>If you don’t believe me, check out the official <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/ea-originals-discussion-en/announcement--faq-split-fiction%E2%84%A2---launching-march-6-2025---pre-order-now/5037251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction FAQ</a>. Under the “Is it possible to play with an AI?” question, the answer states: “<strong>No, this is a co-op-only game uniquely tailored for two friends to play together.</strong>“</p>



<h2 id="h-will-split-fiction-add-solo-play-to-split-fiction">Will Split Fiction Add Solo Play to Split Fiction?</h2>



<p><strong>I think the chances of Split Fiction adding a solo option through a patch are slim-to-none.</strong></p>



<p>Again, Hazelight Studios’ previous work—A Way Out and It Takes Two—didn’t add this option. Given the official stance on solo play, it feels unlikely to be added in Split Fiction either. If you’re a fan of Fares and Hazelight games and want a solo-driven journey, all is not lost.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/02/13/josef-fares-split-fiction-interview-we-will-not-co-op-22554563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Fares said: “We will not only do co-op, we will definitely do other stuff with a Haze-like twist. We want to do something different like a twist… like what we did with the co-op. But co-op is great and, I mean, you can tell great stories and there’s so much to be explored there.”</p>



<p>Who knows where the studio goes once Split Fiction is wrapped up and in the history books.</p>



<hr>



<p>It Takes Two was a bona fide Game of the Year winner. It’s going to take a lot for Split Fiction to replicate its success, but it’s not impossible. Are you picking up Split Fiction as quick as a flash?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-season-delayed-verdansk-return-now-expected-next-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Activision has delayed the rollout of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone Season 3, including the anticipated return of the latter's classic Verdansk map. 
</p>
<p>
Season 3 was previously due to arrive around 20th March. Now, it'll hit two weeks later on 3rd April.
</p>
<p>
"Season 3 is a big moment for Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops 6, and we're taking the time to deliver a great experience starting on 3rd April," Activision wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1896636715143704641">post on social media</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"More to come following Call of Duty: Warzone's fifth anniversary next week..."
</p>
<p>
Verdansk was Call of Duty: Warzone's original map, available when the battle royale's first iteration arrived back in 2020. Now, it's widely-expected to return in time for the game's fifth anniversary.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty is the latest battle royale to lean on nostalgia and bring back a classic map in the hopes of boosting player numbers, following the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.
</p>
<p>
The move to return to a fan-favourite map follows a patchy start to this year's Call of Duty content, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bans-another-136000-cheaters">Activision having to focus time to address player concerns over rampant in-game cheating</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-block-ops-6-players-accuse-activision-of-using-ai-slop">admitting to the use of in-game AI imagery</a>, and selling a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-players-lament-battle-passes-in-between-battle-passes-with-squid-game-event">separate expensive Squid Game battle pass</a>
</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/new-game-in-classic-jrpg-series-suikoden-announced-by-konami<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new role-playing adventure set in the world of Suikoden is on the way, but there is a catch.</p>
<p>It has been many years since we last got a Suikoden. In fact, the last mainline entry was released in February, 2006. So, nearly 20 years ago (seriously, where is time going?!). This makes last night's announcement from Konami rather exciting - a new title in the Suikoden series is on the way, and it looks lovely, with pixel art reminiscent of the original games.</p>
<p>It's known as Suikoden Star Leap, and will take place "a few years before the events of Suikoden 1, but a couple years after Suikoden 5". The upcoming game promises "vibrant" locales to explore and new characters along with familiar faces. But, like I said, there is a catch. You see, this is the "first title to be tailored for mobile", and the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ljj4ymsvzs2m">developer has confirmed it will have gacha elements</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out a trailer for Suikoden Star Leap below (Japanese audio).</p>

<p>We don't have a release date yet for Suikoden Star Leap, with Konami simply stating it will be coming "soon". The team will share more details as part of a future announcement, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>While for now the game is only slated for release on iOS and Android, we know that other gacha games have done well on the likes of PlayStation (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/honkai-star-rail-review-more-than-genshin-impact-in-space">hello there Honkai Star Rail</a>), so perhaps Suikoden Star Leap will one day make its way to consoles.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on Suikoden Star Leap?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Capcom has put the high sales down to the game's broad global appeal, its inclusion in global events (like PlayStation's State of Play and The Game Awards), and holding multiple online beta tests.</p>
<p>"Capcom remains firmly committed to satisfying the expectations of all users by leveraging its industry leading game development capabilities in order to create highly entertaining gameplay experiences," the company said, perhaps alluding to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">poor technical performance of the game</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-warns-incoming-monster-hunter-wilds-update-will-discontinue-your-online-session">patch for the game was released earlier this morning</a>, designed to fix a progress-blocking bug and more.</p>
<p>Capcom lists its top-selling games, what it calls <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html">Platinum Titles</a>, with Monster Hunter Worlds at the top with 21.3m units sold (as of December last year). It's followed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> with 16.7m and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> remake with 15m.</p>
<p>Could Monster Hunter Wilds overthrow its predecessor? At the very least, it's cemented once again that Monster Hunter is Capcom's most lucrative series.</p>

			<p>CAPCOM <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> this morning that Monster Hunter Wilds has already set new record sales. In the first three days since launch, the game sold over eight million units, becoming the fastest game to do so in the Japanese publisher's 45-year history.</p>
<p>This record-breaking milestone is not at all unexpected, given the immense hype surrounding the game after the highly successful entries Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise. Moreover, this past weekend, Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-reaches-steams-top-5-all-time-peak-but-user-reviews-are-only-at-54/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> a user concurrency peak of 1.38 million on Steam, stepping into the platform's all-time top five for this chart.</p>
<p>Of course, user reviews are still quite low at 58%, mostly due to the game's performance on PC. For now, CAPCOM hasn't said if they will improve the game's technical side, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are a few mods that might help</a>. Overall, though, this is a great game if you're into this type of experience, as outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds is the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series. While veterans may find the lower challenge level noticeable, and performance could definitely be better on PC, the improved onboarding and accessibility, a surprisingly engaging main campaign, excellent map and monster design, and refined combat make this entry a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned Hunters alike.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, CAPCOM has also promoted franchise producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, likely as a result of the series' excellent sales results. Starting on April 1, he'll replace Yoichi Egawa as the publisher's executive corporate officer and chief product officer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-warzone-being-shut-down-answered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: Warzone surfaced in 2020 as a free-to-play battle royale of epic proportions. Within just a few days, it had secured tens of millions of players worldwide, and it became known as one of the best games in the genre. Unfortunately, the game didn’t stand up well to the test of time, and after a couple of years, too many bad decisions were made, and players started rapidly abandoning the title.</p>



<p>Given that times have changed and players are still moving on, is Warzone being shut down? Activision won’t support a ‘dying game’ forever, but is Warzone going to be discontinued?</p>



<p>Join me as we find out the answer to that question.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-dying">Is Warzone Dying?</h2>



<p>In 2025, a prominent Call of Duty leaker revealed that the revival of Verdansk – due to take place in April 2025 – is the last-ditch effort for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/">Activision to bring players back to Warzone</a>.</p>



<p>It was mentioned that if Verdansk isn’t a success and players aren’t retained, then <strong>Warzone will be shut down before Call of Duty 2026 arrives</strong>.</p>



<p>This comes as Warzone struggles under the weight of network issues, a plague of cheaters, and lacklustre updates that haven’t given the community a sense of hope for the future of the iconic battle royale.</p>



<p>The esports scene for Warzone is wavering; streamers are abandoning the game for other battle royales, and players worldwide are losing faith in the platform at large.</p>



<p>When you ask if Warzone is dying, you can just look at the streaming figures for the game:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit: TwitchTracker.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Warzone’s performance on streaming platforms like Twitch is at an all-time low. The peaks we’re seeing now are lower than ever before, which is a telling indicator that the game is dying.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-being-discontinued">Is Warzone Being Discontinued?</h2>



<p>Presently, Warzone isn’t being discontinued, but there’s a very real possibility that it will be within the next year or so.</p>



<p>If the leaks are to be believed, Verdansk is the last shot developers have at making Call of Duty: Warzone an ongoing success. It’s an attempt to revive the player base and bring millions of users back onto the platform. If it fails, Warzone could be shut down by the end of 2026.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been said if Warzone Mobile will be shut down, though. This speculation is in reference to the ‘main’ version of Warzone on console and PC.</p>



<p>What will you do if Warzone is shut down? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hideki Kamiya Still Wants To Develop Scalebound with Xbox]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideki-kamiya-still-wants-to-develop-scalebound-with-xbox.1124466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent post on social media, Hideki Kamiya, who founded CLOVERS Inc. after leaving PlatinumGames in 2023, revealed that he’d still love to make Scalebound. The ill-fated RPG was cancelled in 2017 after years of discussions and rumours, but it seems that the Japanese gaming legend hasn’t forgotten about it – to the point that he still wants to make it.</p>



<p>Scalebound was in development at PlatinumGames for around four years before it was ultimately cancelled, and Kamiya was the game’s director. This isn’t the first time that the industry icon has pleaded for Xbox to pick the project up again, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shot-down">Shot Down</h2>



<p>PlatinumGames is famous for the creation of titles like Niear and Bayonetta, but Scalebound would have been a more ambitious game on a different level entirely. In Scalebound, players would have explored a world populated by dragons – and dragonriders. It was announced in 2014 with a trailer dropping at E3 (which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/e3-is-officially-over/">has since died a death</a>), and prospective fans were excited.</p>



<p>The year before Scalebound was revealed, Microsoft penned a deal with Platinum, assuming control of Scalebound in exchange for pumping cash into the coffers to build it. It was shaped around a third-person action-RPG model, and it looked good enough on the surface, but it was ultimately cancelled by Microsoft in 2017.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SCALEBOUND Gameplay Trailer (E3 2016)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dgxcs_5cztw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It was cited that the game’s stoppage was caused by issues with the Unreal Engine, ‘an inability to live up to player expectations’, and a lack of experience at the studio creating some of the game’s core elements.</p>



<p>But along came Hideki Kamiya, almost a decade after that cancellation, saying he still wants to make Scalebound:</p>











<p>His cry of ‘Let’s do it, Phil!’ came following a post from CLOVERS Inc. on Twitter. This post revealed that the team at CLOVERS was banded around Kamiya’s desk, reminiscing about Scalebound while watching videos of the game on YouTube. In the snippet, he said, ‘I’d love to make it again someday.’</p>



<p>In 2023, it was suggested in a discussion on a podcast that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scalebound-revival/">a revival of Scalebound</a> <strong>could </strong>be on the way, but we’ve heard nothing since.</p>



<p>Based on everything we know about Scalebound, would you like to see it made and finally released? Let us know in the comments what you think.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast is set to be released in the summer, opening up another chapter in the decade-old open-world zombie game. As one of the most prolific games in the genre, Dying Light has enjoyed ten years in the spotlight, and that streak of success is set to persist with the arrival of the standalone game, The Beast.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Dying Light’s franchise director, Tymon Smektała, revealed that there’s a secret tucked away in the first trailer for Dying Light: The Beast, and he believes nobody has found it yet.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-easter-eggs">Easter Eggs</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://thethumbwars.com/dying-light-the-beasts-interview-exclusive-director-talks-missed-trailer-details-banned-games-and-lore-answers-10-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with The Thumb Wars</a>, Tymon Smektała suggested that the ‘general location’ of Castor Woods, the in-game map, is hidden somewhere in an easter egg in the game’s first trailer. He said it’s a ‘barely visible’ piece of text that’s written in a dialect that would ‘hint’ at where Castor Woods is located.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer, in case you want to go egg hunting:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c50gFkG91jc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Where is Castor Woods set?</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve been through the trailer frame-by-frame, and I can’t see any unique dialect that would indicate where Castor Woods is set.</p>



<p>There are plenty of English language signs and storefronts, and everything from warning notices on generators to the emergency number on the back of police vehicles suggests we’re looking at another European adventure. The architecture is hard to pin down, though.</p>



<p>Harran, which was the centrepoint for the first game, was a fictional Middle Eastern city based on Istanbul, Mumbai, and Wroclaw. In Dying Light 2, players explore Villedor, another fictional location that’s an ‘amalgam’ of multiple European cities, including Germany, Belgium, and Poland.</p>



<p>I’m inclined to believe that Dying Light: The Beast is also set in Europe, but I can’t scale it down.</p>



<p>Perhaps you can do better – let me know in the comments if you’ve solved the easter egg.</p>

Undeterred, the man proceeded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJOxr32JJiQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follow them to a nearby snack vendor</a>. After a couple of minutes, he began verbally threatening them, saying things like “Let’s fucking fight right now.” When Hoffstetter called for security, the man tried to rush the group while shouting, “I’ll kill you right now.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Stalker Threatens/attack Emiru, Valkyrae, Cinna, Emily &amp; Rosii at Santa Monica Pier" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJOxr32JJiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The streamers ended the broadcast not long after. Nobody was hurt, but Hoffstetter understandably decided to conclude her marathon.</p><p>“We are all OK and have been with police,” she <a href="https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1896449449100247336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter last night</a>. “We decided we are done with the marathon and need time to process! … Please send love to Emiru, Cinna, [camera person] Rosii, and Emily! Everybody is in shock but I’m so glad [we’re] together.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxaQlqmo_Zs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a follow up broadcast today</a>, Hoffstetter and Watts, still visibly shaken up, told viewers more about what happened before and after the stream clip that went viral, noting that they had to “hide in a shed for 15 minutes until cops came” after receiving what they felt was insufficient aid from workers at Santa Monica Pier (though Watts added that she didn’t think it was workers’ fault). The two also asked viewers to provide any additional details they might have to help identify the man. They went on to defend themselves against online suggestions that the situation wasn’t particularly serious because the man didn’t seem to have a weapon, which is a totally fucked thing to even need to do when there is clear video footage of <em>somebody trying to assault you</em>.</p><p>“He put his stuff on the ground to fistfight Emily,” said Hoffstetter during today’s stream.&nbsp;</p><p>“I am in hindsight very thankful that we were in the area that we were and that we were able to go into the store, because I think if we had been anywhere else on the pier, it would have been a very different situation,” said Watts. “Please take this stuff very seriously. It can happen to anybody if you’re male or female, but if you ask any girl streamer, they all have stories.”</p><p>To wit, nearly every female content creator featured in my book and many more I’ve spoken to over the years have all shared stories of stalkers and assailants, and as of last night, one, Kaitlyn “Amouranth” Siragusa – who in the past has dealt with <a href="https://gamerant.com/amouranth-stalker-update-jail-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stalkers</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/amouranth-is-twitchs-smartest-troll-but-shes-on-thin-i-1847324266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swatters</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23410828/amouranth-abuse-twitch-streamer-safe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abuse</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/18/twitch-amouranth-house-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even a suspected arsonist</a> – was robbed at gunpoint in her home. She tweeted about the incident <a href="https://x.com/Amouranth/status/1896432533442904528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as it was unfolding</a>, saying three gunmen had pistol whipped her to the point of bleeding in an attempt to get their hands on her crypto login info. Today she <a href="https://x.com/Amouranth/status/1896600968797561248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted security camera footage</a> of gunmen following her into a portion of her home and then fleeing after one seemingly sustained a bullet wound.&nbsp;</p><p>“They pistol-whipped me but I got one,” Siragusa <a href="https://x.com/Amouranth/status/1896433946919084342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted last night</a>. “Was at gun point they gave me phone and said log in with gun to my head, and I tweeted because calling would be a death sentence.”</p><p><a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2025/03/popular-social-media-influencer-amouranth-pistol-whipped-in-home-invasion-robbery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Esports Advocate</a> received more details from a Houston Police Department spokesperson, saying that "during the time [the home invasion] was happening, Siragusa’s 36-year-old husband heard the commotion, armed himself, and entered the room. As the suspects attempted to flee, Siragusa’s husband was able to fire off an unknown number of shots, possibly injuring one of the suspects."</p><p>Speaking to Aftermath, both Jakob Avery, managing director of Siragusa’s company, and Nick Lee, evidently still with Siragusa even after the aforementioned <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23410828/amouranth-abuse-twitch-streamer-safe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 abuse incident</a>, took unspecified issue with the HPD’s account of events, but said they’d been advised against sharing more during an ongoing police investigation. Lee said that he believes he shot one of the intruders, all of whom had been in the process of drawing weapons, “aiming towards me, and shouting orders” before he opened fire.</p><p>Following the harrowing experiences of Siragusa, Hoffstetter, Watts, and Schunk – as well as those around them – many in the livestreaming community have suggested that bystanders and police will never make for sufficient protection, given their historically <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/08/15/keffals-adin-ross-ishowspeed-swatting-twitch-youtube/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inconsistent responses</a> to these issues. Content creators, they say, <a href="https://x.com/qtcinderella/status/1896465056625480016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need to hire security</a>. That’s far from an option for most streamers, which <a href="https://x.com/LewSpears/status/1896496737604509800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serves as a silent deterrent for women in the space</a>. Others have pointed out that this is a multifaceted problem, and security only treats symptoms, not the sickness.</p><p>"It's not a one-off situation. It's not some random crazy guy," a streamer who goes by the handle <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/blau" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blau</a> <a href="https://x.com/JojoPoehls/status/1896663929956536524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> of Hofstetter's situation during a recent broadcast.

            <p>
If you've spent anytime at all plopping stuff down in 2019's wonderfully soothing minimalist city builder Islanders, there's a fair chance you've been won over enough that a sequel is potentially quite exciting indeed. So brace yourself: publisher Coatsink has announced Islanders: New Shores, and it's coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this "summer".
</p>
<p>
The original Islanders, to recap, was a game about strategically cramming as many amenities as possible onto a tiny (but visually pleasing) randomly generated island - all while attempting to maximise your score by making the most of each amenity's adjacency multipliers. That probably doesn't sound hugely exciting, but its chill vibes and relaxed action made for an unexpectedly hypnotic experience - a space management game as compelling as it was soothing.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Islanders: New Shores, a gently expanded follow-up promising the chance to "explore, build, and strategise like never before". This time around, Coatsink - which acquired the franchise from original developer Grizzly Games in 2022 - has teamed up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/steamworld-build">SteamWorld Build</a> studio The Station, and it's touting a variety of new features for its sequel.

<p>
For starters, New Shores introduces "boons" - one-time power-ups unlocked as players amass points, used to gain an advantage on tougher stages - plus two distinct modes of play in the form of High Score and Sandbox, each with their own saves. Elsewhere, there's talk of 44 unique building types and seven island properties, as well as a photo mode with its own filters and a turntable camera. You can get a taste of New Shores' action in the trailer above.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for Islanders: New Shores just yet, but it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368930/ISLANDERS_New_Shores/">Steam</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch this "summer". And if it's anywhere near as good as its predecessor, it should be well worth keeping an eye on. Christian Donlan called the original Islanders a "thoughtful spin on strategy" and a "classic" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/islanders-console-edition-review-a-gloriously-dreamy-approach-to-city-building">his Recommended review</a> back in 2021.

<p>It has been claimed by a prominent Call of Duty leaker that Warzone 3 won’t happen alongside Call of Duty 2026 if Verdansk’s revival fails to retain enough players. That includes either those currently playing or those returning for the map’s revival next month.</p>



<p>Warzone has been in a sorry spot for a while, and Verdansk’s imminent return is expected to move mountains, but for how long?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-road">End of the Road?</h2>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1896672391457349981">TheGhostOfHope wrote</a> a few exclusive details about Modern Warfare IV – otherwise dubbed ‘COD 2026’.</p>



<p>Amongst <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other details</a>, he claimed that Warzone 3 won’t be implemented alongside next year’s Call of Duty title if Verdansk fails to perform when it’s brought back alongside the Season 03 update. Earlier today, Activision revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/">Season 03 is delayed</a> to April 3 in Black Ops 6 and Warzone to allow more time to finesse the update.</p>



<p>In March 2020, Call of Duty: Warzone was released to an overwhelmingly positive reception, with tens of millions of gamers worldwide pouring their hearts and souls into the battle royale. It changed the face of Call of Duty, creating an entirely new ecosystem that stood at the top of the genre for quite some time.</p>



<p>Things have changed since then, though.</p>



<p>Warzone has been on the rocks for a while, but Activision is hoping that Fornite OG-style event can bring back millions of players. It was claimed recently – also by TheGhostOfHope – that Verdansk will return as it was in 2020, which is sure to be a blast from the past for many players.</p>



<p>Do you think Verdansk is enough to save Warzone, or will the map’s imminent failure prove to be the final nail in the coffin for Call of Duty: Warzone?</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-2026-is-being-developed-for-the-next-generation-xbox-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1124229/</guid>

<p>It’s been claimed that Call of Duty 2026, which is assumed to be another Modern Warfare title is in development for the next generation Xbox.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to break the news after it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 of Black Ops 6 would be delayed until April</a>. </p>



<p>According to Hope, the 2026 title is not being development for past generation consoles (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlike Call of Duty 2025</a>) and is being developed for the next generation of Xbox. If true, this could be our first real hint that the next-gen Xbox could release around Fall 2026.</p>



<p>Also pointed out by Hope is that apparently if Verdansk does not bring players back to Call of Duty: Warzone, a third game in the free-to-play Battle Royale will not release.</p>



<p>Officially, Activision nor Microsoft have released any information on Call of Duty 2026, or even Call of Duty 2025 at this moment in time. But according to our sources, the next game in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty franchise is a Black Ops 2 seque</a>l headed once again by Treyarch Games following rough internal decisions that saw Sledgehammer Games wanting to develop their own fully-fledged Call of Duty title for 2027.</p>



<p>As always, take such rumors with a grain of salt, but Call of Duty 2026 being in development for the next-generation Xbox console is an interesting tidbit of information, if true.</p>



<p>What do you think of the next generation of Xbox potentially releasing in 2026? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen-consoles.1711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

		<p>Send good vibes, friends. My wife is out of town for the next week, which means ol' Patrick is solo parenting until her return. But it does mean my evenings are free once the children are in bed, which will result in an indulgent mixture of beer, shotgunning the third season of <em>Daredevil</em> ahead of the new season, and maybe—just maybe—finally rewatching <em>Interstellar</em>. I've been worried about watching <em>Interstellar</em> because it moved me at the time of release, long before I had kids. I expect to turn into a pile of dust and tears if I'm brave enough to revisit that one.</p><p>-pk, who expects most of his time will be taken by <em>Avowed</em></p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>HOA</em> – We start by sharing a few thoughts on a dearly departed friend, my Costco hot tub, before life updates on paint, contractors, and more.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Onimusha</em> – Barring any fuckin' sliding block puzzles, there's a decent chance we're able to beat this game before the stream is over.

                <p dir="ltr">Ads for four unconfirmed Activision mobile games--Guitar Hero Mobile, Call Of Duty: Sniper, and Call Of Duty: Zombies Defender, and Crash Bandicoot Brawl--all allegedly feature what players believe to be AI-generated art.</p><p dir="ltr">The news comes just a few days after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/">Activision admitted to using AI-generated assets in Black Ops 6</a>. Additionally, it appears that some of these mobile games may not even exist, as only Guitar Hero Mobile has been officially acknowledged on Activision's social media.</p><p dir="ltr">The ads for these rumored games are reportedly appearing on Facebook and Instagram, and contain a link to a survey where players can share their opinions on the games, which have not yet been released.</p><p dir="ltr">The Guitar Hero Mobile ad in particular seems to have truly upset players who have viewed it. Art for the game features four oddly shaped guitarists, each holding an even more oddly shaped red guitar. The strange look of the ads doesn't appear to be the result of Activision trying out a new art style, but instead features what players believe to be the hallmarks of AI-generated art: blurry, oddly shaped, and non-cohesive assets.</p><p dir="ltr">Even stranger, it appears that some of these mobile games may not actually exist. Guitar Hero Mobile, Crash Bandicoot Brawl, and the Call Of Duty titles have yet to be officially announced by Activision, and Guitar Hero Mobile is the only game with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" rel="nofollow ">an ad that's viewable</a> outside of Facebook and Instagram ads.</p><p dir="ltr">Eagle-eyed fans did manage to dig up a <a href="https://store.geeklab.app/p/f6c46a6e325cb82fbb206399" rel="nofollow ">Guitar Hero Mobile page on Geeklab</a>, a mobile marketing platform that helps developers gauge player interest. Geeklab's website says it exists to "create app store pages before the app is released, test product pages, research competitors, build assets, run surveys, run A/B tests, and optimize app stores." Clicking "get" on the Guitar Hero Mobile page <a href="https://lab.geeklab.app/survey/7562005b447f52556c832f82?tq=267a0d4c6151982266fa5a03d97051&amp;pid=3252054" rel="nofollow ">takes players to a survey</a> (also hosted on the Geeklab site).</p><p dir="ltr">The two Call Of Duty titles and the Crash Bandicoot Brawl mobile game do not yet appear to have Geeklab pages, nor do they have official pages on Activision's website, but Facebook and Instagram users are asserting that ads for all three games--plus Guitar Hero Mobile--are regularly running on the two Meta-owned social media sites. Art featured on the Guitar Hero Mobile Geeklab page also appears to include AI-generated assets, according to players. In addition to the bizarre shape of the guitarists and their instruments, the speakers on the stage appear to be facing in multiple directions at once.</p><p dir="ltr">"Thank you Activision," reads one sarcastic player comment on the Guitar Hero Mobile Instagram post. "Thank you for killing any interest I may have had in your games. Makes not supporting you way easier."</p><p dir="ltr">Activision declined to comment when asked about these ads and their reported use of AI-generated assets.</p>
