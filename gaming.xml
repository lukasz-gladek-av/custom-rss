		<p>Sony has announced that a State of Play will be taking place tomorrow, September 24th at 3PM PDT/6pm EDT/ 11pm BST. The show will last 30 minutes with news and updates for around 20 games to be showcased.</p>
<p>The games include both PS5 and PSVR 2 titles, and there is likely to be more news about games that will take advantage of the PS5 Pro’s specs. The State of Play will stream across YouTube and Twitch.</p>


<p>There are not that many rumours around to say what will be shown, though one that has been persistent the last week is a Days Gone remaster, which may or may not generate a similar reaction the news of the Horizon Zero Dawn remaster. If there is a remaster announcement then many would be waiting for games like Bloodborne, which would be a very popular option for fans.</p>
<p>Sony’s State of Play comes a few days before Tokyo Game Show gets into full swing, so there could be some early surprises from Japanese studios. Microsoft also have a Tokyo Game Show showcase taking place this week, with that happening on September 26th, and that will have a focus on games from Japanese studios.</p>

		<p>Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings game has been given a new release date, following on from i<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/14/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed-to-2025/">ts delay from a couple of weeks back</a>. That new release date is March 25th, 2025, and from then on you will be able to live the cost life of a Hobbit. To mark the news, a brand new behind the scenes look at the development of Tales of the Shire has been released focusing on features and inspirations.</p>
<p><iframe title="TOTS / for review only" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFIWB7pYNTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tales of the Shire allows players to create their own Hobbit, who lives in Bywater and can establish their own life. As time passes in Bywater, other Hobbits will come to ask your Hobbit for help on matters. Additionally, you can do all the cosy things a Hobbit’s life should consist of, including growing your own vegetables, going fishing, trading items with neighbours, and cooking up meals. You can wander around Bywater visiting other Hobbits and going to the shop, or venture a bit further out to forage in the fields for supplies.</p>
<p><em>“Wētā Workshop has been trusted with J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth universe for more than 25 years, and over that time we have built up a deep understanding of the lore and a real love of Middle-earth that flows through our creative work across screen, collectibles and now, our cosy sims games,”</em> said Richard Taylor, Co-founder and CEO at Wētā Workshop. <em>“Tales of the&nbsp;<span>Shire</span>&nbsp;allows us to inspire our talents in an entirely new medium and, ultimately, create this game for people just like us – fans of The Lord of the Rings. This is a beautiful way that players who are looking for a quieter, more peaceful time can discover this in a less explored corner of this universe.”</em></p>

<p>Tales of the Shire will be released for PC via Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and it will also be available on Netflix.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-warhammer-40000-superfan-henry-cavill-is-playing-space-marine-2-no-he-wont-reveal-his-username<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Henry Cavill, the world’s most famous Warhammer 40,000 fan, is like so many others enjoying the recently released <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a>.</p><p>In an Instagram post, the Superman and Witcher star praised the developers at Saber Interactive for the action game set in Games Workshop’s grimdark universe, although revealed he failed to complete the campaign solo on the Angel of Death difficulty, which is the hardest of the four difficulties available.</p><p>As we can see from the photo, Cavill is currently big into Space Marine 2’s PvP mode, dubbed Eternal War. We can see him matchmaking on the PC version of the game, although the actor was smart enough to paste over his username with the word “nope.” Yes, that means you could be playing with or against Henry Cavill in Space Marine 2 PvP and you’d never know it.</p><p>Space Marine 2’s PvP, Cavill said, “has real potential to be absolutely awesome,” but he admits he knows nothing about video game development.</p><p>“Disclaimer: I know nothing about game development so the kind of dreams I have may be rather difficult to implement!” he said.</p><p>Also of note, Cavill is playing as an Ultramarine Tactical class, and he’s got a copy of The Horus Heresy Book Two on his table. The book contains rules and special characters for the pre-Heresy Iron Hands, Salamanders, Night Lords, and Word Bearers Legions, which I'm sure will set tongues wagging among the Warhammer 40,000 community.</p><p>It might make sense for Cavill to be submerged in the Warhammer 40,000 universe right now. Games Workshop recently reiterated that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-have-until-dec-2024-to-agree-creative-guidelines-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-film-and-tv-series-or-they-wont-happen">Amazon’s hotly anticipated Warhammer 40,000 film and TV series</a>, to which Cavill is attached, will not happen unless both companies can agree “creative guidelines” by December 2024.</p><p>In December 2023, Games Workshop said it would work with Amazon for a period of 12 months ending in December 2024 “to agree creative guidelines for the films and television series to be developed by Amazon.” And that agreement “will only proceed if the creative guidelines are mutually agreed between Games Workshop and Amazon.”</p><p>“We will update you accordingly,” Games Workshop said, like a Space Marine might tell a Guardsman anxious about a coming battle. That means Games Workshop and Amazon have just a few months to sort themselves out, or the Warhammer 40,000 movie and TV series fans so desperately want might never happen.</p><p>If the Warhammer 40,000 Amazon projects move forward, Cavill will be involved. The Hollywood actor is set to star in and executive produce the Warhammer 40,000 franchise across all Amazon Studios productions.</p><p>While concrete details on shows and films are likely a way off, Cavill nonetheless sounded excited to be bringing Warhammer 40,000 to life. “I have loved Warhammer since I was a boy, making this moment truly special for me. The opportunity to shepherd this cinematic universe from its inception is quite the honor and the responsibility,” said Cavill. “I couldn’t be more grateful for all the hard work put in by Vertigo, Amazon and Games Workshop to make this happen. One step closer to making a nigh-on lifelong dream come true.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In February, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/henry-cavill-says-warhammer-40000-amazon-project-the-greatest-privilege-of-my-professional-career"><u>Cavill touched again on the Warhammer 40,000 Amazon project</u></a>, saying: "It is the greatest privilege of my professional career to have this opportunity. I can’t say too much, again, it’s early days still. But to have this opportunity to bring it to screen, and be at the tiller so it can be faithful, is key to me.</p><p>“This is the stuff I’ve been dealing with since I was a kid. This is the stuff I spend my free time daydreaming about, as an adult as well, and I get to bring it into life. There is no greater reason than I joined the industry than doing something like this.”</p><p>Warhammer 40,000 is Games Workshop’s science fiction universe used as the setting for its hugely popular tabletop wargame starring the iconic Space Marines. It’s a grimdark universe in which humanity clings on to survival in the face of terrifying threats within and without the fascist Imperium.</p><p>Who might Cavill play across the Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe? Talking to IGN in 2021, Cavill expressed interest in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/henry-cavill-warhammer-tv-show"><u>playing one of the Primarchs or Captain-Generals</u></a>, who are high-ranking key characters from the Warhammer lore.</p><p>As for Space Marine 2, be sure to check out IGN's interview with Saber development chief Tim Willits to find out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">what the game's success means for DLC and a potential Space Marine 3</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>The next generation of Xbox consoles reportedly could include both a console and a handheld.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/were-building-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary-of-halo-and-xbox-microsoft-confirms-in-a-new-interview-we-have-such-a-rich-heritage-you-have-to-celebrate-that" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is taking another two-pronged approach to the Xbox hardware market like it did with the Series X and S. The plan is reportedly to have a traditional-style successor to the Series X, as well as a handheld gaming option similar to that of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-steam-deck-games-to-play-right-now/2900-4083/" data-ref-id="2900-4083">Steam Deck</a>.</p><p>It's currently unclear what this approach would end up looking like, but if the handheld anything like the Steam Deck, players will likely be able to play their digital purchases and bounce between the handheld and console. There likely won't be a separate ecosystem like the 3DS and Wii U or Vita and PS3. There's also the possibility that it could look more like a Switch and have both the console and handheld components work together.</p><p>Separately from this report, Microsoft <a href="https://www.licenseglobal.com/video-games/xbox-gaming-evolved" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also confirmed</a> that it has plans to celebrate both Xbox and Halo's 25th anniversaries, which are landing in 2026.

  </p>

    

</div><div>



            <p>
Nintendo has submitted a mystery new "wireless device" to the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for approval that does not appear to be the hotly-expected <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Specific details of the device remain under-wraps, as Nintendo's <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;application_id=m9V0HXBXo8nolsDsEYU3Nw%3D%3D&amp;fcc_id=BKECLO001">application</a> comes with a confidentiality request set to be held for another 180 days - until late March 2025.
</p>
<p>
Still, we know a couple of things. First, its shape - a roughly-square object with curved corners when viewed from underneath. Second, that it has wireless capabilities - including an intriguing 24GHz mmWave sensor. It's also powered by a USB-C connection. 
</p>
<p>
Could this be a Switch 2 peripheral? After all, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">leaked and likely-real (if dated) Switch 2 prototype</a> model features USB-C ports top and bottom. Perhaps, but what's odd here is the device's product code (CLO-001) denotes an item treated by Nintendo as its own separate 'thing'. 
</p>
<p>
This is not Switch 2 (leaks have already pinned down its likely product code line) and is unlikely to be a peripheral for it (this would have a higher product number than 001). The product code also does not relate to any Nintendo device line released to date.
</p>
<p>
Back to that 24Ghz mmWave sensor. These items can detect human presence or movement in a room and are often paired with smart home features to activate lights or monitor the general activity of people or pets. It's intriguing to imagine the usage case for this in a video game. Could it detect gestures? Is this some kind of party game add-on? 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's application for confidentiality simply states that details of the device "contain technical information which we deem to be trade secrets and proprietary. If made public, the information might be used to the disadvantage of the applicant in the market place".

And rest assured, no matter what you may have read or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332">heard about <em>Helldivers 2 </em>in the last few months</a></span>, it is still very much a blast.</p><p>I think the key to what makes <em>Helldivers 2 </em>work so well is that it’s so simple on its face: you are a soldier sent to the frontlines of a two-pronged galactic war to face off against killer bugs and robots. That, in and of itself, is more than enough to get somebody invested in the action, at least for a match or two. From there, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>sinks its hooks into players very easily.</p><p>The worlds on which your battles take place have so much going on, you may be in awe from the second those boots touch ground. Visually, every planet—even the dead ones—is a marvel, and most of them actually feel distinct, whether due to changes in the biome or larger planetwide effects like fire storms or blizzards. The barks from player characters further reveal the extent of <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272">satire and humor</a></span>, which is hilariously unsubtle in its criticism of the fascist underpinnings of Super-Earth, the game’s “good guys.” </p><p>But my favorite thing about <em>Helldivers 2</em> is probably how it never fails to make you feel small and weak. You are, at the end of the day, a human facing off against aliens that simply outclass you. The bug-like Terminids come in all manner of shapes, sizes, and forms that have their own capabilities. Some can fly, while others go invisible and sneak up on you to shred you to ribbons with their serrated claws. Armored brood commanders send grunts charging in your direction, and there are even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-how-to-kill-spore-chargers-update-1851618284&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-how-to-kill-spore-chargers-update-1851618284">massive armored chargers that emit acid-green fogs</a></span> to obscure their position. Hell, there are variants of the latter that unfurl tentacles that burrow into the ground and emerge again as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495">massive spiked tendrils that can impale you</a></span>. Sure, you can call down weapons to defeat them, but in one-on-one scuffles, these things are superior to you in every way, and that’s just one enemy faction.</p><p>Due to this obvious and intentional imbalance, overcoming the odds feels clutch, and victory almost always emerges from smart interplay with your team and a smattering of good luck. I remember running from a hulking Bile Titan and facing my camera back at it while I booked it. I had nothing in the way of resources that could take it out, so I assumed I would just try to dodge its projectiles and legs for as long as I possibly could. The action felt like the big setpiece sequence of an alien invasion film, but the real movie moment came when I rounded a corner, found an ally with exactly the weapon needed to take out my pursuer, and watched them bring it down as I dove past them to safety. Sequences like this happen all the time in <em>Helldivers 2</em> without prompt. </p><p>Once the action gets you, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-guides-tips-chargers-striders-settings-1851265570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-guides-tips-chargers-striders-settings-1851265570">the rest of <em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span> just kind of clicks into place. Resources can be found around its huge maps and put toward passive upgrades back on your ship, which forces you to explore and discover how deep these environments actually are. They are dotted with patrols, enemy camps, optional objectives, and installments, and taking on all of it can yield even deeper rewards, as well as a stronger sense of mastery over <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Soon enough, you’ll be undertaking major orders, defending planets or trying to capture other ones, and maximizing your loadouts and deployable stratagems like rocket barrages or heavy machine gun turrets to meet the increasing challenges of the missions you undertake.<br></p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, too. Falling for <em>Helldivers 2 </em>also means inevitably becoming a conspiracy theorist who constantly argues about the appearance of a third enemy faction, and the motivations of “Joel,” the developer at Arrowhead Game Studios largely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-galactic-war-game-master-joel-1851297376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-galactic-war-game-master-joel-1851297376">responsible for the tug-of-war meta narrative</a></span> that encapsulates the game. Like I said, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>fans are different, but they can occasionally be good fun, and if all of that sounds like a good time to you, picking this game up seems like an obvious move while it’s on sale.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’re into streaming and game capture, you’ve probably heard of Elgato. They’ve dominated the game capture space for over a decade due to their overall quality and understanding of what streamers and content creators need with their products. This time around, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elgato-neo-the-new-family-of-elgato-products-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elgato has taken a different approach with its Elgato Neo line</a>, offering a series of new products in a new Plug-and-play format at a competitive price. For this review, we’ll be deep-diving into the Elgato Game Capture Neo, its latest game capture device that is great for anyone wanting to get into streaming and content creation.</p>



<h2 id="h-cut-to-the-chase">Cut to the Chase</h2>



<p><strong>Price –</strong> $119.99 / £119.99<br><strong>Max Passthrough Resolution</strong> – 4K60HDR<br><strong>Max Capture Resolution</strong> – 1080p60<br><strong>How does it work? –</strong> It connects your console (PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, etc.) to your PC, laptop, or iPad to stream or record.<br><strong>What apps are compatible?</strong> – It’s compatible with almost every app, including Discord, OBS, etc. and can be used to stream to Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Tiktok.<br><strong>Is there a subscription service needed?</strong> – No, it’s a one-time purchase price, and that’s it.</p>



<h2 id="h-an-affordable-option">An Affordable Option</h2>



<p>I’ve been in the gaming content creator scene for about 15 years now, and the truth is, it can be costly. However, the Elgato Game Capture Neo, priced at $119, is a fantastic price point that suddenly makes streaming and recording gameplay affordable for the masses. The Elgato Game Capture Neo offers a 4K60 max passthrough resolution and a 1080p60 max capture resolution, a perfectly acceptable content output resolution for any novice content creator. For comparison, the Elgato HD60 X will also offer these same resolutions, but with frame rate support up to 240FPS priced at $159.99, but unless you have a monitor that supports such a high FPS, you’re getting the same bang for your buck with the Neo but 25% cheaper.</p>



<h2 id="h-plug-in-and-play">Plug in and Play</h2>



<p>All the Elgato Neo family devices have a ” plug-in and play” design that makes whichever Neo device you use simple and easy to understand. While you will still need to download the Elgato Capture Software or OBS to start your recording or steaming journey, the Elgato Game Capture Neo can be set up from unboxing to recording in minutes.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note – You must have two HDMI cables handy as they do not come with the device. </strong></em></p>



<ol>
<li>Connect HDMI IN to your console and HDMI OUT to your TV or monitor.</li>



<li>Connect Game Capture Neo directly to a USB 3.0 (or better) port on your PC or Mac. (To connect to your iPad, use a good third-party adapter or USB-C to USB-C cable. Do not use a USB hub.)</li>



<li>Download your favorite recording or broadcasting app.</li>



<li>Select Game Capture Neo in your favorite recording or broadcasting app.</li>



<li>Share or share your gameplay on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Tiktok, etc.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong><em>Note—If you’re getting “No Signal,” you need to disable HDCP on your console. This is located under Settings in your console’s dashboard.</em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Overall, the Elgato Game Capture Neo is a great capture device for anyone who wants to try out streaming or content creation. While it doesn’t record to the highest resolutions and framerates, it’s important to note that this product is for those who want to dip their toes into recording and streaming gaming content without spending hundreds of dollars on just one product.</p>



<p>Its elegant and simplistic design, lightweight and small size make it an ideal capture device to add to any setup and is the perfect choice for gamers on the move. Overall, it’s another high-quality product from Elgato and a great addition to its existing product line. </p>



<p>The entire Neo family of products, which consists of the Elgato Game Capture Neo, Stream Deck Neo, Facecam Neo, Wave Neo, and Key Light Neo can all be yours now for £399 on the <a href="https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/p/neo-creator-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elgato website</a>.</p>

<p>When The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom began development, it started out as a dungeon creator game. That’s according to the game’s developers at Grezzo.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A from Nintendo</a>, Grezzo game director Satoshi Terada said that the studio looked at “a few different ways to play the game”.</p>



<p>“In one approach, Link could copy and paste various objects, such as doors and candlesticks, to create original dungeons,”  Terada said. “During this exploration phase, this idea was called an “edit dungeon” because players could create their own Legend of Zelda gameplay.” </p>



<p>Producer Eiji Aonuma then chimed in saying that after playing it, he wanted to take the game in different direction.</p>



<p>“As I played, I started thinking that while it’s fun to create your own dungeon and let other people play it, it’s also not so bad to place items that can be copied and pasted in the game field, and create gameplay where they can be used to fight enemies,” he said. </p>



<p>“That was the beginning of gameplay using “echoes.” The gameplay was shifted from creating dungeons up until then to using copied-and-pasted items as tools to further your own adventure.”</p>



<p>The changes were made, according to Tomomi Sano, the first female director in the history of the Zelda franchise, about a year into the game’s development.</p>



<p>”&nbsp;…It’d been that long,” said Terada before Sano chimed in confirming.</p>



<p>“Everyone else was developing the game with dungeon creation in mind, but I was right next to them thinking of something different. (Laughs) But there’s a reason it took a year to upend the tea table,” Aonuma then added.</p>



<p>“After all, you can’t really see the potential for ideas to develop into solid gameplay until you can verify features and their feel, so I wanted them to try making it first. I felt that the “edit dungeon” feature they showed me had significant potential to be developed into a new way of playing the Legend of Zelda games if the gameplay was changed to use “echoes” instead. So, I thought it would be good to expand in that direction and could be even more interesting that way. However, there was one concern. Even though game consoles have larger memory capacity nowadays, the more things players can copy and paste, the more game memory is used up. I was really worried that it would crash the game.”</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, the first Zelda game to feature Zelda as a main playable character, releases exclusively for Nintendo Switch on September 26.</p>

Exactly what those games will be remains to be seen, but likely candidates include Sony's impending Until Dawn remake, which we've seen nothing of since its announcement earlier this year, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s remake of beloved psychological horror <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, which was recently confirmed to be a PlayStation console exclusive for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-ps5-console-exclusive-for-one-year">year after its release</a>.

<p>
As for reveals, Guerrilla Games' long-rumoured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> remaster seems a fair bet given its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rated-for-ps5-and-pc">recent ESRB rating</a>, and reports have suggested 2019's open-world zombie game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> is also getting the remaster treatment - so perhaps there's a space in the show for that too. Oh, and if we're doing remasters Sony, I know one or two people who wouldn't mind nipping back to Yharnam, eh?
</p>
<p>
In amongst all the above, Sony will almost certainly want to further spotlight <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-upgrade-patches-for-around-40-or-50-games-at-launch-this-november">some of the "40 or 50" games</a> getting PS5 Pro enhancements this November, given the less-than-enthusiastic response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">the machine's £700+ price tag</a> and the fact pre-orders are set to open this Thursday, 26th September.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, feel free to make your own guesses in the comments below - and then tune in tomorrow at 11pm UK time (we'll be covering the show here on Eurogamer if you want to join in the communal fun) to have your wildest theories proved correct or otherwise.

			<p>It's no secret that Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 has been a huge hit, experiencing a record-breaking launch. Saber Interactive spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN in an exclusive interview</a>, where Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits said the success of the game would positively affect future projects. At the moment, there has been no official sales figure announced by either Saber or Focus Entertainment, but it's suspected to be a relatively high number. This comes after Focus confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/">two million had played the game at launch</a>, with Space Marine 2 quickly becoming the most-played Warhammer game of any type that has been launched on Steam.</p>
<p>Space Marine 2 reached 225,690 peak concurrent players on Steam, and it's possible that the numbers could continue to rise in the future if DLC is added to the game or other updates. While Willits refused to go into numbers about Space Marine 2's success regarding the revenue or profit made, he says that Space Marine 2 is the fastest-selling game he's ever worked on, which comes as a surprise considering he's worked on games such as Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein.</p>
<p>In the interview with IGN, Willits said that the budget for Space Marine 2 was less than half that of Doom Eternal, the last game he worked on as studio director at ID Software before joining Saber Interactive in 2019. Because of the small budget for this game, and the standard edition costing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$59.99 on Steam</a> and $69.99 on console, it's very heavily hinted that the game has been a very profitable project.</p>
<p>The success of Space Marine 2 means that the staff at Saber Interactive can "dream bigger." There are already big plans for Space Marine 2, including new missions, enemies, and weapons, as well as adjustments once the game has spent a significant amount of time on the market.</p>
<p>In addition to the post-launch plan, there is now the possibility of a story DLC and ideas floating around for Space Marine 3. The open-ended ending of Space Marine 2 makes the idea of Space Marine 3 very feasible.</p>
<p>"Our game director Dmitry Grigorenko, he has proposed some story ideas that could be a DLC or a sequel. We're literally just catching our breath. This is two weeks out. We just need to get the dust to settle. But I can confidently say that we will not disappoint our Warhammer fans in the future." Willits also goes on to say, "Hopefully, we'll be working on Space Marine content for a long time."</p>
<p>While they are considering the idea of Space Marine 3, Willits also mentions that new factions would likely be added in the sequel. However, excited fans will have to wait and see.</p>

Highly recommended!”</p><p>And Carpenter is absolutely right! <em>The Lost Crown</em> remains one of this year’s most impressive releases, in large part because it recaptures the wonder of the<em> Prince of Persia</em> franchise, which has largely been left to die for more than a decade. And while Carpenter is right that <em>The Lost Crown</em> has an old-school feel to it, it also masterfully blends those vintage vibes with modern influences from more recent Metroidvanias. </p><p><em>The Lost Crown</em> gives you a chance to explore a fascinating map full of challenging platforming levels that you unlock through the discovery of new skills over the course of your playthrough. That solid gameplay core combined with quality-of-life improvements such as a fantastic minimap/screenshot tool that helps with backtracking or a slew of accessibility settings make this one of the most welcoming yet still challenging Metroidvanias around. If it’s good enough for John Carpenter, it’s good enough for you.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a great piece of Toxtricity art by Anderson, certainly, and it won because of its use of the space to depict a unique angle for the Pokémon, but it’s harder to get excited about.</p><figure id="" data-id="d5d760aac09c72339601d0579a258127" data-recommend-id="image://d5d760aac09c72339601d0579a258127" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The ex winner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The ex winner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Anderson / The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d5d760aac09c72339601d0579a258127" data-recommend-id="image://d5d760aac09c72339601d0579a258127" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The ex winner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What’s so lovely about the two other winners, however, is quite how <em>different</em> they are.</p><p>The Pokémon Company is getting better and better at featuring ever more lavish art, but is still quite conservative on style, so seeing the pick for Best Standard Card Illustration is a real treat.

<p>Sony has officially <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/23/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced its next</a> PlayStation State of Play will take place on Tuesday, September 24. The event will take place at 6pm ET/11pm BST.</p>



<p>The announcement of the event comes after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weeks of rumors</a> regarding when it would happen. It was always rumored to be late this month, and that ultimately was the case.</p>



<p>Sony says it will showcase updates from “over 20 titles” during the 30+ minute show.</p>



<p>As far as what exactly Sony will show off during the PlayStation State of Play, there’s already speculation. Sony is expected to announce a remaster of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> for PlayStation 5 (PS5). In addition to that, it’s rumored is a reveal of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-circulate-that-days-gone-is-getting-ps5-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone remaster</a> for the PS5.</p>



<p>Aside from those two games, however, there’s not much to go on just yet. It’s worth noting that the State of Play comes around the Tokyo Game Show where both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tokyo-game-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Xbox_JP/status/1836933448901988500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox</a> have a presence. Xbox is holding its own conference at the event on Thursday, September 26.</p>



<p>Speaking of the Tokyo Game Show, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-for-ps5-could-be-announced-at-tokyo-game-show-document-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent document suggested</a> that Palworld could also be announced for PS5. With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-suing-palworld-developer-pocketpair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent lawsuit against</a> developer Pocketpair, however, if that still happens remains to be seen.</p>



<p>What do you think we’ll see during the new PlayStation State of Play on Tuesday? Join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/344/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

<p>As someone who has been following the growth of generative AI for a while now, I know that the technology <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/gmails-ai-powered-email-summaries-can-dig-through-your-inbox-for-you/">can be pretty good</a> (if <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/australian-government-trial-finds-ai-is-much-worse-than-humans-at-summarizing/">not quite human-level</a>) at quickly summarizing complex documents into a more digestible form. But I still wasn't prepared for how disarmingly compelling it would be to listen to <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">Google's NotebookLM</a> condense <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/">my recent book about <em>Minesweeper</em></a> into a tight, 12.5-minute, podcast-style conversation between two people who don't exist.
</p><p>There are still enough notable issues with NotebookLM's audio output to prevent it from fully replacing professional podcasters any time soon. Even so, the podcast-like format is an incredibly engaging and endearing way to take in complex information and points to a much more personable future for generative AI than the dry back-and-forth of a text-based chatbot.</p>
<h2>Hey! Listen!</h2>
<p><em>Listen to NotebookLM's 12.5-minute summary of my <em>Minesweeper</em> book using the player above.</em></p>
<p>Google's NotebookLM <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-new-notebooklm-app-builds-a-custom-ai-based-on-a-source-document/">launched over a year ago</a> as "a virtual research assistant that can summarize facts, explain complex ideas, and brainstorm new connections—all based on the sources you select." Just last week, though, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/">added the new "Audio Overview" feature</a> that it's selling as "a new way to turn your documents into engaging audio discussions."</p>
<p>Google doesn't use the word "podcast" anywhere in that announcement, instead talking up audio creations that "summarize your material, make connections between topics, and banter back and forth." But Wharton AI professor Ethan Mollick correctly referred to the style as a "podcast" in <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1836480689081913572">a recent social media post</a> sharing a NotebookLM Audio Overview of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/059371671X/?tag=arstech20-20">his book</a>. Mollick called these Audio Summaries "the current best 'wow this is amazing &amp; useful' demo of AI" and <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1836482214386671943">"unnerving, too,"</a> and we agree on both counts.</p>
<p>Inspired by Mollick's post, I decided to feed <a href="https://bossfightbooks.com/products/minesweeper-by-kyle-orland">my own book</a> into NotebookLM to see what its virtual "podcasters" would make of 30,000 or so words about '90s Windows gaming classic <em>Minesweeper</em> (believe it or not, I could have written much more). Just a few minutes later, I was experiencing a reasonable facsimile of what it would be like if I was featured on <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510282/pop-culture-happy-hour">NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour</a> or a similar banter-filled podcast.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Just the facts?</h2>
<p>NotebookLM's summary hits on all the book's major sections: the pre-history of the games that inspired <em>Minesweeper</em>; the uphill battle for the Windows Entertainment Pack at a business-focused Microsoft of the '90s; the moral panic over the game's pre-installation on millions of business and government computers; and the surprising cheating controversies that surrounded the game's competitive scene.</p>

But anyone listening to this "podcast" would get the same general overview of my book that they would listening to <a href="https://codexhistoryofvideogames.libsyn.com/episode-262-minesweeper-with-kyle-orland">one</a> of the <a href="https://retronauts.com/article/2079/retronauts-episode-539-minesweeper-shareware">many</a> actual <a href="https://gamehistory.org/ep-110-minesweeper/">podcasts</a> that <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-70840107/ep327-kyle-orland">I did</a> after the book launched.</p>
<p>While there weren't any full-blown, whole-cloth hallucinations in NotebookLM's summary "podcast," there were a few points where it got small details wrong or made assumptions that weren't supported in the text. Discussing <em>Minesweeper</em> predecessor <em>Mined-Out</em>, for instance, NotebookLM's audio summary says, "So this is where those squares and flags start to come into play..." even though <em>Mined-Out</em> had neither feature.</p>
<p>Then there's the portion where the summary-cast mentions a senator who called <em>Minesweeper</em> "a menace to the republic," repeating the quote for emphasis. That definitely captures the spirit of Senator Lauch Faircloth's tirade against <em>Minesweeper</em> and other games being pre-installed on government computers. In the "podcast" context, though, it sounds like the voices are putting words in Faircloth's mouth by sharing a direct quote.</p>
<p>Small, overzealous errors like these—and a few key bits of the book left out of the podcast entirely—would give me pause if I were trying to use a NotebookLM summary as the basis for a scholarly article or piece of journalism. But I could see using a summary like this to get some quick Cliff's Notes-style grounding on a thick tome I didn't have the time or inclination to read fully. And, unlike poring through Cliff's Notes, the pithy, podcast-style format would actually make for enjoyable background noise while out on a walk or running errands.</p>

			<p>At Gamescom 2024, Techland surprised everyone by announcing <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-showcased-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, a standalone game in which Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the first game, returns.</p>
<p>Fans were waiting for the second Dying Light 2 DLC, which was originally slated for 2023 but got delayed. The studio has instead pivoted to focus on The Beast for reasons that were thoroughly explained in the below group interview I had with the team, which also featured Kyle Crane voice actor Roger Craig Smith in addition to Franchise Director Tymon Smetkala and Art Director Katarzyna Tarnacka.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast doesn't have a release date yet, but it will be available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X. It's important to note that it will be free to owners of the Ultimate Edition of Dying Light 2 to compensate them for the lack of a second DLC. Moreover, it will support co-op just like the previous installment.</p>

<p><strong>I know the game started as the second Dying Light 2 DLC, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala:</strong> Yes, but also, actually, not really. We were working on the DLC, and last year, we experienced a leak for the narrative. So, a lot of very important elements of the story have been leaked out, and we were wondering how we could deal with this. We could ignore it, but then I think it would be ruined for a lot of players, actually, the most dedicated ones, because if you are a dedicated fan, you follow all the leaks, you learn about them, and it's kind of hard to unsee what you have already seen.</p>
<p>We came to this dilemma, and we started discussing this. We spent about a week internally talking about what we could do with this. Out of those conversations, the idea came that we could ask Roger Craig Smith to return as Kyle Crane.</p>
<p>That was the trigger, the moment where we actually stopped thinking about DLC and started thinking about it as a completely new product, the return of Kyle Crane, because many people from the studio world have worked on previous games with him. It got us really energetic and inspired, so we came up with new ideas on what we could do with the character, the story, and the world. I think the best way to describe it is that over those two weeks, the game exploded. It was like DLC, but then suddenly, it became something else and much, much, much bigger, and that's how Dying Light: The Beast was born.</p>
<p><strong>You had to change the narrative because of that leak.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Yeah, but it was not just that. Saying we had to change the narrative doesn't really explain the process. It was the beginning of the process. But then we said, hey, actually, we are making a new game. All of the ideas, all of the energy, all of the creativity that has happened because of this trigger, because of that change, we looked at it, and we said, hey, we have about 18 hours of gameplay, we have sets of new game mechanics, a new skill tree for the main character, we have a new main character - even if he's returning, he's new in a way - we have a great story that refers to the first game and the second game and tries to connect them together and answer some questions in both of them.</p>
<p>We have mechanics like vehicles, a new multilayered environment with lots of things to discover, and lots of secrets. At that point, it was a completely different project and game.</p>
<p><strong>Was the Castor Woods region the same when you still planned this to be the second Dying Light 2 DLC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Kind of. It's a version of it. The name was the same, but the geometry and elements were different. Roughly, yes, we have built this on some elements of the previous map, but again, it's evolved, grown, and received a lot more love.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Castor Woods located compared to the two places seen in the previous games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>I think it's definitely closer to Villador. Generally, Dying Light: The Beast takes place after the events of Dying Light 2, but to be honest, we don't really focus that much on making sure that it's placed somewhere in the world. What we want to do is we don't want to recreate a very specific place.</p>
<p>Why? Because if you live in that place, if you know that place, you basically know the game, right? We are trying to build a fictional space that makes sense for our game and for our narrative, but it's just inspired by various things from a specific area. In this sense, Castor Woods is closer to Villador because both share a lot of European inspirations.</p>
<p><strong>You said that it's set after the second game, right? Can you say how long after?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Quite soon. I would say it happens right after the events of the Dying Light 2.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Dying Light 2: The Beast happens quite soon. I would say it happens right after the events of the Dying Light 2.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are there any characters coming back from DL2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>I don't want to spoil it because this would spoil the story, but as I said, it answers questions from the first game and the second game. But I think the most important thing is that Kyle Crane returns in the form and voice embodied by Roger Craig Smith. This is a big deal for us because actually having Roger in the game and on the project really changed things for us. It's an absolutely amazing thing for us, and I think it's worth using the fact that we have the actor here, so you can maybe ask him something.</p>
<p><strong>Roger Craig Smith:</strong> He said it all. The most important thing is that Kyle Crane is back.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like to return after I don't know how many years from the first one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Dying Light will celebrate its tenth anniversary next year, so as humans, we have been working on the game since 10 years ago. However, in terms of Kyle Crane as a character, I think the best way to frame it in the worldbuilding timeline is that it happens after the events of Dying Light 2, and Kyle Crane has been a subject of very brutal experiments for many, many years before that.</p>
<p><strong>How did the fact that your character was experimented on and imprisoned for so many years inform your performance and the narrative as a whole?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Roger Craig Smith:</strong>&nbsp; That's been the challenge, I think. It's easy for me as an actor to want to go back and do what I did 10 years ago and listen to the character and go, oh yeah, we can do that again. But because of what Kyle has endured and I'll use the word trauma, like, the idea that he's so affected by what was done to him for a very long period of time of brutal experimentation... He's still Kyle, but he's definitely a little bit more hellbent on revenge, and he's maybe not as lighthearted or jovial as he once was.</p>
<p>He's a little more focused on a mission if you will, so it was fun for me to try to build the connective tissue between the Kyle Crane that we liked getting to experience as players in the first Dying Light but also doing something just a little bit different - well, kind of vastly different really because of what he's endured. It was a fun challenge to try to sneak little bits of old Kyle in with this new sort of affected version of Kyle, but I love that. If there's a chance to do anything nuanced, it's fun for an actor.</p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Yeah, it's an actor's challenge, right? You have to find a new way to interpret the character.</p>
<p><strong>Roger Craig Smith:</strong> It's fun to kind of like tweak it and do that sort of thing. Otherwise, you're just doing something you've done before, but this is not your Grandpa's Kyle. This is a different Kyle, which is why, to their point, Dying Light: The Beast is not a DL2 DLC. It's a standalone thing because even Kyle is a different version of Kyle than what we've experienced in the past.</p>

He's still Kyle, but he's definitely a little bit more hellbent on revenge, and he's maybe not as lighthearted or jovial as he once was.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are you also doing motion capture for Kyle or just voiceover?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Roger Craig Smith:</strong> It's straight voice acting.</p>
<p><strong>I also wanted to ask, Dying Light 2 was way more of an RPG than the first one. What about Dying Light: The Beast? Is it more like the first one or is it still an RPG?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>I actually think it's something else. I think with every Dying Light game, we're trying to look at the zombie apocalypse and do it in a slightly different way, find a different balance for quite a different take on the narrative and on the world, but also find a different balance and use different elements for building the gameplay. I think what we are trying to do with this one is give it a more survival feel. You should really feel that you struggle against zombies in this world to survive the next day.</p>
<p>In that regard, I think it's closer to Dying Light 1 than to Dying Light 2. A reference for you can be the first initial hours of Dying Light 1, where you enter Harran and just have a weak weapon and every zombie is a problem. Even though Kyle Crane has changed and is a different, more seasoned, more experienced character, the world around him has also changed for the worse, so now he's back to the moment where he is fighting to just survive.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so there won't be any choices and consequences in The Beast.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>No, we decided to go with a linear story, very compact and impactful. We think this approach can be stronger, more emotional, and more engaging for players. We just want to tell a story, and because we also want to close and tie some threads from both games, it was important for us to allow ourselves to tell our version of the story, how we envision the canon of Dying Light 1 and 2 combined into what happens next for Kyle and for the future of the series.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We decided to go with a linear story, very compact and impactful. We think this approach can be stronger, more emotional, and more engaging for players.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I know you've been working hard to improve Dying Light 2 post-launch. We had many interviews about those improvements. Are you grabbing all of those improvements, such as for the nighttime experience, and using them in Dying Light: The Beast?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Of course. With every game, we evolve the formula of Dying Light and redefine its gameplay. After the first game, we tried some new things with the second one. Now, we have a better picture and understand what works best from both approaches, so The Beast combines all of those. It is the next step in the franchise's gameplay evolution.</p>
<p>So yes, we are taking all the advancements of Dying Light 2. We are using the same engine, but the engine has also been improved, for example, some of the weather effects. Dying Light grows all the time. We get wiser and smarter as developers, and we understand our community and the player's expectations better, so I think there's a culmination of everything we have done in the series over the 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Are you still going to continue improving Dying Light 2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Yes. That's the plan. We have promised five years of support for the game. There will be more updates coming to Dying Light 2 this year and in the next years. That's all I can say; we don't want to reveal too much right now because the message that we have right now is that Dying Light: The Beast is a new zombie adventure set in the world of Dying Light. Kyle Crane is back and we have a great game on our hands. We'll focus on this for a moment, and then we'll get back to Dying Light 2 quite soon.</p>
<p><strong>Can you answer whether there will be more DLCs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Right now, we are not planning a narrative DLC for Dying Light 2, but the game will be supported and you can expect more content coming to it over the next years.</p>
<p><strong>I'm guessing The Beast is not launching this year, right?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>We are not revealing anything about the release date as of yet. Of course, information will happen quite soon when we're ready to announce that. By the way, I wanted to say that if you look at the title, the trailer, and the Gamescom demo, you would say it's easy: Kyle Crane is the Beast, right? Because of those new powers. But actually, it is not that simple. I would like to leave that question mark over your head.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about the Castor Woods zone?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katarzyna Tarnacka:</strong> Sure. Castor Woods is located in a valley. There are different areas that you can explore. There's a town that was previously a tourist destination but is now abandoned, and there's an industrial area.</p>
<p>There's a lot of woodlands, a lot of farm areas that we can explore, and it's very dense. In fact, we changed the approach to building the areas quite significantly compared to Dying Light 2. This is much more handcrafted, and there's much more attention to detail. We have the best of the best people working on it. By the way, I wanted to mention that about half of the team worked on Dying Light, and having Roger back gave us so much energy and excitement that it's a very beloved project for us.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Right now, we are not planning a narrative DLC for Dying Light 2, but the game will be supported and you can expect more content coming to it over the next years.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Something that I was thinking about is that there are some similarities with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Following</a>. That was also a standalone DLC, and you had vehicles in that game, too. How are you balancing vehicles in this case? Because the main focus of Dying Light is always parkour.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>What we want to do with every Dying Light project is try to find something new in it. We understand what the core, the essence of Dying Light is, and each game experiments to grow them in different directions. Because the overall theme of Dying Light: The Beast is about surviving and survival - surviving those 13 years of experiments and surviving in this world - the survival aspect is very important. We have also applied this to the vehicles, so it's not something that you can drive around mindlessly, smashing into everything and crushing it however you want.</p>
<p>It's also almost like a character in that you have to take care of it, repair it, make sure that it's not damaged, that it's not broken, that it has fuel. So that's one way how we can balance the vehicles. It is important because, on the other hand, we're also going to give people more options to do things in the world. Imagine being chased on foot: usually, you run to the safe zone, but now you can run to the vehicle. Or when you're being chased, you can also use the vehicle to get away faster, right?</p>
<p>But the zombies are even smarter in this game, so they can do things to the vehicle. We understand that vehicles give you a little bit more power, but we balance it through mechanics, making it more immersive, more realistic, and more grounded</p>
<p><strong>In the presentation, they said you needed to repair the vehicles, right? Do they eventually break?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>A vehicle can break. There's another difference between this and The Following, in which you just had one vehicle. Here, you can destroy the vehicle, but there are more vehicles in the world, so actually you can drive more than just the water.</p>
<p><strong>Are there different types of vehicles in Dying Light: The Beast?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Most of them are based on the off-road archetype, but we try to find differences between them.</p>
<p><strong>Can you modify them in some ways?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>I'm not saying anything about this at this stage. Apologies, we're just focusing on what's important for now.</p>
<p><strong>No worries. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>The plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed two lawsuits regarding game addiction. These lawsuits were against some of the biggest companies in the game industry, <span>and the cases were filed in Arkansas and Ohio, respectively.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ufo-50-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game File</a> has reviewed the court records, but the summary is not available unless you subscribe to the website. The court cases were filed against companies such as Epic, Activision Blizzard, Take Two Interactive, Rockstar Games, Roblox, Microsoft,</span>&nbsp;and Sony.</p>
<p>The lawyers representing the companies involved used protections under the First Amendment to defend themselves, saying that "the plaintiffs should be bound by user agreements that mandate arbitration, not lawsuits."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that game addiction lawsuits have been filed, as a dozen video game addiction lawsuits were voluntarily dismissed in June. For example, one woman sued companies in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/column-first-video-game-addiction-lawsuit-got-knocked-out-will-others-follow-2024-06-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">East Saint Louis federal court</a> last fall, alleging that the defendants' "intentional, negligent, deceptive, fraudulent, willful, immoral, reckless and unlawful acts" caused her grandchild to become addicted to video games. Her complaint was written out in a 161-page complaint, stating that their grandchild became addicted at the age of seven and gets angry when told to stop playing games.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, the grandchild allegedly needed "medication therapy, outpatient counseling, and an Individualized Education Plan" at school. However, after Epic looked through their files for the supposed account, it was found that the supposed account the child was playing on was only used to play games for one hour.</p>
<p>Many more of these lawsuits are continuing to come forward, and the latest suits to be thrown out of court were filed by a mother on behalf of her child, saying that the child would play video games for 12 to 14 hours a day and spent approximately $3,000 on in-game transactions and downloadable content.</p>
<p>It isn't the first time that stories have been released speaking about children spending an unprecedented amount of money on in-game currencies, typically using their parents' payment methods without them knowing. One of the most common games in which this happens is Roblox, alongside Fortnite.</p>
<p>Roblox is a controversial game as it is, but it has currently been <a href="https://wccftech.com/turkiye-bans-roblox-due-to-potential-child-exploitation/">banned in Turkey</a> for potential child exploitation, and other countries may begin to follow suit.</p>
