                <p dir="ltr">Mob Entertainment--the development studio behind the jumpscare-heavy survival horror game known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/poppy-playtime/">Poppy Playtime</a>--is suing Google over what it calls "scam" games that are ripping off the studio's intellectual property (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/510282/poppy-playtime-lawsuit-scam-games-google" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">The studio filed <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/816640114/Poppy-Playtime-lawsuit-via-Polygon" rel="nofollow ">the lawsuit</a> earlier this week, claiming that Google has allowed a number of illegal knockoff versions of Poppy Playtime into the Google Play store. Among the unofficial (and unauthorized) games are Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 and Poppy Playtime Chapter 4, neither of which were created by Mob Entertainment. Both games--developed by an entity known as Daigo--are still available for download on the Google Play store at the time of writing.</p><p dir="ltr">These two games are proving especially vexing for Poppy Playtime's creators due to the fact that the game is episodic in nature. Mob Entertainment argues that by allowing illegitimate games to use "Poppy Playtime" in their titles and (indicate that said games are new episodes), Google is allowing other entities to profit from the Poppy Playtime brand by fooling fans into thinking they're playing new chapters of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">These knockoff games aren't just capitalizing on the Poppy Playtime name, however. Mob Entertainment alleges that the developers of these games are illegally using screenshots from Poppy Playtime 2, presenting them as though they're screenshots of gameplay from the fake games instead.</p><p dir="ltr">The Poppy Playtime developer says that the fault lies with Google due to its failure to take action by removing the knockoff games from its digital app storefront. Mob Entertainment said it has issued multiple DMCA takedown requests and has contacted Google directly with regard to the fake versions of Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. The lawsuit says that although Google did remove both of the fake chapters from its app store sometime in December, both games reappeared on the Google Play store in a matter of days, and Google has allegedly taken no further action against the creators of the illegitimate titles.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio claims in the lawsuit that the knockoff games--which feature "many grammatical mistakes" and an unappealing color scheme, among other flaws--have "tarnished" Mob Entertainment's reputation, especially given the fact that Daigo's knockoff titles can fool some users--particularly children--into spending exorbitant amounts of money on a game that isn't genuine. On top of that, the lawsuit states that Google is profiting from the scam, too.</p><p dir="ltr">"Google and Daigo's unauthorized applications use Mob Entertainment's trademarks and copyrighted material to trick consumers into spending up to $95 for a game prior to its release on Google Play," Mob Entertainment asserts. "Google receives 15% or 30% of all sales made by the unauthorized Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 or unauthorized Poppy Playtime Chapter 4 applications."</p><p dir="ltr">Google has yet to publicly respond to the lawsuit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-hit-all-the-right-notes-according-to-analyst/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-february/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally official</a>. After a couple of years of speculation, the Japanese company has unveiled its upcoming console, which will be released at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>The original Nintendo Switch launched nearly eight years ago. Its unique concept of a hybrid handheld/home console won over the gaming world, making it one of the best-selling consoles ever, with over 146 million units sold as of the last update. However, Nintendo is no stranger to missteps like the Wii U, the GameCube, or even the Nintendo 64 to an extent. Early reception for the Nintendo Switch 2 seems positive, but we reached out to <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/analyst/rhys-elliott" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIDiA Research Games Analyst Rhys Elliott</a> to get his perspective on the reveal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>Rhys, didn't Nintendo play it too safe?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>It was smart of Nintendo to just make a bigger, better Switch. It is shrewd of them to leverage the inertia of the original. While the Nintendo Switch 2 plays it safe, the announcement video shows a range of quality-of-life improvements fans have wanted for years, such as a bigger screen (with a seemingly smaller bezel), a sturdier kickstand, and a bigger form factor for the Joy-Con. Nintendo might surprise us with something a little more out of left field, though — like that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-mill-joycons-as-pc-mice-no-mans-sky-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored mouse functionality</a>.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think of the naming specifically?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The straightforward name of ‘’Switch 2’’ is the right choice. Nintendo learned its hard lesson from the Wii U’s confusing naming convention and the abject failure of that console. Many consumers – not just casual but core ones too – thought the Wii U was an add-on for the Wii, similar to the Wii Fit Balance Board or the Wii Motion Plus. This marketing fumble almost destroyed all the gains Nintendo made with the Wii. Things would have been dire if the Switch hadn’t become a cultural phenomenon. And Nintendo’s leadership – more conservative than ever before – understands that.</em></p>
<p><em>Now that Nintendo has all its console eggs in the Switch basket, it simply cannot risk confusing fans. After all, Nintendo’s cross-entertainment efforts across film, theme parks, toys, and even alarm clocks all lead back to its core console brand. If the beating heart of the brand fails, everything falls apart.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Will core gamers flock to the Nintendo Switch 2 or not?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Core gamers are harder to please than more casual gamers and the general public. Other portable companion devices like the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally likely have more processing power than the Switch 2, and core gamers will draw these comparisons. We expect that many of these vocal-minority gamers will buy the Switch 2 nonetheless. And they are not even Nintendo’s main target audience here – families and more casual players are.</em></p>
<p><em>Nintendo has been awfully quiet about the fan-favorite Metroid Prime 4, which is a niche series relative to Nintendo’s other properties but would attract some core gamers. And Pokémon fandom would find a faster-running version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A enticing, as framerate and performance issues seen in the Switch’s more recent Pokémon games have been a major pain point for that community.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the software outlook for the new console, both from first-party and third-party?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Nintendo confirmed that there will be Switch 2 exclusive games. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has sold over 64 million copies, so making Mario Kart 9 a Switch 2 exclusive would be very enticing to attract players to the new machine. Adding more characters and tracks based on Nintendo’s other franchises would appeal to the masses there. Based on the development timelines of their internal studios, it seems Nintendo has been sitting on a goldmine of titles to launch during the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch window. Alongside Mario Kart, I expect to see a new 3D Mario, an upgraded Pokemon, and likely some other surprises in year one. Nintendo will pull out all the stops.</em></p>
<p><em>It is worth noting that it’s been almost five years since Animal Crossing. The inevitable announcement of a sequel to 2020's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons-essential-social-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, which has sold over 45 million copies and became a cultural zeitgeist, will mobilize cozy gamers in full force, too. A new Animal Crossing and Mario Kart would reactivate some of the consumers who played during lockdowns.</em></p>
<p><em>I think backward compatibility is important, too. It is what gamers – and younger ones in particular – have come to expect from the market. It is also what the competition has done with the Series X and PS5 generation. Nintendo would not want to alienate fans here.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What about third party studios?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Except for Ubisoft, many third-party publishers were late to the party with the original Switch, scared off by the Wii U’s underperformance. Things will be different for the Nintendo Switch 2, and third parties will get in on the ground floor. The Switch 2 offers up a springboard for third-party developers to extend the lifecycles of their game catalogs, promising engagement and revenue boosts for third-party developers big and small.</em></p>
<p><em>It will be an opportunity for EA, Ubisoft, and the like to extend the product life cycles of their older PS4- and Xbox One-era games. Speaking of which, Xbox and even PlayStation have been more to launching games on the Switch. I expect this will ramp up on the Switch 2 as these companies continue their off-platform strategies. I can already play Halo on my Steam Deck. I expect I’ll be able to play it on my Switch 2 one day, too.</em></p>

<p>Nine esports organizations have been announced for the Overwatch Champions Series partner program. While a small handful of teams will be familiar to long-time competitive Overwatch fans, many teams once synonymous with the scene are nowhere to be seen.</p>



<p>With the open Overwatch esports ecosystem entering a new era, and while the game itself is challenged by a new “rival”, it’s an important year for Blizzard’s iconic hero shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-meet-the-owcs-partner-teams">Meet the OWCS Partner Teams</h2>



<p>Nine teams have been <a href="https://esports.overwatch.com/en-us/news/owcs-2025-stage-1#:~:text=Competition%20Memo.-,OWCS%20Partner%20Teams,-As%20announced%20in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invited</a> to participate in the OWCS partner program for 2025: four from Asia, three from EMEA (Europe and the Middle East), and two from North America. The regional distinction is based on the roster of players, not where the organization is based or headquartered. Partnered teams will receive a portion of proceeds from in-game team-themed items, as well as direct invites to their region’s stage one main event.</p>



<p>The list of partnered teams includes: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gen.G</strong> (EMEA)</li>



<li><strong>Twisted Minds</strong> (EMEA)</li>



<li><strong>Virtus.pro</strong> (EMEA)</li>



<li><strong>Spacestation</strong> (North America)</li>



<li><strong>Team Liquid</strong> (North America)</li>



<li><strong>Crazy Raccoon</strong> (Asia)</li>



<li><strong>T1</strong> (Asia)</li>



<li><strong>Team Falcons</strong> (Asia)</li>



<li><strong>ZETA DIVISION</strong> (Asia)</li>

<p>Of the list of nine organizations, only two were active during the Overwatch League days: T1 was the academy team for the Seoul Infernal (formerly Philadelphia Fusion), and Gen.G owned the Seoul Dynasty. Several of the now partnered teams entered Overwatch last year in the first season of the open OWCS ecosystem, following the closure of the Overwatch League at the end of 2023.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Missing from this list are some organizations that were amongst the biggest names of the OWL era. Notably, NRG, the organization that owned and operated two-time OWL champion San Francisco Shock, did not receive a partner program invite. This shocked both <a href="https://x.com/amiller/status/1869534757488644122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NRG staff members</a> and long-time OWL fans, especially after NRG finished 4th in the OWCS 2024 World Finals as the NRG Shock. Fans are also somewhat surprised by there being only two NA slots, considering one is occupied by a Team Liquid organization that last competed in Overwatch in 2017.</p>



<p>There is some renewed excitement in Overwatch esports following the move from the franchised OWL to open OWCS. The 2024 OWCS Finals <a href="https://escharts.com/news/overwatch-champions-series-finals-2024-viewership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a slightly higher viewership peak</a> than the one reached at the 2023 OWL Finals. However the game itself is now facing arguably its greatest competitor ever in the recently released Marvel Rivals from NetEase. While the newer game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very slowly embracing esports</a>, a number of former Overwatch pros have already made the jump.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 7 arrives on January 21, and as is usually the case with patch notes for Blizzard's ARPG, the list of changes and bug fixes is very, very long.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's latest season, Season of Witchcraft, is all about players concocting new builds to take advantage of a plethora of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/" data-ref-id="1100-6528778">Witchcraft powers, many themed after Diablo 3's Witch Doctor</a>. But even for those who aren't planning on diving into the game's new seasonal mechanics, there are plenty of major updates to the game's base systems and classes that are worth paying attention to.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Kc7LjVwa8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R4Kc7LjVwa8?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">At the top of that list are Runewords. The powerful socketable items are exclusive to owners of Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion, and they are getting some major buffs going into update 2.1. The amount of Offering generated by many Ritual Runes is going up significantly, while the cost of activating Invocation Runes is going down. Invocation Runes that didn't previously have Overflow bonuses will now have one, overall making Runewords even better than before.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to class changes, many will want to know how the Spiritborn is being adjusted, given how it was by far the most popular (and powerful) class in Season 6 thanks to its arrival as part of Vessel of Hatred. A number of bugs granting the Spiritborn some unintended power, like Masterwork Resolve stacking and the Viscous Shield Paragon Board node granting more damage than it was supposed to, have been fixed.</p><p dir="ltr">That certainly brings down the power level of the Spiritborn a bit, but Blizzard is compensating players by buffing many of the class' underused skills. Centipede enjoyers will enjoy the buffs to the The Devourer (which now deals more damage based on a player's Healing Received bonus) and the Centipede primary Spirit Hall, where Centipede skills will now deal 70% poison damage over six seconds.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the other classes, they're all receiving some love. Barbarians will enjoy a massive buff to Hammer of the Ancients and a major change to their Walking Arsenal passive. Meanwhile, the Sorcerer is gaining some significant Paragon Board buffs alongside two new Ball Lightning Unique items to experiment with. Rogues will receive a few buffs to some underperforming Paragon nodes while also receiving buffs to Shadow Clones, and Druid will see big improvements to Shred and its Ultimate skills, like Cataclysm and Shred. Last but not least, Necromancer will benefit from a number of minion updates.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of minions, the season also brings an overhaul to summoned minions, with Blizzard looking to make the wording of summoning skills and how they interact more consistent across all classes. That means tagging all skills that summon creatures as Summoning skills, having damage done by summons attributed to the player character across the board (and thus allowing summoned units to properly interact with all of a player's damage modifiers, multipliers, and triggers), and updating the wording on various skills to be more uniform.</p><p dir="ltr">"Summoning skills have behaved inconsistently across the classes, making it hard to know how to scale their damage or what effects would interact with your summons," Blizzard writes in the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24171214/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>. "This update aims to standardize their interactions across the board by attributing the damage they deal to the player, rather than the summoned unit."</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Diablo 4 Season 7, check out our interview with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4s-armory-will-be-a-boon-for-eternal-players-and-the-chances-of-a-witch-class/1100-6528885/" data-ref-id="1100-6528885">Blizzard on the addition of the Armory</a> and whether or not the game may ever see the addition of a Witch class.

This means that damage from your Summons will be able to trigger all of your Lucky Hit effects, and interact with all of your damage modifiers, multipliers, and triggers. Note that effects such as Ring of Mendeln still properly increase their damage output based on the damage bonuses you have for the specific Minion type that triggered the effect.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-exploration-deep-dive-devs-say-the-game-wont-hold-your-hand-too-much/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new delay</a>, Ubisoft is throwing Assassin's Creed Shadows fans a bone in the way of a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-exploration-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new deep dive</a> into the exploration part of the game. Game Director Charles Benoit reckons the studio won't hold the player's hand too much, unlike previous installments in the franchise:</p>
<p><em>We didn't want to hold the player's hand too much with icons and markers. We wanted to craft an open world where information was key and would become a form of reward. This made sense in the context of playing a shinobi and fighting for information. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, information is something you need to look for and earn, whether through your spies, NPC encounters, or through your own eyes. In short, we want players to discover all our cool secrets on their own terms through investigation, their spy network, or by observing the world. When exploring the world, you should look out for undiscovered locations (i.e. "?" icons), because there are so many interesting places to seek out, whether in a destroyed camp or a hidden shrine, we want you to always feel a sense of discovery.</em></p>
<p>Players will still climb to high places, the so-called Viewpoints. However, rather than revealing vast amounts of the map, they'll only uncover nearby interests after tagging them through the new observe mechanic (which does not include any companion Eagle, this time around). Each Viewpoint still unlocks a Fast Travel Point, but some are located in the heart of locations filled with enemies, so fast traveling there may not necessarily be a good idea.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Vantage Point" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnUlfHRHt7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While exploring each region, safehouses called "Kakurega" will become available for players to purchase. They become small extensions of the Hideout (the central, fully customizable home base) and offer some of its more practical functions, such as restocking rations/tools/ammunition, accessing gear stash, managing and accepting contracts, restocking scouts, and managing which allies can be called for help. Kakuregas also have Fast Travel Points of their own, and unlike the Viewpoints detailed above, they're always safe.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in Assassin's Creed Shadows, several of Japan's mountains won't be climbable due to their steepness. Due to this, Ubisoft warns players may sometimes be better off simply following roads, while supposed shortcuts may turn out to be unhelpful. If you get lost, though, there's a new toggleable Pathfinder feature that draws a white line overlay to highlight the best path to the objective, provided a quest is tracked and its location has been revealed to the protagonists by a scout.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Pathfinder" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OXycOtXBNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The quest log in Assassin's Creed Shadows is called Objective Board, which Ubisoft says will be key in investigating and locating the assassination targets. Zooming in on a specific target will reveal Opportunities - quest steps that can be individually selected and tracked.</p>
<p>Players are provided with clues as to the location of each opportunity, and they have to deduce where to investigate or go next by connecting the clues to your map.&nbsp;For those who prefer to have clear quest markers, deploying Scouts in the general area indicated by these clues will make things easier.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Target Board" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/faWrGLgBBAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout Assassin's Creed Shadows, the protagonists will be joined by various Scout NPCs who will help them locate quest objectives, gather resources to upgrade the Hideout base, and even cover their tracks by resetting Provincial alerts.</p>
<p>Deploying Scouts lets players scan ahead and reveal a more accurate location for their quest objectives. The more scouts are deployed at once, the greater the scouting radius, increasing the chances of actually finding the target. This is also particularly useful if you have not collected all the clues to reveal your objective, as they can help fill in the gaps in your knowledge. Once deployed, Scouts return at the end of the season and become available again. However, players can choose to pay some in-game currency to a Kakurega to speed up their return to the base.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Scouts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ozpTwqHtXc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, Scouts are also useful to loot the various resource caches of the Wealthy clans, which are simply too large to be carried by a single person. Instead, you'll mark them with a flag to be smuggled out over time by the Scouts. At the end of the season, all flagged stockpiles will be cashed in to upgrade your hideout.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Smuggling" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SIc5hfp0J9A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is out on March 20 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

Now, Genshin Impact's parent company, HoYoverse, may have to send some of that money back to players following a settlement with Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/ftc-nears-settlement-over-loot-boxes-in-popular-video-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, the FTC is near the end of negotiations with HoYoverse to settle a case that began last summer over Genshin Impact's loot box-like currency system. The terms of the deal haven't been disclosed yet, but it's likely going to include a rebate of some amount to players who heavily invested their money into the game.</p><p>Genshin Impact doesn't have a traditional loot box system. Instead, it utilizes a complex Gacha system that allows players to convert real money into in-game currency, which must then be converted again into another currency before players can "wish" for a specific character or rare item. However, there are no guarantees that the wish will be successful, and this system has drawn comparisons to online gambling.</p><p>It's unclear if the settlement with the FTC will also compel HoYoverse to rethink Genshin Impact's approach to in-game currency and wishes. The United Kingdom's government <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uk-government-wont-enact-laws-on-loot-boxes-says-industry-should-self-police/1100-6505562/" data-ref-id="1100-6505562">has declined to create laws against loot boxes</a>, and instead wants the video game industry to police itself.</p><p>Blizzard's Hearthstone was one of the first games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hearthstone-helped-popularize-loot-boxes-then-weathered-the-backlash/1100-6521767/" data-ref-id="1100-6521767">to popularize randomized loot boxes</a>, and one of the first to face a backlash from players over it.

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Nintendo Switch 2 reveal</a> was about as unremarkable as you could imagine for a new console generation reveal. It’s like the Nintendo Switch, a little bit bigger, a little bit… snappier, there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/mario-kart-9-teased-during-switch-2-reveal/">a Mario Kart on screen</a>, and that’s about it. For a company that’s so often been about spiritual successors that experiment and play with confounding new ideas, this is a direct sequel that slaps a 2 on the end.</p>
<p>Nintendo played it safe, in other words, and that’s exactly what they needed to do.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As popular and enduring as Nintendo has been, the company has always had a tendency to be a bit boom and bust. From the highs of the SNES, the Wii, you had the lows of the N64, GameCube and the Wii U, all of which were unable to keep pace with the dominant consoles of their era for one reason or another. The saving grace for Nintendo’s bank balance was that they always had great success with their handhelds. Sure, the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo 3DS were a step down from the industry-altering hits of the Game Boy and Nintendo DS, but the GBA sold over 80 million and the 3DS eventually passed 75 million and I can think of a console manufacturer that would bite your hand off to have those sales figures.</p>
<p>Nintendo don’t have that lifeline anymore, with the Nintendo Switch having become their all-in-one handheld and TV console. This was a genius move back in 2017, consolidating both their audiences, and letting them unite all their development teams around a single platform, but now they’re faced with having to make a new console generation with much less room for mistakes.</p>

<p>So the Nintendo Switch 2 keeps it simple. The reveal trailer shows a console that is built around the same fundamental principles, a hybrid console with detachable controllers that you can play handheld, docked, or as a tabletop screen. But it also showed key areas of improvement.</p>
<div id="attachment_456087"><p id="caption-attachment-456087">The Nintendo Switch 2 looks familiar, but a new Mario Kart is long overdue –&nbsp;image credit: Nintendo</p></div>
<p>A slightly bigger screen follows the trend set out by PC handhelds like the Steam Deck (and the Switch OLED as well), and the focus on the revised Joy-Con also hints at Nintendo addressing weaknesses of their hardware design from the original. The fixed rails are now a snap-in system –&nbsp;probably relying on magnets&nbsp;– that will hopefully be stronger and less creaky, there’s bigger buttons embedded there to make them more usable, and we’ll have to hope that it’s also got some improvements to remove the risk of analogue stick drift.</p>
<p>Most important of all, though, Nintendo kept it simple with the name as well. After the Wii U and 3DS (and the “New Nintendo 3DS”) seemed to confuse the average consumer with their naming, branding this the Nintendo Switch 2 makes it abundantly clear that this is a new console. Sure, there’s the possibility of cross-gen games, but gamers as a whole are familiar and comfortable with those ideas. They definitely know what backward compatibility is, and putting up a screen to say that (almost) all Switch games are compatible was as clear as could be.</p>
<div id="attachment_456147"><p id="caption-attachment-456147">The Joy-Con redesign for Nintendo Switch 2 –&nbsp;image credit: Nintendo</p></div>
<p>There’s also room for a few surprises still… were it not for the fact that so much about this console has already been rumoured and leaked. People very quickly spotted what look to be optical sensors in the Joy-Con connectors, and the animation of Joy-Con skating around with wrist-straps looking like mouse tails certainly suggest that the rumours of a computer mouse input style could be supported.</p>
<p>That’s an intriguing idea, but it’s a small quirk alongside a console that looks thoroughly familiar. And for some that’s disappointing. Where’s the wild experiments of three-pronged controllers, waggle controls or multiple screens? Where’s the new ideas?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think we’re maybe past that point in terms of gaming hardware. The Nintendo Switch was in many ways the Ur-console for Nintendo. It built in the motion sensors for the Joy-Con, it allows for both handheld and TV play, and even used the IR sensor for heart rate measurements and rudimentary shape viewing. The only things it truly missed from Nintendo’s console idea archives were a 3D screen and dual screen features.</p>
<p>And by having everything built in with a decently powerful console, Nintendo were still able to explore all of those ideas in their typically quirky style. We had the Nintendo Labo cardboard accessories, we had Ring Fit, we had Dr Kawashima’s Brain Training come back, and plenty more besides, and in this age of metrics and analytics, Nintendo will &nbsp;have been able to see exactly what works, what sold, what was actually used. Needless to say, I don’t think Labo is making a comeback, but Ring Fit definitely could, even if it loses the heart rate tracking element.</p>
<div id="attachment_345125"><p id="caption-attachment-345125">Ring Fit could have compatibility issues with Switch 2, but the core idea is one that’s worthy of a sequel –&nbsp;image credit: Nintendo</p></div>
<p>Ultimately, the thing that worked best on Nintendo Switch was Mario Kart 8. The Switch has sold a whopping 146 million units, and not that far off half of those consoles have been accompanied by a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (64 million copies sold, not including Wii U sales). It is the single best-selling platform exclusive game, which is just incredible.</p>
<p>No wonder Nintendo teased the next Mario Kart during the Switch 2’s reveal. It’s familiar, it’s safe, it’s easy to understand. It’s going to sell like hot cakes.</p>

<h2>Fifth Place -&nbsp;<b>Kill Team 3rd Edition</b></h2>

<p>The latest version of the Warhammer 40K skirmish wargame streamlined a lot of rules (and got rid of the crazy shapes for measuring), and while the 2nd edition was great, this edition feels more polished and I love the addition of the free faction rules online, letting you build your force out of your existing models without any other purchase. It also introduced a great cooperative/solo mode (at the cost of the narrative campaign play, which we hope they bring back).</p>

<h2><b>Fourth Place - The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</b></h2>



<p><em>Written by Tyler Chancey</em></p>

<p>This year, Monte Cook Games managed two impressive tasks. Adapting the cult horror podcast series The Magnus Archives into a fun, atmospheric TTRPG. Second, through that adaptation introduce a compelling mental Stress system and with it a layer of cosmic horror into the award-winning Cypher System. Truly a wonder to behold.</p>



<h2><b>Third Place - The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-lord-of-the-rings-duel.jpg?itok=pNlkit7Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-lord-of-the-rings-duel.jpg?itok=MI9Mg8Ca 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Giaco Furino</em></p>

<p>When you give the elevator pitch of this game (a LOTR reskinning of <i>7 Wonders: Duel</i>, which is itself a 2-player version of&nbsp;<em>7 Wonders</em>) you'd be excused for thinking this is just a cash grab using a strong IP. But you'd be more wrong than Boromir suggesting one cannot simply walk into Mordor! With a tense back and forth, fun mechanics built around building a card tableau, and multiple routes to victory (including map control, points, and more),&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth</em>&nbsp;was one of the most surprising gaming experiences we've had this year!</p>

<h2><b>Second Place - HeroQuest First Light</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-heroquest-first-light.jpeg?itok=nW8P3jKt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-heroquest-first-light.jpeg?itok=xtO-3CEZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Andrew Stretch</em></p>

<p>For families wanting to begin to broach more complicated TTRPGs with young family members HeroQuest First Light is an all-in-one box that will have them dungeon diving in no time. With a versatile game board that can be explored nearly infinite ways, and quick to grasp but satisfying combat, it becomes a bridge between a traditional board game and a pen and paper RPG. An added benefit is the GM Companion App that will allow for a party of four to explore without needing a GM lowering the barrier to entry even further.</p>

<h2><b>First Place - Wyrmspan</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-wyrmspan.jpeg?itok=BQua3WM0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-wyrmspan.jpeg?itok=N-HrbQ6U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Giaco Furino</em></p>

<p><em>Wyrmspan</em>&nbsp;is a game that takes something incredible and perfects upon it further, pushing the design right up to the limits to create a bold, inviting, and strategically rewarding experience. I think&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan&nbsp;</em>may be one of the most engrossing gaming experiences I've had this year, and fans of the original&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>&nbsp;absolutely need to check this game out as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Even if the birding aspect is what initially drew you into&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, rest assured that this game - full of its own swath of gorgeous illustrations - will completely sink its talons into you and your gaming group!</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> continues to evolve over a year and a half after release, having seen major changes to its endgame, difficulty, and even items. Now, as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/">Diablo 4 Season 7, Season of Witchcraft</a>, Blizzard is adding another permanent game-changing feature to its ARPG--the Armory.</p><p dir="ltr">What the Armory does is simple: It lets players save up to five different loadouts per character. With the click of a button, players can swap out the entirety of their equipped gear, but more importantly, also their skill points and paragon points. Once a loadout is saved, characters can freely swap to it at no charge, giving easy access to up to five different builds and encouraging players to experiment and try new strategies.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Kc7LjVwa8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R4Kc7LjVwa8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The Armory is in many ways the culmination of how Blizzard's mindset has changed in the time since Diablo 4 launched. Whereas once respeccing skill points and Paragon Boards (or even re-rolling item affixes at the Enchanter) came with a hefty gold cost, those costs have gotten less prohibitive over time. Now, with the Armory, players can completely swap out almost every major choice for their character and flip builds as often as they want, without having to pay any kind of fee.</span></p><p dir="ltr">It may seem like an obvious addition, but it's a bigger deal than it at first seems, and one that will no doubt lead to more creative builds. To learn more and discuss the kind of paradigm shift the Armory represents, GameSpot chatted with Diablo 4 design director Dan Tanguay and game designer Sean White about how Blizzard's stance on a feature like the Armory has changed. Along the way we touched on other Season 7 additions, like how the team decided on its numerous Witch Doctor-inspired powers and the chances of Diablo 4 getting an entire Witch-themed class in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">When Diablo 4 launched and began to transition into the live-service game we know today, Tanguay said some aspects of the game didn't line up with what players wanted. That led to Blizzard taking a hard look at player feedback and implementing changes like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/">Season 4's Loot Reborn update</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-completely-changing-how-it-handles-difficulty-taking-a-page-from-diablo-3/1100-6526194/">major difficulty revamp as part of Season 6</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Next on the player feedback list--the addition of the Armory. Despite the feature appearing in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/">Diablo 3</a> and Blizzard's mobile spin-off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-immortal/">Diablo Immortal</a>, Tanguay said the decision to add the Armory to Diablo 4 wasn't so simple. He said because Diablo 4 was a mix of both returning franchise players as well as new ones, the team first needed time to learn what players wanted from the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4429538-diablo4thearmory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429538" data-ratio="0.56246648793566" data-width="1865" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4429538-diablo4thearmory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429538"></a><figcaption>The Armory allows characters to save up to five loadouts at once.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4429538-diablo4thearmory.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At launch, the team had a strong desire to "make choices matter," according to White. But over time, the game added more and more choices for players but didn't give them more tools to experiment. That led to Blizzard having to make a choice about what direction it wanted its ARPG to go in, Tanguay said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Do we want to encourage that kind of experimentation or do we want to really say you have to start over again in order to do this experimentation, or at the very least pay a cost that you have to spend some time investing in, and put barriers in front of that experimentation?" Tanguay said. "Ultimately we decided, based on what we heard from players, was that we didn't want many barriers to experimentation. We found, even in later seasons, the more we encouraged players to experiment and the fewer barriers we had, they were even starting to make more and more alternate characters. Ultimately Diablo 4 and Diablo games in general have a wide variety of classes and builds within those classes, so it makes sense to try and encourage players to explore all that space much like you would explore the overworld of Sanctuary."</p><p dir="ltr">Though much of Diablo 4's live-service has been dedicated to its seasonal servers, the game's non-seasonal Eternal Realm looks to benefit from the addition of the Armory in a big way. There, players who dread creating a new character every few months can now easily experiment with new builds, without feeling like they have to start over.</p><p dir="ltr">"There is a strong contingent of Eternal players who really want to continue playing their character," Tanguay said. "The Armory very much appeals to them, because now they have their character and they can create variations on that character without any of the time pressures…with seasons."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4429539-diablo4poisonfrogservant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429539" data-ratio="0.56235697940503" data-width="1748" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4429539-diablo4poisonfrogservant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429539"></a><figcaption>Witchcraft Powers like the Poison Frog servant serve as a homage to Diablo 3's Witch Doctor.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4429539-diablo4poisonfrogservant.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While the Armory will be a permanent addition going forward, the rest of the season revolves around players earning new Witchcraft powers to take their builds into overdrive. Many of those powers, like Piranhado, Poison Frog servant, and Soul Harvest, are inspired by the Witch Doctor class from Diablo 3. Once the team had decided on its approach when it came to depicting Diablo 4's "self-serving" swamp witches for the season's theme, bringing in some Witch Doctor flavor seemed like a natural fit, White said.</p><p dir="ltr">"There are parallels to Witch Doctor there which paved the way to 'Alright, we are kind of doing swamp witches, let's try to bring back some fan favorites from Diablo 3,'" White said. "I'm a big Witch Doctor fan. But at the same time, let's also try to put a cool spin on it and bring some new stuff that is still witch-themed but has never been seen before."</p><p dir="ltr">With no Witch Doctor in Diablo 4 and a whole new host of Witch-themed powers, it certainly seems like there is potential for a fully fleshed out Witch class--something ARPG rival <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/">Path of Exile 2</a> currently has. Tanguay wouldn't rule the idea out, and said ultimately if something is popular as part of a season, the team would find a way to make it a permanent addition in some shape or form.</p><p dir="ltr">"Right now our feeling is those powers are going to be season-only right now," Tanguay said. "We may incorporate some new ones of them down the road like how we brought some of the powers back as items in previous seasons, but that does then is leave that door open to say, 'You know what, Season of Witchcraft was great for exploring what witchcraft might be, but down the road, maybe we could have a class that's like that.' Not saying we're going to have one, [but] we've just left that door open. It's important for us, especially as a live service, to make sure we're not closing too many doors so that we can continue that dialogue with players and understand what they want out of the game and be able to react to that."</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 7 begins January 21.</p>

Following yesterday's long-awaited Switch 2 reveal, Nintendo has started opening up registrations for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">previously announced public hands-on play sessions</a>, confirming that attendees will have up to four hours play tie with the new console.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Switch 2 World Tour, as the company's calling the months-long event, runs from 4th April until sometime in June. It's set to visit 15 cities spanning four continents - Europe, North America, Oceania, and Asia - in that time, starting with Paris and New York.
</p>
<p>
And for those eager to attend and check out Nintendo's new console, <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/#/events">registrations are starting to go live</a>. Currently, registration is open for most European venues - Paris, London, Milan, Berlin - with other Madrid, Amsterdam, and venues in other territories to follow.

<p>
What's perhaps most notable is the length of time attendees can spend with Switch 2. Anyone looking to go hands-on must select a 60-minute arrival window when they register, but actual play sessions officially last four hours. In Europe, at least - details currently available for North American venues point to significantly shorter play sessions, lasting two and a half hours.
</p><p>
It's worth reiterating registration doesn't guarantee entry to Nintendo's hands-on events, as tickets will be assigned based on a randomly selected draw. You can, however, register as a group - provided everyone attending has a Nintendo Account linked to the same family group.
</p>
<p>
As to what'll be available to play during each session, Nintendo hasn't yet said - but it seems likely a new Mario Kart will be there given its prominence in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">this week's Switch 2 reveal</a>. We can expect more details on the console's launch line-up during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct on 2nd April</a>, but in the meantime, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we know so far</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rog-ally-v-rog-ally-x-which-is-best/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rog-ally-vs-rog-ally-x-%E2%80%93-which-is-the-best-of-the-best.1085487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rog-ally-v-rog-ally-x-which-is-best/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Asus ROG Ally was considered the best gaming handheld device on the market – until the ROG Ally X showed up. This next-generation variant of Asus’ Windows 11 gaming handheld was released in July 2024, which means gamers worldwide have had more than half a year to fully get to grips (no pun intended) with the device.</p>



<p>I’m the proud owner of both the ROG Ally and the ROG Ally X, and I figured it was about time I settled the comparison beef once and for all. Is the ROG Ally X worth the massive price increase over the ROG Ally, or are you better off sticking with the original and saving a few hundred dollars?</p>



<p>Let’s find it – it’s time for ROG Ally v ROG Ally X – the battle between the best.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-the-rog-ally-x-worth-it">Is The ROG Ally X Worth It?</h2>



<p>The ROG Ally can be bought brand new for around $450 – $600, depending on where you look. By comparison, the ROG Ally X costs up to $800, which is a considerable increase.</p>



<p>But is the extra power under the hood of the Asus ROG Ally X worth the jump?</p>



<p>I went straight from an Ally to an Ally X, and the difference was noticeable both in and outside the device. Internally, the ROG Ally X has 8 GB more RAM and a 1 TB SSD as standard, which beats the Ally’s 512 GB SSD into the ground. The biggest selling point of the Ally X is the battery – while the Ally has a 40Wh battery, the Ally X boasts a beasty 80Wh battery.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, the Ally X isn’t all that much bigger to account for the boosted hardware and capabilities – it’s just 65 grams heavier than the Ally, which was released in 2023.</p>



<p>Both devices utilise the same screen and speakers, but the Ally X has an extra USB-C port and the micro SD card slot was relocated to counter an overheating issue that was present in the Ally – <strong>and still is</strong>. That extra port means that you can run a USB-C headset on the device while charging it, which is a nice bonus.</p>



<p>Asus also reported that the Ally X has a better internal cooling solution, with fans that boast more blades.</p>



<p>On the surface, the ROG Ally X is quite different. The overall shape of the device has been rounded off in place, the default colour is black as opposed to white, the rear ‘extra’ buttons have been shrunken down, and the thumbsticks feel much more durable and tactile.</p>



<p>But is all that worth the price increase, or should you stick with the ROG Ally? I put both of these handheld gaming devices to the test.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-rog-ally-still-hold-up">Does The ROG Ally Still Hold Up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Ally X is the new king of handhelds</figcaption></figure>



<p>Until recently, the ROG Ally was my flagship handheld, and it was a trusty one at that. However, I did have a few issues</p>



<ul>
<li>On the ‘turbo’ mode (25W or 30W plugged in), the heat generated by the ROG Ally would be extreme after too long</li>



<li>Also on turbo, the battery life was laughably short, with a AAA game killing the battery in around 30 minutes</li>



<li>I was never a fan of the stark white colour for a handheld, as it’s bound to get dirty or discoloured</li>
</ul>



<p>It was fine for plane rides and commutes, but beyond that, I couldn’t sing its praises too much. It’s a Windows 11 device, just like the Ally X, but it’s not like I was using it for multitasking and web browsing – the Windows interface just doesn’t translate well to a handheld device like this.</p>



<p>Once I switched to the ROG Ally X, the benefits were plain as day.</p>



<p>For example, I played Diablo 4 off-charge and on turbo mode, and I was able to coax around an hour and a half out of the battery before it collapsed in on itself. That’s more than enough to please me, but I was able to notice a performance boost too, thanks to the enhanced RAM in the Ally X.</p>



<p>The face buttons, shell, multi-directional d-pad, and even the shoulder buttons (which are more ‘mouse-clicky’ on the Ally X) all look and feel superb, and overall, the device is much more attractive in a black-on-black aesthetic. Also, the front-mounted speakers sound much more powerful. Having the volume on just ’20’ is more than enough for me.</p>



<p>I have no gripes with the Ally X – <strong>yet</strong>.</p>



<p>Is the Ally X worth the money, though? I’d say so – but $800 is a severe price point for any gaming device, least of all a handheld with a relatively limited battery life and a UI that just isn’t comfortable when it comes to gaming.</p>



<p>I can see the improvement over the Ally, and that’s what I was going for. I would have liked an upgraded screen or a switch-up in the RGB on the device, but I’ll take what I’ve been given, I suppose. It’s still a nice 7-inch IPS display running at 120Hz.</p>



<p>While you can still get the Asus ROG Ally, I just don’t think it’s worth investing the cash if you’re not getting the best and most up-to-date available model on the market. Ultimately, it’s your decision.</p>
