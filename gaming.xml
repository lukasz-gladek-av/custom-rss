            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-players-wont-be-missing-out-if-they-largely-ignore-one-protagonist<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has assured that Assassin's Creed Shadows players who largely ignore one of the dual protagonists won't be "missing out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Jonathan Dumont told <a href="https://screenrant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-world-protagonists-jonathan-dumont-interview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a> said Assassin's Creed Shadows won't force players to play as both the stealthy Naoe and the brutish Yasuke in equal measure when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-this-time-by-another-month">it arrives March 20</a>, nor will it lock off certain parts of the game to those who prefer one over the other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think you're missing out on things too much," Dumont said. "I think it's more on your preference to [say], 'Okay, I'll see how the game will adapt a little bit to the character if you choose one over the other.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They get individual introductions and then they get their own questline also. Let's say [for] Naoe, a personal questline cannot be played by Yasuke and those are two distinct things. But the core of the game can be pick your character and the game adapts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoe has a play style reminiscent of the original Assassin's Creed games or, ironically, the most recent Assassin's Creed Mirage, which prioritises stealth and encourages full combat only as a last resort.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a stark difference to Yasuke who emulates the more aggressive elements of the role-playing game Assassin's Creed entries, meaning Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. He charges head on into battle instead of sticking to the shadows like Naoe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're not imposing players try to split the time," Dumont said. "If you prefer one character for any reason, you can play maybe, I don't know, I'm not going to put a percentage, but quite a bit of the game using one of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But if you want to balance it out... I play quite a bit balanced out and what happens is, I play with one for three, four, five hours, and then I switch, and then I just play two, three hours. Usually I play stealth and then I [say], 'All right, let me destroy some camps and stuff all right for a while.' And then I just change like that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot rests on the shoulders of Assassin's Creed Shadows as not only the long-awaited Japan-set entry and the first full Assassin's Creed since 2020, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">a struggling Ubisoft needs it to perform well</a> following recent flops and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-investors-grill-ceo-cfo-on-potential-tencent-sale-delays-and-financial-woes">investor frustration</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not enjoyed a particularly positive promotional period so far, however, with the development team having to apologize on separate occasions for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">inaccuracies in Assassin's Creed Shadows' depictions of Japan</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">using a historical recreation group's flag without permission</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design, and combined with the two delays, fans are growing increasingly impatient as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-publisher-is-not-worried-about-the-game-influencing-violence/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>GTA 6’s parent company has stated they are “not worried” about the game influencing violent behaviour in the real world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Violence in video games has been a controversial subject in the industry for years, with the GTA series often being the poster boy for such campaigns. The popular series will receive a brand new instalment this fall, with Rockstar finally releasing GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year</a>. Many wonder if new allegations related to violence will pop up again, but Take-Two’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, doesn’t seem to be worried about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/10/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-take-two-interactive-chairman-and-ceo-strauss-zelnick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/gta-6-publisher-claps-back-against-tv-media-inciting-disproven-violent-video-game-rhetoric/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Video Gamer</a>), Zelnick was asked whether he had concerns about GTA 6’s violence impacting the real world. He responded that he was “not worried.” Zelnick added, “To be clear: entertainment doesn’t create behaviour; entertainment reflects behaviour.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CEO explained that entertainment allows people to express and engage with feelings as it tells stories. “The notion [that] entertainment creates behaviour has been tested and disproved over and over again.” Therefore, he isn’t concerned about GTA 6 influencing people to commit violence against others in the real world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zelnick also discussed TV shows and movies with “very realistic-looking” violence, which doesn’t influence wrong behaviour; hence, he’s “not worried about photorealistic video games” inciting such behaviour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Take-Two’s CEO recently spoke about GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping sell more consoles</a>. Also, the parent company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-stock-hits-all-time-high-after-gta-6-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stocks rose to an all-time high</a> when they reconfirmed the fall 2025 release window. Do you think GTA 6 will influence violent behaviour in the real world?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>VALORANT Masters Bangkok is the first international event of the 2025 VCT schedule, and marks the first time an international tournament comes to Southeast Asia. Bangkok is the first stop in the 2025 international VALORANT world tour, with Masters Toronto and Champions Paris to come later on.</p>



<p>Like last year, the first international event of the year features a smaller pool of teams, but there will be no shortage of talent at VALORANT Masters Bangkok 2025. Here’s everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-masters-bangkok-teams">VALORANT Masters Bangkok Teams</h2>



<p>Eight VALORANT teams are attending Masters Bangkok. The top two teams from each international league’s VCT Kickoff tournament directly qualified for the event.</p>

<li>Team Vitality (EMEA #1)</li>



<li>Team Liquid (EMEA #2)</li>



<li>DRX (Pacific #1)</li>



<li>T1 (Pacific #2)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-valorant-masters-bangkok-schedule">VALORANT Masters Bangkok Schedule</h2>



<p>VALORANT Masters Bangkok will consist of two stages: an eight-team Swiss stage, followed by a four-team playoff. In the Swiss stage, number 1 seeds and number 2 seeds will be matches against each other in the first round. In rounds two and three, teams with the same record will face each other. Teams that win two matches will advance to the playoffs, teams that lose two matches will be eliminated. The playoffs will be a double-elimination bracket.</p>



<p>The first round of Swiss stage matches have been set:</p>



<ul>
<li>EDG vs. Liquid – February 20, 10am UTC</li>



<li>DRX vs. Sentinels – February 20, 1pm UTC</li>



<li>Vitality vs. T1 – February 21, 10am UTC</li>

</ul>



<p>The Swiss stage will run from February 20 until February 24. Playoffs will begin on February 27 and conclude with the grand final on March 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-masters-bangkok-prize-pool">VALORANT Masters Bangkok Prize Pool</h2>



<p>The teams are competing for a $500,000 prize pool, as well as the lion’s share of 10 VCT Championship points. These points are used at the end of the year to determine which teams qualify for Champions. </p>



<ul>

                <p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said that Activision offered world-famous skateboarder Tony Hawk $300k to lend his name and likeness to the first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game--an offer that came at a low point for him financially.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick claimed that Hawk was living in his car at the time, going through his second divorce. Kotick said that Hawk was desperate for money, so they signed him up with an additional 1.5% royalty rate that they renegotiated further as time went on.</p><p>"We made Pro Skater, did well, but Pro Skater 2, that was an awesome game. And that was the explosion of the business in some ways," Kotick explained.</p><p>In 2019, Hawk said that Activision offered him a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/tony-hawk-activision-offered-him-500000-in-royalties-but-he-said-no.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$500k buyout for any future royalties</a>, but he turned that down. Hawk's decision paid off, as he revealed that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/bk8osb/til_tony_hawk_got_4_million_dollars_on_one_of_his/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he received four million in royalty checks</a> after Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 was released.</p><p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was released in 1999 for the original PlayStation. It was then later remade for modern platforms in 2020 as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2. The last mainline entry in the series was 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-hes-no-longer-working-with-activisi/1100-6457017/" data-ref-id="1100-6457017">marking the end of Hawk's contract with Activision</a>.</p><p>While remakes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-was-reportedly-rejected-in-favor-of-more-call-of-duty-content/1100-6523189/" data-ref-id="1100-6523189">reportedly not in the works</a>, Hawk <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">confirmed that the series will continue on</a>.</p>

This is according to posts on LinkedIn from recently laid off staff and confirmed by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-continues-layoffs-with-abrupt-communications-and-5am-emails">reporting from <em>Game Developer</em></a> and<em> <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-unity-ceo-s-internal-announcement-to-staff-amidst-the-layoffs/">80.lvl</a></em>. According to reports, employees were notified via emails sent out at 5 AM local time, while the layoffs affect a number of different teams within the the game engine software company. According to <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/an-update-on-behavior/1598451/11">a message posted in the Unity forums</a>, one of the casualties in the layoffs was the entire Behavior department which built tools that assisted in NPC scripting. It’s not clear at this point how many employees were impacted.</p><p>Unity has been on shaky ground for the last two years, undergoing several rounds of layoffs amid other upheavals. In January 2024, Unity eliminated 25 percent of its workforce or around 1,800 employees. Before that in November 2023, Unity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/28/23980250/unity-confirms-layoffs">closed several office locations and cut 265 jobs</a>.</p><p>Before that was one of the events that likely contributed to all the layoffs: the company’s disastrous deployment of its Runtime fee. The fee, which initially intended to charge developers a small fee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">for every download</a> of a Unity game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23872330/unity-developers-react-new-pricing-model">was roundly rejected by prominent indie developers</a>. Several voiced their concerns on social media, while others threatened and, in the case of a collective of mobile developers, actually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/15/23875396/unity-mobile-developers-ad-monetization-tos-changes">enacted a boycott of the software</a>.</p><div><p>The fallout led to Unity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/22/23882768/unity-new-pricing-model-update">revamping the runtime fee</a> and resulted in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/9/23910441/unity-ceo-president-john-riccitiello-out-retire">CEO John Riccitiello retiring</a> less than a month after the runtime announcement. <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Unity for comment.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The more we talked about it, however, the more it felt actually possible as well as a natural step for the game. Why else would most bosses allow five characters to enter if not for five different vocations?”</p><p>There’s no specific release date for the Monk class yet, though it will be available to test starting on February 25. ClipSoft plans to release new blogs with more details about the class in the coming weeks.</p><p>“All in all, we see the addition of a new vocation as an opportunity to rekindle the sense of discovery that was always part of <em>Tibia</em>,” said ClipSoft. “A chance to learn the intricacies of a new vocation, experiment with new strategies, and adapt to new team compositions.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More layoffs are happening at Unity. According to a post on its forums by Shanee Nishry, Unity has let go the team working on Unity Behavior along with other staff.</p>



<p>In her post, <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/an-update-on-behavior/1598451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nishry says</a> that the entire was included in the latest round of layoffs with support ending immediately. </p>



<p>“Thank you for your love and support for our project,” Nishry said. “Unfortunately we were told today that our team is included in the latest round of layoffs and we will not be able to support you any longer.</p>



<p>“I’ve reached out to leadership to ask if they can open source the project, but there is no guarantee.”</p>



<p>Nishry, who has been with Unity for five years, closed saying she wished Behavior could’ve been brought to the finish line. For those unaware, Behavior <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.behavior@1.0/manual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was a tool in development</a> for “authoring behaviors used to control non-player characters (NPCs) or objects.”</p>



<p>As far as other teams including in the layoffs, they seem to spread across the company with another senior software developer, Coline Turquin, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294738324894691329/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirming that she was</a> also “part of the recent layoffs”. Other employees have also taken to social media to reveal that they were let go by the company.</p>



<p>As of writing, Unity has yet to make an official statement on the layoffs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Unity for comment and clarification regarding how many people were let go in this latest wave. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. In 2024, the company let <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-laying-off-25-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go roughly 1,800 people</a>. Those layoffs cost Unity <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-cost-unity-205-million-to-make-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around $205 million</a>.</p>

                <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has commented on the long wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI </a>and spoke out against the idea that artificial intelligence technologies will surpass the "creative genius" that is only possible from humans. In an interview, Zelnick said the wait for GTA 6 has been so long in part because developer Rockstar Games is seeking "perfection."</p><p>"What Rockstar Games puts into all of their titles is a desire for creative perfection, which is why it takes a long time and why it's complex. We don't claim success until it occurs," Zelnick told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2POQ_toFtgc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>.</p><p>GTA 5 was released all the way back in 2013 and has been released across three generations of console platforms, in addition to PC. In total, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">sold more than 210 million copies</a>. Zelnick said GTA 5 has been the "standard bearer" at Take-Two and the video game industry overall in terms of sales success.</p><p>"Grand Theft Auto 6? What can I say? There is enormous anticipation inside our company and in the marketplace as a whole. We couldn't be more excited," he said.</p><p>After years of development, GTA 6 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">set for release in Fall 2025 across PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a>. Zelnick recently admitted the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">could be delayed</a>, but for now, it remains on track for release this year. Before this, Zelnick said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-gta-6-news-is-frustrating-fans-take-two-boss-admits/1100-6528571/" data-ref-id="1100-6528571">understands that fans are frustrated over the long wait for GTA 6. </a></p><p>As for his comments on AI, Zelnick said Take-Two's teams have been using digital tools since the earliest days of video game development, going on to say that the video game industry is known to be an innovator in this area. He said he expects that to continue with new AI technologies, but he also made it clear that AI cannot replace a human when it comes to creativity.</p><p>"The genius is human. The tools may be digital, but the creative genius is human," he said. "We believe in protecting and paying human beings. We believe we ought to pay for their work if it's replicated by AI after the work is done. We don't think it's the right thing to do to ask someone to perform once, use their work over and over again, and not pay for it. We don't think that's right."</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said artificial intelligence as a term makes no sense because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-boss-discusses-ai-and-how-machines-dont-learn/1100-6529316/" data-ref-id="1100-6529316">machines do not learn--humans do.</a> "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever," he said. "I have no doubt that what is considered AI today will help make our business more efficient and help us do better work, but it won't reduce employment."</p><p>In other news, Zelnick recently discussed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-launch-could-help-improve-console-sales-significantly-take-two-boss-says/1100-6529348/" data-ref-id="1100-6529348">a big game like GTA 6 could help lift console sales. </a></p>

			<p>A new era of online multiplayer PvP battles will be coming on March 4, when War Robots: Frontiers releases and is set to redefine the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steel-hunters-is-wargamings-new-mech-themed-hero-shooter/">tactical mech warfare genre</a>. For those who want to play this game, it will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One <a href="https://warrobotsfrontiers.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for free</a>. To celebrate the announcement of the release date, you can check out the brand new cinematic trailer that was released.</p>
<p><iframe title="War Robots: Frontiers | Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWLV7KZFSH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In War Robots: Frontiers, players will get the opportunity to be in the cockpit of their mechs and experience piloting a War Robot. War Robots is already a massive franchise, with over 270 million fans across the globe. War Robots: Frontiers is said to be a huge step for the franchise, a game that has been built from the ground up for both PC and console in Unreal Engine 5. It will be a game that is ideal for those who like competitive play.</p>
<p>Its also been developed to be relatively accurate and authentic, where every step the mech takes will reverberate with authentic weight. Every shot that is fired from your mech will have realistic recoil. Being developed in Unreal Engine 5 means that this game will give players a highly realistic and dynamic battlefield to fight on, where every single move and shot made by the mechs will have realistic movement and help you feel as if you are actually in the mech.</p>
<p>Customization will be a major feature of War Robots: Frontiers, where players can design their mechs in any way they want to, from the chassis, core, weapons, and skill upgrades to create a mech that fits your playstyle and the way you want to tackle combat. By having this much customization, you can choose whether your mech is a huge chunk of steel with firepower, or you can streamline it so that it has agile defenses and the ability to outplay the opponent.</p>
<p>If you're new to the War Robots franchise, this game is aiming to be highly accessible for the newer generations and new players. This includes the ability to play the game by utilizing prebuilt mechs so that you can get used to the look and feel of the game before being overwhelmed by building your own mech. Of course, for those who prefer to build from the ground up, you'll be able to customize it as much as you need to in order to make it battlefield-ready.</p>
<p>The game will also have cross-platform online play, so you can play with your friends on PC and console. There will be multiple game modes available, including ranked modes for those who prefer a dedicated challenge.</p>
<p>War Robots: Frontiers will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on March 4.</p>

It’s not clear at this point how many employees were impacted.</p><p>Unity has been on shaky ground for the last two years, undergoing several rounds of layoffs amid other upheavals. In January 2024, Unity eliminated 25 percent of its workforce or around 1,800 employees. Before that in November 2023, Unity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/28/23980250/unity-confirms-layoffs">closed several office locations and cut 265 jobs</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610165/unity-layoffs-2025-runtime-fee">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTExODI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272699/unity-6-game-engine-release">Unity attempts to turn things around with its latest game engine release</a></h2><div><p><cite>Illustration by Cath Virginia / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Unity hasn’t had the easiest go of things as of late, but as part of its efforts to get back in the good graces of game developers, the company has released Unity 6 globally. In addition to new features like tools that let developers to target mobile web, the game engine maker is also promising that it will dedicate “long-term” resources to “to enhance feature sets and deliver new functionality while maintaining ease of upgrade and continued stability,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241017906915/en/Unity-6-Launches-Globally-Next-Gen-Game-Development-Platform-Delivers-Enhanced-Performance-and-Stability/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-RqSGyeNvWF-qZ8hKEMz48Z5g0wAIXjK73252wRUvTxLWJT50v2g3Ei-19qH0fyPszGrim8IhAkVNXbaI1AGppOzkqEXpa07kut2m9xviGvGKzEpgVj8oZTJfPwAW_-x3g==">according to a press release</a>.</p><p>Unity is a widely-used game development engine powering games like <em>Among Us,</em> <em>Hollow Knight</em>, and many more, but the release of Unity 6 follows a turbulent period in the company’s history. Unity charges developers on a per-user basis, but in September 2023, the company announced a new pricing scheme that charged developers per install of their games after a certain threshold.

Instead of the runtime fee, Unity will return to a per-seat subscription model.</p><p>Last year, Unity caused a stir within the game development community with a controversial update to its pricing model. Instead of charging developers a set monthly rate based on the number of users utilizing the software, it would implement a pay-per-download scheme that charged developers every time their game was downloaded.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> features an absolutely dreadful spider monster - a spider that, going by preview encounters and trailers, strives for the point on the Venn diagram between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> and the demon arachnid from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a>. The spider monster is called the Lala Barina. If I saw "Lala Barina" out of context I would assume I was reading about a successor to Suzuki's subcompact automobile the Holden Barina, whose brave and sturdy outline once graced the roads of Oceania. I would not picture a giant, greasy rose blossom with jet-black darting mandibles. I would not picture nests of scarlet silk and status effects literally out the wazoo.</p><!--more-->

<p>The good news is that the Lala Barina isn't just an absolute bastard spider. It's a teacher. This is the impression given by Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and director Yuya Tokuda, who have been talking to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/521156/monster-hunter-wilds-interview-preview">Polygon</a> about the game's newly newcomer-friendly design. "Looking back at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a> and Monster Hunter Rise, we focused on where first-time players would drop out from the game," Tsujimoto told the site. "From there, we analyzed that player data and looked into how much we can address - that was our homework for Monster Hunter Wilds."</p>
<p>The fruits of this analysis come across throughout in the addition of handholds like the Seikret, a rideable lizard who'll guide you towards your prey. But they're especially apparent in the game's first few hours, which are sort of one big tutorial. While learning the ropes, you'll tangle with the toadlike Chatacabra, the bovine Doshaguma (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-alpha-doshaguma-the-doomed-dragonfighting-guinea-pig-of-my-monster-hunter-wilds-demo">alas! My beloved</a>), the Brute Wyvern Quematrice, the Rompompolo - a T-Rex crossed with a mosquito - and our lovely friend the Lala Barina. </p>
<p>Should you find these creatures appalling, you may rejoice in the knowledge that they are there to subtly inculcate the basics of Monster Hunting. "At the beginning of the game, you'll first fight Chatacabra, which teaches the players how to avoid big attacks," Tokuda explained to Polygon. "For Quematrice, the next monster that you fight, it uses its long tail. It has a very wide area attack, so it teaches you to dodge. Next is Lala Barina, which uses a lot of tricky movements; it moves out of sight of players, so it teaches them how to control their camera." The Lala Barina harbours other lessons for new players: its many status effects result from a rich diet of forest mushrooms. Perhaps you'll learn about those mushrooms while it's kicking your arse.

</p><p>You know, it all reminds me of how Halo: Combat Evolved taught us the basics of camera control. Halo did it by having a guy hold up a flashlight for you to look at while securely lodged in a cryopod. Seems a bit gentle by comparison. Perhaps Capcom could shore up the association by having the Lala Barina wield some glowsticks. This would also usefully prevent it from using some of its limbs to murder you. </p>
<p>I'm also reminded of Bloodborne, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/souls-devs-fromsoftware-also-want-bloodborne-on-pc-even-if-the-games-own-director-cant-admit-it">which will surely release on PC one of these days</a>: there's a boss in that game, Father Gascoigne, who has a terrifying launch attack that opens with him dragging his blade across the terrain in a cacophony of sparks. That move always used to paralyse me till I realised that the theatrical wind-up exists to teach you how to parry. Yes, this seems closer to the Wilds experience.</p>
<p>I'm writing this article partly because Wilds is making a big deal of tying the simulated ecology into the "gamier" elements, and I really like the idea that certain boss anatomies and behaviours are elaborate pedagogic devices. Perhaps building on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/animal-well-review">my Animal Well review</a> from last year, I think there is much to say about how digital interfaces may become bestial and how beasts may come to resemble HUD elements and how all that connects to older traditions of animal symbolism and heraldry. If you're less enthused about such topics than you are bothered about having to fight a schoolmasterly tarantula, the buried lede, I guess, is that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia">Monster Hunter Wilds has an arachophobia mode</a>.</p>

<p>Number one ranked chess player and five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen is reportedly close to joining esports organization Team Liquid. The signing of the consensus best chess player in the world would align with the upcoming debut of chess at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<h2 id="h-magnus-carlsen-in-advanced-negotiations-with-liquid">Magnus Carlsen in “Advanced Negotiations” with Liquid</h2>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/en/articles/sources-magnus-carlsen-in-advanced-negotiations-with-team-liquid/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> from Sheep Esports reporter Alejandro “anonimotum” Gomis, Magnus Carlsen is likely to sign a deal with Liquid. Gomis notes in their report that with chess debuting at the Esports World Cup in 2025, Liquid is likely seeking to expand its winnings potential. In the inaugural EWC in 2024, Liquid finished second in the club championship race behind Falcons, taking home $4 million in addition to the prizes won from individual competitions.</p>



<p>To even those only slightly familiar with chess, Carlsen is known as one of the greatest players of all-time, if not the greatest. He’s held the International Chess Federation’s number one ranking since July 2011. He became the first player to hold the Chess, Rapid, and Blitz world championships at the same time in 2014, and then accomplished that feat again two more times. Carlsen most recently made the news after withdrawing from the Rapid and Blitz world championships, after being warned and fined for wearing jeans. He did end up competing in the Blitz tournament after the dress code was loosened, but again sparked controversy after successfully proposing to share the championship after a deadlocked tie with Ian Nepomniachtchi.</p>



<p>Chess isn’t the only game making its debut at the Esports World Cup in the event’s second year. Just yesterday, the EWC announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-esports-world-cup-riot-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT would join</a> Riot Games titles League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-2025-games/">at the 2025 tournament</a>.</p>



<p>Is this the biggest name outside of esports to sign with an organization? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>In 2016, Universal and Activision Blizzard brought World of Warcraft to the big screen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-movie-review/1100-6440592/" data-ref-id="1100-6440592">Warcraft</a>. The film only earned $47.4 million in the United States, but its worldwide total was $439.1 million. Regardless, Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision Blizzard, recently shared his belief that Warcraft was not only one of the worst movies he's ever seen, he also cited it as one of the reasons why World of Warcraft veteran designer Chris Metzen left Blizzard in 2016.</p><p>While appearing on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Grit podcast</a>, Kotick explained that Metzen became burned out during the production of the Warcraft movie. Kotick added that he felt it was "a terrible idea" to make the film, but the deal was already in place before Activision merged with Blizzard. He also went on to say that Warcraft proved to be a major distraction for Blizzard that took the company's focus off of the games.</p><p>"It took a lot of resources and distracted [Blizzard]," recalled Kotick. "You think about all these people who make video games for a living and now they have the chance to like make a movie and they're like helping with the casting and they're on the set and it's just a huge distraction. Our expansions were late, you know patches weren't getting done on time and... it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen."</p><p>Kotick added that he begged Metzen to return to Blizzard, which he finally did in 2022. Since Metzen's comeback, Kotick noted that they have hardly spoken, before asking rhetorically, "What am I going to tell Chris Metzen about game design?"</p><p>Despite Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it was recently reaffirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-world-of-warcraft-is-not-coming-to-game-pass/1100-6529082/" data-ref-id="1100-6529082">World of Warcraft is not coming to Game Pass</a>. World of Warcraft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-at-20-is-the-same-and-increasingly-unrecognizable-and-thats-by-design/1100-6527983/" data-ref-id="1100-6527983">celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024</a>, and there's no end in sight for the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-12th-february-for-40-minutes-of-ps5-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced that their PlayStation State of Play showcase will return tomorrow, 12th Feburary, 10pm UK time – that’s 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CET, and on 13th February at 7am JST.</p>
<p>The announcement is very, very light on what we might expect to see, but we do know that the show will be around 40 minutes long, and it will feature “news and updates on great games coming to PS5. The show celebrates a creative and unique selection of exciting games from studios around the world.”</p>


<p>And that’s all that they’re saying. Not even hinting at some of the publishers and studios that are taking part. Though we do already know one that will be there:&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/06/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-august-release-date-leaks/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater release date announcement</a>, which leaked last week.</p>
<p>The MGS Delta release date trailer – <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4">viewable here</a> – was accidentally uploaded to the PlayStation Store, and the page listing temporarily hosted the game’s August release date as well. The trailer teased the returning Ape Escape tie-in mode, Snake vs. Monkey, just as was found in the original release of Metal Gear Solid 3!</p>

<p>Sony only mentions the PS5 here, and while that strictly speaking would include PSVR 2 games. The VR headset obviously requires a PS5 or a PC in order to play games, so there could be some VR titles featured or games that build VR compatibility in, but Sony don’t mention it here like they have in the past. So, I think we can safely expect that this will be pretty narrowly focused on PS5 titles. Hopefully there’s some first party bangers in there, like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-1-ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, Insomniac’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/09/insomniac-are-making-a-game-based-on-marvels-wolverine/">Wolverine</a> – which was first announced way, way back in 2021 – or something completely new and surprising.</p>
<p>Maybe Kendrik Lamar will turn up and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak&amp;pp=ygUTYXBwbGUgaGFsZnRpbWUgc2hvdw%3D%3D">perform around the PlayStation symbols,</a> like he did on the weekend?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-has-a-major-security-flaw-hacker-claims/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A hacker has found a security flaw in Marvel Rivals, one of the most popular multiplayer games currently available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A report from <a href="https://shalzuth.com/Blog/IFoundAGameExploit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shalzuth’s blog</a>, spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/528355/article/can-marvel-rivals-hackers-take-over-your-pc-or-playstation-5-remotely-hacker-finds-a-security-exploit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, discusses the Marvel Rivals security exploit, which lets hackers access the player’s PC and PS5. The report states that developers use “remote code execution for their hotfix patching system.” However, when the codes are executed, the “game doesn’t verify” whether the command comes from the real server. Moreover, it provides “admin privileges for the sake of anti-cheat,” making it easier for the hacker to take over the device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering about RCE or remote code execution, this is a common way for hackers to run malicious code on a player’s device if they are on an unsecured network without the victim noticing. Shalzuth also posted a video of exploiting this Marvel Rivals security flaw on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSXoH1xYIcE&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gaming laptop</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDxUaIvVxmY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> by injecting malicious scripts while on the same Wi-Fi. He has also contacted NetEase through various channels to inform them about the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Security flaws in the gaming industry aren’t uncommon, especially with games like Marvel Rivals, which focus on online gameplay. However, the fact that a hacker can quickly take over a player’s device with the help of the game is a cause for concern, mainly when the title attracts close to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">200-300,000 players every day</a> on Steam alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cancels-mid-season-rank-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled mid-season rank resets</a> after recent backlash. Also, the game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-section-disney-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a section on Disney Plus</a>. What are your thoughts on the Marvel Rivals security flaw? Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I was smitten with Compulsion’s South of Midnight well before I got to play a little more than an hour of it recently. From the first enigmatic trailers hinting at this Southern gothic, dark fantasy, magical realist stop-motion game set in the Deep South, to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-first-preview-compulsion-games-bets-big-on-art-music-and-deep-south-folklore"><u>IGN’s own first look</u></a>, to the bigger gameplay overview at the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-release-date-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct"><u>Xbox Developer Direct</u></a> – South of Midnight struck me as a deeply moving, highly stylized game that would almost definitely make me cry. When I told the Art Director, Whitney Clayton, that I had immediately thought of that decade-plus-old movie Beasts of the Southern Wild, she confirmed that was one of their early major inspirations for its “Mythical Bayou-type location, folklore creatures, and this really heartwarming protagonist.” That, along with the “darkness and folktale fantasy” of Pan’s Labyrinth from Guillermo del Toro. Huge yes to all of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the section that I got hands-on time with, I absolutely got the sense that all of the intrigue and hype-building was no bluff, and yet a couple elements of the gameplay still needed more time in the metaphorical oven before it’s ready to ship out. Even with those minor blemishes – which are slightly concerning because we’re just a couple months away  from its April 8 release date – I left still enamored with the setting and bubbling with curiosity about the bigger story about ghosts and environmental catastrophe driving South of Midnight. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">South of Midnight Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I played through Chapter 3, far along enough to have some magical combat tricks as a Weaver going up against spooky figures called Haints – which is exactly where I began. (Though the question of “What exactly is a Weaver?” is yet to be explained.) Diving pretty much headfirst into a fight was expectedly disorienting, but I was reassured that all of the mapped techniques – push, pull, and what’s basically a stun move – are introduced at a pace that’s much easier to get acquainted to naturally. Part of the struggle was the autolock feature being a little loosey-goosey at times; because of the volume of Haints and where they appear in the combat area, the camera spun around the main character, Hazel, in a way that made me a tiny bit woozy.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>South of Midnight’s charm is, well, basically everything else besides combat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I eventually got the hang of the Weaving moves, plus the timing of dodging for its magic recoil against nearby Haints, and found it challenging enough but not necessarily revolutionary. But I hardly think it needs to be: South of Midnight’s charm is, well, basically everything else. As long as it’s fun (it was) and not horribly repetitive (it wasn’t), then it can, in fact, run almost purely on vibes. From each encounter with the Haints, I felt a sense of eerie dread from the lighting and fog, the blaring drums-and-horns score, the general spore-like creepiness of the Haints and their corruption. And when I finally beat their spooky asses, it culminated in a cathartic cleansing of the land, both physically and spiritually, that had been choking on its past. Hazel wasn’t just clearing out the wreckage of environmental disaster from a devastating hurricane where she lost her mother, setting her on this very journey. She was healing the ghosts of history that were haunting the land, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s kind of how the beats of the chapter went: platform around a swampy area with double jumps, glides, and magic skills to find what I’ll call “Haint holes,” clear ‘em out, and pick up little pieces of a bigger story that all point back to a Mythical Creature – this one in particular at the behest of a giant talking magical Catfish who is both narrator and seemingly Hazel’s mode of transportation around different areas. Chapter 3 didn’t end with a boss battle against one of the giants highlighted in earlier videos; instead I climbed up a giant man-shaped tree to clear the Stigma of its Wound. I swear, the game explains why it exists at all through the collected ghost stories, and houses and spaces are littered with ephemera that help fill out more of the character-building picture. But even so, the ultimate answer still felt like a cliffhanger: Who were these people and how were they connected to the bigger tapestry of South of Midnight? I gotta know!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This storybook narrative meshed peachily – pun intentional – with the luxuriously textured elements of its habitat. Clayton told me the basis of these details was rooted in making the animation feel tactile: “What would this look like if it were actually handcrafted in real life?” she said. “What kind of materials would they have been made out of to look like the thing that they're supposed to be made out of?” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of stop-motion: The team knows that not everyone is going to love the style, Clayton said, and that’s fine: “Anytime you do something a bit bold, you're gonna get polarizing feelings.” (For what it’s worth, if it’s <em>that</em> distracting, you’ll be able to turn it off outside of cutscenes in South of Midnight’s settings.) I will say, I did catch a couple of moments with frame rate issues that haven’t been fully ironed out yet, but Compulsion is aiming for 60fps on Series X by launch. And when everything is running smoothly as it ought to, South of Midnight should be a uniquely beautiful game that might even make you cry a little bit, too.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its message says that, following “a wealth of feedback from the community,” there will no longer be a four-division hit to players’ Competitive rank when the Season 1 mid-season update arrives on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-sets-february-release-date-for-the-thing-and-human-torch"><u>its previously announced release date of February 21</u></a>. Instead, NetEase says "players will retain their ranks and scores from the end of the first half." It appears the change will carry over to future seasons as well, and it seems the six-division rank drop is still set to arrive at the end of full seasons.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you for all your passionate discussions and feedback.

Your engagement and support mean the world to us, and we're excited to continue this journey together!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s surprising news that comes with the promise that Gold rank players will still receive the previously promised costume reward and Crests of Honor rewards. For players of all ranks to earn the new rewards, they only need to complete 10 Competitive matches and then meet the conditions before the season comes to an end. In other words, NetEase is gutting the issue players were upset about and keeping everything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals’ rank reset was announced yesterday and was immediately met with concern and criticism from fans. As NetEase explained, the main complaint saw players worried that ranked mode would be less enjoyable if they needed to work to keep up with continuous rank resets every month and a half or so. That idea has now been killed less than one day after the mid-season Competitive change was announced, resulting in shock from those who aren’t used to seeing developers address fan feedback so quickly.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is actually insane.
