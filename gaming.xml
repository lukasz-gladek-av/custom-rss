            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-20m-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima has announced that his most recent game&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed another big player milestone ahead of the release of the hotly-anticipated sequel later this year.</p>

<p>Speaking on social media platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2jd64ychnmuu4x6eghptdvco/post/3llo4343bk222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Kojima Productions revealed that&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed 20 million players around the world, thanking "everyone who built bridges, paved roads, and delivered cargo" for the "incredible milestone".</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Kojima Productions is referring not just to sales of the game, but to the player count as a whole. That figure therefore likely includes players who have experienced the game on PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass; it's currently available on the former on both PS4 and PS5.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-20m-players-box.jpg?itok=PtkmihIz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-20m-players-box.jpg?itok=zi3L6yvs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed 20 million players worldwide.</figcaption></figure><p>The new player milestone for <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>comes as Kojima and his studio prepare to release the game's sequel,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for a June launch on PlayStation 5</a>.</p>

<p>It looks like the game will be exclusive to Sony's console for the foreseeable future, but given that Kojima <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">now owns the IP rights</a> to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, I really wouldn't be surprised to see the game get a multiplatform release at some point.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>movie, which will be a co-production between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">Kojima's studio and movie house A24</a>, to look forward to. We still don't know who will be starring in that or when we can expect to see it, however.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, it's Hideo Kojima's first major project after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-hideo-kojima-leaves-konami-forms-new-studio" rel="nofollow">leaving Konami back in 2015</a>. He's best known for the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series, although he's also worked on other games like&nbsp;<em>Policenauts&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zone of the Enders</em>.</p>




<p><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>tells the post-apocalyptic story of Sam Porter Bridges, a courier who must deliver packages in a world devastated by a mysterious cataclysm. Of course, if you know Kojima's work, you'll know that's hardly doing the game justice.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/death-stranding-directors-cut/9nqgn8tgnt8p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The sequel, <i>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</i>, is <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launching for PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/638535/physical-digital-video-games-nintendo-xbox-ps5-disc-cart<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of Sony’s best-ever PlayStation ads is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA">a 21-second video</a> titled, “Official PlayStation Used Game Instructional Video.” It’s a “step-by-step” guide about how to lend your PS4 games to your friends. It has one step: one person hands another person a game box.</p><p>The ad succinctly clowns on Microsoft’s original and convoluted game sharing policy for the Xbox One, which let users ditch discs in exchange for daily DRM checks. The idea was so hated that Microsoft <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/19/xbox-one-drm-second-hand-restrictions-abandoned">walked it back</a> just over a week after the release of Sony’s ad and months before the console came out. The lesson was simple — don’t mess with people’s discs.</p><p>But more than a decade later, it’s not hard to imagine a future where Sony’s own ad doesn’t apply anymore. </p><p>Physical game sales in 2024 were less than half what they were as recently as 2021, and the market has been in decline since 2008, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella tells <em>The Verge</em>. “There has been a long trend of declining sales in physical games,” Piscatella says. “And now there’s declining distribution with retailers pulling back space, with companies making fewer physical games overall, and with the entire shift towards digital distribution.”</p><p>The writing has been on the wall since 2020, when Microsoft and Sony introduced their (at the time) next-generation Xbox and PlayStation consoles with versions that didn’t have a place to put your discs. Ultimately, they were responding to the emerging trend of people buying fewer physical games for consoles. Can you even remember the last time you bought a physical game for PC?</p><p>The primary reason for the shift to digital is because of connectivity: about 99 percent of consoles are connected to the internet, Piscatella says. (Players weren’t quite as online <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2015/game-consoles-in-2015-one-stop-shop-for-games-and-entertainment/">a decade ago</a>.) And once people got used to digital, “more and more often people would choose convenience over the practical positives of physical.”</p><p>Just look at this graph from Piscatella showing plummeting physical sales. The outlook is grim.</p><p>Microsoft hasn’t been particularly secretive about its interest in a heavily digital future. The latest Xbox generation launched with the all-digital Series S, and it added an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174793/microsoft-xbox-series-x-white-digital-edition">all-digital Series X option</a> last year. Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">“This is an Xbox” campaign</a> positions basically every device with a screen as a potential console. The company’s Xbox Game Pass subscription is essentially a rental service for digital titles. And physical editions of <em>Avowed</em>, one of Microsoft’s biggest Xbox games of the year, only have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-avowed-xbox-pc-premium-edition">a code for the game</a> in the box.</p><p>Of course, Microsoft is best known as a software company, so perhaps it’s not too surprising that it might want to bank its video game future entirely on digital games. And while I still think it will be a shame if the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264129/halo-unreal-engine-5-halo-studios-announcement">next <em>Halo</em></a> isn’t available on a disc, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to expect that Xbox could drop discs entirely by the end of the decade.</p><p>Sony will probably take a little bit longer to make the all-digital jump. The company is certainly signaling it wants to move in that direction, perhaps most strongly by shipping the premium $699 PS5 Pro <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241265/sony-ps5-pro-game-console-disc-drive-end">without a disc drive</a>. But it continues to sell drives separately for the Pro and for the slim PS5. And the company would simply face pushback on a different scale than Microsoft: there are far more PS4s and PS5s out there than Xboxes, and that means a lot more people who have bought a lot more physical games who may want ways to play them for the foreseeable future. </p><p>Piscatella also points out that some major mass-market games like <em>EA Sports College Football</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em> have a “pretty big physical presence” that console makers may not want to jeopardize.</p><p>Nintendo is where we see the argument for physical games — though maybe not <em>discs</em> — sticking around. The just-announced Switch 2 has a cartridge slot and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">backward-compatible with Switch 1 games</a>. The console’s first generation lasted from 2017 until sometime this year, so if the Switch 2’s lifecycle also lasts eight years, physical media will be relevant for Nintendo well into the 2030s.</p><p>The company may have reason to stick with cartridges for even longer. Piscatella says that Nintendo platforms are still “heavier physical” than other platforms because its audience, especially families, expects the format; it’s a lot easier for kids in a family to share a game when they can just pass the cart to each other, as Sony adeptly showed in its ad. That advantage won’t last forever, though. Just last week, Nintendo announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system">a “virtual game card” lending system</a> that lets family members share digital games.</p><div><p>“Consumers on PlayStation and Xbox are speaking with their dollars”</p></div><p>It’s yet another sign that physical media is waning, even in its strongholds. “At this point, the consumers on PlayStation and Xbox are speaking with their dollars that digital-first is a fine way to go,” Piscatella says.</p><p>Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox did not respond to requests for comment on their future plans for physical media.</p><p>While physical media sales are on the decline, New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen points out that the sales of physical video game accessories have been “skyrocketing.” The PC <em>games </em>market may be mostly digital on Steam, but sales of things like custom controllers, screens, chairs, and headphones are a “huge category,” he says.</p><p>He believes that accessories and what he calls “the personalization of the physical experience of games and interactivity” will grow, which we can see manifested all the way to theme parks. (van Dreunen points out that Nintendo is particularly good at this: think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/16/8050027/nintendo-amiibo-sales-charts">Amiibo</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">Alarmo clock</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">theme parks</a> filled with Nintendo goodies.)</p><p>Both van Dreunen and Piscatella ultimately made the comparison of video games to vinyl records, which is “kind of like on the extreme niche, but doing ok,” Piscatella says. There’s a key difference between vinyl and video games, of course — with a vinyl record, you can play it on a turntable, but a physical cart of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> can only slot into a Nintendo Switch. It’s more about the enthusiast crowd focusing on physical media.</p><p>Maybe that will be enough to keep physical formats around into the future. But the next time Sony makes a guide on how to share PlayStation games, I doubt it will be a crisp 21 seconds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An alleged cryptocurrency scam that models itself on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will be launching on Steam this week, despite Valve's promises that they do not allow NFT or blockchain games to exist on the platform. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paradise-xrpl">Paradise</a> has been advertised as an action game set in a sunny city which will allow players to drive cars, shoot enemies, and earn money. But its in-game currency is based on blockchain technology, and some reports allege it is a scam based in Russia which does not allow its crypto investors to withdraw funds. When asked why the game is allowed on the platform, Valve have repeatedly neglected to comment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Paradise will be releasing into early access on April 2, say developers Ultra Games. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_c9D63YNm4">recent trailer</a> shows a player inspecting guns, walking through a garage full of cars, and navigating a world split up with loading screens made with AI-generated art designed to look like the loading screens of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> series. Previous trailers boast that you can speak to any NPC using AI technology. </p>
<p>"Play with your friends, engage in shootouts, race cars, complete daily missions, and reach the apex of life," reads a blurb. "Earn money and buy what you want, from real estate to fancy clothes." The creators have boasted that the game is in Steam's top 200 most wishlisted games. It's possible many of those Steam users aren't aware of the game's grubby features and history of misleading marketing.</p>
<p>Paradise uses a currency called the $PAR token which is based on blockchain technology, and can be invested in via a third-party app. Some investors in this cryptocoin claim they became unable to withdraw funds, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-copycat-paradise-is-an-alleged-crypto-scam-yet-continues-to-gain-steam-wishlists">we reported in January</a>. The developers have also falsely claimed to be working with streamers such as Ninja and Pokimane, and included unlicensed use of a Lamborghini and other cars in previous trailers. </p>

<p>Together with a lot of AI slop and very heavy use of Unreal Marketplace assets, the game had enough red flags that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9CQBMzLjCA">multiple YouTubers investigated the company</a> behind it, with one discovering that the Hong Kong address listed by the company was fake and eventually discovering that it is actually based somewhere in Tbilisi, Georgia - a city with <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/project/scam-empire/diamonds-dior-and-dubai-vacations-the-luxurious-lives-of-georgias-call-center-scammers">a troubled history when it comes to blockchain scammers</a>. </p>
<p>"Versions of the game for Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation Store will not include cryptocurrency, ensuring there are no restrictions for users on these platforms," say the developers in a <a href="https://paradisevs.com/company_statement2">defensive rebuttal</a> on their website. Unfortunately, no one can verify the developer's claims until the game is released. But even if a means to buy the currency is not present in the final release, it wouldn't restrict the game from redirecting players to the third-party cryptocurrency app necessary for players to earn and spend the game's $PAR token in-game. An act which, in itself, could be harmful to users, even if Valve’s terms of service don’t specifically forbid this. Since the game can still serve as a Trojan horse for hooking people into an alleged crypto scam.</p>
<p>On top of this, the document which insists cryptocurrency will not be in the game is full of other misleading statements, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CA4RvTrS-nE">pointed out by video creator Jetro</a>, one of the YouTubers who previously investigated the game. The developers claim their use of a minimap from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> is allowed, for example, because "The GTA 5 map is based on the real layout of Los Angeles, which is not intellectual property". To avoid doubt: the GTA 5 map is not a 1:1 reproduction of Los Angeles, and Rockstar own the rights to that map. </p>
<p>Steam <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-is-banning-games-with-nfts-and-cryptocurrency">banned all games that feature NFT and cryptocurrency</a> in 2021. The Paradise developers have edited the game's Steam page a number of times since it first appeared, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3281420/history/?changeid=U:56561021">removing trailers that mention cryptocurrency</a>, for example. It's unclear if Valve have been in contact with the developers or not. I have asked Valve for comment on this game multiple times and have not received a response. </p>
<p>The game is also launching <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/paradise-xrpl-9e47b6">on the Epic Store</a>, but only after it was removed once and reuploaded as "Paradise XRPL" , with a store page that clearly states it is an NFT game, along with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/paradise-xrpl-faq-9f3b93">an FAQ on its crypto gubbins</a> which insists that it is good for the game. "The introduction of a crypto token in PARADISE XRPL enhances the product by enabling streamlined transactions for in-game purchases, facilitating trade between players, and granting access to exclusive content." I have also asked Epic Games for comment and will let you know if we learn more. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Adam Sandler is easily one of the biggest comedy stars ever in Hollywood. Though he’s run afoul of critics for years, Sandler has enjoyed a loyal following due to his everyman persona that thumbs the nose of well-dressed muckity mucks. His recent cameo at the 2025 Oscars says it all: He’s a superstar who revels in the comfort of zip-up hoodies and basketball shorts over designer tuxes. And we wouldn’t have him any other way.</p><p>This July, the unexpected sequel <em>Happy Gilmore 2</em> will hit the links on Netflix, where Sandler has called home for the better part of the last decade. In commemoration of Sandler’s return to the world that boosted him to the upper echelons of movie stardom, we’ll be running down through all of Adam Sandler’s major movies to rank the worst to best. Get your Scuba Steve goggles on and dive in. </p></div></div><div><p>Just because a movie calls itself “ridiculous” doesn’t excuse it from being abominable. One of Adam Sandler’s first major forays into streaming-release movies was the Western spoof <em>The Ridiculous 6</em>, a movie mired in controversy – a disputed number of Native actors walked off the set over its offensive humor – only to have the dubious recognition of earning 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. Are critics being uptight? Just once, maybe trust them on this.</p></div><div><p>Adam Sandler could have sunk after his film debut in 1989, the seafaring dud <em>Going Overboard</em>. Predating his run on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, Sandler’s first movie is his first as a leading man, and sees him play a cocktail waiter on a cruise ship who harbors lofty dreams of becoming the ship’s resident comedian. Budget production value doesn’t weigh down <em>Going Overboard</em> so much as Sandler’s painfully obvious inexperience sinks it. </p></div><div><p>Behold an Adam Sandler comedy that hasn’t just spoiled like milk, but is straight up radioactive. Sandler stars in <em>You Don’t Mess with the Zohan</em> as a top-rate soldier for the Israel Defense Force who abandons his post to pursue his dreams of becoming a hair stylist in America, where he falls for a Palestinian salon owner (played by Emmanuelle Chirqui). There’s no point in getting worked up over an almost 20-year-old comedy that’s dumber than rocks where the most memorable gag has Sandler smack a guy with a fake foot. But truly, what the hell was anyone thinking? </p></div><div><p>An empty calorie sequel to a comedy few liked in the first place, <em>Grown Ups 2 </em>lives to serve anyone who finds middle aged men in low-stakes crises to be the peak of modern entertainment. David Spade, Chris Rock, and Kevin James reunite with Adam Sandler for a rudderless second round that sees the grown men square off with a neighboring college fraternity. Why bother with Sandler waddling around in oversized basketball shorts when the infinitely better <em>Neighbors </em>with Seth Rogen and Zac Efron exists?</p></div><div><p>Somehow, Al Pacino saw fit to put in effort in <em>Jack and Jill</em> while Adam Sandler floats around on autopilot. Sandler does double duty playing both an ad executive and his intrusive twin sister who overstays her welcome during the holidays. There’s no other way to say it:<em> Jack and Jill</em> is bad. Really bad. But Pacino proves he’s one of the greatest actors of our time by making a meal out of his supporting role, where he plays himself caught up doing a lame Dunkin Donuts campaign. Sandler must have made him an offer he couldn’t refuse. </p></div><div><p>A star-studded religious satire that makes a convincing argument for atheism,<em> Little Nicky</em> stars Adam Sandler as the “kindest” son of Satan (Harvey Keitel) who is sent to Earth to keep his brothers from wreaking havoc on a biblical scale. Nothing in <em>Little Nicky</em>, not even a giggling Reese Witherspoon in angel wings, can redeem the movie’s damned soul. A lethally annoying performance by Sandler is arguably the movie’s deadliest sin.</p></div><div><p>A movie adaptation of a divorced man’s Funko Pop collection, <em>Pixels </em>is a headache-inducing tentpole that doesn’t mine Generation X nostalgia so much as weaponizes it in a test of human endurance. Adam Sandler plays one of several grown-up arcade champions from Reagan’s America who are called by the President of the United States (Kevin James) to save the world from an alien invasion who’ve taken the form of classic video game monsters. Sandler in a “real-life” version of <em>Space Invaders</em> <strong>should</strong> be fun. But <em>Pixels </em>is so bad in its unfunny excess you might feel compelled to firebomb your local retro bar arcade in an act of vengeance.</p></div><div><p><em>That’s My Boy </em>begins with statutory rape and ends in incest. Even for Adam Sandler, <em>That’s My Boy</em> is far too filthy and unfunny to put up with. It’s also maddening, given how it squanders a dynamite pairing of Sandler and Andy Samberg. <em>That’s My Boy</em> sees Adam Sandler play the deadbeat dad to his estranged son (Samberg) – born of a highly-publicized teacher-student affair – who crashes his son’s wedding to stage a lucrative TV reunion. It might look like another run-of-the-mill Sandler joint, but its over-extended reach for shock humor make it a distasteful wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p></div><div><p>You have to give The Sandman credit: He’s treated his lucrative Netflix deal for the blank check it is, taking the tech giant’s money to kick it in Puerto Rico. Sandler co-stars in <em>The Do-Over </em>with David Spade, who plays a hapless man in a loveless marriage who gets the chance to start life anew after running into his old classmate (Sandler) at a high school reunion. The bullets start flying when they find out the dead men whose identities they’ve stolen were caught up in shady stuff. A deflating action-comedy, <em>The Do-Over</em> is ironically-titled; Do-over? Don’t even bother.</p></div><div><p><em>Grown Ups</em> is a better movie than its sequel, but that’s like saying a colonoscopy is better than rectal cleaning. In the first of the two films, Sandler and his other seasoned Hollywood comics spend 90 minutes making poo jokes in a pathetic comedy that deals with the difficulties of aging with dignity. Sandler unites with Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, and Rob Schneider as childhood buddies who meet up years later with their families in an attempt to recapture their youthful vigor. <em>Grown Ups</em> is like watching a 40-something year old at the bar telling obnoxious jokes – and it’s just as unfun as it sounds.</p></div><div><p>After years of churning out lewd and crude product, Adam Sandler took a surprising turn with 2014's<em> The Cobbler</em>, a little piece of magical realism. Sandler is in a whole different gear, playing a humble shoe repairman with the power to become his own customers. Despite welcome sincerity and Sandler demonstrating more dramatic heft than normal – though Sandler gets assist from <em>other</em> actors playing his metamorphing shoemaker – <em>The Cobbler</em> is too riddled with scuffmarks in spite of its own good intentions.</p></div><div><p>Because a questionable amount of people watched <em>Murder Mystery </em>in 2019, Netflix punished its own customers with a direct sequel, <em>Murder Mystery 2 </em>in 2023. Following up on its predecessor, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston return as the Spitzes, who are now struggling to keep their private detective agency afloat. Their latest case: finding the Maharajah, who has just been kidnapped at his own wedding. Anniston and Sandler are clearly having fun, it’s just a bummer how no one else is.</p></div><div><p>It’s strange to realize how Adam Sandler came to prominence in the waning years of the buddy action movie boom, yet never made any meaningful strides in the genre. Among the only few buddy movies Sandler ever made was 1996's <em>Bulletproof</em>, where Sandler stars as a two-bit criminal who reunites with an estranged friend (Damon Wayans) who is actually an undercover cop. Few people remember Bulletproof and for good reason: It’s boring. Uninspired and plodding, Sandler and Wayans’ lethargic chemistry – or lack thereof – leaves <em>Bulletproof </em>anything but.</p></div><div><p>Overstimulating to the point of inducing anaphylactic shock, <em>Hotel Transylvania 3</em> slightly flips the script from the 2012 original. This time, Adam Sandler’s Dracula takes his monstrous family and friends on a crusie liner vacation, where he falls for Kathryn Hahn’s Ericka, later to be revealed as the great granddaughter of his nemesis Abraham Van Helsing. Even the movie’s target audience of kids might find <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> <em>3</em> extra, and even harmless fun can leave them winded.</p></div><div><p>A whodunnit as plain as its title, <em>Murder Mystery</em> lacks the swagger and sex appeal inherent to the genre – and that’s kind of the point. Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston reunite from <em>Just Go With It</em> to play an ordinary married couple who, after being invited to come aboard a billionaire’s yacht party, must now prove their innocence after their affluent host (Terence Stamp) is murdered. Though Anniston and Sandler get moderate mileage out of their fish-out-of-water roles, <em>Murder Mystery </em>is glossy plastic, yet another streaming thing to be watched passively on your phone. </p></div><div><p><em>Sandy Wexler</em> flirts with brilliance in how it drops Adam Sandler in ‘90s Hollywood to play a talent agent remembered for his eccentricities. But what could have been a self-reflective meditation on Sandler’s own unlikely success as a movie star is instead an unambitious, overly-sentimental rom-com where Sandler falls in love with Jennifer Hudson, a singer whom Sandler’s Sandy discovers at an amusement park. About the only memorable thing about <em>Sandy Wexler</em> is Sandler’s execution of the role. And even then, his oversized glasses, seal-like applauses, and pastel jackets are hardly a new shade. </p></div><div><p>After committing the artistic violation that was <em>Grown Ups 2</em>, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler tried to make amends in 2018 with the more sober Netflix comedy <em>The Week Of</em>. The two play the fathers of an engaged couple who work to put aside their differences during the most important and increasingly calamitous week of their childrens’ lives. <em>The Week Of</em> is light on Sandler’s signature gross-outs, but it’s not enough to keep it afloat either. </p></div><div><p>Back when gay marriage was a hot-button issue, Adam Sandler and Kevin James starred in the abundantly offensive, yet surprisingly sincere <em>I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry</em>. Sandler and James co-star as best friends and New York City firefighters who get legally married to receive benefits; when the government starts getting suspicious, the buds begin masquerading as lovebirds. Originating from a script by Alexander Payne before Sandler got involved, <em>I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry</em> comes across as an unexpected call for social equality, albeit a careless one, from a most unexpected place: the heart. </p></div><div><p>If every major comedy star in Hollywood has to have a cartoon franchise, then Adam Sandler’s money maker is the Hotel Transylvania series. The first of them, released in 2012 and directed by animation auteur Genndy Tartakovsky, introduces Sandler as Count Dracula, who in addition to being the famous vampire also runs a hotel getaway for monsters. Sandler doesn’t seem to really <em>try</em> to be Dracula. Instead, he’s content to come off like he’s in a Halloween costume than actually portraying an eldritch creature of the night. But this, and all the other Hotel Transylania movies, are innocent fluff that ultimately serve to distract rugrats for the afternoon.</p></div><div><p>Adam Sandler returns as Dracula in <em>Hotel Transylvania 2</em>, with the comic star afforded marginally more room to play around as a doting grandfather than the more conventional protective father he was in the predecessor. Still, <em>Hotel Transylvania 2</em> simply keeps the ball rolling, existing as little more than a paycheck for everyone involved. But Sandler has done far worse than voice a funny Dracula, and <em>Hotel Transylvania 2</em> is as sweet as a handful of Halloween candy.</p></div><div><p>In 2014, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore nearly matched Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan to deliver a third in a trio of perfect romantic comedies. Sadly, their efforts fell way short with the flavorless <em>Blended</em>. Sandler and Barrymore co-star as single parents whose disastrous blind date is followed up by a coincidental shared family vacation in South Africa. There’s some sweetness in all its schmaltz, but <em>Blended </em>is nowhere near to the level of what Sandler/Barrymore have delivered before. </p></div><div><p>Adam Sandler in a squeaky-clean Disney movie sounds like magic on paper, but<em> Bedtime Stories </em>is nothing revelatory for the normally crude superstar. Sandler stars as a hotel maintenance man whose bedtime stories to his niece and nephew impausibly become true in reality. But while Sandler starts weaving tall tales of heroism and riches, the oblivious kids offer up some wacky twists of their own. By virtue of its Disney overlords, <em>Bedtime Stories</em> is sanitized Sandler romp the whole family can enjoy, but it’s not anyone’s idea of a dream come true.</p></div><div><p>It’s something of a master stroke on Adam Sandler’s part that he convinces everyone that Jennifer Anniston is the “other” woman in his 2011 rom-com <em>Just Go With It</em>. The Sandman stars as a womanizing plastic surgeon who compels his office manager (Anniston) to parade around as his divorcing wife after he meets someone he believes is his true love (Brooklyn Decker). But naturally, what Sandler is looking for may have been in front of him all this time. <em>Just Go With It </em>doesn’t tread new ground, and you can guess every turn it takes, but it’s a carefree ride.</p></div><div><p>A lesser remake to an already middling 1936 Frank Capra movie, <em>Mr. Deeds</em> sees Adam Sandler as a small-town pizzeria owner who inherits a massive $40 billion fortune, only to find priceless love from a tabloid TV journalist (played by Winona Ryder). Tamer than most Sandler fare but not as memorable either,<em> Mr. Deeds</em> gets most of its worth from Sandler inhabiting a uniquely wholesome, gee-shucks energy that’s in stark contrast to his other screaming buffoons.</p></div><div><p>If you were the right age to catch <em>The Waterboy</em> on cable, chances are bits like “Water sucks, Gatorade is better” are ingrained somewhere in your memory. Otherwise, <em>The Waterboy</em> is typical Adam Sandler slop, a raunchy underdog comedy that obscures its good nature in juvenile idiocy. Sandler stars as a bullied 32-year-old manchild whose new job providing water for a losing Louisiana college football team unlocks the violent superstar within him. Endlessly quotable but not much else,<em> The Waterboy</em> quenches anyone’s thirst for something stupid. </p></div><div><p>As Adam Sandler once sang himself: Christmas is one day, but Hanukkah is eight crazy nights. In this unusual R-rated animated musical, Adam Sandler lends his voice and likeness to become Davey Stone, a 30-something alcoholic who is given one last shot to turn his life around or else spend ten years in prison. Despite clever apperancess and catchy tunes, <em>Eight Crazy Nights </em>doesn’t totally seize on its potential to be a true holiday classic. But if claymation Santas and reindeer feel played out, you can light a candle with a mischievous 2D Sandler. </p></div><div><p>Adam Sandler is known for playing out-of-shape schlubs and <em>very </em>average joes, but for once, he was an all-star MVP in <em>The Longest Yard</em>. A remake of the hard-hitting Burt Reynolds movie from 1974, <em>The Longest Yard</em> follows Sandler as Paul Crewe, a disgraced NFL star who forms a team of inmates to play against their abusive guards. (Burt Reynolds also co-stars in the remake, this time playing the team’s coach.) While this ‘05 remake goes for more laughs than its grittier predecessor, it’s still a down-and-dirty football flick teeming with testosterone.</p></div><div><p>When Adam Sandler failed to get an Oscar for his work in the acclaimed <em>Uncut Gems</em>, he threatened to make a movie that was quote, “so bad on purpose” as an act of revenge. When Sandler went home with no trophies, that’s when <em>Hubie Halloween</em> hit Netflix. But as a surprise, this pumpkin spiced romp is anything but tricks. Sandler plays innocent, Halloween-obsessed deli worker Hubie Dubois who takes it upon himself to save his hometown of Salem, Massachusetts when a kidnapper threatens to ruin the spookiest night of the year. It’s a bizarre follow-up to <em>Uncut Gems</em>, sure, but this sugary sweet Halloween flick is a good time for everyone, even those too young to remember when Sandler wasn’t a Netflix fixture.</p></div><div><p>Before the Bill Lawrence show <em>Shrinking</em> saw Jason Segel play a therapist who invites a patient to live with him, there was the comparatively more reckless <em>Anger Management</em>. A timid businessman (Adam Sandler) has one bad experience on an airplane that leads to court-mandated therapy with a specialist (Jack Nicholson), whose unorthodox treatments escalate to extreme degrees. Though Nicholson pushes Sandler’s buttons, it just might be the thing he needs to finally stand up for himself. <em>Anger Management</em> is no comedy classic, but Nicholson proves he’s a hall of fame-worthy meme machine, eclipsing a surprisingly subdued Sandler. </p></div><div><p>Chad Kultgen’s novel about suburban families wallowing in self-made prisons of sex, boredom, and technology is also a sedated, if sleepy dramedy by <em>Juno</em> and <em>Up in the Air</em> director Jason Reitman. Adam Sandler is one of several familiar faces in the movie; he plays Don Truby, the dissatisfied husband to Helen (Rosemarie DeWitt) and de facto main character of Kultgen’s book. While <em>Men, Women &amp; Children</em> underwhelms like an extramarital fling at a Marriott, its defiance of what a “sex movie starring Adam Sandler” should be might pique interest. </p></div><div><p>During a brief spell when Adam Sandler and pal Rob Schneider were the default stars of lowbrow, high-concept comedies, Sandler took folks by surprise with his emotionally affecting <em>Click</em>. Sandler takes charge as a workaholic family man who is given a magical remote that gives him control over time. But as he fast forwards through the “boring” parts of life, he comes to realize what he’s missing out. Though the movie’s premise is built on a corny Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond gag, <em>Click</em> is disarmingly powerful in its overly familiar but no less resonant message of taking time to pause and bask in the wonderful life you already lead. </p></div><div><p>With stone cold classics like <em>Terms of Endearment</em>, <em>Broadcast News</em>, and <em>As Good as It Gets</em> under his belt, director James L. Brooks disappointed many with his 2004 romantic dramedy <em>Spanglish</em>. But in hindsight, it’s now one of the better turnouts for star Adam Sandler, playing a Los Angeles chef who hires a Spanish-speaking Mexican immigrant (Paz Vega) as a live-in housekeeper. As cultural differences and language barriers create tension, their crowded house becomes a home through shared understanding. <em>Spanglish</em> was not the first mature film to star Sandler – Paul Thomas Anderson’s <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em> was released just two years prior – but its appeal to actual grownups proved Sandler had, and has, more to offer. </p></div><div><p>Clunky inclusion of 9/11 aside, Adam Sandler is in exceptionally rare form as troubled Charlie, a lonely man mourning the loss of his family. After running into an old college roommate (Don Cheadle), who is split between his family and his career, the two rekindle their friendship, finding in each other what they need to carry on and move ahead. With a mop of frumpled hair and oversized earphones as a security blanket, Sandler impresses in one of his most vulnerable roles to date. You should also see him play the heck out of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/feature-the-colossus-and-the-comedian-246286&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/feature-the-colossus-and-the-comedian-246286"><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em></a></span>. </p></div><div><p>In a different time, <em>Spaceman</em> would be a different movie. If it were twenty years ago, Adam Sandler floating around in a spacesuit and befriending a talking spider who gives him advice about his marriage would be a recipe for something nonsensical. (As if it isn’t already.) But in the streaming era, <em>Spaceman</em> is played straight, maintaining its dignity as an existential sci-fi drama that interrogates the pangs of loneliness. Not all of <em>Spaceman</em> feels like it has footing on solid ground, but its somber tone compliments a committed Sandler who appears in uncharacteristically tortured hues. </p></div><div><p>Vomiting walruses and ethically troubling behavior by everyone are not enough to sink the buoyant <em>50 First Dates</em>. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore reunite from <em>The Wedding Singer</em> to play a romantic match made in Hawaiian paradise whose only problem is Barrymore’s condition of short-term memory loss. Though Sandler relishes in the comfort of his usually bawdy humor, <em>50 First Dates</em> has a heart of gold that is easy to fall for. If you’re the sentimental type, the ending will sweep you off your feet. </p></div><div><p>Not long after <em>Happy Gilmore</em> made him a household name, Adam Sandler offered a glimpse at his coming maturity with a movie explicitly about his unwillingness to grow up and take responsibility. In <em>Big Daddy</em>, Sandler’s leading loaf Sonny illegally adopts his roommate’s kid (Cole and Dylan Sprouse in their first major role) in a desperate play to win back his ex-girlfriend. But raising a child is both rewarding and far more than Sonny bargained for, his fight to maintain custody culminating in a disarmingly sweet climax at a courthouse. Poke holes at the plot all you want – it can’t stop <em>Big Daddy</em> from being one of Sandler’s better movies, equally crass and charming in all the best ways.</p></div><div><p>Audiences went into <em>Funny People</em> expecting one thing, only to come out the other end with something totally different. Helmed by Judd Apatow during his hot streak, Adam Sandler plays a terminally ill comedian and movie star who befriends an up-and-comer (Rogen) and hires him as an assistant. Despite its title and marquee stars, <em>Funny People</em> isn’t a laugh-a-minute riot (which certainly many thought it would be). Instead, it’s an anxious dramedy about mortality and artistic expression. Sandler is a particular standout, practically playing himself but in a way that opens him like a bleeding wound.</p></div><div><p>When <em>Billy Madison</em> hit theaters, critics dismissed it as low-rent comedy for the MTV-pilled. But audiences rallied around it, cementing it as a classic that created a star out of Adam Sandler, who plays the dimwitted, spoiled son of a CEO who must repeat his entire schooling to win control of his father’s company. This has effectively been the story of Sandler’s whole career: His is the face of critically unpopular comedies that earn repeat viewings and loyalty from “normal” people. Whether or not <em>Billy Madison</em> is actually good – it’s pretty good, really!– its true importance lies in setting up Sandler’s ball before he spiked it one year later. </p></div><div><p>Only The Sandman in a Bruins jersey could turn the ninth hole into a house party. Adam Sandler’s star-making <em>Happy Gilmore</em> sees the actor as a would-be hockey phenom whose vicious slap shot makes him a natural for golf, but his presence in the sport draws the ire of buttoned-up pros. <em>Happy Gilmore</em> is an instance of material and talent synthesising in a way that feels like fate as Sandler’s abrasive dude persona make him the perfect underdog antihero over manicured turf. Between Carl Weathers as his mentor and Bob Barker as his sworn enemy, Sandler’s undisputed classic brought new meaning to fore-play. </p></div><div><p>If Adam Sandler has one perfect romantic comedy, it’s easily <em>The Wedding Singer</em>. With microphone gripped in his fist, Sandler flip-flops between charismatic cat and pathetic crooner in this delightful ‘80s nostalgia period piece, in which Sandler’s mulleted romantic lead is a heartbroken wedding (and later, bar mitzvah) singer who is left at the altar. That’s when Drew Barrymore shows up as a client, inspiring Sandler to steal her away from her unfaithful fiance before her big day. A Mousse’d up Sandler is a pure charmer, even when he’s ruining some other poor bride’s festivities with his depressing soliloquies. </p></div><div><p>It’s a family affair for the Sandlers in <em>You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah</em>, a late-stage Sandler joint that is implausibly one of his best-ever In this electric coming-of-age comedy for Netflix, Adam Sandler plays a supporting role as Danny Friedman, patriarch of the Friedmans whose youngest daughter Stacy (Sunny Sandler) is gearing up for her monumental day. Naturally, the movie’s main focus is on the comically petty drama between its youthful characters. But Papa Sandler is just being a good dad in letting his kids relish the spotlight.</p></div><div><p>Though he plays a fast food-gorging NBA scout, Adam Sandler is locked in as Stanley Sugerman, whose future in professional basketball rests on an unproven dark horse from the streets of Spain, Bo Cruz (Juancho Hernangómez, who in real life played for teams like the Denver Nuggets, Boston Celtics, and Toronto Raptors). Tapping into the same well of risk-it-all agents of chaos that made his role in <em>Uncut Gems</em> acclaimed, Sandler puts on a measured performance that reveals how much you can still win even from the bench.</p></div><div><p>Noah Baumbach’s smart, punchy family drama <em>The Meyerowitz Stories </em>chronicles the lives of adult siblings who suffer under the shadow of their moderately successful artist father (Dustin Hoffman). Adam Sandler is the eldest and the resident loose cannon, Danny Meyerowitz, whose labored gait and nervous energy puts him in contrast with his waifish hippie sister (Emma Thompson) and self-made financier Matthew (Ben Stiller). Sandler is in fine shape in Baumbach’s picture, his workwear wardrobe emphasizing his rough edges. </p></div><div><p>When it seemed like Adam Sandler was a one-note performer, director Paul Thomas Anderson proved otherwise with his acclaimed surrealist picture <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>. Sandler takes charge as socially inept, often shy business owner Barry Egan, who is eternally drowned out by the overbearing presence of his many sisters. Barry’s life changes when he falls for one of his sister’s coworkers (Emily Watson) and becomes the victim to an extorting phone sex operator. For the first time in his career, Sandler drops the loud voices and manbaby screaming and reveals an infinitely more thoughtful and careful side to his artistry, anchoring a film that revels in the expanse of one’s loneliness.</p></div><div><p>The term “white-knuckle thriller” was made for movies like <em>Uncut Gems</em>. After years of flailing around in mediocre studio comedies, Adam Sandler went to the dark side in his role as Howard Ratner, a Diamond District player whose toxic gambling addiction escalates into violence. The Safdie Brothers give Sandler carte blanche to run wild as a bespectacled agent of chaos, whose ring-studded fingers and obnoxious gold Rolexes can’t shield him from others’ aggressions. Whether or not <em>Uncut Gems</em> is actually Adam Sandler’s best movie, it’s without question one of his best performances, forcing us to acknowledge that Hollywood’s biggest clown is in his own ways a king.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Actor Jack Black believes his latest film, A Minecraft Move, is just the tonic the world is in need of right now.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jason-momoa-jack-black-minecraft-movie-jennifer-coolidge-1236175713/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> during the film's premiere, Black channelled his inner Burt Bacharach stating: "What the world needs now is love, sweet love."</p>

<p>"We've got to work together, my God," Black - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movies-second-trailer-brings-deep-steve-lore-tree-punching-square-bee">who plays Steve in the Minecraft adaptation</a> - continued.</p>
<p>The actor said there is quite simply "so much violence and war and hatred" right now, so what he loves about A Minecraft Movie is that there is "a lot of love in it and there's a lot of creativity". He added there is "some anger and violence" peppered throughout the film as well, but "in the end it's about friendship and working together to make [the world] a better place".</p>
<p>Black's sentiment was echoed by Game of Thrones and Aquaman actor Jason Momoa, who stars as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison in A Minecraft Movie.</p>
<p>"I think everyone needs to escape a little bit right now," Momoa said. "It's nice to sit back and have a really fun adventure and giggle and laugh."</p>
<p>As for the rest of the cast, Black was full of praise for his co-stars, calling Momoa "worth the price of admission" alone. Then there's "Danielle Brooks, who is fantastic; Emma Myers, she's fantastic. You've got this new kid [Hansen], who is a genius. But then wild card! You didn't know you're gonna get Jennifer Coolidge?" Black enthused.</p>
<p>Oh, and in case you were already wondering, Momoa is up for making another Minecraft film down the line. "We won't let you down. We worked our ass off for you, and I think we brought the world to life. I think everybody's gonna love it," the actor said. "There's so much more to tell; I just hope the fans will be delighted and let us make more."</p>

<p>A Minecraft Movie is set to release on 4th April, and while Black plays Steve in the film this wasn't always going to be the case. Believe it or not, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-jack-black-was-initially-going-to-play-a-talking-pig">originally going to portray a talking pig</a> in the upcoming film.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you fancy some themed-food ahead of any trips to the cinema, McDonald's is offering its customers the chance to purchase a £8.19 Minecraft Movie Meal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mcdonalds-limited-edition-8-minecraft-movie-menu-includes-amazing-collectibles-for-adults">complete with "amazing collectibles" crafted for adults</a>.</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-pc-improvements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-adds-new-challenges-and-more-on-april-4/">Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1</a> will introduce some PC-specific improvements, including a reduction of VRAM usage that should lead to better stability.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Director Yuya Tokuda shared a new message on the game's <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> providing additional information on Title Update 1 launching later this week, as well as on future additions, which include the introduction in late May of Tempered Monsters (★8) Gore Magala and the apex predators Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad as well as some balance tweaks that will make them more resilient, like increased health and resistance to wounding, balance adjustments to weapons and mantles, more quality of life improvements and more.</p>
<p>The biggest news for PC players, however, is the confirmation that this week's update will introduce improvements such as a reduction in VRAM usage and an upgrade to DirectStorage's latest version, which should result in an overall improvement in stability. In addition, the team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements where possible, so the PC version should see more improvements in the future.</p>
<p>At the end of today's message, the Monster Hunter Wilds director also teased some more changes coming in the future, such as changes to the gameplay flow and the introduction of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-highly-requested-feature/">Layered Weapons</a>. This will be quite welcome, as the powerful Artian weapons don't look all that good&nbsp;compared to the vast majority of other regular weapons.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game and why it has sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/">10 million copies</a> already by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-reach-10-million-breaking-another-record.1149633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales have hit yet another milestone, cementing the game's legacy as the studio's fastest-selling game and breaking another company record in the process.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250331.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> issued earlier today,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has passed 10 million sales, a milestone that also sets a first-month sales record for Capcom. The game already broke franchise and company records earlier this month, hitting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">eight million sales in just three days</a>.</p>

<p>As for how&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>achieved this goal, Capcom puts its performance down to the introduction of crossplay for the first time in series history, as well as "the fusion of numerous new elements with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>'s appeal" creating "significant excitement".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m-charge.jpg?itok=1XN3KhWT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m-charge.jpg?itok=cwpzN1Cp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>continues to sell very, very well indeed for Capcom.</figcaption></figure><p>By way of comparison, it took previous mainline entry&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sales-hit-8-million-units-worldwide" rel="nofollow">around ten months</a> to achieve the same sales figure, although that might be a slightly unfair comparison since&nbsp;<em>Rise&nbsp;</em>was a Switch exclusive until January 2022.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter World</em>, meanwhile, took over two months to achieve eight million sales, although again, the game was initially only released for PS4 and Xbox One, with a PC version subsequently launching in August 2018.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>still clearly stands as the series' most successful entry to date, although it's still currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a Mixed rating</a> on Steam, thanks in large part to what appear to be ongoing performance issues for many players' PCs.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Capcom will address those performance issues in future updates.&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date" rel="nofollow">first Title Update</a> is due to land later this week, and it's bringing a big new monster to fight, plus lots of other goodies.</p>




<p>If you want to see what all the fuss is about, you can pick up&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/638542/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-relevance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">official unveiling of the Switch 2</a> was an incredibly confident moment for Nintendo. It was brief and lacking almost entirely in details. There was no price, no release date, and no confirmed games outside of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">a <em>Mario Kart</em> tease</a>. The 2 in the name implied a bigger and better Switch, but when it came to the how — the chips that will power the device, the screen that will make Zelda and Mario look great — Nintendo deemed it wasn’t important enough to share right away.</p><p>And it’s right: unlike the rest of the industry, Nintendo has carved out a path where specs no longer matter.</p><p>It wasn’t always this way. Previous Nintendo consoles were sold, as their contemporaries were, on horsepower. The Super Nintendo was a more-powerful NES, while the N64’s processor was deemed so important that the system was named after it. But things started to change around the time of the GameCube. Nintendo had experienced a steady decline in console sales over subsequent generations; while the NES and Famicom sold more than 60 million units, that was down to just over 20 million for the GameCube. At the same time, Nintendo’s direct competition had changed significantly. After getting a taste of going up against Sony during the N64 era, Nintendo was now up against a second tech behemoth in Microsoft. Competing on technological prowess no longer made much sense.</p><p>Something had to change — and that change came in the form of the Wii.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Britta Pedersen / picture alliance via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>Once infamously described as “<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gdc-the-wii-is-a-piece-of-sht-says-hecker">two GameCubes and some duct tape</a>,” the Wii wasn’t a major advancement over its predecessor in terms of how games looked or ran. While the Xbox 360 touted blockbusters like <em>Halo 3</em>, and the PS3 was showing off next-gen visuals through <em>Resistance</em> and <em>MotorStorm</em>, the Wii was defined by <em>Wii Sports</em>, in which characters looked like eggs and didn’t even have arms. And yet, the game, which was bundled with the console everywhere but Japan, went on to become one of the best-selling games of all time because of how it played, rather than how it looked.</p><p>This shift came because of what Nintendo called its “blue ocean” strategy. The idea was that the increasing technological complexity of games was actually making them <em>less</em> appealing to many consumers. We’d come a long way from the simplicity of making Mario run and jump in the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. Just looking at a GameCube controller could be overwhelming for many. As former Nintendo of America president Reggile Fils-Aime <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090806203242/http://news.cnet.com/Nintendo-on-the-latest-technical-divide/2010-1041_3-6180215.html">wrote in 2007</a>, “While ardent players reliably responded to ever-advancing technology and complexity, those same attributes consistently chipped off potential new players from the total market, narrowing the consumers into a smaller niche.”</p><p>This meant the best path forward for Nintendo was to get out of the technological arms race and find a way to broaden the market. For the Wii, that was a console with specs that were mostly good enough to run modern 3D games, but where the focus was on its motion-sensitive controller that made games more intuitive to play, like with <em>Wii Sports</em>. This was followed by the Nintendo DS, a handheld that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">introduced touchscreen controls before smartphones were ubiquitous</a>. Both were massive hits: the Wii sold more than 100 million units, while the DS topped 150 million. And both proved that specs are a minor concern — if they’re a concern at all — to most consumers, as they surpassed more powerful competitors in terms of sales. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24121232/sony-playstation-vita-steam-deck-switch">Sorry, Vita</a>.)</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Kiyoshi Ota / Bloomberg via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>Finding the right direction for a console isn’t always easy, as evidenced by the Wii U, which was a failed early attempt to merge the worlds of home consoles and portable gaming. But by shifting away from specs and graphics to focus on player experience, Nintendo has not only carved out a space for itself, but it is arguably as successful as it has ever been at a time when the video game industry is struggling on many fronts.</p><p>The Switch is a pure expression of this philosophy. It’s an underpowered tablet that doubles as a home console, and despite going up against beefy PlayStations, Xboxes, and a burgeoning field of portable PCs, it’s on track to become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">Nintendo’s best-selling piece of hardware ever</a> (and it might even surpass the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307463/a-big-milestone">record set by the PS2</a>). Its modest technical chops are overshadowed by a straightforward premise — you can take games with you anywhere — while also allowing Nintendo to develop lots of games in a more sustainable way than its competitors, who are struggling with the massive increasing costs of live service and blockbuster games.</p><p>That’s why Nintendo didn’t utter a single spec when revealing the Switch 2 — because they’re not the point. Whatever powers the company’s next device has will be mostly good enough <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">for the next open-world <em>Zelda</em></a>, but the specs don’t need to be detailed in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">lengthy video that uses words like upscaling and teraflops</a>. Those details are coming, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">of course</a>, but they’re secondary to the core idea: this will be just like your old Switch, only better. You don’t need specs to get that across.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>'s dev team are "actively looking at" adding options for a more challenging jaunt through the throaty-poke 'em up's incarnation of feudal Japan. "We're looking at these things and monitoring what people say about the game," creative director Jonathon Dumont told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-devs-actively-looking-at-an-even-harder-difficulty-mode-for-the-rpg-how-challenging-do-you-want-it/">GamesRadar+</a> at this year's GDC.</p>
<p>Shadows currently features four difficulty options for both stealth and combat, ranging from 'story' to 'expert', as well as the 'guaranteed assassination' toggle from recent previous entries, which ensures that when you stab a man in the neck with a large sharp piece of metal, he does not react with a blasé "ow! Nevertheless…".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Being a modern Assassin's Creed game, however, the difficulty can vary wildly depending on whether you like mopping up optional content for shiny trousers, or just want to play the story or explore the world in peace, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review">like our Brendy</a>. I finished the game last week, and ended up whacking the difficulty down about half way though. Not because I wasn't enjoying combat - but because there was too much of it, and it was getting in the way of me riding around on horseback enjoying some of the best bad weather in gaming.</p>
<p>If you're someone who craves even more gruelling tests of swordsmanship, however, it sounds like the team are listening. "Obviously, we can't do everything, but there are things that we're going to be actioning on, and just for the next updates, there are quite a bit of bug fixes and little feature enhancement stuff that is coming in," Dumont said.

<p>PlayStation recently revealed that it provided extensive support during development to Game Science, a developer of Black Myth Wukong, among others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/black-myth-wukong-received-tons-of-support-from-sonys-content-ventures-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingBolt</a>, a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/leadership-spotlight-a-conversation-with-phil-rosenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new interview</a> with Phil Rosenberg, SVP of Global Partner Development and Relations at Sony Interactive Entertainment, revealed details about third-party games receiving support from PlayStation. Rosenberg first stated that the Content Ventures team at Sony is excellent at identifying new franchises and bringing them on. They have discovered games like Stray, Genshin Impact, Black Myth Wukong, Stellar Blade, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rosenberg added that there’s “nobody better in the world” than Christian Svensson and Shawne Benson at finding these hidden gems and “nurturing up-and-coming companies” that are usually very difficult to find. Moreover, the third-party account management team and the partner development team at Sony provide “tons of support” to games like Black Myth Wukong, Stray, and more, as they are often the first points of contact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were rumours earlier last year that Black Myth Wukong had not been released on Xbox due to an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-has-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusivity deal</a> with Sony. Also, a Microsoft representative later added that the delay was not due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-isnt-delayed-due-to-xbox-platform-limitations-microsoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platform limitations</a>. However, early this year, the CEO and founder of Game Science confirmed that the Xbox port for Black Myth Wukong didn’t arrive due to<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-xbox-delay-caused-by-series-s-issues-ceo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> optimisation issues on the Series S</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Black Myth Wukong knockoff has appeared on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-knock-off-appears-on-nintendo-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s Store</a>. Also, check out the CEO’s views on Wukong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-science-ceo-reveals-his-views-on-black-myth-wukong-not-winning-goty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not winning GOTY</a>.

            <p>The Last of Us has an ending that leaves many questions regarding Joel's actions. Was he right to do what he did? Well, The Last of Us' creator Neil Druckmann believes he was.</p>

<p>At the end of The Last of Us, Joel executes multiple members of the Fireflies when he discovers that for them to work on a cure for the cordyceps virus, Ellie would need to have an operation that would kill her.</p>
<p>By this point in The Last of Us' narrative, Joel has come to consider Ellie to be like his own child, and having already lost one daughter, he can not bring himself to lose another one. But, whether or not Joel was right to do this has been an ongoing debate since the first game released back in 2013.</p>
<p>Now, ahead of The Last of Us season two, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-hbo-creators-answer-whether-or-not-joel-was-right-to-save-ellie">IGN</a> asked the show's cast and creators the same question, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s own Neil Druckmann is firmly on the side of Joel simply doing what he had to do.</p>
<p>"I believe Joel was right," Druckmann said. "If I were in Joel's position, I hope I would be able to do what he did to save my daughter."</p>
<p>Fellow showrunner Craig Mazin added he would probably do the same thing if he was put into Joel's position. "But I'd like to think that I wouldn't," Mazin said, adding: "That's the interesting push and pull of the morality of it. And that's why the ending of the first game is so provocative and so wonderful. It just doesn't let you off the hook as a player.”</p>
<p>Mazin continued: "People get to the end of The Last of Us [the game] and there is that question, what would you do? What should you do if faced with the opportunity to save the world, if you sacrifice your child. That goes back to Abraham and Isaac. It's so profound. The notion of sacrifice to save the world."</p>
<p>"It's a difference between, OK, if I had to kill a random person to save who knows how many lives, in the abstract, you would say, well, yeah, that makes sense, of course,” Druckmann furthered. "But now, remove it from being a random person and it's your kid. Now the answer is very different."</p>
<p>Other cast members such as Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie in the show, said that Joel did save the world, it is just that the world he saved was his own. Jesse actor Young Mazino mused: "It's like death begets death begets death and I think that's just a perfect example. And yeah, it's his world. Who cares about the world if your world isn't there?"</p>
<p>These comments echo what Troy Baker - who plays Joel in the games (and James in the show's first season) has previously stated. Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-the-last-of-us-episode-nine">Baker said he believes Joel's actions at the end of The Last of Us to be "the most selfish act ever"</a>. However, he doesn't feel the ending could have played out any other way, as, in Joel's eyes, Ellie was "his world" and as such saving her was more important than saving humanity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/31/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Before nerd culture went mainstream, and everyone was into or aware of anime in all its forms, there was what anime die-hards called The Big Three. It was the three iconic and long-running shonen action manga &amp; anime series that were mainstream titans compared to any other series – Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach. The first two have had a healthy variety of video game adaptations over the years, but Bleach&nbsp;has never truly had its moment in the sun. A number of middling arena fighters have come and gone for the stylish and edgy series, but Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;aims to be a breakout hit by combining a reverence for the origins of the series with the sleek underground futurism of it’s recent anime revival seasons, all bundled together in what is easily the most inventive anime arena fighter I’ve played in years.</p>
<p><iframe title="BLEACH Rebirth of Souls – Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hiyFl_UPGpk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bleach&nbsp;has a huge amount of major story arcs, not unlike Naruto&nbsp;or&nbsp;One Piece, and its final story arc from the original manga was only just adapted into anime form with a stylish new set of finale episodes. You might expect a new game to tie in with that arc for the sake of recency and relevance, but Bleach: Rebirth of Souls goes back to the beginning. Literally all the way back to the very first scene of the very first episode. In a world where most video game adaptations of lengthy anime tend to skip over the fluff and dive right into the major moments, the story mode in this game is a refreshingly slow and detailed journey through the finer and often brushed-over moments of the franchise.</p>


<p>Is it so successful that you could play this as a substitute for reading the manga or watching the anime? Maybe not entirely. You do get a great dive into the world of Ichigo Kurosaki, a Japanese teen who encounters a mysterious woman calling herself a Soul Reaper and a giant monster attacking his family, leading him down a long and complicated road of becoming a Soul Reaper himself. While the details are there, and the character models are gorgeously detailed and incredibly accurate to the style of the source material, the animation in these story scenes can be really stiff at times, and some iffy dialogue pacing ruins the flow of otherwise impactful and emotional moments. I think it’s an incredible story mode for a die-hard fan of the series, but a newcomer might be left wondering what all the hype was about.</p>


<p>Thankfully,&nbsp;Bleach: Rebirth of Souls delivers plenty of it’s own hype that more than makes up for some minor story mode issues. The game is packed full of music from the composer of The World Ends With You,&nbsp;and I got goosebumps from almost every needle drop moment in the game. Each character’s theme plays when they awaken in combat and every impactful moment in the story mode is paired with a wild song, each track blending the style and mood of Bleach’s original soundtrack with vocals and in-your-face beats that made me feel like I was right back in front of Shibuya 108 fighting Noise with Neku. On top of that, every menu, transition, and piece of UI in the game is sleek and stylish in the coolest way possible – it’s an element of the presentation from the newest seasons of the anime that I’m really happy they adapted for this game.</p>
<p>Of course, the heart of Bleach: Rebirth of Souls, like any arena fighter, is in the combat, and this is where the game shines brightest. Battles are focused around a dual-health system slightly reminiscent of Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy.&nbsp;You have a minor Reishi health bar that is drained normally when attacks land on you, and if that bar goes into the red, you’re susceptible to suffer a Soul Break when another attack hits you, letting your opponent trigger a special attack that depletes a certain number of lives from your major Konpaku health gauge. Different characters deal a different number of damage in these attacks, but are also balanced in different ways beyond how strong those special attacks are.</p>

<p>I was blown away by how faithfully the game managed to take the silly, ridiculous, and often unfair abilities of its cast and adapt them into actual gameplay mechanics. Iconic villain Aizen can trigger his Kyoka Suigetsu ability in the middle of an opponent’s super attack animation, cancelling it completely and rewinding the clock back to before it ever happened. Shunsui, meanwhile, can trigger a mode that randomly activates one of several mini-games that you’re forced to play at the same time as your battle. It’s often hilarious how some of these characters operate, but what’s consistently impressive is how gorgeous every attack, ability, and Awakening animation is.</p>
<p>Those Awakenings are a core part of combat. Each character, after taking enough damage, has an Awakening they can trigger that will let them transform into whatever their respective power-ups from the original series entail, changing their attacks, abilities, and more. It’s a comeback mechanic built into the flow of battle, but rather than acting as a quick reversal of circumstances like a Tekken 8 Heat move, it instead adds a new layer to combat mid-battle that complicates the situation for both players. It’s a really fun way to emulate the tug-of-war patterns so many battles in the original series fall into, but it does so in a way that’s actually rewarding and exciting.</p>

<p>There’s more style, soul, and spark put into Bleach: Rebirth of Souls than I’ve seen from any other anime spin-off game since some of the earlier <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/10/18/review-naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-2/">Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm</a>&nbsp;releases. This is a game clearly made by fans and for fans where the aura and energy of the original series has been perfectly adapted into a fresh gameplay experience. It’s the game that Bleach fans have deserved for a long, long time.</p>

<p>In a new press release by Capcom, it has been announced that Monster Hunter Wilds has passed 10 million units sold in its first month of release.</p>



<p>The press release also reconfirmed that the first free title update will be released later this week and that the second update for the game will be released in the summer. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds impressive sales numbers puts it on pace to easier match Monster Hunter World, which went on to sell 22 million units since its release.</p>



<p>But it’s success wasn’t without its issues. On release, Monster Hunter Wilds surpassed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.3 million concurrent players</a>, but was criticised for its lack of PC optimisation. </p>



<p>“This game is absolutely amazing – but has the worst optimisation I’ve ever seen,” said one Steam user.</p>



<p>That being said, Monster Hunter Wilds continues to be a success for Capcom and the games multiple updates since release has addressed a lot of issues pertaining to PC optimisation.</p>



<p>As for where the success will end remains to be seen, but Wilds’ next target will likely to be to try and overtake Monster Hunter Wilds place to become the best-selling Monster Hunter game in the series.</p>



<p>Do you think Monster Hunter Wilds has enough lets to hit 22 million units sold? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

Jacksepticeye streamed the game extensively at the time it came out, and often mentions it as one of his favorites.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/31/jack-1743416008894.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jacksepticeye was working on a Soma animated show. Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for QTCinderella.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the video, Jacksepticeye talked generally about what has been a difficult period creatively following various projects that have either been canceled or failed to progress far enough to show his fans. Lamenting his lack of content creation lately, Jacksepticeye then revealed the Soma animated show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had a very large creative project that I was very excited to do, and — I don’t actually know if I’m allowed to say what it is — I’m just going to say what it is, and then if I’m not allowed to say it then this next part won’t be in it,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was planning to do a Soma animated show. Because I love Soma — Soma is top five, top 10 at least video games of all time for me. I absolutely love that game. It has one of the best stories ever in a video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I was so excited to do that. We’ve been talking to the developers for like a year, talking about that, and we were ready to go into full production on that. And I was so excited, and I really wanted to announce that to people, and to talk about it and get really stuck in and share it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because I wanted to play the game all in one video. And I was like, okay, I’ll hold off on that then till we can announce that we’re doing it. So that’s why I haven’t done it yet.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jacksepticeye went on to say the Soma animated show fell apart abruptly after an unnamed party suggested they wanted to do “in a different direction,” but he deliberately left out specifics because he was left so upset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We were making really great progress on that, and then it all just fell apart out of nowhere,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m not going to go into too many of the specifics of what happened, because I’m quite upset about what actually went down. But, it’s more of a, ‘we’re going in a different direction,’ kinda vibe. And that really upset me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jacksepticeye did not name the other parties involved. IGN has asked Frictional for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upset is the cancelation of Jacksepticeye’s Soma animated show “flipped” the YouTuber’s plans for 2025 “upside down.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had planned a lot of my year around it. I was like, you know what? I won’t be able to upload as much because I’ll be focusing everything I have into that. But at least I’ll have a really cool creative thing to show off. And I’ll have something for you and we can talk about it and share it and be part of this thing together and have fun with it. And then it all fell apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So all of my plans for the year are flipped upside down. Now what is the priority? What am I doing? I don’t know. I’ve had so many calls over the last couple of weeks. It’s been a lot. It’s been a tough month. I took time off and did all that and I have nothing at the end of it. It’s so frustrating. I hate that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of Soma, Frictional released two more Amnesia games: 2020’s Amnesia: Rebirth and 2023’s Amnesia: The Bunker. In July 2023, in the wake of the release of Amnesia: The Bunker, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amnesia-developer-frictional-games-cutting-back-on-horror">Frictional creative director Thomas Grip said the company was looking to cut back on horror games</a> "to give greater focus on other emotional qualities.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While all of our games have been horror in some way, what we really try to do is to get a kind of playable immersion," Grip said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want to give the player some sort of immersive fantasy, be that being a [World War 1] soldier trapped in a bunker or a robot stuck at the bottom of the ocean.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Horror games naturally are where emotions are front and centre. Games really excel at this. However, we are also exploring themes outside of making things spooky."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-has-surpassed-20-million-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding has reached a new milestone ahead of the sequel's release in a few months, Kojima Productions confirmed.</p>
<p>Today, it has been revealed that the first entry in the series connected over 20 million porters across all formats - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox, iOS, and Amazon Luna. This excellent result definitely bodes well for the sequel, which is launching in late June on PlayStation 5, and will presumably hit other formats in the future, like the original did after its PlayStation 4 release back in late 2019.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/">Death Stranding</a> is among the most unique open-world games ever released. As Sam Porter Bridges, players travel to a post-apocalyptic version of the United States called the United Cities of America, literally building connections between isolated communities to restore the bonds between the survivors of the apocalyptic Last Stranding. This unique experience was later enhanced in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/">Director's Cut</a> release, which added more features, including enhanced combat features.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which will launch on <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/">June 26th on PlayStation 5</a>, is looking to bring everything up to eleven with plenty of new mysterious characters, including Neil, played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli, who bears a striking resemblance to Solid Snake. Thankfully, it won't be long before we learn if the inclusion of this character will bridge the gap between the two series in some unexpected ways.</p>

        <p>Update 1.1 to make the factory sim yet more satisfying</p>

            <p>
Coffee Stain remain dissatisfied with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a>, their first-person factory sim, despite Matt Cox giving it the Cox's Orange Pippin Award in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactory-10-review">Satisfactory 1.0 review</a>. They're just about to release update 1.1 into public testing. This adds Photo Mode, programmable personnel elevators, and a bunch of twisty furnishings. 
</p>
<p>
One thing it doesn't add is rain, which used to exist in Satisfactory but was removed because it wasn't working properly. Apparently, Coffee Stain need to do an Unreal Engine upgrade before they can restore the missing precipitation. Many players are sad about this. Ah, I think it's kind of poetic that there are people in the Satisfactory community who wish only to be rained upon.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Here's a video in which the developers break down update 1.1's additions.
</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty7GdZvCETo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
And here's a quick summary of the highlights. They're adding branches for hypertube networks, allowing you to shoot down one or the other branch as though switching rails in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-adventure-2">Sonic Adventure 2</a>. They've got some fancy new throughput counters for conveyor belts so that you can easily track how many items a line is carrying. The editor now supports curved building modes for belts, and straight building mode for pipes. There are also new vertical belt splitters and mergers for people who like to expand upwardly, perhaps because they've covered every inch of available soil in metal.
</p>
<p>
New bits and pieces include railway buffers to close out railroads, and the aforesaid personnel elevators - more of a cosmetic flourish in a game with jetpacks, perhaps, but you can customise what the buttons do, and I imagine Satisfactory players will find many arcane applications for such functionality. Just don't use them to transport vehicles, because the game will act as though you've chucked a bunch of forklifts onto a bouncy castle.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least - proper controller support for your Eggbox and PlayStaycation peripherals! There's no final public release timing for the update yet beyond its experimental branch rollout from tomorrow, 1st April. That choice of release date is obviously cause for suspicion, but the developers assure us in the video that, unlike the Cox's Orange Pippin Award, update 1.1 is a real thing that exists.

            <p>If you are simply breezing your way through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and thinking to yourself 'oh I would love this so much more if it was a bit more challenging', well then I have some good news for you.</p>

<p>Based on my own experience with Shadows so far, this will not be a setting for me. Reader, I have died plenty on my adventures through Feudal Japan so far. But, for those who are not me, Dumont joked to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-devs-actively-looking-at-an-even-harder-difficulty-mode-for-the-rpg-how-challenging-do-you-want-it/">GamesRadar</a>: "How challenging do you want it?"</p>
<p>The developer added Ubisoft is "always listening and monitoring what players are doing" so it can address <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-fans-have-a-list-of-features-ubisoft-should-add-next">things like bug fixes and any other changes its community wants</a> via the "constructive feedback" it receives.</p>
<p>"Obviously, we can't do everything, but there are things that we're going to be actioning on, and just for the next updates, there are quite a bit of bug fixes and little feature enhancement stuff that is coming in," Dumont explained. "I can't just make a list. There's quite a bit of it. So the team is always working to improve the game, and hopefully, people will be able to see the difference when they're playing Shadows in the upcoming months."</p>

            <p>According to Sony's outgoing SVP of Global Partner Development and Relations, PlayStation is like a well choreographed dance.</p>
<p>The company's Phil Rosenberg will be heading off to pastures new at the end of this year. But, while he may be leaving, he has plenty of optimism for PlayStation's future.</p>
<p>"I think we have the smartest, brightest and most passionate people in the world working at [Sony Interactive Entertainment]. They are specialists in areas that need specific expertise. I think that as technology continues to evolve, it becomes more stable, will run faster and that gaming will be an even bigger part of our entertainment world," he said in <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/leadership-spotlight-a-conversation-with-phil-rosenberg/">a recent interview</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The exec went on to describe the company's workings being "like a ballet", saying while it may all appear "like it's kind of effortless", in reality there is "a lot of work" and "heavy lifting" behind the scenes.</p>
<p>"And we're really good at it,"  Rosenberg said.</p>
<p>The exec stated he was "very hopeful and very encouraged by the wind we have in our sails right now", adding he believes the company will "end this year on a great note". Meanwhile, while he didn't go into any great detail, he said all signs point to Sony having "another fabulous year" in 2026.</p>
<p>Based on nothing other than my own extrapolations, this comment made me think of Insomniac's Wolverine, which still doesn't have a release date yet. I am still hopeful for a release this year, although it was recently said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-release-window-narrowed-down-by-black-panther-himself">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra was aiming for a Christmas launch window</a> - would Sony want to release a first party Marvel game around the same time? I am not sure.</p>
<p>But, back to the matter in hand! Continuing his train of thought, Rosenberg said he is sure Sony has a "bright, bright future" in store. "This is not a '30 years and out' story," Rosenberg closed. "This is a '60 years and who the heck knows from there' story."</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Sony news, earlier this month a leak revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-experimenting-with-ai-powered-playstation-characters-ironically-chooses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate">the company was working on AI-driven characters</a>, including Aloy from the Horizon series.</p>
<p>This prompted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-actress-ashly-burch-responds-to-sonys-controversial-ai-aloy">Aloy's Ashly Burch to respond to the leaked footage</a>, with the actress stating she doesn't feel worried that the technology exists, or even because game companies want to use it, but it does still scare her.</p>
<p>"I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone's performance attached to it. That does have someone's voice, or face, or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse," Burch said. "They wouldn't have any protections. Any way to fight back.</p>
<p>"And that possibility... It makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The announcement of the long-rumored Final Fantasy IX may be imminent as Square Enix is gearing up to celebrate the game's 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>Earlier today, a new <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary news page</a> went live on the series' portal website, revealing some of the projects that will mark the occasion, including new figurines, plushies, and a commemorative record featuring a newly recorded version of the Melodies of Life theme song called Timeless Tale. Interestingly enough, a couple of months back, a Reddit user called<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i2putn/comment/m7gztwq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TomAto314</a> revealed they knew of this record, and the information in their possession suggested that the music contained in it was for a game, so there's a good chance this new version of the theme song could have been recorded for the yet to be announced remake.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake is one of the very few projects by Square Enix revealed via a massive GeForce Now leak a few years back that has yet to be announced. According to rumors, the remake will be quite <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">faithful to the original</a>, so we shouldn't expect a massive overhaul in the vein of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy. Unfortunately, it seems like we will have to wait a few more months to see Zidane and the gang back in action, as the remake isn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-active-development/">expected to release this year</a>, according to an extremely reliable insider.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features a lot of different side activities that reward players not only with experience points but also with all sorts of items, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-get-resources/">resources</a> that can be used to improve the Hideout and Legendary equipment, and Knowledge points, which are used to unlock new parts of Naoe and Yasuke's skill trees.</p>
<p>Among the activities that Naoe alone can complete to earn Knowledge points, as well as unlock a specific achievement, are Kuji-Kiri, quick time events where Naoe meditates while sitting in some rather stunning locations. If you're having trouble finding all 22 Kuji-Kiri locations, you have definitely come to the right place, as the maps below, divided by region, will help you pinpoint the locations with ease without having to look behind every nook and cranny of the game's massive map.</p>

<p>16 - On Mount Hiei, to the north of Sakamoto. During the meditation, you will be attacked by The Pond Yamabushi, a Level 40 enemy. As such, you will want to leave this Kuji-Kiri for when you are at a higher level, closer to the end of the Assassin's Creed Shadows campaign.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gets-new-details-from-official-website/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost of Yōtei is, without a doubt, one of the most anticipated games scheduled to launch in 2025. Its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, was the fastest-selling new IP debut for Sony's PlayStation 4 console when it launched, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-the-fastest-selling-new-sony-ip-during-ps4-gen-with-2-4-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registering</a> over 2.4 million units sold in the first three days on the market. It was so successful that Sony even fast-tracked a movie adaptation, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in March 2021, only a few months after the game's debut. The film is being directed by Chad Stahelski of John Wick fame.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima was an excellent game, as I said multiple times <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a> at the time. Interestingly, Sucker Punch has decided to make a spiritual sequel rather than a direct sequel. Ghost of Yōtei takes place in another place and another time, featuring a new main character. Now, Sucker Punch and Sony have shared a few more details by updating the game's page <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ghost-of-yotei/?country-selector=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the PlayStation website</a>.</p>
<p>The new protagonist, Atsu, lives in 1603, at the very beginning of the Edo period, in the lands surrounding the titular Mount Yōtei, the stratovolcano located on the snowy island of Hokkaido. At that time, this area was not officially part of Japan, making it somewhat of a wild frontier.</p>
<p>It is in this context that Atsu's life is upended when her homestead is burned to the ground. Following this tragic event, she undertakes a path of vengeance not unlike that of Jin Sakai, the protagonist of the previous game. According to the website, side content like bounties will provide Atus with the coin needed for the journey, but how she fights, survives, and evolves is entirely up to the player. The developers had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-feature-a-less-repetitive-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at users having more control over Atsu's story, so this could suggest some level of player choice. Could Sucker Punch allow users to choose how to complete some quests? It certainly sounds like it.</p>
<p>The website also promises new gameplay mechanics and improvements as well as new weapons, such as the ōdachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas. The environment will vary from sprawling grasslands with vegetation that reacts to the wind to snowy tundras, all the while gracing players with skies featuring massive sightlines. Of course, Ghost of Yōtei is being developed for PlayStation 5, though it will be best experienced on the PlayStation 5 Pro with enhanced visuals and performance.</p>
<p>The game has no release window yet. Like most publishers, Sony may be waiting to see if GTA VI really launches this year. Stay tuned to get informed when the launch date will be made official.</p>

            <p>"Alien Ant Farm or we boycott," reads the top comment on Activision's <a href="https://x.com/TonyHawkTheGame/status/1905290954191298620">recent reveal</a> of the next wave of tracks for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> - a response to the revelation that the upcoming remasters have both been hit <em>and</em> struck by some soundtrack changes, which hasn't gone down completely smoothly with fans. You could almost say they feel making alterations to such classics is criminal. OK, I'll stop. For now.</p>
<p>It turns out these changes come straight from the large Hawk himself. “It was my choice to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in THPS3+4 OST,” he wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tony-hawk-explains-controversial-pro-skater-34-soundtrack-changes-it-was-my-choice/">Very Gary Computing</a>. “I’m hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place. So listen and enjoy the ride. More to come… both old and new.”</p>

<p>I'm not sure I entirely buy this, for no substantial reason other than I've grown too weary to accept such chummy reasoning for anything a publisher the size of Activision does ever. Still, I reckon you've got a point there, Mr. Tony 'Tony Hawk' Hawk. The original games's role in introducing US skate punk and hip hop to a huge audience outside the states was undeniable, as was its influence on baggy jean and wallet chain sales. Giving exposure to some lesser known bands is no bad thing, even if I'm personally devastated by the<a href="https://youtu.be/yFA7c7uK5Ks"> loss (or lack of mention so far) of AFI</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/hDolkBP98Mg">Del Tha Funkee Homosapien</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose this might have gone down better if it wasn't for the already announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-career-mode-timer-1851768305">changes to THPS's career mode</a> (Kotaku), which is getting replaced by time challenges ala the prior games, though there'll reportedly still be a free skate option. </p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545710/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_3__4/">out on Steam</a> July 11th, 2025. I assume so much licensed music means they'll be a robust option for streamers. Otherwise they might get copyright-struck down. Possibly in the bedroom. It'll be their doom, presumably.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Over the weekend, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> team announced the second wave of music set for the upcoming remakes, but some noticed a few omissions from the original games. However, there is a good reason for this, with none other than Tony Hawk himself taking responsibility.</p>
<p>"It was my choice to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">THPS3</a>+4 OST," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Hawk wrote on Instagram</a>. "I’m hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place. So listen and enjoy the ride."</p>

<p>Hawk closed by assuring fans there is "more to come… both old and new", so keep your eyes and ears out for those.</p>
<p>As for that second wave of music, it includes tracks such as Hollywood Baby by 100 gecs and 2 Minutes to Midnight by Iron Maiden.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-soundtrack-details-rolled-out">Previously confirmed tracks coming to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> include Ace of Spades by Motörhead (of course!!), Damaged Goods by Gang of Four and Collard Greens by Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar, to name just a handful.</p>
<p>You can check out the full soundtrack (so far) over on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWU4xkATYcbh7?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaaNnBQwFy3CDZKngGhvo-xQ3sKyjajcgV6i1mG3EL6vTaTiXQt-NhjNQT8_aem_QZupxh6pl3kr_nPv5OsN3Q">Spotify</a>.</p>

<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC (via Steam, Battle.net and Microsoft Store), and Nintendo Switch on 11th July, 2025. It will also be coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.</p>
<p>On its release, there will be some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-is-switching-up-how-thps4-works">changes to how things work in the remake of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-reportedly-intervened-to-get-bam-margera-in-pro-skater-3-4-remake-after-activision-said-no">skater and former Jackass star Bam Margera will feature in the upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake</a>, despite being omitted from the publisher's previously released skater roster. This was all supposedly thanks to a last-minute intervention by Tony Hawk himself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rumours of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy IX</a> remake have been remaking themselves part of the discourse for several years now, sparked by the announcement of an animated series and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hopes-for-god-of-war-on-pc-stoked-by-leaked-nvidia-list">Nvidia leak back in 2021</a>, and stoked by manifestations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-tactics-ogre-reborn-leak-brings-screenshots-and-a-release-date">several</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-finally-announce-chrono-cross-remaster">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Squeenix</a> games from the leaked Geforce list. Now, Square Enix have added a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th">dedicated 25th anniversary</a> page flogging figures, spectacles, and other charming tat to their website.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a>'s 25th cake day isn't until July 7th, but this new page <a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/1888418337790534097">lines up with claims</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">Oblivion remake</a> leaker NateTheHate that we're getting closer to an announcement, if not a release. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-reportedly-real-and-happening-giving-hope-for-one-of-the-series-finest-to-finally-come-to-pc">has also claimed</a> that the Final Final Tactics remaster is still being worked on - a rumour that's been twinned with the FF9 one for about as long as it's been floating about.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For now, all we have are Quina plushies, Garnet figures, and a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5482">lovely looking graphic novel starring Vivi</a>. I've come to love Vivi over the years, as well as as FF9 as a whole. I must confess that, when the game released, I was <em>that guy</em>. You know, that guy who had just played as brooding big-sword Cloud and brooding big-sword Squall and wasn't thrilled to be handed a whimsical monkey boy named after a footballer with dodgy chibi proportions. "What is this magical, fanciful tomfoolery!" I cursed. "I want to shoot motorbikes at my rival's floating child soldier training facility!". Thankfully, I have seen the error of my ways. Final Fantasy 9 is lovely.</p>
<p>If you don't fancy waiting for a remake that might not exist -  like some sort of hopeful but deeply disorientated salmon smashing itself repeatedly against a rock jutting out from a crystalline stream consisting mostly of frothy leaker saliva - then the beautifying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-9-has-never-looked-better-than-it-does-with-the-moguri-mod">Moguri mod</a> may be for you. You get some extra frames (15 to 30), alongside high-resolution textures. Flap in anguish no more, noble salmon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> was arguably one of the biggest surprises out of The Game Awards 2024. There was no prior rumor that CAPCOM would revive a long-dead franchise whose latest installment launched nearly twenty years ago. Still, fans of the action/adventure franchise were definitely elated, especially after learning that they wouldn't have to wait too long, given the 2026 release window.</p>
<p>Japanese publication Famitsu recently <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/37453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the Producer Akihito Kadowaki and Game Director Satoru Nihei, who shared several details on the game's structure and length. The Producer said:</p>
<p><em>I want to make it a satisfying volume for a single action game. It's not a game where you defeat the same boss over and over like "Monster Hunter," so I think it will take about 20 hours to complete. It hasn't been decided yet, though. Basically, the story progresses as you clear stages. It's not an open world.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Kadowaki said that while the timeline won't change, the location may change, although it will still be mainly focused on Kyoto in the early Edo period (seventeenth century). Regarding difficulty, the two suggested Onimusha: Way of the Sword won't be a super challenging game:</p>
<p><em><strong>Satoru Nihei — </strong>We want a wide range of action game fans to enjoy the game, so we are proceeding with a policy of not making it extremely difficult. However, if the bosses are easily defeated, it will be boring, so we are continuing to make adjustments every day.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Akihito Kadowaki</strong> <strong>— </strong>Having a difficulty setting hasn't been decided yet. I'll say it again, but I want action fans to enjoy the game to the fullest, so I don't want to make it too difficult, and I want to pursue the appeal of being able to feel a sense of accomplishment when you beat it.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, the two stated that the setting has been completely reimagined, including the Oni and Genma clans. As such, there's essentially no direct connection to the previous installments, which also helps introduce newcomers to Onimusha: Way of the Sword.</p>
