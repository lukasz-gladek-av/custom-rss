			<p>I’ve been pretty excited for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> ever since its announcement. I’m someone that like’s Ubisoft’s open worlds, and I also like Star Wars, so a combination two where you play as a Han Solo-type that can con, grift and blast their way to riches is just about a dream come true. So, how does a game where you are a scruffy looking nerf-herder actually work?</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws: Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmj-U_WjJzA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws begins on the streets of Canto Bight, a rough place that’s full of, you guessed it, scum and villainy. You may recognise it from The Last Jedi – it’s the place with the alien race horses. Kay Vess is a down-on-their-luck scoundrel looking for that one big score that will allow her and Nix, her adorable little Merqaal, to retire in luxury. However, when that opportunity turns up, things inevitably go awry and one hasty escape later, you find yourself on the moon of Toshara with a damaged ship to repair, an open world to explore, and a heist crew to get together for your mysterious new employer.</p>


<p>You have nine crew members to gather, though most of them don’t actually join you on your ship, instead training you with certain things, like heavy weapons for example, all unlocking new abilities for Kay and/or Nix. Those that do join you have significant quest lines and you can interact with them on &nbsp;your ship, but the others are given more superficial characterisation. It also doesn’t really feel like a cohesive crew, as there’s very little interaction between them.</p>


<p>That’s not to say that tracking them down isn’t fun though, the game taking you between five different planets. Tatooine is here as it is seemingly a legal requirement for all Star Wars media, allowing you to fulfil your dreams of driving a speeder across the Dune Sea, but there’s also Akiva, a lush jungle world with plenty of water, Kijimi, which is a large city on an extremely snowy planet, Cantonica, where Canto Bight is, and the extremely windy moon of Toshara. The latter is where you’ll be learning the basics when it comes to scoundrel-ry as you navigate the fierce rivalry between two crime syndicates in the area, the Pykes and Crimson Dawn.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most interesting part of the game. You maintain a reputation with each of the four syndicates (the remaining two are the Ashiga and the Hutts – yes, those Hutts), but helping one usually means upsetting another… because it usually involves stealing from and shooting them. There are five tiers of reputation, with the worst causing them to send assassins after you, attacking whenever you see any members of the faction, and, worst of all, giving out fewer contracts to take. If you get more popular with them, you’ll be able to walk around all but the restricted areas of their territories both in cities and in the open world without being bothered, you’ll get discounts and a wider selection of rare parts from merchants, and the best contracts to complete.</p>
<p>It’s a really cool idea that is mostly delivered effectively, but there are a few hiccups. You can just sneak into their territory if your reputation is too low, but this becomes a forced stealth section that disables your guns and is an instant fail if you’re spotted. Now, sneaking in is fun enough, but one of your tools – a silenced stun gun – is a pretty useful part of sneaking that it takes away from you for some reason. Not being able to shoot also just feels a little out of character, when you’re more than welcome to wander into, say, a Hutt workshop in the wilderness and shoot everyone full of burning holes.</p>

<p>There is one group we haven’t mentioned yet: the Imperials. Outlaws is set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, so Stormtroopers are a pretty common sight, and have their own camps and fortifications from which to pilfer goods and information. The Empire has quite a bit of tech, so you’ll be going on contracts to break into their compounds and gather rare materials for upgrades, downloading data they’ve collected of syndicates to return to them (or to their rivals). You’ll get a wanted level that has five stages if you’re careless, the final stage of which involves Death Troopers. They will eventually abandon the search if you can stay away from them for long enough, or you could break into an Imperial outpost and wipe your wanted level with a terminal, or escape into space and find an Imperial probe that you can hack to do the same.</p>
<p>These systems – the factions, the Imperials, and the contracts you get against them – combine into something that is pretty damn good at giving you the experience of being a scoundrel. Stealing from Stormtroopers, getting caught and fleeing to your ship, blasting off into space, taking out a few TIE Fighters whilst you wait for your Hyperdrive and then fleeing at lightspeed to Tatooine to deliver something to Jabba the Hutt is a sequence of events I once thought I would never experience in a game. There are a lot of other touches that really sell the scoundrel archetype as well, such as picking up information on scores by eavesdropping on conversations, discovering fixed Fathier races allowing you to bet without risk, or playing Sabacc, which I’ve been surprised to find I actually enjoy and not just because you can cheat at it.</p>

<p>Then there’s the Trailblazer, your ship. It’s great, handling very well both in intense combat and whilst carefully edging around wrecks looking for loot, and firing off a proton torpedo to finish off an enemy amongst a cacophony of laser fire never gets old. However, space in Outlaws is fairly limited. Once you regain control from the practically seamless take off cutscene, each planet has a reasonably sized area to fly around in your ship with some stuff to loot and plenty of space battles to end up in,&nbsp;but you could probably knock out all the locations on your first visit and have no reason outside of contracts and missions to go there again. What’s there is enjoyable enough, there just isn’t that much of it.</p>
<p>This is also your one and only ship, and there’s limited options to improve it. Cannons, proton torpedos, shields and the like all have two or three variants to choose between, and these can then be upgraded once or twice each. I’d have loved to see a loot system for more depth to upgrading my ship, but it’s basically like upgrading the weapons in Kay’s pocket, and it just doesn’t really feel like it’s <em>my</em> ship.</p>
<p>I also don’t get to ride the Speeder I really want to – you know, the one from Return from the Jedi? This one looks like a real life motorbike without wheels, but everyone I’m fighting uses the one I wanted, so I’m blowing it up over and over like some kind of ironic punishment. It has other quirks, like speeder free zones kicking you off and forcing you to run away and summon it to you, which is frustrating to say the least, but it gets you from A to B quite handily.</p>

<p>Another slightly underwhelming aspect is that, graphically, Star Wars Outlaws is not <em>that</em> amazing playing on PS5. The planets look nice, and Toshara’s environment is pretty distinctive, but aside from that we’re talking about your fairly standard feeling jungle, desert, and snow planets. Perhaps other open world games have spoiled me, but outside of those first launch into space, Outlaws didn’t make me gasp with its beauty like AC Valhalla did. Facial animations are a little stilted and rough as well, even with Kay and other main characters.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Kay Vess can mostly can be summed up as being a Han Solo-type with a Merqaal instead of a Wookie. She can be entertaining at times, but doesn’t leave much of an impression beyond her archetype. The villains and syndicate leaders are a touch more interesting, but they are in the background for most of the game.</p>
<p>There are also a handful of bugs that I’ve encountered, though nothing game breaking. I completed the last section of a mission three times before it stopped showing back up in my journal, as well as some minor graphical glitches and bugs in randomly occurring event quests that will hopefully be patched out.</p>

			<p>Wccftech's first Gamescom 2024 appointment was with Yellow Brick Games, a Canadian studio getting ready to release its debut game, the fantasy action/adventure Eternal Strands. The developer was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-mike-laidlaw-new-studio-yellow-brick-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> in late 2020 by Mike Laidlaw, formerly franchise director for Dragon Age at BioWare. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gets-new-trailer-at-xbox-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing</a> a new trailer at the Xbox Showcase, there's a brand new gameplay video out today.</p>
<p>More importantly, the embargo for Gamescom 2024 hands-on is now up. You can read our enthusiastic preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gamescom-hands-on-preview-magical-mayhem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>; this article, on the other hand, is dedicated to our chat with Game Director Frederic St-Laurent, who confirmed the game's estimated length and talked about the physics emphasis designed into the title and much more.</p>
<p>Eternal Strands is slated to launch in early 2025 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010810/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/eternal-strands/9NNKJNRKFT0G" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Xbox Series S|X</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="101 Gameplay Trailer | Eternal Strands" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHxtabO0hj8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Can you introduce the main character?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> You play as Brynn, the point scout of a band of magic holders called Weavers. This is your base camp, where all the companions are located, the smith, the enchanter, and the lore keeper.</p>
<p>At this point of the story, you have just broken through the Enclave, a magical place that has been shut down for 50 years. You're the first one to get in since, and when you get in, everything is half-destroyed and you're trying to find what's going on here.</p>
<p>Your objective here is to defeat a big epic monster to collect some of the magical threads for you to just gear up and get more powerful.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned the big monster. Was Shadow of the Colossus a major inspiration for Eternal Strands?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. We've all been a big fan of that. A mix of that, Dragon's Dogma, and, of course, Zelda has been another inspiration because of the vivid colors.</p>
<p><strong>You also have an emphasis on physics, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yes, our character is driven by physics. All our climbing is with physical constraints. We have powers using telekinesis that make things move around. We fully simulate the heat and cold in every pocket of air, like every cell of air in the environment, every two meters is simulated with the temperature. If you heat up a rock, that becomes your powerball, basically, and if it falls into grass, then grass will ignite and so on.</p>
<p><strong>This sounds very Zelda-like, too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> It is, but we chatted with them as well, and we go just a little bit beyond because they have a good chemistry in terms of element to element, but they don't have the air being simulated per se.</p>
<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch probably wasn't powerful enough to do that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yeah, maybe, that's true. So, like I said, Brynn is the scout. She's the one going out while the other ones wait at the base camp. She's a kind of Warrior, so she can use the sword and shield. You can swap between the three weapons that you have, which also include the bow and the two-hander greatsword. Every weapon has a base attack and then an alternate attack. If you charge like this and you can hold, you can go through and cycle again to a more powerful attack.</p>
<p><strong>Are there combos or stuff like that in Eternal Strands?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> There are combos, but our philosophy is more like... It's sword and magic, but magic is the most powerful, so the weapons are complementary. All the weapons have some magic as well. If you hold this one here, you can see that it creates these spikes of ice. If you go with this one, it has a telekinesis bubble that attracts stuff. You also have the fire spells. Be careful not to stand in the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent: Your own fire damages you as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Oh yeah, it's fire. You get some resistance while you cast, but after that, fire is fire, and you can see that it's going to propagate and burn.</p>
<p><strong>I see that the fire breath melts ice down.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yeah, exactly. Oh, I forgot this one. It's kind of a magic tube. You can put an object in there or launch yourself as well, or cast Molten Barrage in there. We emphasize synergies.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Everything is fully destructible.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Is there crafting in Eternal Strands?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> We have made some of the crafting systemic, so it's not like you have a piece of armor and you need these ingredients. There are many types of fabrics, and the way it works is what you loot, every piece, like, let's say, the ones you just got, those are good for cold resistance and not so good at heat resistance.</p>
<p>As you input those into your recipe, it will output stats. Some armored pieces have a predefined step at the beginning, so okay, this one is going to be the one that is better against heat, and then you can boost it up or change it or make it more versatile, but that's really going through a more systematic approach. It changes the looks as well, like changing the color of the armor piece.</p>
<p><strong>What's the structure of the world like? I mean, is it basically various zones that you go through?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yes, exactly. Eternal Strands is not an open world, but there are a number of big maps that you can walk around and explore, and they connect to each other.</p>
<p>We also have physics-based environmental challenges that reward you with some new recipes. In this case, you just unlocked the frost two-hander, which is the opposite version of the big sword of fire you had. You'll need to return to base camp to craft something, as you cannot craft on the field.</p>
<p>Everything is fully destructible, everything's going to start to burn. Another thing that I really like with the crafting and the loot is, let's say you burn a tree. Then the tree is going to drop something at the end, but you might get better wood out of it, because it's a charwood.</p>
<p>If you freeze an enemy so hard, it's going to brittle and destroy all the loot table related to metal. If you burn an enemy, then all the woven resources are going to burn as well, so as a player, you have control of the loot table directly playing with them.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have an emphasis on traversal as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Lightweight. You can climb anything you want. Also, if you want to manually cling on something, it's the Y button.</p>
<p><strong>I guess you can climb big monsters.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yeah, and they will try to shake you off, so a bit like in Shadow of the Colossus, you need to hold on to not get shaken off.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have difficulty settings in the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yes, but it's a light change. It only increases Brynn's health points. If you put it on easy, we'll just add you more health. We're indie, so we haven't changed spawns or enemy behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a release window?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Early 2025. We're also going to look at everything else coming out in that time frame. By the way, the basic loop in Eternal Strands is nuanced by the fact that you have quests. In this demo, we don't emphasize it, but you're going to bond with the companions, so they're going to ask you to do something for them, and there's dialogues. The game is fully voiced over in French and English.</p>
<p><strong>That's maybe where Mike Laidlaw's influence is more felt.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Exactly. Whereas I'm more about all the systems and crafting and loot, Mike's background is of course more about bringing out the lore, so we balance each other.</p>
<p><strong>But it's not like Dragon Age, where you can make choices, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> No, no, the focus is still more on action adventure. The stories play a fair part in it, though. You have some dialogue choices, but they won't change the story's outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so it's just to learn more lore or more info.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yeah, and also, it's going to influence your relationship with your companions.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Epic was impressed with what we've been doing with their Chaos Engine.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you have an estimate on the length?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> It's between 25 to 35 hours.</p>
<p><strong>So, is there some side content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yes. In the past playthrough I did, I took my time and everything, but I ended up with 40 hours doing every quest in the game. I expect players are going to go a little bit faster than that, but still, just the main bath is 25 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Did you settle already on the price point?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> To be confirmed. It's not set yet.</p>
<p><strong>Who is the publisher of Eternal Strands?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> We're self-publishing.</p>
<p><strong>You're based in Canada, correct?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yes, Quebec province. We're in Quebec city, but we have a satellite studio in Montreal as well.</p>
<p><strong>How big is the studio right now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> We're 70.</p>
<p><strong>Do you consider yourself AA-plus?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> I would say we're an independent studio. That's what I would say. After that, it is not a one-man game because we're still 70, but we're not trying to be AAA in any sense.</p>
<p><strong>I saw there is also item rarity in the game, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Exactly right. By the way, when you die, your companion can retrieve some of the crafting resources you had gathered, but not everything. You can select.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like to develop in Unreal Engine 5?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> It's been great. There are so many resources. The Chaos Engine for the physics was fairly new, so we've been lucky to have good contacts with them and I must say, I'm kind of happy that they're being impressed with what we've been doing with their fairly new Chaos Engine.</p>
<p><strong>That's the one thing they've been improving, right? But not many games have used it so far.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yes, exactly. So they probably like adding more serious test cases.</p>
<p><strong>Also, there doesn't seem to be any shader stuttering. Many UE games lately stutter a lot, especially on PC, but this seems to be running pretty well.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a talent tree sort of thing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> No, it's really gear-focused rather than having any RPG-like skill trees. You gather the magic powers by defeating these big monsters and you loot stuff and you gear up. As simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>How did you ensure that boss fights would be varied? When you have a game mostly focused on big monsters, maybe the issue is how you make them different from one another, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Yeah, exactly. We try to come up with different archetypes. This one is more of a Mage type, so he won't move a lot. If you stay far, it will hurt you more than if coming close. It has fewer things to do when you come up close versus another one that we would have where they would charge you constantly, and then you're trying to stay away instead.</p>
<p>We're trying to come up with verbs of action, let's say, come closer, avoid the mouth. This is how we come up with the rest of their abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Can you do the same thing over and over? Like, freeze him over and over. Because in some games, they build up resistances, and you have to switch things up a bit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> No, we haven't felt the need to do that.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It's really gear-focused. There are no RPG-like skill trees.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do the enemies change with the varying time of day?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Not for the night. However, because the Enclave is kind of a magical place in disarray, sometimes it can get like drought, super intense heat, and sometimes, for instance, cold. And yes, the enemy will change. You'll get more cold related enemies rather than the normal ones.</p>
<p><strong>This seems like a game that YouTubers can use to make really cool shorts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St-Laurent:</strong> Oh yes, yeah, I'm craving for this. By the way, you can upgrade each power in the full game.</p>
<p><strong>That was a really cool demo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frederic St</strong>-<strong>Laurent:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gamescom-hands-on-preview-magical-mayhem/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yellow Brick Games is among the many game development studios formed in the past few years by AAA industry veterans that show a lot of promise. Earlier this year, the studio founded by longtime Dragon Age series creative director Mike Laidlaw, among others, announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gets-new-trailer-at-xbox-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eternal Strands</a>, an action role-playing game set in a magical world where players control Brynn, one of the last magic users remaining in the world after a cataclysmic event.</p>
<p>Magic definitely seems to be at the center of the experience, judging from the around 20-minute-long demo I had the chance to try out during Gamescom 2024. As the developers themselves revealed, the game feels a lot like a combination of the latest entries in The Legend of Zelda series and Shadow of the Colossus, with a sprinkling of Monster Hunter on top, with large colorful locations to explore, tons of enemies to defeat and some massive bosses that require players to climb on them to reach and exploit their weak points.</p>
<p>From this very brief overview, one may think that Eternal Strands is nothing special, but that is not the case at all. While it is true that the experience feels a little derivative here and there, with mechanics like stamina-based climbing inspired by Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, the game has plenty that makes it stand out from its illustrious inspirations. For starters, Eternal Strands doesn't feature a massive weapon selection, but only three of them - Sword and Shield, Bow, and Two-Hander. All three weapons have an extensive moveset, which is further expanded by the elemental properties Brynn can wield using magic. Combat feels fluid enough, coming with all the features seen in similar third-person games, such as combos with light and heavy attacks, dodging, lock-on (which is not available for bosses), and the like.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>What truly makes Eternal Strands stand out is the well-realized magic system. Every spell, from the simplest elemental shots to the more complex gravity-based ones, interacts not only with the environment and the enemies but also with one another. One gravity spell, for example, can propel Brynn forward and up in the air, but it can also be used to push enemies into chasms or to extend the range of elemental shots. In other cases, another spell can make other spells whose effects go off after a short while activate instantly.</p>
<p>The interactions with enemies are no less varied. An enemy is using a wooden shield? No worries, you can just burn it off using fire magic. An enemy is too mobile for your tastes? No problem, just freeze their legs and they will stop moving. During my short time with the game, I tried experimenting a bit to find some unique interactions, finding it incredibly fun to burn grass to set a large group of enemies on fire or use a gravity spell to attract them to a single spot and then launch them in the air with another. The developers themselves are expecting to see players come up with interactions they didn't know about, so in this regard, Eternal Strands should offer plenty of fun.</p>

<p>Having experienced almost nothing of the story, it's hard to say if Eternal Strands will deliver a well-rounded experience when it launches sometime next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, but there's no doubt that the game by Yellow Brick Games will offer plenty of fun for those who like experimenting and finding new ways to break the experience, as many have done with the latest entries in the Zelda series. I, for one, am definitely looking forward to seeing more of the possibilities the game will offer. Meanwhile, check out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-qa-game-length-confirmed-between-25-and-35-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Game Director Frederic St-Laurent.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there’s one constant modern Star Wars can attest to, it’s the continued cultivation and success of its video games. The last several years have seen a solid portfolio of titles that expand the known Star Wars universe, whilst remaining true to form all while rivaling the live-action output in the same franchise.</p>
<p>Those seeds continue to be sown with the release of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, as Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment step up to the plate with an all-new action game in an attempt to make their mark on the playing field. This time, it’s open world and it won’t be focused on a Jedi story, as many of Star Wars games were wont to do.</p>
<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is promising a new adventure where you take on the Han Solo-esque role of a scoundrel and trek through a galaxy that isn’t as black and white as it first seems.</p>
<p>As someone who has always been keen on Star Wars as a video game medium, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> caught my eye because of that type of pivot. Here we were going to play as someone who isn’t a Force user, who must rely on cunning, stealth, and blaster skill to get by.</p>
<p>Being able to play as a normal person in a fantastical galaxy far, far away certainly has its appeal. But how does it hold up in practice? Let’s dig in.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-20-23-14-53.jpg?itok=H7Q6MJyc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-20-23-14-53.jpg?itok=_aS23v2A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As with most Star Wars games, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is a narrative-driven journey across many hours, told through quests, cutscenes, and the various worlds you’ll visit in an era between the films <em>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.</p>
<p>This story introduces Kay Vess, a young woman just trying to scrape by, taking on odd jobs as a thief in an effort to secure her own freedom. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> kicks off her journey with a grand heist and this sets the stage for much of what comes after.</p>
<p>Kay is tasked with sneaking into a high-stakes vault in the series' familiar location of Canto Bight, a city renowned for its wealth and entertainment. The goal? A massive vault with riches untold, but sneaking in won’t be easy. She’ll have to use every tool available to her, along with her trusty sidekick Nix, to pull it off.</p>
<p>As this opening sets the stage for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, so too does it kick off the opening to the greater journey Kay will have in the shadow of the Empire. With a bounty on her head following the events at Canto Bight, she has nowhere to go but up – literally, as she makes her way to other planets, encounters the galaxy’s various syndicates, and puts together a crew worth heisting with.</p>

It’s a lesson that I ultimately came to appreciate because it kept the story fresh, and it kept me on my toes because it wasn’t always obvious just who was on Kay’s side or not. Much like the live-action series <em>Andor</em>, there’s a lot of depth crafted in both the individual stories, as well as the larger politics at play.</p>
<p>The story of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is well-woven into its main quest and all the secondary quests that make up the game world. Things like local lore and discovering new locations are fed into the living planets Kay gets to visit as a form of organic storytelling.</p>
<p>It’s also bolstered by its unique cast of characters. For example, there’s Kay herself, whose no-nonsense attitude isn’t dampened by her situation; Nix, her companion and beloved family member; and ND-5, a droid from the Clone Wars era who is surprisingly fleshed out in a positive way.</p>
<p>All these different parts come together to frame an exciting adventure that never loses its spark.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-22-15-51-39.jpg?itok=5NDcDUww 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-22-15-51-39.jpg?itok=-Ky_E8se 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This of course plays hand in hand with the action-adventure elements of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. The gameplay loop is established early on, and I found the gunplay controls quick to pick up and get used to, along with the addition of the sidekick Nix, who can aid with specific tasks out in the field.</p>
<p>Most of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> will have you fighting, sneaking around, and exploring by land or space. They’ve really outfitted Kay here with a number of abilities, including gadgets such as grenades, as well as melee combat to help her get around and through conflicts without the use of a lightsaber or Force abilities.</p>
<p>The gunplay is pretty standard but becomes bolstered by the various upgrades that can be installed on Kay’s blaster. This includes expansion to various blast types including plasma, ion, and power.</p>
<p>Plasma, as the name suggests, fires standard plasma bolts and can be upgraded to improve accuracy, add rapid firing, and more. Ion fires off ionized particles and is great against enemy droids or enemies with shields. Power charges a heavy plasma blast that can take down armored enemies or help get through certain obstructions.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-21-19-29-32.jpg?itok=1vJuxlru 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-21-19-29-32.jpg?itok=W2qVqZ0Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It’s a simple setup, but it’s effective in how you can choose to customize each upgrade, as well as the collection of different guns Kay can pick up during exploration. My only gripe is she doesn’t keep any of them beyond her own blaster, and it was sometimes tedious to have to pick dropped weapons back up after interacting with a door or other item in the midst of combat.</p>
<p>When in doubt, Kay can just punch a guy and that’s plenty satisfying on its own. The formula largely doesn’t deviate much other than that, and your mileage may vary depending on the number of hours sunk into playing the game.</p>
<p>An auxiliary system known as Experts does alleviate this a bit by being able to unlock new abilities through normal gameplay – many of which are optional.</p>
<p>While fighting is a big part of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, I was surprised at how big of a role stealth played in, well, pretty much everything for better or worse.</p>
<p>Right from the start, it’s apparent that sneaking around, stealing items, and dodging alarm systems is something Kay will become very familiar with. I found myself taking the time to explore because the game does let you approach these sections in different ways. I failed quite a bit, but it was a learning experience in finding what worked for me.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-23-0-6-27.jpg?itok=g9--J312 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-23-0-6-27.jpg?itok=KWbyEDOx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I did find all the sneaking around to be tiring a ways into the story, and I just wanted to move on to the next part of the action because I was more interested in that than a pale go-around at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/metal-gear-solid-v-final-review"><em>Metal Gear Solid</em></a>.</p>
<p>One of the most helpful elements of the stealth game within a game is the use of Nix. He’s essentially the second main character here and an extension of Kay beyond what she can do on her own.</p>
<p>Not only can Nix sus out enemies and context clues in the environment, but he can also be made to do quick actions such as opening doors, gathering items, disabling alarms, and even distracting and fighting enemies. It was convenient to just let Nix go ham and scope out most of an area before I moved or did anything. He’s a great asset, and his loss is very noticeable in the areas where you can’t use him.</p>
<p>Another key tentpole of gameplay in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> includes the various vehicles you get to mess around with.</p>
<p>On the ground, Kay gets access to a speeder, which can zip across the terrain at high speed, and later be upgraded during the course of the main story. There’s also a starship she gets a hold of known as the Trailblazer, which too can be modified with extra parts such as turrets and propulsion systems.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-23-17-31-54.jpg?itok=erBk7ceZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-23-17-31-54.jpg?itok=lEK6Aqk6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This takes us into outer space, where true exploration and combat are realized. It’s not just a glorified loading screen either, there’s plenty to be aware of upon exiting a planet’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>There’s never a dull moment as you’re likely to be confronted by pirates, Imperial forces, or other syndicates jousting for superiority. There’s also an element of exploration with ships looking for rescue, or hidden treasures amongst floating debris.</p>
<p>While controlling the ship can be somewhat tricky at times, I do appreciate that space is more than just a travel point. There’s something particularly satisfying about pulling the analog sticks and hitting the jump to lightspeed after all.</p>
<p>Back on land, the breadth of <em>Outlaws</em>’ open world circles back around as something I considered to really cater to my sensibilities. The variety of quests involving the major syndicates (Pyke, Crimson Dawn, the Hutt Cartel, and the Ashiga Clan) will have you taking on contracts in order to boost your reputation with any one of them and traveling around detailed landscapes to do so.</p>
<p>The reputation system is outlined by your relationship with each faction and dictates how syndicates will interact with you and which areas you can enter without conflict. Reputation can also be lost by doing things such as trespassing or choosing to go against a rival syndicate during a quest choice.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-23-17-22-29.jpg?itok=FdLYRvci 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-23-17-22-29.jpg?itok=2XamypSS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On top of all that, the Empire has their own form of engagement with the Imperial Wanted System. Much like in <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, getting caught doing crimes against the Empire will put you on their wanted list. That means they’ll be chasing after you with increasing firepower depending on just how much you’ve gotten into trouble.</p>
<p>Kay can clear her name by avoiding detection after a time, hacking computers, and even bribing officers to look the other way. My thoughts on this open-world system are fairly neutral, but it can add a level of tedium with stealth such a big aspect of the game already.</p>
<p>It’s just one of many ways that <em>Outlaws</em> tries to cater to its open-world sensibilities, and there’s a lot in the game to keep you occupied including side quests, mini-games, and unlocking abilities.</p>
<p>What’s helpful too is all these things are largely spelled out – there’s a surprising absence of the typical open-world jank, what with a lot of what <em>Outlaws</em> makes you do feel organic and complimentary to the main quest. That said, there still are the occasional fetch quests that feel like they’re just there to pad time and don't do much beyond that.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-23-0-35-53.jpg?itok=nDxLBJ40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws2024-8-23-0-35-53.jpg?itok=MJ9H_0ps 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Outlaws</em> puts it all together with some amazing art direction and inspired music, and although the character animations do leave a little to be desired, the world is varied enough that it’s a small complaint in the grand scheme of things. I also encountered some visual and performance issues during my game on PC, which will hopefully be ironed out for launch.</p>
<p>Overall, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> represents another positive achievement for modern Star Wars in the same capacity we've already seen from the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">Star Wars Jedi</a> </em>games. While certain aspects like combat and stealth could be more fleshed out to keep things fresh, and some of the side quests more engaging, the story and characters carry a main story that manages to ramp up and stick the landing. I loved spending time with Kay, Nix, ND-5, and the rest of the crew. It’s safe to say they’re a welcome new entry to this vast universe, and if <em>Outlaws</em> proves anything, it's that their story is only just beginning.</p>

It’s wild that it took this long to finally get a true open-world <em>Star Wars </em>game<em>. </em>And while it has some frustrating flaws, the experience <em>Outlaws</em> offers is worth it.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-rpg-ghost-of-tsushima-1851610802&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-rpg-ghost-of-tsushima-1851610802"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a></span><em> </em>you play as thief Kay Vess, a young woman who has been on her own for many years now. The only person she trusts isn’t a person. Instead, it’s Nix, a small and very cute alien creature that acts as her pet, best friend, criminal partner, and little brother.<br></p><p>The game starts with the two of them getting into big trouble with a powerful and deadly criminal syndicate, Zerek Besh. They need a big score to earn their freedom and escape their fate. And that opportunity arrives in the form of Jaylan, a smooth-talking criminal who is planning a heist against the leader of Zerek Besh. He offers Kay a large cut of the credits and asks her to help him with putting together a crew to complete the big job. Kay’s not big on working with others, but she accepts the deal. To help her (and kill her if she betrays the plan) Jaylan partners her up with ND-5, aka <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-commando-droid-nd5-1850534004&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-commando-droid-nd5-1850534004">the sexy robot people fell in love with last year</a></span>. ND-5 is a cold BX commando droid. But as the game progresses, Kay and ND-5 start to respect and even like each other as she learns that it’s okay to trust people. Well, <em>some </em>people.</p><p>Without spoiling anything, I can say that ND-5’s role in the game surprised me. I wasn’t sure how much screen time he would get or how important he would be in <em>Outlaws</em>. I assumed he’d be around, maybe give some quests and help you a bit. In reality, a large chunk of this game’s narrative is dedicated to Kay’s friendship with ND-5, who doesn’t have free will due to a restraining bolt placed on him by Jaylan. Ubisoft and Massive devoting so much time to ND-5’s arc was a risk, but it paid off as it’s one of the best parts of <em>Outlaws</em>.<br></p><h2 id="h16317"><a id=""></a><strong>The amazing open world of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></strong></h2><p>After you get past the opening hour, <em>Outlaws </em>opens up, letting you freely visit its planets and the space between them. Now, <em>Outlaws </em>isn’t <em>No Man’s Sky</em> or <em>Starfield</em>. There aren’t hundreds of planets or cities to visit. Instead, <em>Outlaws </em>focuses on quality over quantity. As such, there are only four worlds you can land on and explore: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-planets-list-size-how-big-4-5-minutes-1851583277&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-planets-list-size-how-big-4-5-minutes-1851583277">Tatooine, Akiva, Kijimi, and Toshara</a></span>. And each planet contains a single large map to poke around. That might sound disappointing, but Ubisoft has packed these places with so much detail and so many opportunities that you can easily spend a dozen hours just walking around each one. And you should!<br></p><p>I was able to complete the main story of <em>Outlaws </em>in about 20 hours and it’s probably possible to mainline it and finish it even faster. But I wouldn’t recommend doing that. The best moments I had in <em>Outlaws</em>, and what I’m excited to do more of when I’m done writing this review, happened when I was just walking around Tatooine or Akiva and organically stumbled upon an activity or opportunity.<br></p><p>I can’t overstate how amazing it is to just walk around these digital recreations of famous <em>Star Wars</em> locations. Ubisoft and Massive have nailed every detail. Aliens look like they do in the movies. Every noise is perfect. Walking through Mos Eisley and seeing hundreds of aliens milling around made me feel like I had just been transported into a scene from the movies. As a big fan of the franchise, visiting these planets was one of the coolest things I’ve experienced in a video game.</p><figure id="" data-id="de6f2482f33ad3080f67998c7cd4ef83" data-recommend-id="image://de6f2482f33ad3080f67998c7cd4ef83" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Kay riding a hoverbike through Tatooine.

I traveled to the area and found it, but got ambushed by some bandits. I fled on my hoverbike, escaped, and then found myself near an Imperial camp. Sneaking in and looking around, I was able to grab some credits and resources but also found a datapad with information on an Imperial officer. I sold that info to the Hutts for a pretty penny and then realized it was like 2 am and I needed to go to sleep.</p><p><em>Outlaws </em>feels less like the checklist simulator that so many open-world games have become, and more like a living world that reacts to you and which is also filled with secrets and things to do. You just have to take a moment to slow down and look around. But don’t get too distracted by the gorgeously rendered and wonderfully accurate planets of <em>Outlaws</em>, as this is still <em>Star Wars,</em> where crime, action, and danger are always around.<br></p><h2 id="h16318"><a id=""></a><strong>Balancing the criminal underworld</strong></h2><p>Kay’s goal of building a heist crew to take on a big criminal gang inevitably leads to her interacting with other criminal syndicates and outlaws. In the game, you’ll interact with four main syndicates: The Pykes, Crimson Dawn, The Hutts led by Jabba, and the Ashiga Clan.<br></p><p>Each gang will offer you jobs and missions. Succeed and you’ll build a reputation with each syndicate. If a gang likes you a lot, you can freely explore their turf, receive discounts when buying items from their vendors, and even get some fun gifts and exclusive contracts to complete, too. However, if you fail a contract, betray a gang, or upset them in some other way (like attacking their members or stealing), you’ll lose rep. And if you lose too much, you can eventually become hated by that gang, leading them to shoot you on sight and barring you from exploring some areas of the game without sneaking around to avoid conflict.<br></p><p>Balancing the four gangs is a key part of <em>Outlaws. </em>It can change how you complete missions, even main story quests. For example, a campaign mission might ask you to go to a specific location to meet someone to scout out a camp and then attack. But the starting spot might be located in Hutt turf and if they currently hate you, it will be much harder to start the mission. On the flip side, if they like you, then you’ll just be able to walk in and not worry about it.<br></p><p>It’s also fun to play gangs against each other, to earn more credits and resources, which lets you upgrade your spaceship as well as your speeder bike. </p><p>Perhaps you start a mission helping the Pykes protect a convoy of goods. But then Crimson Dawn calls and says, “Hey, why don’t you actually destroy that convoy, bring us the goods, and we’ll pay you twice as much!” At that point, you’ll have to make a call. Maybe the Pykes already think you are the best, so you can afford to lose some rep with them to make more money. Or maybe they hate your guts and betraying them will make your life harder. But perhaps double the credits is worth it? This balancing act can lead to some truly tough choices and makes even small side quests and contracts feel important and meaningful. Regardless of which gang you help or betray, most of the missions and jobs in <em>Outlaws </em>involve stealth and combat. And it’s here that I think some players might run into trouble.<br></p><h2 id="h16319"><a id=""></a><strong>Sneaking and blasting your way through the galaxy</strong></h2><p>Stealth is a big part of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and in the game’s second half, you spend a lot of time infiltrating bases filled with guards and alarms. Sometimes you can’t trigger an alarm or you’ll fail the mission, so you have to be really careful. </p><p>Sadly, sneaking around places feels extremely inconsistent in <em>Outlaws</em>. Sometimes I’d get spotted from halfway across the map by one random trooper. Other times I’d be next to three different enemies and none of them would see me. You can hide in bushes, but that doesn’t always work. And enemies sometimes could hear me, but then later were oblivious to my heavy footsteps.<br></p><p>Thankfully, you can usually go loud and fight your way out of most situations, which I found more fun and wound up doing often. But when the game demands stealth, it felt like I needed luck on my side to succeed. Eventually, I did get better at sneaking around. It also helped that I unlocked some useful upgrades via the game’s expert system, which has you completing challenges from different people to unlock new skills and perks. </p><p>But still, I never found myself excited to sneak around in <em>Outlaws</em>. On the other hand, I almost always had a good time blasting my way out of a situation.</p><p>Combat in <em>Outlaws </em>feels hectic and messy, which feels perfectly suited for the <em>Star Wars </em>universe. You only have one main blaster in the game and can’t permanently pick up and store other weapons. Your main blaster has four options. A plasma bolt setting that can kill most things, an electrical mode that fries droids and shields, and a heavy option that can blow up rocks and take out groups of enemies. (And there’s a quick stun option always available as a secondary fire, but it uses a cooldown.) As I upgraded and modified my single blaster and its options, I didn’t mind that I only had one gun because it felt like I had four and they all served their purpose during combat and helped out with puzzle-solving outside firefights.<br></p><p>Still, there are times when you might want a bigger blaster to take out a large group of Deathtroopers or droids, and <em>Outlaws </em>lets you pick up enemy weapons to temporarily gain an edge in fights. You can even order Nix to grab you a stormtrooper blaster and bring it to you while you take cover.

Instead of showing up to fights with five amazing guns like you might in <em>Far Cry</em>, you arrive with one blaster and your trusty pet Nix, and have to improvise the rest. Moving around, shooting, and taking cover in <em>Outlaws </em>is smooth and responsive enough that improvising in firefights is fun and satisfying, letting me live out my Han Solo fantasies. Telling Nix to attack someone, then sliding over cover, punching them in the face, grabbing their blaster, shooting a few other people, and then tossing a grenade at some other enemies before rolling out of the way never got boring.<br></p><p>Do enough of this cool stuff and you can slow down time, mark enemies, and take them out <em>Red Dead Redemption </em>style. It’s a neat trick, though it does feel a bit out of character with Kay Vess, who is never presented as an expert gunslinger. But whatever, it’s so cool that I’ll look the other way.<br></p><p>On the opposite side of cool is space exploration. Heading out into space and flying through shipwrecks and nebulas should be awesome. But space is unfortunately the weakest part of <em>Outlaws</em>. Exploring space is dull, unrewarding, and tedious due to how heavy and stiff your ship feels when maneuvering it. Space in <em>Outlaws </em>also never offers the same organic flow of discovery that on-foot planet exploration provides.<br></p><p>The problem is that, in addition to your ship not being great to control, the space around each planet feels small, isolated, and empty. And, yes, I know that in real life space is mostly empty, but that doesn’t translate to much fun in a video game. Off planet, combat isn’t much better, as it is way too easy to survive big fights against TIE fighters or pirates, and with a few upgrades, I turned into an unbeatable space tank. At least space exploration in <em>Outlaws </em>is a fairly small part of the game and hey, you never have to sneak around in a spaceship. So that’s nice, I guess.<br></p><h2 id="h16320"><a id=""></a>The best way to visit the <em>Star Wars </em>universe</h2><p>Yet, despite some annoying stealth sections, a few problematic bugs, and space exploration being mostly disappointing, I still adore Ubisoft’s open-world<em> Star Wars</em> adventure.<br></p><p>The first time I landed on Tatooine in<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-how-big-time-to-beat-30-hours-1851536051&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-how-big-time-to-beat-30-hours-1851536051"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a></span>, I’ll admit I had a big, dumb grin on my face. And that smile didn’t go away as I jumped on my hoverbike and sped around the photorealistic recreation of the famous desert planet seen in so many <em>Star Wars</em> movies. Plenty of <em>Star Wars </em>games have included this iconic (and admittedly overused) world before. But none let me truly, really explore it and poke at every perfectly rendered dune, rock, cave, building, and crevice for hours and hours.<br></p><p>On Tatooine, I found a random moisture farmer who needed help with his droid. I visited Tosche Station. I met some Jawas. I leaned up against the famous Cantina bar and overheard a dozen alien conversions around me as the band played in the background. Playing <em>Outlaws </em>is the closest I’ve ever felt to actually visiting the <em>Star Wars</em> universe.<br></p><p>And that’s the thing that I love most about the game. Yes, the story of putting together a crew to pull off a heist is great. And yeah, working with and against criminal gangs led by people like Jabba is fun. And I love ND-5 and Nix, too! But what I appreciate the most about <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>is that finally, after all these years of watching the movies, I can step into the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-best-games-ranked-jedi-knight-dark-forces-lis-1848893189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-best-games-ranked-jedi-knight-dark-forces-lis-1848893189"><em>Star Wars</em> universe</a></span> and just exist in it. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A reputable Xbox Game Pass leaker has claimed that Ubisoft’s Riders Republic will be coming to Xbox Game Pass in September.</p>



<p>The news comes courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1827874341008376092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@eXtas1stv</a> on X (formerly Twitter), who said that Riders Republic is coming to the subscription service in September. In the tweet, eXtas1s theorists that the date could be September 11, but that date could change. The insider has had a series of Xbox Game Pass leaks come to fruition over the last year or so, so it’s likely that Riders Republic will be coming to Game Pass soon, too.</p>



<p>Developed by Ubisoft Annecy, Ubisoft first released Riders Republic on October 28, 2021, for&nbsp;PlayStation 4,&nbsp;PlayStation 5,&nbsp;Stadia (no longer in service),&nbsp;Windows,&nbsp;Xbox One, and&nbsp;Xbox Series X/S. The game received generally favorable reviews on Metacritic.</p>



<p>In mid-2023, it was announced that the game would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riders-republic-skating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">receive a skateboarding add-on</a>, which was released on September 26th, 2023.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Riders Republic on Xbox Game Pass when it releases? Let us know down in the comments below.</p>

			<p>Black Myth Wukong, the popular action RPG developed by Game Science, is still indefinitely delayed on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S due to a memory leak issue.</p>
<p>As reported by the reliable <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exstas1s</a>, the game by Game Science released last week on PC and PlayStation 5 is still delayed indefinitely on Microsoft's consoles due to a memory leak error, which causes crashes and apparently affects the consoles as well. As such, the game still hasn't passed certification. The studio, however, is working hard to solve the issue and obtain certification, but sadly, it is not yet known when the issues will be fixed. The game is reportedly ready, so once the issue is fixed, the release shouldn't be too far off.</p>
<p>It is a shame Xbox players still cannot enjoy Black Myth Wukong, as it is an extremely solid title that is more than worthy of anyone's time. You can learn more about what makes the game one of the strongest debuts we have seen in recent times in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. It will launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on a yet to be confirmed date.</p>

			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator has been making some incredible progress in the past few days, and it is now capable of running Bloodborne at high frame rates and higher resolutions than the base release.</p>
<p>As showcased in a couple of videos shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a>, the PlayStation 4 emulator can run what is one of the console's most popular exclusive games at 1800p resolution and at high framerates, such as 120 and 144 FPS. Emulation is clearly far from being accurate, as visuals are still not rendered properly in some instances, but considering how the emulator was only able to boot the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/">a few weeks ago</a>, this is incredible progress. The day Bloodborne will be fully playable on PC doesn't seem too far off in the future now.</p>

<p>ShadPS4 emulating Bloodborne properly is only the first step, as a known Souls series modder confirmed earlier this month that they are working on a remaster featuring upscaled textures, dynamic shadows, better reflections, and more. As such, PC players are still getting that coveted remaster that Sony doesn't seem interested in releasing in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/why-warframe-1999-might-be-the-games-most-important-update-in-13-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-warframe-1999-might-be-the-game%E2%80%99s-most-important-update-in-13-years.963489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/why-warframe-1999-might-be-the-games-most-important-update-in-13-years/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>“You get a motorcycle!” There’s a gleam in Rebecca Ford’s eye as she recounts one of the key new elements in Warframe 1999, and one which already has players clamouring for this update to arrive. As Creative Director for Warframe, and having worked on the game for the past 13 years, you might think that this would lessen the joy of a further step on the game’s impressive roadmap, but there’s no sign of that here.</p>
<p>Perhaps it helps that the marketing for Warframe 1999 has been utterly on point for the reveal trailer, with the Nine Inch Nails-backed announcement sending collective shivers down Warframe’s immense fanbase’s spines. She tells us, “This is the wild and weird content update; our biggest in many, many, many years”. Wild and weird sounds right, and when you see that motorbike riding across the alien landscapes we’re used to seeing from Warframe, there’s a dissonance that’s both completely off-kilter, and also completely Warframe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warframe: 1999 Official Trailer | TennoCon 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ugGHOKOA9p0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It definitely doesn’t end there. “It has boy bands, motorcycles, music – the boy band are also monsters.” Rebecca adds as an aside, her smile widening further. “Warframe is like this faceless hero game, but back in 1999 there’s these humans that have come across a pretty tragic fate where they’re turning into Warframes. So you, as a character in the future, have to go back and help them and figure out what’s going on.”</p>
<p>It sounds immediately exciting, not least because of the new-old setting. When asked what came first, the narrative or the 90s, Rebecca laughs, “The 90s! We had the style, and then we had the immediate plan right away. It was like a perfect storm, 22 atoms hitting each other with great force, then this was born!”</p>

<p>Style is obviously important to Warframe, particularly with their free to play business model being built on selling additional skins to their most committed players. Warframe 1999 changes things up by being the first time we can see character’s faces, and it’s a huge thing that may or may not sit completely at ease with the current player base, though the team have an answer for that, “These are skins that transform, so if you prefer playing as a voiceless, faceless character, you can stay that way, or you can transform and become one of the human frames, and that will give you the ability to banter with each other”</p>

<p>It’s clear that 1999 is allowing the team to really flex their creative muscles, with Rebecca continuing, “It’s been a lot of fun, because we’ve never done it before. It’s just a little bit more, it’s for different people, right? Who knows if people will love it – maybe, maybe not – but we’re working with really cool actors like Ben Starr from Final Fantasy, Alpha Takashi from Cyberpunk and Amelia Tyler from Baldur’s Gate 3.”</p>
<p>Warframe 1999 is pretty deeply set within Warframe’s narrative, but Digital Extremes are working on an all-new onboarding experience for incoming players in an effort to better deal with all the new players that this update is liable to bring. “We’re updating the beginning with this new player experience – we’re happy to announce that it’s called Koumei and the Five Fates.” Rebecca continues, “This is a Japanese-inspired update that’s going to fit early in the game, and it’s going to have some truly inspirational visuals.” Fans won’t have to wait too long to see this in action, as the team will be revealing more at this year’s Tokyo Game Show in September.</p>
<p>The team aren’t unaware that this is a big change for Warframe, but they’re hoping it hits home with fans, with Rebecca telling us, “It was very risky, because the biggest risk is this – players who’ve spent 12 years, or even only a short time with their favourite characters, don’t want them to have faces, or talk. But, they’re optional characters, and though that was the risk, the reaction to them has been great.”</p>

<p>They’re doubling down on the risk though, “I think the most surprising thing is we’re actually making them dateable. So, there’s this romance system. Back in the 90s, you had your AOL, your instant messengers, and in our game we’re doing a fully functional chat room that you can build romances with these character and have romantic optional content.” Once again, this doesn’t sound like Warframe, and yet, it does.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Digital Extremes are having a lot of fun with the 1999 update, and that even 13 years into Warframe’s journey, there’s still new and exciting ways to reinvigorate the formula. Whether you’re a committed player, a lapsed fan, or a newcomer, Warframe 1999 looks like an essential experience, and one which we can’t wait for. Heck, we’re so excited we’re going to tell all our AOL friends about it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview.963483/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Few games truly deserve the remake treatment as much as Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Arguably the best stealth-action game of its generation, back in 2004 it pushed the PlayStation 2 to its very limits – so much so that the hardware occasionally weighed down its ambitions. Twenty years later, a complete remake from Konami using the power of modern consoles has the potential to unlock the full, uncompromised vision of the game’s original creators. Instead, this new, Kojima-less Metal Gear Solid Delta seems more like a very shiny HD remaster than the elegant remake it could have been. It’s an admittedly beautiful nostalgia trip, but almost faithful to a fault.</p><p>In a recent hands-on demonstration I was able to play through Metal Gear Solid Delta’s Virtuous Mission; a complete recreation of MGS3’s prologue built in Unreal Engine 5. It looks every bit as fantastic as you’d hope, particularly when it comes to character models – faces and clothing are a real highlight. The jungle is the true star of the show, though, with modern lighting techniques helping showcase the graphical overhaul to every blade of grass, every pool of mud, and every writhing python. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>If you’re a Metal Gear veteran, you’ll know that the roughly 90-minute duration of the Virtuous Mission is dominated by cutscenes and codec calls. It’s not the ideal section to test drive any changes Konami has made (visuals aside) particularly since Delta uses the same dialogue audio as the original Snake Eater and thus all cinematics are frame-for-frame and line-for-line identical. But, if this slice is anything to go by, any gameplay changes are minimal. Delta appears to be a painstaking recreation of Metal Gear Solid 3 down to the millimetre. Trees stand exactly where they originally stood. The same enemies patrol the same routes. And frustratingly frequent load screens once again divide the jungle into small, self-contained maps. </p><p>This structure, perfectly preserved from the 2004 original, makes Metal Gear Solid Delta feel so much older than its new high-definition visuals. The jungle is small and claustrophobic, not because of its imposing canopy but because of its limited playspaces. The loading screens act as hard barriers, meaning what happens in one zone doesn’t impact another – alerted guards can’t chase you into a different map, for instance. This lack of continuity between each segment limits your creativity; there’s seemingly no way to cause distractions that fool enemies into investigating beyond a loading screen boundary, or line up a perfect shot across the stitching between zones. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Frustratingly frequent load screens once again divide the jungle into small, self-contained maps. </p></div><p>All of this, of course, was not just forgivable back in 2004 but expected. The PS2 simply couldn’t render an entire seamless playspace this detailed. But in 2024 the freedom of Metal Gear Solid 5’s sprawling maps, which would be perfectly at home retrofitted into Snake Eater’s Soviet wilderness, is sorely missing here. I’m reminded of Capcom’s Resident Evil 2 remake, which eliminated the original game’s iconic door-opening loading screens in favour of a more immersive, completely seamless police station. Without a similar approach, I worry that the overall play experience of MGS Delta won’t be significantly different enough from the Snake Eater HD remaster available as part of last year’s Master Collection Vol. 1 – a game with a much lower price point <em>and </em>packaged with two other truly excellent games. </p><p>After playing the demo I had the chance to talk with producer Noriaki Okamura and I asked why the team didn’t opt to bring MGS3’s map design up to date. “We did debate about this internally,” he told me. “Maybe we should reskin the game into the current open-world type map? But after thinking about this, we would definitely have to basically remake the game from scratch, and by doing so it could alter other things about the game, and we decided that’s not the direction we really wanted to take.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While the playspace of the Virtuous Mission is exactly what you remember, Konami has made some smart changes that incontestably make Delta more comfortable to play than its parent. The most important is a modernised control scheme that works in tandem with over-the-shoulder aiming, a feature pulled from the 3DS version of MGS3. This setup is practically revolutionary. The original Snake Eater used inputs that had their roots in the comparatively basic MGS1, but the increasingly complex and ambitious boss battles demanded a level of fine control that the scheme simply couldn’t keep up with. Thankfully the old, fiddly aim mechanics are now gone, replaced with contemporary trigger-based gun control that allows for easy, precise headshots. There’s nothing in the Virtuous Mission that really challenged my marksmanship, but I’m really looking forward to battling The Fury; a boss whose speed and attack patterns were an uncomfortable fit for the original game’s clunky controls.</p><p>Other welcome enhancements are a quick-dial system for your codec, allowing you to access vital functions like saving the game by tapping down on the d-pad, while the up button opens a quick-select for your camouflage. The two remaining d-pad buttons cycle through your equipment, which is a minor but solid improvement over the original scheme. </p><p>More essential is the fact that Snake can now crouch walk (another feature first included in the 3DS version), which practically feels like a necessity in a stealth game. Combined with the refreshed aiming system and modern 3D camera, Snake Eater now plays much more intuitively. However, I will caveat that by saying it does still feel like a game from a prior generation; Snake unfortunately does not move with the fluidity of his MGS5 counterpart. Again, it feels like Konami has missed a clear opportunity to bring modern enhancements to MGS Delta.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are smart changes that incontestably make Delta more comfortable to play than its parent.</p></div><p>Provided the entire game follows suit with this demo, I think your feelings on Delta are going to depend on just how faithful you want this remake to be. If you’re a purist, then you’re in luck: the new MGS team at Konami clearly sees the original Snake Eater as something of a religious text. But it means Delta’s creative vision is held prisoner by the early 2000s. Even the cutscenes feature the same fade-to-black loading between scenes as the original – something surely cinephile Kojima would have exorcised if only he’d had access to SSDs back in the day. </p><p>Beyond the updated graphics and controls, there’s nothing surprising, refreshing, or dare I say exciting about MGS Delta, at least in this demo. The only significant change we did find was that shooting Ocelot did not trigger the time paradox game over screen. It’s not clear if this omission is simply because the demo is not pulled from the final version of the game, but such a famous Kojima-ism being missing from the first press showing of Delta did raise a concerned eyebrow. Hopefully it makes it into the full release. </p><p>Okamura told me that he “wanted to avoid a situation where this series will be forgotten in time,” and that the goal of Delta was to “make sure we deliver the game as faithfully as possible so it doesn’t take away from the nostalgic aspect.” That’s a noble goal, but I can’t help but feel that was the job of the Master Collection. I had hoped Delta would have seen the team upgrade and enhance Snake Eater with ideas from The Phantom Pain and beyond, offering the same story and objectives but in a more modern, more flexible, and more reactive stealth hunting ground. That could have made it the remake to topple Resident Evil 2 from its perch. Instead, Metal Gear Solid Delta is shaping up to be little more than a prettier, more intuitive version of 2004’s most essential stealth game.</p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-hour-long-new-4k-gameplay-footage-showing-off-three-different-archetypes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> to February 18, 2025, Obsidian Entertainment continues to show off more of its upcoming game, Avowed. We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-possible-endings-now-reach-into-double-digits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> that the number of endings is double-digit, and the studio also <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-developers-confirm-30-fps-was-the-target/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the frame rate target of 30 frames per second on Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>Now, YouTuber Enfant Terrible has posted over an hour of new gameplay footage (available in gorgeous 4K resolution) that shows off three different archetypes players will find in Avowed: Blood Mage, Barbarian, and Ranger. The action RPG set in Eora, the world of Pillars of Eternity, has a classless system. As such, players will be free to customize their main character however they like, but specific playstyle can still be achieved.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, Obsidian was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBL4jTHs5w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by the Iron Lords Podcast. Here, Art Director Matt Hansen and Production Director Ryan Warden explained one of the less talked about systems featured in Avowed: the radial wheel, which allows players to stop time and think strategically about what they're doing next, and how companions factor in.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ryan</strong> <strong>Warden:</strong> We also have those abilities that are available to bind to the d-pad, so if you want to quickfire one of those abilities, no problem, and if you want to have a little bit more momentum in your combat experience, no problem, just quick bind that too to the d-pad. If you want Kai to come in with Fire and Ire, which is one of his abilities where he kind of draws aggro on enemies to act a little bit more as a tank, no problem, you can do that. Just quickfire that from the d-pad. Each companion has four active abilities. You're going to have to make some choices because there's only so many buttons, but you get to remap them to your heart's content.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Matt</strong> <strong>Hansen:</strong> To add on to that a little bit, each of those abilities also has a series of upgrades that you can get that can very fundamentally change how that ability works. There's lots of different ways you can build your companions and combine them, too. Kai and Marius have different ways of synergizing than Giatta and Yatzli. So much of the game is about this idea that you're stronger together with your companions.</em></p>

<p>As mentioned above, the release date of Avowed is now set for mid-February on PC and Xbox Series S|X. However, with Microsoft already <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirming</a> the PlayStation 5 launch window of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, it's looking increasingly likely that the game may be released there at some point in the future.</p>
<p>PCs will likely offer the best experience anyway. Obsidian has&nbsp;partnered with NVIDIA to support NVIDIA DLSS 3 and ray tracing, although we don't know yet which effects will be enhanced by&nbsp;ray tracing.</p>

<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation has confirmed that the monumental competitive event will return in 2025. This was almost considered inevitable following this first iteration’s stellar success, which laid the groundwork for an annual series. We caught up with the Esports World Cup Foundation’s CEO, Ralf Reichert, and he suggested that this would be a yearly affair.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-things-in-store">Big Things In Store</h2>



<p>Saudi Arabia has plans to welcome the esports and gaming industry with open arms as it develops a ‘city’ to accommodate these super-sized tournaments. There’s a vast desire to bring publishers and developers into Riyadh, as well as stand up or host esports organisations that want to call the region home.</p>



<p>This is all part of a mission to make Saudi Arabia a leading player in these industries by 2030.</p>



<p>Here’s what CEO Ralf Reichert had to say <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-ralf-reichert-esports-world-cup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when we interviewed him last month</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the planning process, we debated all sorts of formats for the Esports World Cup. But while we took inspiration from top international sporting events, we felt that the EWC was best as an annual event, as the world of video games and the digital age overall work on an accelerated timeline compared to others.</p>



<p>We want to build the best platform to crown the best esports Clubs each calendar year, creating a prestigious moment for players and fans to aspire to attend. No format is set in stone, but we’re happy with the way the EWC is currently unfolding.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From July to August 2025, the Esports World Cup will unravel once more, and fans are eager to learn how it’ll go bigger and better than the inaugural event. This year’s EWC saw a $60 million prize pool up for grabs, as well as an ostentatious trophy system and some of the grandest stages and ceremonies in esports.</p>



<p>It’ll be hard to top that next year, but the Esports World Cup Foundation is eager to try.</p>



<p>Now that the sun has set on this year’s event, we can look back and remember the fond memories. What was your favourite game at this year’s EWC?</p>

<section><p>Hands-On with Konami’s reverent remake of Big Boss’s debut</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In 2016, Konami released a pachinko machine based on Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater that featured remakes of the game's iconic cutscenes. For series fans that had been hoping for full remakes of the classics--especially in a post-Kojima Konami--this amounted to a gut punch. It was the slightest hint of what a modern take on Snake Eater could look like, but to see it you'd have to be seated in a pachinko parlor instead of getting the lengthy, cinematic Metal Gear Solid experience we had come to expect.</p><p dir="ltr">Eight years later, the dream of a proper remake is being realized with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. Announced via a 2023 Playstation Showcase, questions immediately arose about what we could expect from this update. Hideo Kojima has long been absent from anything Metal Gear, and his signature style of storytelling and game direction is perhaps the series' defining feature. This first glimpse lacked the humor, flavor, and "Kojima factor" that fans expected from MGS trailers. Was Delta destined to be a soulless corporate remake of the 2004 classic?</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake Stays True To The Original</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">After playing the entire Virtuous Mission (essentially the game's prologue) at a recent Konami event in London, I'm happy to report that all signs point to Delta being the Snake Eater remake that fans have wanted for years. Unlike the polarizing Twin Snakes remake of the original Metal Gear Solid--which featured fully re-recorded VO and an egregious amount of "artistic license"--Delta seems far more interested in preserving and updating your memories of Snake Eater rather than presenting its own dramatically altered version of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite Hideo Kojima's messy divorce from Konami, Delta doesn't shy away from his name and direction. His credit appears numerous times before Naked Snake completes the world's first HALO jump. Yoji Shinkawa's character art shows up in character vignettes and establishing cutscenes. It's clear from the opening minutes that there is a reverence for the original work that hasn't been evident in other post-Kojima projects like the baffling Metal Gear Survive and the bare-bones Master Collection. Every cutscene feels indiscernible from the original game's, barring the dramatically improved visuals and occasional stock footage that has been replaced for copyright reasons. Even little details like holding R1 to look through Snake's eyes are perfectly replicated down to the timing of the button prompts.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you gain control of Snake (which takes a while--this is a Metal Gear game, after all), numerous welcome gameplay updates become apparent. The older MGS games always had inventory and weapon selection relegated to the trigger buttons, but by utilizing left and right on the D-pad, Delta's modernized controls share more in common with Metal Gear Solid V. A handy update allows you to swap your camo on the fly by holding up on the D-pad to quickly access the camo menu. Holding down, meanwhile, gives you quick access to your codec contacts. Your health, stamina, and camo index are now displayed in the lower middle of the screen rather than the upper corners.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the touted gameplay features of the original game was its CQC (close quarters combat) system. It allowed for a lot more than just snapping the necks of guards: You could interrogate them, slit their throats, toss them to the ground, or use them as a human shield. While it allowed for more variety, it was easy to perform unintended actions thanks to its specific required inputs and utilization of the PS2's pressure-sensitive face buttons. You'll no longer need to whip out a manual, do a Google search, or call The Boss to remind you of "the basics of CQC" thanks to Delta's useful tooltip system. Just grab a hold of an enemy with the right trigger and all of your options will be handily laid out onscreen for you.</p><p dir="ltr">This system will also remind you of Snake's potential actions in various combat scenarios. As I dangled off a bridge to avoid detection, I forgot that Snake could aim and shoot with one hand. Thanks to the tooltip, I pulled out my tranquilizer pistol and neutralized the approaching guard before he had a chance to discover me. While Snake always had these abilities, the quality-of-life updates in Delta reminded me of them and I wound up using them more as a result.</p><p dir="ltr">With modern action games eschewing frequent load times, it's natural to wonder if Delta's gameplay zones would remain cordoned off into their own sections or if they'd be stitched together into a larger contiguous world. As is the case with most aspects of this remake, the developers have chosen to remain true to the flow of the original. You won't encounter any real load times when moving between areas, but the screen still fades to black and comes back in displaying the name of the new area just like in the original. This adherence to the experience of the original applies to most aspects of the gameplay. It's not like this is suddenly Breath of the Wild and Snake can climb every tree and scale rock faces. He's still limited to climbing the same ivy-covered trees that were there in 2004re.</p><p dir="ltr">Personality hasn't been sacrificed in the pursuit of realism. Giant anacondas will still become neatly packaged in to-go boxes upon their death. Guards flail and sprint away like cartoon characters when you shoot down a beehive in their vicinity. You'll still be alerted that you've created a time paradox when you die. Naked Snake still dons a Raiden mask if you select "I like MGS2!" at the outset of your mission. I wasn't greeted with an Old Snake mask when I selected "I like MGS4!" however, so it remains to be seen what the other game selections do.</p><p dir="ltr">One of my few complaints about the original game was the cumbersome Survival Viewer and curing system. When Snake took damage, you'd frequently have to go into a menu to perform a series of actions to repair his various wounds. There's a world where this could have been cool. After all, Rambo was pretty badass when he cauterized his wound by packing it with gunpowder and lighting it. In this case, selecting numerous styptics and suture kits from a menu wasn't exactly an immersive experience. It remains to be seen if this system will be as intrusive in Delta, as it isn't introduced until just after the Virtuous Mission in the original game. That said, I did see a grayed-out "Cure" option in the Survival Viewer menu, so it's likely back in some form.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of truly new content, I did discover a bit during my 90 minutes with the game. Snake's initial bag of gear grants you a compass that presents cardinal directions as well as an objective indicator in the lower left corner of the screen. Rolling is given its own dedicated button (Triangle), and you can now dive to the ground from a standing position. On top of the returning Kerotan frogs, I encountered one camouflaged GA-KO duck. It was draped in what appeared to be a ghillie suit, which went up in flames when I shot it and caused the duck to start hopping and quacking. It's unclear at this point what this accomplishes or if they're just a bonus collectible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356825-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356825" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356825-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356825"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356825-3.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356833-knm_mgs_delta_collectable_ga-ko.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356834-knm_mgs_delta_cutscene_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356835-knm_mgs_delta_cutscene_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356836-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356837-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356838-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356839-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356840-knm_mgs_delta_radio.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356841-knm_mgs_delta_ui_shortcutmenu_camouflage.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356842-knm_mgs_delta_ui_shortcutmenu_radio.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356833,1300-4356834,1300-4356835,1300-4356836,1300-4356837,1300-4356838,1300-4356839,1300-4356840,1300-4356841,1300-4356842" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356833-knm_mgs_delta_collectable_ga-ko.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356834-knm_mgs_delta_cutscene_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356835-knm_mgs_delta_cutscene_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356836-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356837-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356838-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356839-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356840-knm_mgs_delta_radio.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356841-knm_mgs_delta_ui_shortcutmenu_camouflage.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356842-knm_mgs_delta_ui_shortcutmenu_radio.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356833-knm_mgs_delta_collectable_ga-ko.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356834-knm_mgs_delta_cutscene_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356835-knm_mgs_delta_cutscene_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356836-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356837-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356838-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356839-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356840-knm_mgs_delta_radio.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356841-knm_mgs_delta_ui_shortcutmenu_camouflage.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356842-knm_mgs_delta_ui_shortcutmenu_radio.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Of course, the most obvious upgrade is the visual presentation. Delta does not disappoint in this area. The lush jungle features far more detail than before, with additional ambient wildlife and tons of little details like Snake trudging through the mud and leaving a distinct trail. As Snake takes damage over time, it will be permanently reflected on his body and clothing during gameplay and cutscenes. All of the characters look fantastic and true to the original designs too. Volgin's scars are deep and detailed, The End's eye pop is unsettling, and The Sorrow's blood rain is much more pronounced. My demo was locked to a 30fps fidelity mode, but the final release promises a 60fps performance option.</p><p dir="ltr">On the remake spectrum, Delta's ambitions fall somewhere between the enhanced visuals and quality-of-life upgrades of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD and the substantial Resident Evil reimaginings in recent years. It certainly isn't attempting to change things up as much as the newer Final Fantasy VII titles. This is a relatively straightforward, modernized remake of the original, which is in no way a complaint. Snake Eater has such a distinct personality that to make too many tweaks would risk losing much of what made it special. Delta's dev team is walking a tightrope with such a beloved title, and everything I saw during my return to the Virtuous Mission has me confident that they're handling this with a deft hand.</p>

			<p>Monster Trucks are absolute beasts. Take El Toro as an example – who is a literal beast, being custom clad in a raging bull motif – who weighs in at a bonkers 12,000 pounds, yet has enough bull-power to go from zero to thirty miles per hour in only 1.52 seconds. Then there’s Megalodon, who, despite have a non-aerodynamic, extremely enormous blue shark stuffed on its chassis, can reach top speeds of 70mph. Just the tyres of these things alone is awe-inspiring – an immense 66 inches tall and 44 inches wide – yet somehow significantly less-inflated than the tires of my humble Nissan Micra. Apparently, it’s all to do with truck bounce.</p>

<p>Considering all these admirable qualities, it’s a shame that the monster trucks of the brand-new official Monster Jam game offer an absolutely pathetic driving experience. They handle like lubed up bricks, have the consistency of paper mâché, ignore physics – not in a fun way – and go about as fast as me in my Micra up a hill on a windy day.</p>


<p>Perhaps I’m getting ahead of myself, Monster Jam: Showdown is the latest game featuring vehicles from the world-leading Monster Truck league. This outing has been developed by racing game specialists Milestone; so, it’s understandable that expectations are high. From a looks point-of-view, Monster Jam Showdown certainly delivers.</p>
<p>The 40 unlockable Monster Trucks you’ll find all look resplendent, rendered to an exhausting level of detail in Unreal Engine 5. All the crowd favourites are ultimately available to race; including, Grave Digger, MAX-D, and Zombie. Thing is, most of them are hidden behind a tedious check list of challenges that you must tick off. Unlike the Monster Jam Steel Titans series, there are no puzzles to solve to find new trucks. Instead, you’ll engage in thrilling activities, such as… do the same race several times. As such, unlocking new trucks to gawp at is quite the chore.</p>


<p>Amazingly, even more uninspiring is the actual racing. The AI trucks are likely the most boring opponents you could ask for. Despite looking exiting and dangerous, they drive like a learner on test day. Each truck ambles along on its prescribed racing line and never alters from its intended route. Heck, you can ram an AI truck, and it will shrug you off and dawdle along as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>Matters are made worse by the nonsensical physics. Hit an AI truck at full speed and it will no-sell your attack like the Undertaker in his WWE hey-day, whilst your vehicle will crumple like a paper aeroplane and launch itself into a series of impossible flips – forcing a likely race-losing respawn. The same is true of hitting any object in the environment; with the terrible collision detection regularly trapping your truck against the invisible wall surrounding rocks, trees and roadside debris – again forcing a respawn.</p>
<p>No matter how you tinker with the settings, the controls are abominable. Either your truck just drives itself, or it skids around aimlessly as soon as you even think about touching a thumb stick. The best way to win a race is simply to drive unbelievably slowly and cautiously, edging around a corner like you are driving in a blizzard. This, of course, robs the game of any of the obvious enjoyment that should come with zooming around in a humongous Monster Truck at the national speed limit. Stunt races, where you rack up points performing outrageous manoeuvres like backflips and barrel rolls, are marginally more enjoyable. Yet they still suffer from the nonsensical controls as well as point allocation that appears entirely random.</p>

<p>Online and split-screen multiplayer are rather more fun, simply because other players drive in a far more interesting manner than the dull as dish-water AI. But still the confounding controls and tediously slow gameplay ultimately rob the experience of any enjoyment it might have had.</p>

		A game about racing massive trucks that look like dinosaurs should not be boring, and yet Monster Jam: Showdown achieves the seemingly impossible; this game is an absolutely slog of an experience. Best avoided, even for Monster Truck loving aficionados.	</p></div>

			<p>Steam's concurrent player record has been broken again. The newest data shows that the platform managed to attract over 37 million users over the weekend, breaking the previous record of 36 million users <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-another-record-with-36-million-concurrent-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set </a>five months ago. It's no surprise that Steam has had such huge activity recently, given the hype in the gaming industry following Gamescom 2024 and the release of the highly anticipated Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p>New <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/">data from SteamDB</a> shows that the platform has now seen a peak concurrent player count of 37.2 million, breaking its previous record. Steam has seen massive growth over a matter of days in player count, and we all know the reason behind this is the release of the iconic Black Myth: Wukong, which has managed to break all industry records when it comes to single-player titles since the game is now second only to PUBG regarding concurrent users peak.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Just recently, we reported on how Black Myth: Wukong has <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sells-a-whopping-10-million-copies-in-just-three-days-surpassing-industry-records/">sold 10 million copies in just three days</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/">hit 2.3 million concurrent players on Steam</a>, that too in quite a short time span. For those unaware of why Black Myth: Wukong is such a huge success, the title's rich storytelling, stunning visuals, and unique take on the action RPG formula have attracted the attention of several gamers.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The title's close attachment to Chinese cultures and traditions is one of the main reasons why there have been a massive number of players from China, nearly accounting for 80% of the total user base. The title has also surpassed its expectations and received massive hype at launch, which is why it has been a huge success in the markets.</p>
<p>Since it was Black Myth: Wukong's first weekend, we expected records to be broken. Moving into the future, the title will surely be remembered as one of the most successful in the industry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/concord-update-matchmaking-rivalry-ps5-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a> have released a new <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> update for PlayStation 5 and PC (Steam and Epic). The new patch – showing as version 01.003.006 on PS5- is now available to download and includes a small number of fixes. Note that you will need to install this new Concord update in order to play the game and access online features.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Launch Trailer I PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQB_2FF2G1o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With the game having only officially launched a couple of days ago, this patch is aimed at fixing smaller issues flagged by the player community. The big one here is the option to requeue after a match is finished should now be visible to players, allowing them to hop back into matchmaking quicker.</p>
<p>Firewalk has also lowered the level requirement needed to access Concord’s “Rivalry” game mode playlist. This includes Cargo Run and Clash Point which can both be considered more advanced, competitive modes played across multiple rounds with no respawns. Keeping greenhorn Freegunners away from these modes makes sense though, as a result, it’s likely that queue times for Rivalry are suffering as a result.</p>
<p>Our Concord review will be dropping later this week though our initial feedback is positive. Gunplay and player movement are satisfyingly smooth with enough depth to the hero roster to keep matches feeling dynamic. With that said, sentiment surrounding the game has continued to be negative since it was properly showcase for the first time earlier this year by Sony. If you want to read more, we’ve written a short analysis on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/24/why-do-gamers-want-concord-to-fail/">why gamers want Concord to fail</a>.</p>

<h3>Concord Update 01.003.006 Patch Notes</h3>
<p><strong>Gameplay Changes &amp; Tuning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made changes to Rivalry modes – Reduced level for entry and added bonus XP rewards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In-game Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Issues seen with the Requeue option not being available should be resolved.</li>
<li>Inconsistency in Business Card Stats should be resolved.</li>
<li>General performance optimizations and minor fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Time Trial Leaderboards not showing appropriate data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Concord is available now on PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam and Epic). The game has a launch price tag of £34.99 and doesn’t feature F2P monetisation features such as loot boxes or battle passes.</p>

<p>The Esports World Cup 2024 has officially come to an end, and one of its biggest games, Rocket League, helped close out the Sunday ceremony with its Grand Finals. With some of the biggest names competing this last week for the first-place victory, the Rocket League competition was nothing short of astounding.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-team-bds-wins-grand-finals-at-the-esports-world-cup">Team BDS Wins Grand Finals At The Esports World Cup</h2>



<p>In a best-of-seven competition, Team BDS managed to walk away with first place during the Esports World Cup 2024. The popular team faced off against Team Falcons, winning 4-2. While Team BDS might have won quite easily in the Grand Finals, it was a tough road to make it there. </p>



<p>The team had barely made it out of the Quarter Finals, defeating Spacestation Gaming by only one game, where they then won against Gen.G Gaming during the Semi-Finals by two games.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Regardless, the team had a hard-fought victory against Team Falcons, certifying themselves as the Rocket League Esports World Cup 2024 champions. </p>



<p>The team took home a whopping $200,000 in prizing, proving to the world that they are the best when it comes to Rocket League.</p>

<h2 id="h-team-bds-wins-first-major-title-since-2022-rlcs-world-championship">Team BDS Wins First Major Title Since 2022 RLCS World Championship</h2>



<p>The popular Rocket League team has struggled over the past few years to take home any first-place titles, with them not making it out of the Semi-Finals during last year’s Gamers8 tournament. </p>



<p>The team, though, decided that enough was enough. With their last first-place title for a major tournament being back in 2022 during the RLCS World Championship, the Swiss esports team made it clear to the world that they are not to be trifled with.</p>



<p>Now, the question stands, will Team BDS be able to hold onto this momentum going into next year?</p>

<p>After a week of heavy competition, Soniqs has officially come in first at the PUBG: Battlegrounds Esports World Cup 2024. The American esports team walked out with the first-place trophy, only having a four-point lead ahead of Petrichor Road, the Chinese esports team.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-soniqs-dominates-pubg-battlegrounds-esports-world-cup">Soniqs Dominates PUBG: Battlegrounds Esports World Cup</h2>



<p>The 2024 Esports World Cup has officially come to an end, and the PUBG: Battlegrounds tournament portion did not lack any heat. With some of the best teams in PUBG history competing against one another, fans were able to experience one of the biggest Battle Royale tournaments of all time.</p>



<p>And it would seem like Soniqs was ready to cement their name in PUBG history. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The popular American esports team started out somewhat weak, placing 20th in their first game. In rounds 2-6, though, the team found themselves within the top 10 in each game. In fact, they even won Round 6. </p>



<p>This momentum was handled well, as Soniqs continued to dominate throughout the rest of the tournament. The team finished with 113 points, played over 12 games, and walked away with $700,000 in prize earnings.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-petrichor-road-struggles-to-grab-first-with-faze-clan-falling-behind-in-third">Petrichor Road Struggles To Grab First, With FaZe Clan Falling Behind In Third</h2>



<p>With some huge teams competing in the PUBG: Battlegrounds Esports World Cup 2024, many organizations struggled to keep up with the likes of Soniqs. A few teams, though, that did stay at the top of the leaderboard, were Petrichor Road and FaZe Clan.</p>



<p>Petrichor Road fell behind first by only four points and FaZe Clan dropped behind second by only five points. TSM even took home fourth place, scoring only six points lower than FaZe. However, KWANGDONG FREECS placed fifth in the tournament, 12 points behind TSM.</p>



<p>While the points margin drastically changed going down the leaderboards, the top teams were still able to keep in close quarters with each other, making the Grand Finals incredibly competitive.</p>

<p>What a wonderful day for esports. Popular Valorant team, Edward Gaming, has officially won the Valorant Champions 2024 tour, placing first during the championship against Team Heretics. Both teams have been battling it out through a bracket in South Korea since the beginning of August, with today marking the official Championship. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-edward-gaming-defeats-team-heretics-to-win-valorant-champions-2024">Edward Gaming Defeats Team Heretics To Win Valorant Champions 2024</h2>



<p>Not only did Edward Gaming win first place, but the team based out of Shanghai, China, also walked away with a whopping $1 million. The team closed out the month-long tournament series with a 3-2 win against Team Heretics, making their victory dangerously close to being a loss. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>But regardless of how close the matches were, Edward Gaming still managed to hold onto that momentum that had already gotten them so far within the series. Cementing themselves in esports history, Edward Gaming now has their first Valorant Champions victory, while still qualifying for the series during the 2022 and 2023 events.</p>



<p>The team is also the first Chinese esports organization to reach $1 million in earnings, putting them above all other teams in their nation.</p>



<h4 id="h-edward-gaming-s-current-valorant-roster">Edward Gaming’s Current Valorant Roster:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Shou “Aqua” Wenjun</li>



<li>Tang “Muggle” Shijun</li>

<li>Xu “Xiaoxu” Yilai</li>



<li>Li “JuiceFlip” Junsheng</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-team-heretics-falls-short-of-victory-in-valorant-champions-2024">Team Heretics Falls Short Of Victory In Valorant Champions 2024</h2>



<p>While Team Heretics may not have walked out in first place, the team still had quite a victorious season this year. The team also placed second back in June at the VCT 2024: Masters Shanghai event, winning $200,000.</p>



<p>Their second place during the final Valorant Champions 2024 event awarded them $400,000, which is still a massive amount of cash to walk away with.</p>



<p>With star players such as Benjyfishy and Wo0t on their roster, Team Heretics already has a solid chance at breaking out of that second-place curse next year. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-black-myth-wukong-dnc-content-creators<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why can’t people just play a game, say it’s fine, and move on anymore? Why does everything – whether it’s a finite single-player experience like <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> or a <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-controversy-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stab at live-service immortality</a> like <em>Helldivers 2</em> – <a href="https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devolve into a numbers-driven culture war battleground</a>? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about how fandom has skewed people’s understanding of why we engage with works in the first place.</p><p>Before we get to that, though, we’re joined by Wired’s Makena Kelly to discuss <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dnc-influencer-convention/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content creators at the Democratic National Convention</a> (a topic I’ll be covering in more depth next week). Was it a savvy move on Democrats’ part to give them press access? Did they do a better job of shining light on protesters and their causes than traditional press? And what was the deal with all the rumblings of conflict between creators and journalists?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, a Chinese action-RPG that’s taken Steam by storm, but not without its fair share of controversy. After much ado about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexist undercurrents</a> at the studio that made it and <a href="https://aftermath.site/black-myth-wukong-feminist-propaganda-politics-twitch-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streaming restrictions</a> that asked content creators not to talk about “feminist propaganda,” the game is, like so many others at the heart of endless culture wars… fine. Then we wrap up by figuring out popular video game characters’ political affiliations (Sonic is an anarchist, Mario is center-right, and Zelda has probably overseen at least a handful of drone bombings).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can grow large enough that somebody will one day wage a culture war over <em>our </em>concurrent player count.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The reason why people care so much about concurrent players – even though it makes no sense in the context of a single-player game – is because it’s one of the few metrics people can point to and say “Look, we’re winning the culture war. Here’s a number that says we’re winning. Number goes up or number goes down, and – you can do this in either direction, since numbers are never entirely steady – you can say “Ah, our side is winning.”</p><p>I’ve seen this a lot with smaller games that come from indie developers – that are focused on more diverse casts and things like that. There’s the new game from Red Thread, the company headed up by Ragnar Tornquist, who made <em>Longest Journey</em> back in the day. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/721180/Dustborn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dustborn</em></a>, is what it’s called. It has a diverse cast and tries to deal with a lot of serious issues. But it hasn’t performed that well on Steam, so people are saying “Nobody wants these games. They’re doing badly. They’re made by bad people. This validates our stance in the culture war.” Even though single-player games that are made by relatively small teams are not gonna attract millions of players or hundreds of thousands of players – and in fact can sell slowly over time and recoup their costs. It’s a different scale of production.&nbsp;</p><p>But it doesn’t matter to any of these people. They’re all using the same standard of judgment and saying that if you’re not hitting massive triple-A numbers or live service numbers, then you’re nothing, and that proves that you don’t matter, nobody cares, and actually every game should be the same game about the same white guy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Bleeding Cool or Comic Book Resource or whatever don’t need to be reporting on box office numbers while a movie is only three days old or rating single episodes of a TV series while it’s still running. It’s a series that’s got an overarching story to tell. We don’t need to be breaking everything down into numbers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I did actually calculate the gross for an internship once. That was my job. I worked at ThinkFilm for a minute in film school, and they were like “Here are all the ticket stubs. Here are all the takes from these things.” In retrospect, I don’t think I should have been doing that. I think that’s not something you want to trust your intern to do.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> Well that’s part of why [I said what I said earlier]. I’m definitely guilty of having done this in the past. We all would be to some degree. The need to constantly be posting and providing fresh stories and fresh SEO hits for a modern media website has you looking at those numbers and thinking they’re news.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> For multiplayer games, they’re also germane. With <a href="https://aftermath.site/savetf2-you-can-finally-play-team-fortress-2-again-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Team Fortress</em> thing</a>, I think it’s important to be like “How many people here are bots?”</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> Yeah, because a multiplayer game is reliant on the size of the player base to an extent.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Even then, though, that can be germane, but you’ve gotta contextualize it, and you’ve really gotta work to do that, because people will look at a game like <em>Helldivers 2</em> and say it’s a failure because of bad updates. Meanwhile, it still gets up to 50,000 concurrent players sometimes. That’s more players than most games!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s made its money. They’re good for a very long time. I will say for me, though, there’s this element of, every time I see somebody who gets that way about box office stuff, I’m like “Do you own stock? Are you a shareholder?” Because if not, I don’t see why you fucking care.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Did you like the movie or not, man? That’s all that should matter to you.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> If you do [own stock], I get it. If you put all your money into Tencent, and you want to be like “Oh, the numbers,” then sure.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s a byproduct of the fact that people in many ways feel powerless to express themselves and their values beyond consumption. And so they’re like “I’m gonna be the ultimate consumer. I’m gonna show that the things I consume are more right and just than the things other people consume, and that bears itself out in the number of people consuming them. If my thing is more popular, then my views are better and more popular. I’m the best and the most normal.”</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I just thought of the term “emotional shareholder” for fandom. Just somebody who is like “I gotta sell this franchise. The movie’s bad. I gotta sell!” Or they’re like “Alright, what am I buying? I’m buying <em>Deadpool 3</em>. Alright, cool.”&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
