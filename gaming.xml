<figure data-uuid="046aaf27c8ac8"><a title="Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/046aaf27c8ac8/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, folks, the day is finally upon us. Today is the last day that you can buy Switch Game Vouchers before Nintendo consigns them to the 'Discontinued' pile.</p>
<p>The Big N initially made the announcement way back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-will-discontinue-switch-game-vouchers-entirely-in-2026">July 2025</a>, but time has flown by since then, so we thought it was only right to give you one last nudge now that the day of reckoning is upon us.</p>
<p>You have until <strong>11:59pm</strong> in your timezone to make any final purchases, and the vouchers will be valid for one year from the point you buy them — so any that you pick up today won't expire until 30th January 2027. As ever, you'll need an active Nintendo Switch Online membership to get the vouchers in the first place.</p>
<p>For those who have missed out on this offer until today, Switch Game Vouchers come in pairs and can be used on select first-party digital purchases — saving you a few quid in the process. A pair of vouchers costs £84 / $99.98, which, when used on two full-price Switch 1 releases, knocks £16 / $20 off the combined price. It's a pretty sweet deal, we must admit.</p>
<p>While Game Vouchers cannot be used on Switch 2 exclusives, Nintendo has confirmed that it will continue to add Switch 1 releases to the scheme throughout 2026. Just yesterday, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> is a part of the Voucher programme and new releases like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> are available in it too (both of which have a paid upgrade option to Switch 2, if you choose to do that down the line).</p>
<p>You can find the full list of eligible games on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&amp;p=0" rel="noopener">Nintendo's website</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to make the most of this offer before it's gone, either head over to the <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/GB/en/pretickets/70020000000101">Nintendo website</a> and sign in with your active NSO account, or head to the 'Nintendo Switch Online' section of the eShop on your Switch / Switch 2 and select 'Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers'. Do keep in mind that you can't have more than eight active Vouchers on your account at once, so don't go crazy out there!</p>
<p>So long, partner!</p>

              <p>You can add a lot of extra storage to your computer without opening the case with the Western Digital 8TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive. Photos, 4K video, game installs, and old project archives all take up valuable space on computers. This desktop-style external drive provides a spot to stash them. The WD Elements Desktop has a black enclosure designed to sit next to your computer tower or monitor, and its 8TB capacity will give you enough space to create several large backup systems and many large media folders. To begin moving files to the external drive, simply plug in the power and the included USB cable, and you’re done.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6958/">The Western Digital 8TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive is available now at Amazon for $171, a $54 savings or 24% off the original price of $225.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6958/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An 8TB hard drive perfect for adding extra storage to your PC</h2>
<p>The Western Digital 8TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive is a USB hard drive that provides additional storage capacity for larger media collections and bigger project folders. WD claims that this version of the Elements Desktop offers faster data transfer speeds than previous models, so transferring large numbers of photos, 4K videos, or large game files should be easier and quicker. The Elements Desktop comes pre-formatted to work immediately with a Windows-based PC, but Mac users will have to format it before use.</p>
<p>Setting up the WD Elements Desktop model is easy and does not require much technical knowledge. Once connected to a Windows machine, the Elements Desktop is recognized immediately and can be used to store files after connecting the power and USB cables.</p>



<p>A compact desktop enclosure houses the internal mechanical hard drive in the WD Elements Desktop, and it does not take up much space, especially considering the amount of storage capacity it contains. The WD Elements Desktop is compact, which makes it easy to place beside a computer tower or monitor. The simple black design will blend in well with most computing environments, and the quiet passive operation makes it suitable for long-duration file transfers and scheduled backups.</p>
<p>If you are running out of internal storage space, then this 8TB Elements Desktop model is one of the easiest ways to add capacity to your computer. This hard drive can be used to store full system backups, serve as an archive for older projects, or store large media collections, such as videos and photos, that are taking up too much space on your internal drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6958/">Now’s a great time to buy the WD Elements Desktop model, which is currently selling on Amazon for $171, a $54 savings from the $225 list price.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Build a Rocket Boy to End Publishing Partnership With IO Interactive on MindsEye]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/</link>
            <guid>1420717</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the developers behind <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mindseye/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mindseye/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MindsEye</a>, Build a Rocket Boy, are planning to announce soon that they have decided to part ways with their publisher, IO Interactive.</p>



<p>According to sources close to the impending news, the decision is driven by Build a Rocket Boy’s desire to bring its publishing in-house and gain more control over its future. That includes faster decision-making, simpler communication, and greater control over the player experience.</p>



<p>As part of the change, it’s said that the upcoming MindsEye x Hitman crossover, which was announced during 2025’s Summer Game Fest, will no longer be taking place. Instead, Build a Rocket Boy will continue focusing on more fixes and content updates to build out MindsEye.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the decision to part ways is Build a Rocket Boy’s, rather than IO Interactive’s.</p>



<p>MindsEye launched on June 10, 2025, to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-reviews-creep-in-worst-rated-game-2025/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-reviews-creep-in-worst-rated-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrible critic reviews</a>, with just 6% of critics recommending the game and receiving mostly negative to mixed reviews on Steam. Prior to the game’s launch and just a couple of weeks earlier, Mark Gerhard, the co-CEO of Build a Rocket Boy, took to Discord in a Q&amp;A to claim that the negative pre-release reception of MindsEye was part of a paid campaign by a third party to make a “concerted effort to trash the game and the studio”.</p>



<p>Build a Rocket Boy remained mainly silent following the game’s release, instead focusing on trying to fix and improve the game. Co-CEO <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-relaunch-as-ceo-blames-saboteurs/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-relaunch-as-ceo-blames-saboteurs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leslie Benzies reportedly told staff </a>on a call one month following the game’s release that 300 developers were at risk of redundancy, saying the “studio and game’s struggles” were due to “internal and external saboteurs”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has contacted IO Interactive for comment, but did not receive one prior to publication. Should one be given, we will update this report.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/after-going-gold-crimson-desert-developer-deep-in-optimization-phase-to-make-the-game-run-as-good-as-it-possibly-can-before-launch</link>
            <guid>1420714</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve seen Crimson Desert’s impressive 15-minute gameplay video, you might be wincing at the thought of it running smoothly on your console or PC. Well, right now, the developers at Pearl Abyss are focusing on optimization to help ensure a “smooth” experience when the game comes out in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crimson Desert is set in a huge and seamless open world packed with enemies, NPCs, and all sorts of things to do. It’s dense with detail, and you can zip around quickly on the back of a dragon. Based on the video, below, Crimson Desert will be a demanding beast — it will be interesting in particular to see how it runs on the Xbox Series S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Will Powers, director of public relations at Pearl Abyss America, the developers are doubling down on the "optimization phase” as we speak, telling former IGN video extraordinaire Destin Legarie in <a href="https://youtu.be/5hPXEVG-X5g?si=4A95xvuCARBCLl1f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new interview</a> that this is the focus ahead of Crimson Desert’s March 19 release date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have gone gold. Now comes further, further optimization to make the game run as good as it possibly can,” Powers said. “And that’s as important of a part. So that's the phase we're currently in between now and launch to make sure that the experience when players eventually get their hands on the game, is as smooth as possible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers wouldn’t go into specifics on the graphics settings that will be available on consoles, but did confirm Crimson Desert has PS5 Pro enhancement. You can also turn off the particle effects in settings, although Powers said they do convey important information during fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss built a new engine for Crimson Desert, and Powers explained that it’s capable of providing a 4K60 native presentation, complete with ray tracing, without the aid of graphics technology such as DLSS or FSR. But of course you’ll need powerful hardware to enable it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, we'll show 4K 60 native, sure, with ray tracing on, that's not done through DLSS or FSR, that's done natively in-engine,” Powers said. “And then if you want to further optimize then you can tweak all the settings and do all the things, but we want to show that you don't have to… like the game itself should be able to stand on its own.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crimson Desert Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And on that decision to go with a proprietary engine:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not going to say that the game is absolutely perfectly optimized, but within the engine it's using every single thing. So it's as optimized as it can be within that space. That's not possible otherwise. And so rendering thousands of trees within draw distance, it does those things better than an off-the-shelf engine could because of that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Off-the-shelf engines weren't able to deliver the uncompromised vision that the developers set forth to create with this game. So, they needed to create their own engine in order to deliver on that vision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crimson Desert’s huge open world has been a topic of debate recently. Pywel is divided into five distinct regions: Hernand; Pailune; Demeniss; Delesyia; and the Crimson Desert itself. The main quest revolves around protagonist Kliff’s journey, but you’re free to explore the world in any order, taking faction-driven quests, large-scale battles, fortress sieges and smaller, character-focused missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss confirmed that as the story progresses, two additional playable characters become available, each with unique combat styles, skills and weapons. Exploration is a big part of the game — you travel on horseback, climb terrain, glide across distances, and later access advanced traversal options such as a missile-firing mech and a dragon. Pearl Abyss said the world is filled with hidden treasures, ancient mechanisms, puzzles and points of interest “designed to reward curiosity and discovery.” As for combat, expect to face enemy soldiers, sorcerers, beasts and machines.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-open-world-is-at-least-twice-as-big-as-skyrims-and-larger-than-the-red-dead-redemption-2-map"><u>Powers called Crimson Desert’s open world “absolutely massive,”</u></a> bigger even than that of Bethesda’s Skyrim and Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/aEX6hjTSlOk?si=Ei_PQfEUiBEH5A6F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Gaming Interviews YouTube channel</u></a>, Powers said that describing the size of Crimson Desert’s world in terms of numbers doesn’t do it justice, because doing so fails to capture the scope and scale of the game. But he did go as far as to compare it to two of the biggest open-world games around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think numbers really do it justice because, how big is that in terms of scope and scale?” he said. “But what we can say is that the world's at least twice as big as the open world, the playable area, of Skyrim. It's larger than the map of Red Dead Redemption 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers went on to insist that the size of Crimson Desert’s open world wouldn't determine its quality. Rather, what you actually do in it is the key factor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The continent of Pywel is absolutely massive, but size doesn't really matter if there's nothing to do,” he said. “Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions. So we wanted to create a world that's not only massive, but is also incredibly interactive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Pearl Abyss.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ncr-power-armor-from-the-fallout-tv-show-makes-its-way-into-fallout-76-but-youll-need-to-spend-30-to-use-it</link>
            <guid>1420708</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Inevitably, the New California Republic Power Armor that made such a dramatic appearance in the latest episode of the Fallout TV show is now in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>. But rather than sell it via the in-game shop and thus allow players to buy it with Atoms, Fallout 76’s virtual currency, it is only available as part of a standalone DLC bundle priced $30.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In lieu of a brand new Fallout video game, Bethesda has leaned heavily on Fallout 76 to capitalize on boosted interest in all things Fallout following the breakout success of the Prime Video TV show. Fallout 76 has Walton Goggins’ character The Ghoul dishing out quests, for example. There is a New Vegas-style expansion (Season 2 is set in New Vegas — or what’s left of it). And now Fallout 76 has the NCR Power Armor that Maximus uses to fight a pack of Deathclaws in Episode 7.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Never underestimate the power of brand recognition. <a href="https://t.co/vuHbfcQ6EB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/vuHbfcQ6EB</a></p>— FALLOUT⚡️ (@falloutonprime) <a href="https://twitter.com/falloutonprime/status/2016573413502906575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 28, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That NCR Power Armor is a big talking point among Fallout fans for a number of reasons. It’s brand new — we’ve not seen its type in the video games before — and it sparks all sorts of questions about the Fallout lore and what we thought the NCR was capable of. Setting aside the fact that an NCR Power Armor appearance in Fallout 76, which is set <em>before</em> all the other Fallout video games, makes little sense lore wise because the NCR didn’t exist yet, its price has become the big talking point.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The NCR Power Armor is available in Fallout 76 via the Mojave Bundle, which includes the following:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ranger Power Armor Paint</li><li>NCR Flag</li><li>New Vegas Neon Sign</li><li>Ad Victoriam (Super Sledge)</li><li>Legion Legate Outfit</li><li>Player Title Prefix – “Advictoriam”</li><li>Player Title Prefix &amp; Suffix – “Tribune”</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/f76-1769766158551.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Fallout 76 Mojave Bundle costs $30. Image credit: Bethesda.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The long and the short of it is that if you want the NCR Power Armor, you need to hand over $30 for this entire bundle — a standard practice these days really, where DLC bundles often cost more than entire video games, and items you might not necessarily want are thrown in to improve “value.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have said the bundle is overpriced at $30, and accused Bethesda of “cashing in” on the show by not making it available to buy for Atoms, which most players will have stashed away for DLC like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, the price of the Mojave bundle is ridiculous,” one fan said. “It’s exhausting to watch a studio that once had credibility reduce everything to cash grabs. I guess a lot of people will pay for it anyway. Good luck.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sentiment shared by many across the various Fallout subreddits, Steam’s own forum, and social media. “Yeah this is a hard pass for me. Put it in the Atom shop,” said a disgruntled fan. “£26.99 for eight items, two of which are just words!!!” added another. “Then you've got two C.A.M.P items, a Power Armor paint, a weapon, plus an outfit with a helmet.... Not even a cheeky few hundred Atoms thrown in! That's actually peak lmao, but whilst people keep buying it, Bethesda are going to keep selling it!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This DLC includes a set of armor that I'm never going to wear because the Legate armor doesn't fit in thematically with anything, it also includes a flag and a neon sign, none of which are of particular value to me,” reads one negative Steam review. “And with the Burning Sands starter bundle you at least get a free bullet machine. This bundle gives you nothing of value. For me the only reason to pick this up is the NCR Power Armor, which I can understand cashing in on the show, but they clearly didn't want to put it on the Atom shop for the people who have saved atoms. I would have paid $10 for this item no problem.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2, Episode 2 Video Game Details - Characters, Locations and Factions</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, not all players agree. Many are pointing to the $30 price point being standard for bundles of this type in Fallout 76 (and in other games), and others are saying you can simply choose not to but it if you don’t like it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Is it overpriced? Yes. Is it undervalued? Yes,” countered one fan. “It's still not predatory, because you can simply NOT BUY IT. You lose out on zero actual gameplay by not buying it. You also don't gain any gameplay from buying it. If having this bundle gave me some type of advantage in-game, that might be predatory, but this is just another bundle. I've skipped plenty of those over the years. This bundle replaced the Atomic Angler bundle, which I believe was also $30. There's ALWAYS going to be a cash bundle out there. Just don't buy it. It's that simple.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You know as weird as it is I just don't mind,” said another. “There's no gameplay content or quests / locations locked behind the purchase, so far every expansion has been released for free, there's plenty to do in the game and loads of other cosmetics and camp stuff to get for free or buy with atoms from challenges, the game (imo) doles out tons of Atoms anyway, and from my understanding these bundles typically go on more than 50% off sale pretty regularly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I mean like, whatever, you don't need to day one buy every single piece of content, if Bethesda releasing these lil whale drops occasionally means the vast majority of the game can stay free for the vast majority of players that's a good thing. Just be glad we're not a gacha or a lootbox game or something with actual predatory pricing.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda will of course be hoping that as many fans as possible decide that $30 is a reasonable price to pay to patrol the desert of Burning Springs like you’re straight out of the Fallout TV show. Data shows that the show has fueled an increase in player numbers for all Fallout games, with some newcomers dipping into the likes of Fallout 76 for the first time. I imagine in that context, this NCR Power Armor will prove quite popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout 76 itself, meanwhile, is free-to-play until February 5, with the Season 2 finale set to broadcast on February 3. If you need to catch up, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-is-releasing-all-episodes-of-fallout-season-1-for-free-on-youtube-ahead-of-season-2-finale">Amazon has released Season 1 for free on YouTube</a>.

            <p>The Metal Gear Solid series has sold over 65.5m copies worldwide, according to a new business post by Konami.</p>
<p>The post, <a href="https://www.konami.com/corporate/en/business/digitalentertainment.html">published on the official Konami corporate website</a>, breaks down a selection of milestone achievements for its various IPs. The crowning achievement of this breakdown is the Metal Gear Series, which has surpassed 65.5m total worldwide sales. However, other big series from the Japanese games company have also taken centre stage alongside the stealth action series.</p>
<p>These include the Pawafuru Puroyakyu series, which has passed 26.3m sales, YuGiOh games at 32.5m, Momotaro Dentetsu at 19.9m, and Silent Hill which has made it past 14m sales. Of of these stats run up to the end of December 2025.</p>

<p>The page also includes some pretty eye-watering download stats for various mobile and console games. eFootball has apparently surpassed 950m total sales since 1995, and YuGiOh Duel Links is no slouch either, passing 150m downloads since its release in 2016.</p><p>As a page aimed at impressing investors, there are additional interesting tidbits included in paragraphs meant to sell Konami as a forward-thinking company. This includes a descriptor of Konami as "a leading company in esports", thanks to YuGiOh, eFootball, and Pawafuru Puroyakyu.</p>
<p>The company also claims it will: "continue to take on challenges of the latest innovation by utilizing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), fifth/sixth generation mobile communications (5G/6G), cloud technology, WEB3, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a>, and VR/AR."</p>
<p><a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/statements/2026/en0129_cf84s6.pdf">Looking at Konami's latest quarterly report</a>, it certainly seems as though the company is doing well. It saw a 16.3 percent increase in income from its digital entertainment sector compared to last year, and a total revenue increase of 13.6 percent.</p>

            <p>The first script for an upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> film adaptation based on Hazelight's game of the same name has been penned.</p>
<p>It was first announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-film-in-the-works-as-bidding-war-for-rights-begins">Split Fiction, which sees two aspiring writers trapped in simulations of their own stories, was going to be getting the movie treatment</a> last year. At this time, sources said media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - was in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Soon after, it was revealed that Euphoria and Eden actor Sydney Sweeney would star in the upcoming film, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Deadpool screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick would handle the script</a>. And, handle the script, they appear to have done.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DTw4CbhDZZT/">Moviezine</a>, Hazelight studio head Josef Fares said he had seen the first finalised script for the Split Fiction film. "I got the first version of the script today but you know, there's so much talk in Hollywood. I usually say it like this 'I believe it when I see it'," Fares said (translated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/">Dexerto</a>).</p>
<p>Fares added he had chatted with a "hyped" Sweeney about the project, as well. "I've had a meeting with her and she seems super chill," he said.</p>
<p>But, while she may be hyped, there is still no word on when we can expect filming for Split Fiction to actually kick off. It could be some time, given how busy Sweeney's schedule is. As well as Split Fiction, the actor is also attached to Colman Domingo's romantic drama Scandalous, which is set to shoot early this year, and a Gundam adaptation. On the other side of the camera, it has been reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-outrun-getting-movie-adaptation-from-michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney">Sweeney is set to produce an adaptation of OutRun</a>. </p>

<p>Split Fiction isn't the only Hazelight game getting the film treatment. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>.</p>
<p>However, little has been heard of this particular project since, and last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’m going to call it a day early: January is done! It’s been a long, dry (well, in terms of alcohol) and often dull sort of month, and it always feels good to get it out of the way. I can almost feel the sunshine coming, or at least, a slight rise in the UK’s temperature and for the drizzle to get a bit lighter.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/28/highguard-review-in-progress/">been playing Highguard this week </a>and, well, I don’t really see why the world has decided to pile on it. It’s a fun enough (and free) diversion. Whether it’s got any longevity, we’ll have to see, but it deserves more of a shot than some people are giving it. Besides that, I got to have time with the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/27/grid-legends-switch-2-review/">GRID Legends</a>, and Feral Interactive have done a great job of bringing it across, with a heap of user-friendly graphics options. I’m embarking on a heap of reviews and previews now, which you’ll get to read about next week!</p>

<p>First in the alphabet and first to turn up was <strong>Aran</strong>, who’s had another week of sneaky shenanigans in Star Wars Outlaws. He said, “I’ve just taken to travelling around each planet, taking contracts and seeing what opportunities I can find. It’s been fun to pit the various factions against each other while getting them to all like me. It makes it easier for me to steal the valuables from their vaults too.”</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> has gone all coy, saying, “You know I can’t tell you, you tease.” But I think he’s being a bit too secretive don’t you? He’s actually been playing Nioh 3 for review, and while he can’t say much more than that before embargo, there is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/29/theres-a-fresh-demo-for-nioh-3-with-a-week-to-go-before-launch/">a demo out now</a> if you want to try it for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> dived back into Dynasty Warriors: Origins for the new DLC. He tells us, “I was quickly reminded what an excellent job Omega Force has done in rebooting the series – Visions of Four Heroes is somewhat similar to the Xtreme Legends expansions we used to get back in the day, though some of the battles are a little too big/prolonged. Still, I’m enjoying the new weapon classes.” That’s not all though, as he also checked out the game everyone is talking about, “I also dabbled in some Highguard but it’s fusion of gameplay ideas just isn’t for me. This disappointment has probably been amplified by my short time with Deadlock which is ticking all my boxes and genuinely feels like the evolution of a subgenre.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has played all sorts of random bits and bobs this week, though his highlight has been Rebellion’s reboot of 90’s classic Speedball. He says, “I played the original on my trusty Amiga, some three decades ago! Absolute madness! review coming soon!”</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has played a bunch of the new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/26/cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-dlc-review/">Cult of the Lamb DLC, Woolhaven</a>. He said, “It’s nice to get back into the game. I’ve had to move on to review something else though, which you’ll hear about next week.”</p>
<p>Having wrapped up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/29/cairn-review/">Cairn for review</a>, and halting his playthrough of Ghost of Yotei just before the final mission, <strong>Gamoc</strong> made the poor decision to then ruined his chances of feeling alive, telling us, “I couldn’t get to sleep last night so I gave up and played Factorio for six hours overnight and now I’ve had no sleep whatsoever.” Maybe a nap is in order?</p>

<p><strong>Miguel</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/26/code-vein-2-review/">Code Vein II</a> for our review, and Romeo Is A Dead Man! He’s fully on a wild anime action game grind! Meanwhile, <strong>Steve</strong> has been playing Ebola: Village and I Hate This Place for review and continuing to enjoy Gigasword at bedtime. He’s also spent some time jetting through space with friends in Void Crew.</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been on a secretive mission to Germany that you’ll hear all about next week. All he can say for the time being is that he had a currywurst delivered to him by a robot with a cute cat face on his trip back.</p>
<p>And what about you? Played anything this week?</p>

            <p>Well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> developers Blizzard have decided to have a bit of extra fun with all the junk that'll fill up the new player houses rolling out in full with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-releases-in-march-bringing-voidstorm-plague-on-all-the-new-houses">March's Midnight expansion</a>. The MMO's getting a prop hunt mode dubbed Decor Duel, designed to act as a "small diversion" from the whole Xal’atath-led void invasion business.</p>

<p>Decor Duel was one of the many incoming WOW things outlined during yesterday's <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24250385/catch-up-on-the-state-of-azeroth-in-our-recap">State of Azeroth showcase</a>, which saw Blizzard detail all of their 2026 plans beyond the launch of Midnight. It's prop hunt as you'd likely expect prop hunt if you're a veteran of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/garrys-mod">Garry's Mod</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> or more recently the likes of Call of Duty. Two teams of five on a map in a city or neighbourhood, one with the ability to turn into random items via illusion magic, and the other tasked with hunting down their hiding spots amid the area's regular fixtures.</p>
<p>"You might not defeat the Void and save Azeroth by taking part in this event, but it’s a great way to find a bit of fun in the face of the ever present and growing threat the Void presents," Blizzard admit. Prop hunt will be coming with patch 12.0.5, which is set to arrive not long after Midnight's launch on March 2nd. That same patch will also bring void assaults, which are a chance to fight back against the whole Xal’atath thing by slapping up some enemies invading random spots throughout the world.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first major update arriving after Midnight will be 12.1 in the summer, which Blizzard wouldn't get into specifics on in terms of name or setting, but they did reveal that it'll come with "a new zone with maximum level content, new raid, and a new season with an updated Mythic+ dungeon Pool, new PvP and Delves rewards", plus an overhaul of the Friends system. After Blizzcon in September, another update called 12.1.5 will be bringing "Labyrinths" to the MMO, these being new mega-dungeon-esque adventures designed to play like the shorter Delves added as part of The War Within. Blizzard describe them as follows: "large sprawling experiences you can tackle all at once or a bit at a time depending on your own schedule. They will have a different form and reward structure than are currently available in Delves but retain the core elements of exploring and besting foes alongside your Delve companion."</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year, the publisher's 2026 plans also include a mysterious new mode from the team who've previously created pirate-themed battle royale mode Plunderstorm and Remix.</p>
<p>So, there are the things. If you've not kept abreast of all the hulabaloo that's been going on ahead of Midnight around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcraft-devs-blizzard-will-offer-folks-a-free-wardrobe-change-just-before-midnight-following-fashion-fee-furore">WOW's transition between two types of gear transmog system</a>, you'll be glad to learn Blizzard have stepped to try and limit the gold costs involved in existing players making the switch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 76 Devs Lock Insane Power Armor Behind $30 Paywall]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-power-armor-fallout-devs-lock-paywall/</link>
            <guid>1420690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios recently unveiled an awesome new ‘Mojave Bundle’ to eager Fallout 76 players, especially those neck-deep in the second season of the television show, which comes to an end in under a week. The Mojave Bundle contains a kick-ass new power armor skin that replicates the recent one revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the TV series</a>, but there’s a huge catch.</p>



<p>Despite the Mojave Bundle boasting a few more cosmetics, some fans are outraged that it costs a whopping $30 – or £26.99, if you’re on the other side of the pond.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-vegas-ranger-power-armor-locked-behind-pay-barrier">New Vegas Ranger Power Armor Locked Behind Pay Barrier</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 players are contending with the revelation that one of the coolest suits of power armor ever added to the Fallout universe (let’s not get into <em>that </em>debate) is locked behind a hefty paywall.</p>



<p>If you want to acquire Fallout 76’s Mojave Bundle, you’ll need to part ways with $30 of your hard-earned cash. It’s not available to purchase using in-game currency (Atoms), nor do you get any kind of a discount for having a Fallout 1st <em>premium </em>subscription.</p>



<p>As a side note, check out why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-1st-removed-from-player-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76 fans in Japan</a> are especially annoyed at Fallout 1st…</p>



<p>The Mojave Bundle comes with:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ranger Power Armor Paint</li>



<li>NCR Flag</li>



<li>New Vegas Neon Sign</li>



<li>Ad Victoriam (Super Sledge)</li>



<li>Legion Legate Outfit</li>



<li>Player Title Prefix</li>



<li>Player Title Prefix &amp; Suffix</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s not a tiny bundle by any means, but it’s 100% cosmetic and has a high price point, which is the core problem here. To put this into perspective, the base game currently costs under $10, so the cosmetic pack is more than three times the cost of the game (when it’s not on sale).</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Most people would be playing Fallout 76 via a paid-for subscription, like Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, so they’re even more unlikely to invest cash in the ecosystem to acquire a $30 cosmetic bundle.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, Bethesda <strong>pledged </strong><span>there would be no paid DLC for Fallout 76, then later unveiled Fallout 1st, which caused a bit of outrage by paywalling items many thought they should all&nbsp;</span>get, like the treasured stash box and survival tent mechanics.</p>



<p>Admittedly, every expansion to hit Fallout 76 thus far, including the recent Burning Springs expansion, has been <strong>completely free</strong>, so it could be argued that a $30 cosmetics bundle isn’t rocking the boat too much and should be eaten up nicely by the die-hard fans of the post-apocalyptic world.</p>







<p>Do you think $30 is too much for a Fallout 76 cosmetics bundle? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new claim states that PlayStation is developing an OLED version of the Portal, following the success of the original. </p>



<p>We have heard about several leaks about the upcoming PlayStation 6 handheld over the last year, with reports that it will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-handheld-console-will-be-dockable-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dockable</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not as powerful</a> as the PlayStation 5, and more surfacing online. Now, new information has surfaced online on the existing PlayStation handheld, the Portal. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-portal-oled-model-is-reportedly-in-development">PlayStation Portal OLED Model is Reportedly in Development</h2>



<p>The claim about the PlayStation Portal OLED model comes from KeplerL2 on <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/intels-panther-lake-igpu-is-really-worth-considering-for-a-handheld-amd-fell-asleep-at-the-wheel.1692741/page-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Neogaf</a>. In the thread, Kepler first mentioned that the PS Handheld will be RDNA5 before discussing the Portal. They then stated that the original Portal model “seems to be a success,” with PlayStation working on “another version this year.” When asked which version they were referring to, Kepler responded, “OLED version.” </p>



<p>The PlayStation Portal received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-portal-gets-cloud-streaming-in-surprise-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise cloud-streaming update</a> last year, adding the ability to stream select PS5 games directly to their devices with PS Plus Premium. The library includes some big names like Astro Bot, Borderlands 4, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Fortnite, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto V, Resident Evil 4, Cyberpunk 2077, God of War Ragnarök, Hogwarts Legacy, Sword of the Sea, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, and more.</p>



<p>With the new update, the PlayStation Portal OLED Model would be more attractive to new customers; however, we have yet to receive official confirmation, so readers should take this information with a grain of salt for now. </p>







<p>In other news, a recent claim states that Xbox’s dedicated handheld was cancelled as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-handheld-amd-10-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMD required 10 million units</a>. Additionally, layStation Store seems to have inadvertently confirmed an incoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-ps5-upgrade-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance PS5 upgrade</a>.

<p>A new announcement reveals that the original Final Fantasy 7 is re-releasing on Steam, replacing the 2013 version. </p>



<p>Nowadays, all we hear about Final Fantasy 7 is the remake instalments, Intergrade has already been released for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-series/" id="3453">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-part-3-confirmed-for-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth and Part 3 </a>have been confirmed for both platforms as well. However, today we aren’t talking about any of the remakes; instead, we are talking about the original Final Fantasy 7 title. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-re-releasing-to-replace-2013-version-on-steam">Final Fantasy 7 Re-Releasing to Replace 2013 Version on Steam </h2>



<p>According to a recent post on <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2016920806258069772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/square-enix/" id="149">Square Enix</a> has posted a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/39140/view/514107648813039662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> on Steam regarding Final Fantasy 7’s re-release. The new version will rename the current version to FINAL FANTASY VII – 2013 Edition, and this version will no longer be available for purchase once the new version is released. </p>



<p>Existing owners of the 2013 version of Final Fantasy 7 don’t need to worry, as they will both retain access to the previous version and gain access to the new version at no additional cost. This means players can have both versions in their library, but there is no save data compatibility between them. Players with FF7 2013 save data can only use it for the 2013 edition, and the same for the new release. </p>



<p>Moreover, Square Enix has yet to provide a release date or an explanation for re-releasing Final Fantasy 7 on Steam. From what I can see, there are no noticeable upgrades in this version. </p>







<p>In other news, a new claim states that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth could release for Xbox and Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-arrive-for-switch-2-this-summer-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this summer</a>. Additionally, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 will bring back the iconic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-bring-back-the-snowboarding-mini-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowboarding mini game</a>.

            <p>According to Walton Goggins, we can all expect something "profound" to happen in the Fallout season two finale next week.</p>
<p>Goggins, who plays The Ghoul/Cooper Howard in Amazon's Fallout adaptation, has said his character's motivations have always been about finding his family. Of course, over the course of two seasons, we have seen the highs and lows of Cooper Howard's family life with his wife Barb and daughter Janey via flashbacks. Meanwhile, in the present day, a now Ghoul-ified Cooper is still searching for his family, and has been for centuries.</p>

<p>So, will he find them in the final episode of Fallout season two? Well, that remains to be seen, though Goggins has teased something "profound" happening not just to The Ghoul, but to the sweeter than sweet vault dweller Lucy as well.</p>
<p>"I can tell you that in episode eight, without giving something away to your audience, something profound happens for both the Ghoul and Lucy that would also be my favourite, but we can't talk about that," he told <a href="https://ew.com/fallout-season-2-finale-cover-story-exclusive-11893674">EW</a> ahead of the Fallout finale.</p><p>Goggins added viewers will also learn more about what Cooper was doing at that birthday party, way back at the start of season one. "I mean, the whole first seven minutes of this experience in season one was about [Cooper being] a guy at a birthday party. Well, how did he get to that birthday party? What happened? It's all leading somewhere," the actor said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to Lucy MacLean actor Ella Purnell, the second season's finale will be a "conflicted, explosive and character-defining" cocktail for the naive and trusting vault dweller.</p>
<p>"You get to see Lucy be a real human with real human problems, and I think at times, because of her strength and her optimism, it doesn't always feel that way with her," Purnell explained. "But in this moment, and that maybe says a lot about what her choices and decisions are, she's flawed and she's actually just getting more and more human."</p>
<p>Ooh, curious!</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-latest-episode-delivers-another-cameo-for-fans-of-the-video-game-series">many weeks of chaos and cameos</a>, Fallout season two will wrap up on 3rd February. Meanwhile, the third season of Fallout is already being written, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">filming expected to kick off this May</a>. Ghoul blimey, and all that.</p>

            <p>
If you’ve ever intrepidly looked up a Paradox game, seen a million DLC expansions on the Steam page, and fled screaming into the woods, rest assured that Paradox have you in their eye. It’s doubtful they’re going to change anything about their broad DLC strategy, mind, but they’re aware that some players may feel reluctant to purchase older Paradox games that have dozens of add-ons.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
“We're well aware that if you go in and see a barrage of DLCs, it might be a bit off-putting to buy the game directly if you're a new gamer, but [like we] mentioned we do bundling to get different types of starter packs, to make it easier to get on board,” commented CEO Fred Wester in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHWAVZVRxW">the company’s latest financial earnings call</a> with investors. “We also work with pricing in different territories, but also deep discounting and publisher weekends and whatnot. We also have DLC subscriptions on – is it a majority of our games, or at least maybe half of our games? 
</p>
<p>
“So that's an option as well. You pay a smaller sum to try everything out, and you can do it on a monthly basis. So those are the strategies we've tried so far, and they're working really well. But we continue to to try to make our offerings more appealing to more gamers.”
</p>
<p>
Why exactly are people put off by DLC barrages? Wester doesn’t spell it out, but for me, the agonising introspective journey goes like this: I do not want to spend all that extra money, but I’m also worried that I’m missing out on something crucial if I stick with the base game – yes, even though Paradox are in the habit of chunky free updates. For all I know, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearts-of-iron">Hearts of Iron</a> 4’s La Résistance expansion is the difference between Pétainist ignominie and Charles-de-Gaullic triomphe.</p><p>I could go read some reviews of La Résistance or one of the game’s 25 other add-ons, but that would take several extra minutes of research and this was supposed to be an impulse purchase. ARGH! I’m going to buy a Creative Assembly game instead. 
</p>
<p>
*opens <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3 Steam page* 
</p>
<p>*soul is ejected from body*
</p>
<p>
I don’t think there’s a way out of this predicament, while Paradox are in the business of making fat stacks over several years by way of paid expansions alongside free updates and re-promotion. Part of it is that Paradox are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">renowned for ‘long tail’ post-release development</a>, so even a brand new Paradox grand strategy game with a modest handful of preorder cosmetics looks suspect - a submerged Great White waiting to explode from the waves and guzzle you down like some loathsome, cash-strapped, time-poor penguin. Swim penguin, swim! Lest you too accidentally take out a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> subscription.

            <p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a>' release on February 11th, devs RGG Studio have announced plans to put out a day one patch to fix visual issues spotted the remade beat-em-up's demo. Specifically, there's a section of the game's version of downtown Okinawa by a river which players have pointed out to be garishly oversaturated compared to the original Yakuza 3 and its previous remaster.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can certainly see it in posts folks have compiled which put the two games' riverside vistas alongside each other. I didn't find it too off-putting when playing through the demo myself, though I had opted to tone the brightness down to compensate, which made a couple of night scenes a bit harder to make out. So, it's good news RGG are planning to sort it out.</p>
<p>"Rest assured the graphical quality of the demo does not represent the final experience," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/RGGStudio/status/2017040175180796074">Tweeter post</a>. "We plan to have a v1.11 patch available at launch which will address the lighting issue and other quality concerns in the full game. One specific example is the visual and lighting issues around the Kubochi River area in the Downtown Ryukyu area, which many of you have already pointed out."</p> <div>

<p>RGG added that the patch will "include not just fixes for the issues identified above, but many other improvements" and that the timing of its release might vary by platform. Here's hoping its PC arrival isn't left until last.</p>
<p>While they have now publicly acknowledged these lighting issues, RGG Studio have so far opted not to issue a response to a Yakuza fan petition calling on them to re-cast one of the game's actor's, Teriyuki Kagawa. The backlash against Kagawa's casting stems from a 2022 report by Japanese magazine Shukan Shincho that the actor sexually harassed a female employee at a club in Tokyo’s Ginza district in 2019.

            <p>Word on the internet is that Nintendo will be holding another reveals-based livestream next week, and it'll be a Partner Showcase no less.</p>
<p>According to various sources, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016969052132962528">including NatetheHate and GameXplain</a>, the showcase will be focused on third party studios publishing on Nintendo systems, with NatetheHate going one step further stating it'll be hosted on the 5th February.</p>
<p>While these are folks who have a history of calling these sorts of events right in the past, they are still rumours and should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Still, it's been some time since we had a Nintendo Partner Direct. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">Back in July of last year</a>, games like Monster Hunter Stories, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler-2">Octopath Traveler 2</a>, and more were shown off in quite the jam-packed occasion. Leading into 2026, there are plenty of games lined-up for release that we've not actually seen much of yet, including 007: First Light, and The Duskbloods. That last one being especially silent as of late.</p><p>Looking at the reactions to these rumours, there's excitement yet, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qqj4qr/natethehate_next_weeks_nintendo_direct_is_a/">but also hunger for a Nintendo Direct focused on first-party releases</a>. It's clear to see why, with a new Fire Emblem on the way as well as a new Mario Tennis, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> is looking strong on that front too.</p>
<p>What do you reckon? Will we see a Partner Direct next week? If so, what do you want to see in it?</p>

            <p>A report from GDC has shed a rather sobering light on the state of things, revealing that one third of surveyed US workers within the industry were laid off in the last two years.</p>
<p>According to GDC's <a href="https://reg.gdconf.com/2026-SOTI">2026 State of the Game Industry Report</a> - which included data provided by over 2300 respondents including developers, producers, marketers, executives and investors - 33 percent of respondents in the US had been laid off over the past 24 months.</p>
<p>Looking further afield to include other countries as well, 28 percent of those surveyed from within the industry reported they had been laid off in the same period, which is over a quarter of all respondents.</p>

<p>17 percent of those surveyed, meanwhile, stated they had been laid off in the past 12 months. "The total number of layoffs could be higher, though, as some may have experienced more than one layoff in the past two years," the report notes.</p><p>Almost half of the respondents - 48 percent - said they were still looking for employment after being laid off. Of those who were laid off one to two years ago, 36 percent said they still haven't found other games industry employment.</p>
<p>"Over 450 respondents reported experiencing an acquisition, closure, or merger in the past year. About 31 percent of those people also reported being laid off, though it's unclear how many were a direct result of said company changes," the report reads. "AAA and older indie respondents were more likely to report their companies were acquired, and newer indie studios were more likely to close."</p>
<p>In terms of professions within the industry, game designers reported the highest percentage of layoffs over the last 12 months, with 20 percent of those surveyed affected. This percentage includes those in narrative design.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale, those working in business operations and services reported the lowest percentage of layoffs, with eight percent affected.</p>
<p>As to the reason why these layoffs happened, 43 percent cited company restructuring, while 32 percent said it was due to a project getting cancelled. Budget cuts and market conditions were also cited by 38 percent of respondents.</p>
<p>"Leadership failed to see that the Covid-era boom was not permanent, [and the] company went on an acquisition spree before being acquired," one respondent told GDC. "Now, money is a lot tighter because the goldfish with the money want returns yesterday so they can funnel it into the current fad (genAI)."</p><p>Another respondent, who was laid off less than 12 months ago, said: "Executives who have never actually worked as a dev are pulling up the boards on their ships, throwing people overboard, and expecting these scuttled ghost ships to keep making them infinite money."</p>
<p>Some respondents added their employers were working to retain their staff, "in spite of ongoing challenges".</p>

<p>Layoffs and closures remain an ongoing issue in 2026. Earlier this month, Ubisoft shocked everyone when it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">"major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games.</p>
<p>For more on this topic, back in 2024, Chris Dring wrote an in-depth feature about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">everything going on with layoffs in the video games industry</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Video Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Console users can now adjust FoV to 110.</li>
<li>Low scalability settings for shadows and reflections are tuned for even more performance at the cost of some image quality.</li>

<li>Players can now select Off to disable Global Illumination entirely.</li>
<li>Resolved an engine bug which could inadvertently throttled laptop users to 60 FPS regardless of frame rate settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crash and Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>This patch resolves crashes that could occur in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving a match on PS5 with an unexpected input state.</li>
<li>Loading into matches on machines with slower storage devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of other bugs related to online user presence and matchmaking were also resolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Friends now appear online correctly after accepting requests, and Xbox presence updates properly. Major crash fixes have reduced crashes by 90 percent, significantly improving stability.</li>

<p>Highguard was announced last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards extravaganza</a> (which did also feature some awards). Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>Despite Amazon's live-action God of War series following the plot of Santa Monica's 2018 Norse epic, the cast so far has a very Ragnarök (and roll) feel to it.</p>

<p>Last night, it was announced that Severance actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson will portray the Norse God of Thunder, Thor. "A mountain of a man who has weathered many a battle in his time, but whose actions in a war fought long ago now haunt his waking hours," reads Thor's character description.</p>
<p>As in 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, Amazon's live-action Thor is "now but a shadow of his former self", and has turned to alcohol in an attempt to drown out his demons. "Keeping his wife and children at arm's length has only deepened his isolation, but the power (and danger) of the God of Thunder is still there just beneath the surface," the <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/olafur-darri-olafsson-cast-thor-god-of-war-1236702443/">description ends</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to Thor, Homeland and Princess Bride actor Mandy Patinkin has been announced as the show's "most powerful Aesir god", Odin. "Odin, the All-Father, is not physically imposing or particularly god-like: but looks can be deceiving," reads his <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/mandy-patinkin-god-of-war-odin-1236644947/">God of War character description</a>, adding that Odin is a "patriarch who leads with an iron fist, and an unrivaled seeker of knowledge".</p><p>Odin - who is the father of Thor - is "paranoid, manipulative, and dangerous", and will serve as "a formidable antagonist" to God of War's lead, Kratos. The Aesir god will do "anything to try and prevent Ragnarök, the Norse end of days".</p>

<p>Ólafsson and Patinkin join an already impressive cast, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">Ryan Hurst as Kratos</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-casts-thors-wife-sif">Teresa Palmer as Phoebe/Sif</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ey-up-this-lad-from-emmerdale-is-playing-norse-god-heimdall-in-amazons-god-of-war-show-thats-norse-not-up-north">Max Parker as Heimdall</a>. Meanwhile, behind the camera, Amazon's God of War adaptation includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore</a>, who will serve as showrunner on the upcoming series, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">Emmy winning Shōgun director Frederick E.O. Toye</a>.</p><p>"God of War follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human," reads the show's official logline. I wonder when we will hear who will play Atreus…?</p>
<p>We still don't have a release window for the first season, however a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>.</p>

			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> is the hot new extraction shooter on the market from developer <strong>Embark Studios</strong>, and while it may appear to be another third-person shooter that you can jump into without missing a beat, the fact that it's an extraction shooter means that there's a lot you have to contend with that you don't in your average multiplayer shooter experience.</p>



<p>You can find out more about what to know going into the experience in our Tips and Tricks guide, while this guide will take you through five things you need to do first when starting your own raiding journey in the Rust Belt.</p>

<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-first-5-things-to-do-for-new-raiders">ARC Raiders - First 5 Things to Do for New Raiders</h2>



<h3 id="h-expand-your-stash">Expand Your Stash</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-First-Things-to-Do-1-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>You've got to expand your stash.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Your loot is everything</strong> in ARC Raiders. You need resources to survive, whether it's for directly crafting survival materials like healing items or more weapons and ammo to protect yourself while on raids, or for expanding your workshop back in Speranza, so you can craft better gear to help you go out on raids.</p>



<p>Where that cycle of going out, collecting resources, and successfully extracting back from the Rust Belt breaks down is when you run out of room in your <strong>Stash</strong>. You take a backpack out with you on raids, but when you get back to Speranza, everything not in your loadout or in your backpack goes to your Stash, which is by no means an unlimited resource. You will run out of space if you're not properly managing your Stash in between raids, but what's better than having to manage it after every raid for five to ten minutes? Expanding it so you have more space and don't have to pause after every run to sell off or recycle a bunch of items because you can no longer store them.</p>



<p>Expanding your Stash is done by collecting in-game <strong>Coins</strong>, and it's about the most useful thing you can spend those coins on. When you're in Speranza, you can expand your Stash by selecting the '<strong>Expand'</strong> button in the top left corner. Your Coins are almost always better put to use by expanding your stash over buying a new weapon or piece of gear from one of the Traders, so try to save up for the expansion costs (which can get fairly hefty) by selling anything you don't need.</p>



<h3 id="h-fill-out-your-workshop-starting-with-the-gunsmith">Fill Out Your Workshop (Starting with the Gunsmith)</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-First-Things-to-Do-2-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Filling out your workshop is a key step in your ARC Raiders journey.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your <strong>Workshop</strong> starts out with six empty slots for you to fill with several different benches to craft specific kinds of gear. Alongside the introductory <strong>Workbench</strong>, you can fill out your Workshop with a <strong>Gunsmith, Gear Bench, Refiner, Utility Station, Medical Lab,</strong> and an <strong>Explosives Station</strong>.</p>



<p>All of these stations are important, and you should fill out your Workshop with all of them as soon as you can, and once you've crafted them, track all the resources needed to craft their level two variants. But you should start with the Gunsmith, for the basic reason being the sooner you can upgrade your weapons, the better your chances of survival should you get into a fight while Topside.</p>



<p>After you have your Gunsmith, one of the following three: Medical Lab, Explosives Station, and Utility Station, should be your next focus. The Medical Lab and Utility Station are a little more obvious in their importance because they allow you to craft things like healing items and additional shields, but you will want to prioritize the Explosives Station as well. That's because outside of your main weapons, grenades are your best offensive option against ARCs - particularly the bigger monstrosities.</p>



<h3 id="h-go-for-some-recon-runs">Go for Some Recon Runs</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-First-Things-to-Do-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Recon runs are essential.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Part of the fun in ARC Raiders is the tension felt when you barely make it back to Speranza alive, not just with the loot you've grabbed while Topside, but the weapons and resources you brought with you that would have been devastating to lose. That's why you should never take anything with you Topside that you can't afford to lose, and that's also why you should give yourself a bit of a break from the tension and utilize <strong>Free Loadouts</strong> as often as you can.</p>



<p>Free Loadouts are a randomized inventory and loadout that you can utilize when going Topside. You only get one weapon, a bit of ammo, and your backpack has fewer item slots, meaning you can't take as much back with you. But you don't risk anything in the process either, and when you extract safely, not only do you gain everything that came with that free loadout, but a full session's worth of game knowledge you didn't have before.</p>



<p>That's why I'm calling them 'Recon Runs.' Of course, it's good to get a bunch of loot without having to risk any of your own, but the most important thing you can do on a free loadout run is go to a part of the map you've never been before, and explore it as much as you can. You don't risk your own gear, and you gain invaluable knowledge as a new player still exploring and discovering each of the game's maps.</p>



<h3 id="h-unlock-skills-before-upgrading-them">Unlock Skills Before Upgrading Them</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-First-Things-to-Do-4-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>You can always reset things if you really want to (and have 26K coins to spare).</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When looking at the <strong>Skill Tree</strong> in ARC Raiders, you may notice that on each branch, <strong>Conditioning, Survival, </strong>and <strong>Mobility</strong>, every point can be upgraded from one to five. You unlock <strong>Skill Points</strong> with each new level gained, and while you can, of course, bank five skill points early into a single Skill in order to max it out, you're better off spending those skills elsewhere.</p>



<p>Namely, towards unlocking new skills. Each branch starts with one featured Skill, indicated by its larger icon, followed by four smaller skills before the next featured Skill. The second row of featured Skills requires you to spend a certain number of skill points in that particular branch to even be able to unlock them, which is why you're better off using your early skill points to unlock all five of the skills available at the start of each branch.</p>



<p>Once you've unlocked all of the skills initially available to you, feel free to start banking skill points towards unlocking higher tiers for the different skills. Otherwise, you're just making it harder on yourself and unnecessarily gatekeeping yourself from essential skills like being able to craft items while Topside and increases to your base Stamina.</p>



<h3 id="h-kill-arcs-make-friends-with-raiders">Kill ARCs, Make Friends with Raiders</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-2-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>You'll catch more flies with honey than vinegar. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This might not be everyone's preferred approach when starting ARC Raiders - it is, after all, a PvPvE game - but this whole guide is about what to do <strong><em>first</em></strong> when jumping into Embark's new extraction shooter, and this means taking into consideration the studio's <strong>aggression-based matchmaking</strong>. </p>



<p>Of course, you can choose not to do that. Out of the rest of this list, this is the one you can choose to ignore based on playstyle preference. The other elements are sound advice for ARC Raiders, and while I think this is also sound advice, I can understand if you're not coming to this game for the PvE. </p>



<p>The beauty of ARC Raiders isn't just that it has both PvE and PvP; it's that the community has embraced both almost as separate matchmaking queues. You can play one version of ARC Raiders for hours and then flip over to a very different version just by playing differently. It's wonderful to have both in this capacity, but the game's extraction shooter nature is what makes me express caution towards diving into PvP.</p>



<p>You don't want to find yourself in a frustrating loop of being unable to make real progress because you keep getting killed by other players. Also, the reality is that if you start off your ARC Raiders journey with a full PvP focus, then you're in for a rougher start. You just simply won't be as prepared to take down enemy Raiders, and while you can rely on your squadmates to help carry you, anyone who has played a squad-based multiplayer PvP game knows that relying on your squad, particularly if you're playing with strangers, is rarely a good strategy.</p>



<p>So spend your early hours as a PvE player. Load up your stash, craft some stronger weapons, level up and gain as much game knowledge as you want. Then go into PvP with both barrels, and you'll likely have a much better time.</p>

<p>One aspect of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> we thought was "excellent" was the music. With this in mind, it's been announced the game's soundtrack will be getting a physical release in Japan on <strong>17th April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>It will include five CDs and a total of <strong>148 tracks</strong>. The good news is this also extends to the game's DLC expansion <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension</a>, which launched at the end of last year. Along with this, it comes with a full-colour 36-page booklet, and as a purchase bonus, there's a wire key ring featuring three acrylic charms.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7nkmuhj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"This is a complete version of 148 songs, including background music found in "Pokémon LEGENDS ZA" and "Pokémon LEGENDS ZA M-Dimension Rush," as well as past songs used in the games!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no mention of a local release at this stage, but if we hear any updates (or pre-orders are made available elsewhere for local trainers), we'll share an update.</p>

<p>Following a response from AdHoc Studio</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="af43581ad9511"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af43581ad9511/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The superhero comedy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dispatch">Dispatch</a> is out on the Switch and Switch 2 this week and as we've already highlighted in our review, the 'Visual Censorship' toggle has been removed from the Nintendo versions of the game, meaning censorship is automatically activated with no option to change it.</p>
<p>We reached out to the developer AdHoc Studio <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/psa-dispatchs-visual-censorship-settings-cant-be-removed-on-switch">earlier this week</a> to ask what was up, and received the following response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AdHoc Studio:</strong> <em>"Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually. For our Switch release, we worked with Nintendo to adapt certain elements so Dispatch could be on their platform."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much">GoNintendo has got an official statement</a> about "Dispatch's censorship" after contacting Nintendo. Here's what it had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated by Nintendo here, games on its platforms must be rated and meet its established guidelines. And while it informs its partners when titles don't meet its guidelines, it "does not make changes to partner content" and also won't discuss the content or criteria used to make determinations.</p>
<p>If there are any other notable developments, statements, or sudden changes, we'll provide an update, but for now, these are the official responses each party has provided. Unsurprisingly, this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1qpxtya/i_think_dispatch_being_censored_on_switch_is/">hasn't stopped fans</a> <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/eurogamer-dispatch-on-switch-1-2-is-permanently-censored-possibly-mandated-by-nintendo.1418761/page-18#post-150688015">and gaming communities from speculating</a> about what else might be going on here. Some outlets have also shared theories that factor in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dispatch-is-censored-on-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-and-this-might-be-the-reason/">local ratings boards</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the removal of these "visual censorship" settings, Dispatch on the Switch and Switch 2 still had us hooked until the bitter end with the potential of its ever-changing arcs.

Developed by <strong>GeniGods Lab</strong>, the studio behind the mobile game <strong>My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero</strong>, it aims to bring a 'Chinese God of War' experience. The game is a single player hardcore action RPG tentatively slated for a 2027 or 2028 launch on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

<li><a href="#roundtable-interview-devs">Roundtable Interview with Devs</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="genigods-nezha-preview">GeniGods: Nezha Preview</h2>



<p>Wccftech recently participated in a remote presentation and roundtable interview with two members of the development team, Producer <strong>Yan</strong> and Art Director <strong>Erdie</strong>, who explained that Genigods Lab, while not well known in Western countries, now employs <strong>over 70 veteran developers</strong> with <strong>more than 20 years of industry experience</strong>.</p>



<p>GeniGods: Nezha is their big bet, and they chose a Genesis myth from Chinese mythology. The titular character is one of the three most famous heroes in Chinese myths, alongside Wukong and Yang Jian. The backstory is that Nüwa, the God of Creation, was dying, but before that happened, she created Nezha from clay and water and empowered Nezha, also known as the <strong>Spirit Pearl</strong>, with her heart.</p>



<p>Basically, the developers said, you are a <strong>"Chinese Kratos"</strong>. By that, they meant a tragic, rebellious teen hero whose fate was sealed before birth. Nezha's path to redemption is brutal: you'll need to skin the dragon, take your own life, and then be reborn.</p>



<p>We also learned a few narrative tidbits. After <strong>Pangu</strong>, a primordial being and a figure of creation in Chinese mythology, died, his body formed the planet. Now his soul wants resurrection, which would, however, destroy the new world. As Nezha, the first human, <strong>players must stop Pangu's return</strong>. Nezha's journey takes place across the dead body of Pangu himself, and GeniGods Lab designed each part of his form (arms, neck, head, torso) as intricate, multi-level sandbox environments.</p>



<p>Nezha won't be alone. Other mythical heroes like <strong>Yi</strong> (the sun shooter who shot down nine of the ten suns) and <strong>Yu</strong> <strong>the Great</strong> (the flood stopper) will also be featured in the game. Nezha's heart is also filled with holy water, a powerful gift from Nüwa and an important companion for solving puzzles, overcoming challenges, and exploring the world.</p>



<p>The developers then showed us a comparison chart with the X-axis labeled speed (Slow to Fast) and the Y-axis labeled genre (RPG to Action). In this chart, GeniGods: Nezha sits very near <strong>Sony Santa Monica's God of War 3</strong>. According to GeniGods Lab, its gameplay is a balance of action and strategy; a fast game, but not as fast as Phantom Blade Zero or CAPCOM's <strong>Devil May Cry</strong>. </p>



<p>Advancing through the main story requires defeating powerful bosses. The game has four pillars:</p>



<ol start="1">
<li><strong>Aerial Soaring Combat:</strong> Inspired by fighting games, combat occurs on both the ground and in the air (dual stance). Bosses have dynamic AI that analyzes player tactics in real-time. The dual stance forms a complex offensive and defensive system. On the ground, you charge power to create opportunities for aerial combos. Once you break the enemy, you knock them into the sky to perform complex combos for huge damage.</li>



<li><strong>Relic Form:</strong> Nezha obtains relics to learn superpowers from other heroes, offering multiple tactical choices to the player. Relics and special forms can be combined: for example, pairing "Hot Wheels" with a "Six-Arm Form" enables powerful ranged suppression against flying enemies.</li>



<li><strong>Fluid Mystics:</strong> Since Nüwa is a water goddess, her body can turn into water. Fluid Mystics is based on <strong>Bruce Lee</strong>'s philosophy ("Be water, my friend"). By pressing <strong>R1</strong> on the controller, Nezha activates the holy water power, enchanting skills, and giving attacks fluid, water-like visuals. Her techniques adapt the essence of <strong>Jeet Kune Do</strong>. Players can condense water into a piercing One-Inch Flash for armor-breaking blows, or unleash water all at once with a sweeping Dragon's Kick to tackle crowds of enemies at once. This system encourages players to master a reactive combat style and requires perfect timing to parry and counter.</li>



<li><strong>Narrative:</strong> This is a world of colossal beings and wonders, like the Nine Suns in the sky. climb ancient gods towering like mountains and fight by traversing the contours of their bodies. With the help of the giant Kuafu, scale the Sun Tree that bridges mortal and celestial realms, then draw your bow to extinguish the Nine Suns and end the scorching catastrophe.</li>
</ol>

<iframe title="Genigods: Nezha Trailer - Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5mZseIFDmc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nezha has three primary ways to fight in this game: martial arts (fist fighting), swords (blade fighting), and a lance (spear fighting). Throughout GeniGods: Nezha, the main character will have to face <strong>over 60 different enemy types</strong>, choosing the most appropriate weapon each time. Structurally, it is not an open world game, favoring a rather linear structure centered around hubs, albeit with plenty of side content. The studio estimates <strong>the main story will last around 24 hours</strong>, but <strong>a completionist playthrough to earn the Platinum trophy could take up to 75 hours</strong>. There are also three different endings based on how you decide to solve the impending catastrophe.</p>



<p>The game is being developed <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the <span>latest version of&nbsp;<strong>Unreal Engine</strong></span></a><span>&nbsp;(5.7, </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/ue-5-7-is-close-to-a-magic-bullet-for-performance-says-ark-developer-though-it-wont-fully-eliminate-stutters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>which brought significant</span> performance improvements</a>). The team has crafted a dynamic day-and-night weather system to control environmental hues and synchronize weather effects, such as thunder, with combat mechanics. On the physics front, they built destructible environments (buildings, trees, rocks) to visualize Nezha's destructive power. They're using Epic's <strong>Metahuman</strong> technology for facial capture and motion matching to achieve, in their own words, <strong>The Last of Us Part II</strong> levels of emotional expression. Moreover, they implemented a high-mobility "3C" system (Camera, Character, Control) to enable soaring, jumping, and combat on colossal beings, as required by the game's premise.  </p>



<p>GeniGods: Nezha <strong>will support hardware ray tracing</strong>, upscalers like <strong>NVIDIA DLSS</strong> and <strong>AMD FSR</strong>, SSD optimization for seamless loading, DualSense controller features such as haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, and 3D audio on PlayStation 5 via the console's T<strong>empest Engine</strong>.</p>



<p>Following the presentation, <strong>we were able to ask a few questions</strong> alongside colleagues from other outlets. You can read the full transcript after the image gallery.</p>

<h2 id="roundtable-interview-devs">Roundtable Interview with Devs</h2>



<p><strong>Alessio Palumbo (WCCFTECH): How long has GeniGods: Nezha been in development, and can you share the estimated budget behind it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> We started the project in 2023, so it's been nearly three years. We spent that time building engines, pipelines, and tools. The total cost is <strong>$20 million</strong>. Most is supported by our studio, but we have a major global investor helping with promotion.</p>



<p><strong>Alejandro Pascual (3D Juegos): Is the mission system straightforward and linear, or are there secondary missions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> The main story is linear, like God of War 3, focusing on fighting bosses and solving problems. After that, you reach a "Hub World" (like a city). From the Hub, you access branching missions. Each mission rewards you with Relics or Superpowers, allowing you to build your combat strategy before challenging the next boss.</p>



<p><strong>Fran G. Matas (Vandal): Why is this type of Action RPG so popular in China right now, after Black Myth: Wukong and Phantom Blade Zero?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Erdie:</strong> Chinese games are getting popular because they offer a new experience. Western and Japanese cultures are familiar, but China has 5,000 years of history and myths that haven't been used much. Unlike boring games that reuse old ideas, we bring fresh stories and aesthetics. <strong>Our plan is to spend 10 years exploring Chinese creation myths</strong>. We plan to make a trilogy of "Genot" games to show something deep, not just surface-level culture.</p>



<p><strong>Giovanni Panzano (Everyeye): Can you tell us about the progression system? Skill tree? Equipment?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> We combine Relics, Equipment, and Skills. A "Skill" is a combination of a Relic and a Superpower. When you press R1, you enhance your power using the "Heart of Water." It is similar to a skill tree but structured differently; we will show more of this next time.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio Palumbo (WCCFTECH): You mentioned three different endings. How does the player reach them? Choices?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Erdie:</strong> Since the world is dying, <strong>people have built three different "Schools" of thought on how to save it</strong>. Nezha must choose which way is right. Based on your options, you get different powers, different fighting modes, and unlock unique levels. Each direction leads to a totally different ending. It is a bit like the "Word Tendency" in Demon's Souls.</p>



<p><strong>Alejandro Pascual (3D Juegos): Have you been in touch with other Chinese creators, such as Phantom Blade Zero or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>, to avoid overlapping themes?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> Yes, we are good friends with the Phantom Blade Zero team; we are both in Beijing. Black Myth: Wukong is a "superhero" boss rush game. Phantom Blade Zero focuses on Chinese swordsmanship and weaponry. Our game is rooted in the <strong>Genesis Myth</strong>: the story of creation, the first human, and the source of power. You fight colossal beings. Our gameplay focuses on collecting Relics to change your form (e.g., wearing wings vs. using fans). We are very distinct games.</p>



<p><strong>Fran G. Matas (Vandal): Is there any endgame content?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> Yes. Because there are three schools, when you reopen the game (New Game+), you can choose to collect goods from another school. On the third playthrough, you collect the final set. When you collect all of them, you become the "Premier" and truly finish the game.</p>



<p><strong>Giovanni Panzano (Everyeye): Can you beat the bosses in any order?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> In the Hub World, you need to collect five stones (keys) to open the end doors; you can choose your own order. Each boss has specific weaknesses and superpowers, so you can strategize which one to tackle first based on your build.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio Palumbo (WCCFTECH): How does side content work? Are there any personal missions or just boss fights?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Erdie:</strong> We have linear level design for the main story to keep it focused. Once you unlock a Hub World, you can access different areas with new enemies and Relics. There are myth-related Relics linked to side quests and player choices. This gives players freedom to explore without losing the narrative thread. All bosses are based on old Chinese gods and monsters; we care more about making them meaningful than just having a high number of them.</p>



<p><strong>Fran G. Matas (Vandal): How is Sony supporting this game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> Sony published our last mobile game (My Hero Academia) and helped us reach 10 million downloads. They introduced us to SIE China. We are discussing deep cooperation.</p>



<p><strong>Alejandro Pascual (3D Juegos): Are there difficulty levels?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> We want all users to be able to play. We have a "Modern Mode" (like Street Fighter 6) where pressing R1 + other buttons executes complex combos easily. For pro players, they can control everything manually. We will also add a harder difficulty mode upon release.</p>



<p><strong>Giovanni Panzano (Everyeye): Is there customization?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Erdie:</strong> Yes. The main character will have more than 20 different costumes. Some are based on legendary Chinese heroes; Nezha can "cosplay" as them, giving her a totally different look.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio Palumbo (WCCFTECH): Are you using AI tools? It's one of the big topics in the industry.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Erdie:</strong> We believe creativity comes from people. We use AI tools only to help artists generate ideas or reference materials faster and to do the boring, repetitive jobs. The final call and the assets in the game are all human-made. We use AI to improve creation, not replace it.</p>



<p><strong>Alejandro Pascual (3D Juegos): Is there a ranking system for combos?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Erdie:</strong> The enemies are smart. To make a real combo, you have to break the enemy's "Magic Bar" (a blue bar seen in the trailer). Breaking it knocks them into the sky or stuns them, allowing you to deal huge damage. It's not just a score; it's a mechanic to open up damage windows.</p>



<p><strong>Fran G. Matas (Vandal): How do you balance visual spectacle with gameplay clarity?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> We prioritize clarity. We use "Red Color Power" flashes to signal powerful enemy attacks, telling users exactly when to dodge or counter. We design effects to be flashy but clear, ensuring the visuals don't obscure the gameplay cues.</p>



<p><strong>Giovanni Panzano (Everyeye): Will the PS5 Pro version have multiple graphics modes? 60 FPS?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> Yes, we can play at 60 FPS. </p>



<p><strong>Giovanni Panzano (Everyeye): Is that only for Pro or the base PS5 too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> We propose to make the base PS5 version run at 60 FPS as well. We already have a version for SIE China running on the base PS5.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,297 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,386 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4346690/Genigods_Nezha/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/genigods-nezha-95a016" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>. It will launch in 2028. <span id="more-1022593"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Genigods Lab:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Genigods: Nezha</em> is a hardcore <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,948 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action role-playing game</a> set against the chaotic backdrop of ancient Chinese genesis mythology. You take on the role of the Spirit Pearl—the first life forged by Nuwa, the Goddess of Life, from earth, water and fire—who is reincarnated as Nezha. Immerse yourself in iconic tales of Chinese genesis mythology, battle against Colossal Gods, and master the one-of-a-kind combat of Chinese-style celestial showdowns.</p><p><strong>A World in Ruins, A Hero’s Call</strong></p><p>Pangu, the Genesis God, succumbed to an eternal slumber, plunging the realm into utter chaos: Ten suns sear the land, birthing a <a title="Companies > crim [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>son desert. Gods wage ceaseless wars that rend the sky asunder. With celestial pillars collapsed, ferocious monsters ascend from the abyss.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Nuwa gifts you the “Heart of the Spirit Pearl”—a heart infused with divine water that is both your constant companion and the wellspring of your power.</p><p>Your destiny is forged by three titanic quests: MEND the shattered sky with the Five-Colored Stones, UNCOVER the truth of your own origin, and DESCEND into the Abyss of Return to SEAL the spacetime rifts devouring the world.</p><p><strong>Celestial Combat: Dual Stances, Fluidmystic, Relic-Fusion</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Experience [213 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the dynamic scale of Chinese mythic warfare, where battle flows seamlessly between heaven and earth:</p><ul><li><strong>Dual Stances</strong> – Switch seamlessly between ground and aerial combat. Wield Nezha’s iconic Fire-Tipped Spear for close-quarters combos and parries on land; take to the skies with Wind Fire Wheels for high-speed raids and aerial combos.</li><li><strong>Fluidmystic</strong> – Tap into the Spirit Pearl’s heart to awaken fleeting mythic abilities, like the Wind Fire Wheels’ devastating mid-air strike. Focus its power to imbue your weapons with sacred water, triggering potent EX effects.</li><li><strong>Relic: Fusion</strong> – Pair mythic treasures for unique skills: combine Hou Yi’s Bow with Three Heads and Six Arms for Rainbow-Piercing-the-Sun Archery, or match the Palm Leaf Fan with water prisons to trap and disable foes.</li></ul><p><strong>Colossal Gods and the Sun Tree</strong></p><p>Built with Unreal Engine 5 and optimized for PlayStation, the game delivers a one-of-a-kind Chinese-style colossal adventure: climb ancient gods towering like mountains and fight by leveraging the contours of their bodies. With the help of the giant Kuafu, scale the the Sun Tree that bridges mortal and celestial realms, then draw your bow to shoot down nine suns and end the scorching catastrophe.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1022599"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Water Philosophy and Jeet Kune Do Mechanics</strong></p><p>The combat embodies Bruce Lee’s “Be Water” philosophy through the Divine Water within Nezha (the Spirit Pearl). Channel this flowing power, focusing it into your body or artifacts to surge your combat prowess. His techniques adapt the essence of Jeet Kune Do: condense water into a piercing One-Inch Flash for armor-breaking blows, or unleash it as a sweeping Dragon’s Kick for fluid crowd control. This system allows you to master a defensive, reactive style—parrying and countering with the adaptable precision of water itself.</p><p><strong>From Legend to Legacy</strong></p><p>We have not just admired Nezha—China’s iconic rebel—but have been haunted by him. Haunted by his tales, by the faded murals of Nuwa mending the sky and Hou Yi shooting down the suns. They were untouchable legends, sealed in ancient texts.</p><p>No longer.</p><p>In <em>Genigods: Nezha</em>, you do not watch the myth. You live it. You wield the heart of creation, soar between realms, awaken the three-headed, eight-armed form, and step onto the primordial battlefield to mend the shattered heavens. This is not about hearing a story; it is about etching your name into its very fabric.</p><p>Our mission is to ignite the epic celestial battles of Chinese mythology. Here, every skill you cast, every choice you make, writes a new line in an ancient epic—forged in your image.</p><p>We invite you to feel the divine fury, master the flowing combat, and claim your place in the myth. The legend awaits its newest author.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

As much as fans appreciated this early play test, it's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/yakuza-fan-concerns-come-to-a-head-over-dodgy-kiwami-3-graphics">also drawn some criticism</a>.</p>
<p>Some players had been highlighting "graphical issues" and other problems and in response to this, RGG has now <a href="https://x.com/RGGStudio/status/2017040175180796074">shared an official message</a> on social media, mentioning how the "graphical quality" and other issues in the demo are not representative of the "final experience", with a patch to be made available at launch. Here's the message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have heard concerns from players regarding graphical issues and other problems present in the downloadable demo for Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties.</p>
<p>Rest assured the graphical quality of the demo does not represent the final experience. We plan to have a v1.11 patch available at launch which will address the lighting issue and other quality concerns in the full game.</p>
<p>One specific example is the visual and lighting issues around the Kubochi River area in the Downtown Ryukyu area, which many of you have already pointed out.</p>
<p>This patch will include not just fixes for the issues identified above, but many other improvements. We look forward to sharing the final version of Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties with our global audience on February 12th.</p>
<p>We appreciate your continued support of the Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza series.</p>
<p>RGG Studio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, the Version 1.11 patch will also include "many other improvements" although details about what exactly can be expected have not been revealed just yet. The rollout of this patch will also vary by platform. If you haven't already tried out this demo, it gives you access to both Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties.
