            <p>
Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shut down servers for its open-world racer The Crew</a> came as a blow to the game's community. But, rather than remaining defeated by this news, a group of dedicated modders decided to take matters into their own hands - and began recreating the server-side software necessary to play The Crew online once again. </p>
<p>
This fan-lead project, codenamed The Crew Revival (at least for now), currently has five members working on it. "We started pretty much as soon as Ubisoft announced the shutdown last December," team member whammy4 told Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>"It's still the same game that everyone played before, except instead of connecting to Ubisoft's central server, they will connect to ours (or a local server running on their computers if they choose to play offline)," he explained.

<p>
While whammy4 knows that many online-only games have been shut down over the years, he believes The Crew stands out for "several reasons" as being worthy of saving. Most importantly? "It can be, and often is, played solo on your own", whammy 4 said, meaning Ubisoft "artificially enforced constant online connectivity constraints" on its players. </p>
<p>"As we know, [this] resulted in this AAA full price game being completely inaccessible for the 12+ million players who own(ed) the game."</p>
<p>
Whammy4 called Ubisoft's decision to shut down The Crew's servers "completely unacceptable", adding this type of action from developers and publishers "seems to be an alarmingly rising trend" in the video game industry. In addition to shutting down servers, Ubisoft also reportedly started <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">removing the game from owners' libraries</a> and revoking their user licence in the process back in April.
</p>
<p>
"If the trend continues, in a decade we'll have tons of unplayable, dead video games that people once loved and played, which is why video game preservation is extremely important, before the situation spins out of control," whammy4 continued.

<p>
This project is evidently incredibly important to the entire Crew Revival team, with whammy4 calling the original game a "unique" experience. 
</p>
<p>
"It is the only video game, even to this day, to allow the player to cruise along an open world, contiguous, scaled down yet still huge USA. To give up on such a remarkable video game would be a crime," he said. 
</p>
<p>
Whammy4 does not yet know exactly when The Crew Revival's servers will be available to the public, although he said the team hopes to have everything ready before The Crew's 10th anniversary, which is this December. When it is all sorted, however, it will be free. 
</p>
<p>
"The reception [to The Crew Revival] from people who are both familiar and unfamiliar with the game has been greatly positive, as they are happy to see the game be revived, and be preserved, like all games deserve to be," whammy4 said, telling me he believes there are "one or more" of Ubisoft's Ivory Tower developers in the revival's Discord server. 
</p>
<p>"I think Ubisoft heard enough criticisms from their customers [following the server shut down], but I have one thing to say to The Crew's community: they should absolutely not let Ubisoft keep getting away with such horrendous practices, otherwise it will just keep happening to more and more games, including The Crew's sequels, and history will just keep repeating itself," he closed. "People must not forget."</p>
<p>To stay up to date on how whammy4 and the rest of the team are getting on with The Crew's preservation project, you can <a href="https://discord.com/invite/gUczTkphGE">join the revival's Discord server here</a>. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crew-review">Eurogamer's own review for The Crew</a>, Outside Xbox's racing aficionado Mike Channel came away impressed. "It's a game that requires and occasionally enforces patience, but like all great road trips it's about the journey, not the destination," he wrote.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Hades 2</a>'s third early access patch is of the gargantuan variety. It improves Olympian Boons, adds lots of new UI icons, reworking Keepsakes, and basically touches every aspect of the game you could possibly think of. One thing it doesn't change is how sexy the gods are, but because they're so sexy anyway, I don't think that's an issue moving forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Right at the top of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/6085006571972858968">patch notes</a> there's mention of a few topline changes everyone will appreciate. Namely, many Duo Boons and Legendary Boons being offered more frequently, increases to the minimum number of Boons you'll find past Erebus, and a tweak to your Gathering Tool that grants you +1 Elemental Essence.</p>
<p>At the Altar Of Ashes a host of Grasp costs and their positions have been moved, meaning you might need to reset your Arcana loadout once you've booted up the game. As for Keepsake changes, I'm into the Silken Sash no longer meaning you lose your armour if you switch to a different keepsake. And that Olympian Keepsakes mean their respective Olympian Boons will appear more frequently, allowing for a lovely bit of synergy.</p>
<p>The Boons change log is monstrous, but there's quite a few that have been cut or are entirely new additions. Many Hexes Of Selene have also seen blanket buffs in the mana-spend department, meaning they won't hog your blue bar quite so relentlessly.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there are loads of major and minor bug fixes, UI tweaks, and plenty more little bits and pieces. Supergiant say that now this patch is done, they'll focus on the first "Major Update" for sometime later this year.</p>
<p>Thanks to lots of other good video games coming out this year, I've not spent as much time as I'd like with Hades 2. But I do think it's been a fantastic investment, in the sense that it's practically transforming into a totally different game with these colossal patches. Do I hold off until it's out of early access? Maybe? Maybe I'll spend some time with some of the other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">best roguelikes</a> on our list, not that I need anymore suffering in my gaming life right now. Cheers Elden Ring.</p>

			<p>Earlier today, a new CAPCOM Next event was <a href="https://x.com/CapcomUSA_/status/1806137312830800334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> by the Japanese publisher. The broadcast will go live on all main platforms (YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, Facebook) on Monday, July 1, 2024, at 3 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>The studio clarified a few things in advance: this CAPCOM Next broadcast will last around 25 minutes and will not include any news about <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-summer-game-fest-impressions-surviving-the-dangerous-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. It will focus instead on three specific games: the newly unveiled Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard for iPhone/iPad/Mac.</p>
<p>The first game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> yesterday with a surprise teaser. As shown in the pictures below, it is getting a substantial visual facelift. Other than that, we'll have to wait for the broadcast to learn more details about the remaster.</p>

        <p>Thousands could be affected at the company's offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Chinese company Perfect World has reportedly laid off thousands of employees.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/perfect-world-cuts-staff-in-multi-unit-layoffs-reportedly-suspends-game-projects">Game Developer</a> (translating a report from Chinese publication <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_27838848">The Paper</a>), the firm has made extensive cuts across its offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu.</p>
<p>Most departments were reportedly impacted, apart from its esports segment.</p>
<p>Concerning its games currently in development, conflicting reports have emerged: The Paper said both One-Punch Man: World and Perfect New World are still being developed, while <a href="https://pandaily.com/perfect-world-lays-off-over-a-thousand-employees/">Pandaily</a> reported that they've been "suspended."</p>
<p>Perfect World is known for being a developer and publisher, as well as the exclusive distributor of Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2 in China. It has a film production company as well.</p>
<p>Several publications have reported that it had recently experienced a sharp decline in revenue, as per its annual financial report, with net profit dropping 64% year-on-year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-group-acquires-perfect-world-entertainment-digic">Perfect World sold the publishing branch of its European subsidiary to Embracer in December 2021</a>, which was then <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/perfect-world-entertainment-rebrands-to-gearbox-publishing">renamed to Gearbox Publishing in April 2022</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-embracer-layoffs-also-affect-gearbox-publishing">firm was hit by layoffs last year,</a> alongside many other Embracer studios, and its San Francisco office was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gearbox-publishing-is-now-arc-games">renamed again in April 2024, to Arc Games</a>.</p>

        <p>Developer set to unionise with the CWA, is the second ZeniMax studio to form a union</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Bethesda Game Studios Montreal has filed to unionise with the Communications Workers of America.</p>
<p>The BGS Montreal union announced yesterday in a thread on <a href="https://x.com/OneBGS_MTL/status/1806001296593346639">social media</a> that they filed for certification with the Quebec Labour Board.</p>
<p>"As a union, we will strive to make BGS a supportive workplace that fosters creativity and talent," it wrote. "This will allow us to keep creating some of the best video games in the industry in the jobs and studios we all love.</p>
<p>"Having a seat at the table will ensure job security as well as improve transparency, accountability, flexibility, and more. We aim to make sure everyone receives fair compensation for their work and the value they provide."</p>
<p>BGS Montreal is the second ZeniMax studio to unionise. In January 2023, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zenimax-qa-workers-form-union">ZeniMax QA workers formed ZeniMax Workers United</a>, with a majority of 300 employees across ZeniMax's US operations voting in favour of unionisation.</p>
<p>Last month, the CWA announced that all ZeniMax studio workers were covered by Microsoft's labour neutrality agreement, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-and-cwa-enter-labor-neutrality-agreement">which both parties entered in 2022</a>, meaning the firm is legally bound to take a neutral stance on unionisation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When you name your controller after Doom’s most devastating weapon, you’re making a clear statement about just how powerful you think it is. With the Victrix Pro BFG, that initial statement is backed up by one of the most versatile and impressive controller packages in recent years.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Victrix Pro BFG Wireless Controller" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Unhp5o8ALoQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Victrix Pro BFG is a wireless modular controller for PS5, PS4 and PC, our review unit decked out in PS5-centric white, with a proprietary USB dongle for connections. There’s also a black Xbox-flavoured version if that’s more your thing. Alongside the wireless option, there’s a 3-metre-long USB-C braided cable, to give the reassurance of a wired connection and reduce latency as much as possible, but that’s not all that you’ll find tucked away in the box.</p>


<p>This is where the Victrix Pro BFG’s package really starts to impress, and that’s before you’ve even tried playing a game with it. There’s a sturdy, hard-shell carry case, boasting the same white and purple colour scheme as the controller. Within it, there’s everything you could need to customise the Pro BFG to exactly how you like it, or exactly what a particular game needs.</p>
<p>This is a modular controller, much like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap</a> series, and what that means is that you can swap around some of the components to suit your tastes. The left-hand module can be unscrewed – a nifty little screwdriver is included – so you can have either symmetrical or asymmetrical analogue sticks. If you’re a former Xbox player who now dabbles in the PlayStation side of things, you can at make your controller layout feel “right”, to go with the rather Xbox-like form it takes.</p>


<p>Alongside that, the right-hand module can be swapped out entirely, and there’s a fightpad – a six-button microswitch setup that ditches the analogue stick – that you can slot into place, and is ideal if you’re trying to perfect your combos in Street Fighter 6 or Tekken 8. Personally, this is a game-changer, and while it takes a few moments to swap, it’s well worth it for the huge advantage it’ll give you if you prefer playing fighting games with a pad rather than a stick. If you like an arcade stick, you should definitely check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/18/pdp-victrix-pro-fs-best-arcade-fight-stick-ps5-review/">Victrix’ own Pro FS stick</a>, incidentally.</p>
<p>While you’re swapping out or switching around your buttons, you can alter the analogue sticks themselves, and there’s a choice of a tall, hyper-accurate stick or a standard-length one with a PS3-style rounded head, alongside the two standard dimpled ones. There’s only one of these domed sticks, so you can’t completely mimic the old-school Dualshock 3, but it’s great to have this level of customisation. I found using the taller stick made my Overwatch 2 accuracy much greater, though it took some getting used to before I settled in.</p>
<p>In addition to that, there’s a choice of different gate types too, which are the sections that sit around the analogue stick. Current pads have circular gates, but octagonal gates can be really useful for some fighting games and other genres that would benefit from the more definite input – also N64 and GameCube emulators. It’s a shame that these aren’t using Hall Effect sensors, but Victrix are seemingly all set to release replacement Hall Effect modules in the coming months, and they are a step cheaper than some of their rivals.</p>
<p>You can also change the D-pad, and there’s a standard cross style, a circular version with a raised cross, and then Victrix’s own diamond-shaped offering. I’ve always preferred the old-school cross, but depending on what you’re playing you might want to swap it on a game-by-game basis. This is a pad that you can truly make your own, and while it can feel a little like Frankenstein’s monster – especially with the two analogue sticks changed out and a different gate in there – I genuinely can’t fault the options that Victrix have given us.</p>

<p>The Victrix Pro BFG weighs in at 271g – lighter than Victrix’ own claims – which is 13g lighter than the DualSense, and a whole 20g lighter than the standard Xbox Series X controller. There may be a few grams to be added with different sticks and gates, but our set up it was lighter and also better balanced than its standard rivals. This meant that even during the longest, sweatiest Overwatch 2 sessions – I do play other games, I promise – I never felt any fatigue thanks to my controller, just my occasionally terrible play.</p>
<p>The Victrix Pro BFG looks sleek and futuristic, but it’s also pleasingly understated. Its pure white plastic construction is interspersed with purple highlights, and large texturised grips sit comfortably beneath your palms, while a lighter texture wraps around each arm. It’s not shifting in your hands, that’s for certain, and thanks to a much improved battery life compared to the DualSense – up to 20 hours versus 8-12 – you won’t have to.</p>
<p>From there, it’s a bevy of inputs, and while you’ll find everything you’d expect on the face of the controller, there’s also a cavalcade of extra inputs and controls hidden away around the back. There’s a tiny platform selector, which is a little fiddly, but also small and precise enough that there’s no chance you’re going to catch it mid-game. You’ve then got four programmable buttons that nestle beneath your fingers, and I found these to be the most comfortable and well-placed rear buttons I’ve come across. They’re just right there, which… is kind of the point.</p>
<p>You can then control the range of each analogue trigger, and the spring-loaded selector is easy enough to figure out, holding them as you push the trigger as far as you want it to go, before then releasing them. Alternatively, you can set them with a hair-trigger so you barely have to press them – the perfect thing for lining up an instant headshot. I found that when I started using the controller, I kept undoing the settings for my triggers, somehow catching the release mechanism, but after a short amount of time, it just stopped happening. Thankfully.</p>

<p>If the level of customisation that Victrix have placed in your palms isn’t quite enough, they’ve gone even further with the Victrix Control Hub, a PC-based (or Xbox-based) app that lets you update the controller firmware, tinker with the stick and trigger deadzones, and choose from three different EQ settings for the wired audio connection. The biggest problem? The app isn’t on mobile or native to PlayStation itself, meaning that you’ll need a PC to finetune your experience. It’s a wrinkle in an otherwise flawless package.</p>
<p>There’s clearly some serious competition out there for pro controllers, and with the Victrix sitting around £170 it’s right in the centre of that conversation. It’s cheaper than the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/23/dualsense-edge-review-is-sonys-first-ps5-pro-controller-essential-for-gamers/">Dualsense Edge</a> and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/07/nacon-revolution-5-pro-controller-review-ps5/">Nacon Revolution 5 Pro</a>, and boasts wireless where the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap</a> does not – we’re considering the Xbox variants, as Thrustmaster’s eSwap doesn’t have a PS5 native controller yet. It has more customisation options than all three, barring the Thrustmaster’s tiny driving wheel, and the only clear downsides are the lack of haptic rumble, and the inability to start your console up via the PlayStation button on the pad. Sony reserve such things for their own controllers, and that’s as frustrating here as it has been elsewhere.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/defunct-xbox-cloud-console-keystone-shows-up-in-patent-filing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-rumored 'Keystone' Xbox cloud console has been spotted <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-xbox-that-never-was-our-first-detailed-look-at-the-keystone-cloud-streaming-console-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Windows Central</a> in a patent filing <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/D1009161" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> in the United States.&nbsp;The Xbox Keystone project was set aside over two years ago. At the time, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-device-keystone-needs-more-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>We have made the decision to pivot away from the current iteration of the Keystone device. We will take our learnings and refocus our efforts on a new approach that will allow us to deliver Xbox Cloud Gaming to more players around the world in the future.</em></p>
<p>A few months later, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-keystone-streaming-box-shelved-price-99-to-129-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to the subject</a>, revealing that the pricing was the main issue.</p>
<p><em>The console we built that now people have seen, Keystone, was more expensive than we wanted it to be when we actually built it out with the hardware that we had inside.</em></p>
<p><em>With Keystone, we’re still focused on it and when can we get the right costs, but when you’ve got Series S at $299, and like during the holidays you’ll see some price promotion, you’ll obviously have Series X higher, I think in order for a streaming-only box to make sense, the price delta to S has to be pretty significant. I want to be able to include a controller in it when we go do that.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t want to announce pricing specifically, but I think you’ve got to be $129, $99, like somewhere in there for that to make sense in my view, that we just weren’t there. We weren’t there with the controller. And I love the effort. It worked really, really well.</em></p>
<p>It sounded like Spencer was really into the vision. Chances are Microsoft is still working on a way to lower costs to get the price where it needs to be, thus resurrecting Keystone (or a new version of it, anyway). Meanwhile, Xbox Cloud Gaming for owned games is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-for-owned-games-is-coming-this-year-says-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to launch later this year</a>, and last month, mouse and keyboard support was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-rolls-out-mouse-and-keyboard-support-for-26-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled out</a> for 26 games.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-clip-recording/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> around a month ago by the creator of SteamDB, Valve has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Steam Game Recording beta. It's a powerful set of tools that will allow users to record, replay, clip, and share footage from their games.</p>
<div>
<p><em><strong>RECORD - Never miss a moment</strong></em></p>
<p><em>With Background Recording mode, your gameplay is continuously saved to your preferred drive, never exceeding your specified duration and storage limits. An&nbsp; On-Demand Recording mode with manual start and stop is also available. Use the&nbsp; Steam Timeline and&nbsp; Event Markers to find key moments.</em></p>
</div>

<p><strong><em>REPLAY - Quickly jump back in time</em></strong></p>
<div>
<p><em>Useful for things like seeing what went wrong when your hero died or recalling something mentioned by an NPC earlier. Accessible in the Steam Overlay for every game.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>CLIP - Find and keep the good stuff</em></strong><br>
<em>Keep only the video that matters to you. Steam offers lightweight tools to make it easy to find and clip your gameplay footage. Share and edit local footage in the redesigned Recordings &amp; Screenshots interface.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>SHARE - Conveniently send clips</em></strong><br>
<em>Get your videos where you want them. One-click share to a friend in chat or post your finest moments for the world to see. Plus, easily send footage from your Steam Deck to your PC or mobile device. Use the new Save/Share menu during or after play.</em></p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video id="video-1527268-1" width="1280" height="720" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Feature-1.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Feature-1.mp4">https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Feature-1.mp4</a></video></p>
<p>Valve also explained that the Steam Timeline appears whenever you’re actively recording. Timeline-enhanced games generate event markers as relevant game events happen, though for the Steam Game Recording Beta, only Valve's own Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2 are supported. That said, developers will be able to leverage <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/timeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an SDK and API</a> to implement the feature. Steam achievements and screenshots automatically create markers, and players can create their own markers, too.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that Steam Game Recording, unlike NVIDIA's Shadowplay, does not offer the option to record the desktop or other programs. That said, you may include audio from other programs, such as Discord. To join the beta, you must go to Steam, Settings, Interface, Beta Participation, and select one of the two available options. Then, you'll need to go to Settings, Game Recording, and pick either Background or On-Demand Recording.</p>
<p>You'll find your recordings in the folders in View &gt; Recordings &amp; Screenshots when using the Steam desktop client. From your Steam Deck, select the Media tab from the main menu. Keep in mind that you can choose where your recordings are stored on your hard drive from Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Game Recording.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Steam Game Recording feature takes advantage of NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards to minimize the performance hit when recording. However, Intel users are seemingly out of luck, as Valve said systems without NVIDIA/AMD GPUs would have to fall back to the CPU, causing a much larger performance hit.</p>

			<p>Capcom has rolled out a new Dragon's Dogma 2 update across all platforms, adding new graphical modes on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/topics/update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new patch</a> for the hit title is available now and, aside from the above-mentioned new graphical modes on consoles, it includes adjustments and additions to the storage as well as plenty of fixes. On PS5 and Xbox Series consoles, this new update also comes with a new 120Hz option, which can either be en- or disabled. In addition, the patch aims to address issues around CPU overload on certain occasions. We highly suggest reading the <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/topics/update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full release notes here</a>. We've included a photo of the notes down below as well:</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dragon_s-dogma-2-update.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is available worldwide now for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.&nbsp; The game was released back in March of this year, and as covered last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-breaks-3-million-units-sold-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 3 million copies of the game have been sold since launch</a>. Here's what we wrote about the long-overdue sequel to 2012's Dragon's Dogma in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a>:</p>
<p><em>"The most unlikely locations may hide the greatest treasures, rewarding players after a long and arduous trip. While this is no Soulslike game (which is a massive bonus in my book), the relatively limited fast travel means you'll often have to brave the roads for a long while to reach your objective. Also, the more you fight monsters, the more you accumulate the so-called loss gauge. This meter progressively reduces the maximum health you can recover with consumables or magic abilities, and it can only be restored while resting at an inn or campsite. The latter will be your only option for resting in the wilderness, provided there is a nearby campsite to begin with. If not, you'll be forced to go ahead and deal with the reduced health as best as possible.</em></p>
<p><em>The other major strength of Dragon's Dogma 2 lies, once again like its predecessor, with the combat system. First and foremost, it feels great and extremely fun to play, thanks to a praise-worthy combination of animation, sound, and spell effects. The abilities of each Vocation also provide an excellent sense of class identity, allowing for many different playstyles."</em></p>

Read on for the details.</p><h2>Preorder The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h2><div id="202464" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/eBJr1" target="_blank">Get it at Best Buy</a> - $59.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/KJwpB" target="_blank">See it at GameStop</a> - $59.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Od6nB" target="_blank">Get it at Nintendo eShop (digital)</a> - $59.99</li></ul><p>There are no special editions of the game, so the standard one is the one to get. And if you're waiting on it to go up for preorder at Amazon, you may be waiting a while. Recent Switch games have only become available at launch – not for preorder.</p><h2>What Is The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom?</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Echoes of Wisdom is the first mainline Zelda game to star Princess Zelda, which is pretty cool. Fans have been asking for that literally for decades, so it’s nice to see Nintendo finally listen. It also uses the same almost claymation-looking art style as the remake of Link’s Awakening. It looks great.</p><p>As the game kicks off, purple rifts start opening in Hyrule and swallowing people up. Link gets sucked in, but Zelda escapes. So it’s up to her to save the kingdom (because apparently her military can’t do it for her while she runs the realm? I don’t really understand how the details hash out).</p><p>The standout gameplay feature is the use of echoes. Zelda has something called a Tri wand, which lets her summon items and enemies she’s encountered previously. She can use these summoned echoes to fend off other enemies and to solve puzzles and to access previously out-of-reach areas. It looks like it will require players to be creative, which was also a big part of Tears of the Kingdom. It’s cool to see that kind of creative puzzle solving come to a 2D-style Zelda game.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/where-to-preorder-nintendo-switch-hyrule-edition-uk-1719318569585.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In addition to the new Zelda game, Nintendo is releasing a stylish new edition of the portable-only Nintendo Switch Lite console. <strong>It's not available to preorder yet in the US, </strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-where-to-preorder-uk"><strong>though it is in the UK</strong></a><strong> (and it ships to the US)</strong>. The casing is gold, with black buttons and sticks. It has a tiny Triforce symbol under the right stick. The back of the device sports a big version of the winged Triforce Zelda symbol thingy. It looks great.</p><p>It also comes with a free 12-month individual subscription to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. That lets you play a whole bunch of classic games from Game Boy, NES, Sega Genesis, SNES, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy Advance. You also get free access to massive expansions to games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing, and Splatoon 2.</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-is-up-for-preorder-out-september-6">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-release-date-editions">College Football 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-ps5-pc-release-date-preorder-bonus">Concord Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preorder">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">Madden NFL 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-release-date-deluxe-edition">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-release-date-preorder">Super Mario Party Jamboree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

The series has come a long way since then, so long (and with so many entries) that they stopped numbering the new installments after the 10 one, which came out on the Wii U. And that’s just the console entries — there were even more on Nintendo’s handhelds throughout the years.</p><p>Jamboree is the third Mario Party game on the Switch, and it’s the biggest one yet. Announced during the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, it takes place on an island resort. It has seven boards, including new ones like a racetrack-themed one called Roll ‘em Raceway and a shopping mall one called Rainbow Galleria. It also has a few favorite boards from previous games. With over 110 minigames, it’s the biggest Mario Party game yet. It has a number of play modes, including a 20-player online Koopathlon, which has you duke it out for a high score against more players than ever before in the series.</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-is-up-for-preorder-out-september-6">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-release-date-editions">College Football 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-ps5-pc-release-date-preorder-bonus">Concord Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preorder">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">Madden NFL 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-release-date-deluxe-edition">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-release-date-preorder">Super Mario Party Jamboree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

And if you're waiting for it to appear on Amazon, I have some bad news for you: Nintendo Switch games haven't been going up for preorder on Amazon for a while.

You’ll explore new lands with a variety of environments, like a rainforest and a populated city. But like its predecessors, the turn-based combat requires lots of real-time inputs. You can also have the dynamic duo team up during combat to pull off Bros. Attacks, and to overcome obstacles in the over-world using Bros Moves. It looks like a lot of fun.</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-is-up-for-preorder-out-september-6">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-release-date-editions">College Football 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-ps5-pc-release-date-preorder-bonus">Concord Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preorder">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">Madden NFL 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-release-date-deluxe-edition">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-release-date-preorder">Super Mario Party Jamboree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Country Returns is, er, returning once again with a new, refreshed HD port on the Nintendo Switch. Donkey Kong Country Returns originally released on Wii in 2010 and was then ported to Nintendo 3DS in 2013. Now, over a decade later, DK and Diddy are swinging back into action with remastered graphics and everything offered in both previous versions of the side-scrolling platformer. <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1846242598777135010%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdonkey-kong-country-returns-hd-preorder-nintendo-switch%2F1100-6524388%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is available to preorder now</a></strong> ahead of its January 16, 2025 release date.</p><p dir="ltr">Essentially presented as the "definitive" edition of the wonderful platformer, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD will offer the original challenge of the Wii version while also giving players the option to play with the friendlier 3DS settings. It also contains all of the extra levels from the 3DS version. Players can take on the 80-level, nine-world gauntlet as Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong in either solo or two-player co-op modes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Bonuses</h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo rarely offers preorder bonus for its first-party titles, and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is no different. However, if something is announced, we'll be sure to update.</p><p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a great opportunity for fans to revisit the 2D platformer with sharper visuals and new controls, or for newcomers to try out for the first time. However, don't skip out on Donkey Kong Country Returns: Tropical Freeze HD either. Both games rank among the best 2D platformers ever made, and Tropical Freeze HD is a great way to pass the time while waiting for the new release.

Nothing has been announced on that front just yet, but we'll update this preorder guide if and when we hear more.</p><p>Super Mario Party Jamboree looks to be a nice step forward for the iconic series, offering more mini-games, five new maps, and a handful of returning maps from previous entries. Along with the traditional Mario Party experience of racing around a board and battling against friends, you can now jump online to challenge 19 other players in the new Koopathlon mode.</p><p>It sounds like there are even more new modes players will get to explore--but Nintendo is keeping them under wraps. Expect to hear more about Super Mario Party Jamboree as we get closer to its release on October 17.</p><p>Plenty of other games were highlighted during the latest Nintendo Direct, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524359/" data-ref-id="1100-6524359">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-and-luigi-brothership-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524356/" data-ref-id="1100-6524356">Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-comes-to-nintendo-switch-in-january/1100-6517717/" data-ref-id="1100-6517717">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>.

Brothership marks not only return of the Mario Bros. role-playing series, it's also the first entry in the series for a home console--though you could play it entirely on a portable device, of course.</p><h2>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>No preorder bonuses have been announced for Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, though that could change in the coming weeks and months. Nintendo games rarely have official bonuses, but major retailers often offer exclusive collectibles while supplies last.</p><p>Aside from two 3DS remakes, the last entirely new entry in the Mario &amp; Luigi series, Paper Jam, arrived in 2015. That means fans have waited nearly 10 years for more turn-based, platforming action--and Brothership's reveal trailer makes it clear that Nintendo is embracing the legacy of the Mario &amp; Luigi RPG series. It has cool graphics that retain the aesthetic and perspective of previous entries, a turn-based combat system with Action Commands (timing-based maneuvers) and new Bros. Attacks, and an emphasis on platforming and puzzles outside of battles.</p><p>We also met a few new characters, including the Extension Corps, Snoutlet, and Connie. Of course, Bowser also makes an appearance, though aside from guiding Mario and Luigi across a series of unique islands, it's unclear how the story will unravel. Expect to learn more as we close in on its November release date.</p><p>If you haven't played Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Super Mario RPG yet, these recently released Switch games will give you a pretty good idea of the combat system in traditional RPGs set in the Mushroom Kingdom.

Link is one of the many Hyrulians who find themselves pulled into a mysterious rift, which means it's Princess Zelda's turn to save the day.

Other Zelda games on Switch came bundled with little trinkets at select retailer. We'll update our Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom preorder guide if bonuses become available at major retailers.</p><p>To coincide with the game's release, Nintendo is launching a Hyrule Edition Nintendo Switch Lite. It features a golden color scheme with black accents, along with a Hylian Crest on the back. It's a good-looking gadget, but if you want to get your hands on it before it sells out, consider reserving a unit as soon as you can.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320715-switchlite.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4320715" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320715-switchlite.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4320715"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320715-switchlite.jpeg"></figure><p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a throwback to pre-Breath of the Wild Zelda that retains the colorful visuals of Link's Awakening. Unlike Link, Zelda doesn't wield a trusty sword; she uses a newly acquired power called Echoe, which lets her create items that help you traverse Hyrule, overcome enemies, and solve puzzles. Echoes allow you to replicate NPCs who will then fight on your behalf or help you solve puzzles.</p><p>Based on the reveal trailer, the new mechanics could add a lot of variance to each playthrough. Nintendo even stated players will have different experiences based on how they approach using Echoes. In this way, Echoes of Wisdom is similar to Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, especially the latter, which implemented a robust building tool called Ultrahand that encouraged players to experiment to solve puzzles, explore the world, and defeat enemies. Though Echoes of Wisdom, as a top-down Zelda game, clearly won't be as dynamic, it's cool to see the melding of classic Zelda with the modern approach to the franchise. And it's even cooler to see Zelda step into the leading role for the first time. Well, for the first time on a Nintendo platform at least. Zelda's Adventure for Philips CD-i does indeed exist.</p><p>If you're not all caught up on the major The Legend of Zelda games on Switch, you can save on the other four mainline games that have received physical editions at Walmart right now. Link's Awakening would be a good one to play before Echoes of Wisdom since it shares the same foundation.</p><ul><li><a

However, as spotted by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/06/26/steamworld-heist-ii-no-longer-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>XboxEra</u></a>, social media posts mentioning a Game Pass release have since been deleted, and trailers that included the Xbox service’s branding have seemingly been modified and reuploaded without the logo. Its inclusion can still be seen in re-uploads from third-party accounts like YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0196lrXfm6g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GN Game Trailers</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A representative with Fortyseven PR confirmed with XboxEra that SteamWorld Heist 2 is no longer coming to Game Pass, adding that the Xbox service's logo was mistakenly added. Thunderful and Fortyseven did not reveal how the Game Pass logo managed to worm its way into an official trailer, but in <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1806050824629416183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement sent to Kotaku's Ethan Gach</a>, a spokesperson further clarified that distribution plans for SteamWorld Heist 2 are still being ironed out.</p><p>"We inadvertently included a Game Pass logo in our reveal trailer," the statement says. "We have not finalized our distribution plans for SteamWorld Heist 2 at this time. We'll share news about our distribution plans closer to launch."</p><p>SteamWorld Heist 2 is still planned to launch for all other previously announced console and PC platforms. The sequel follows Captain Leeway and their struggle against a new menace that threatens the Great Sea. Spicing up the turn-based combat this time around is real-time naval combat, more crew customization, more story, and more steampunk weapons.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Steamworld Heist 2 - Announcement Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Although it's looking like SteamWorld Heist 2 won’t sneak its way into Game Pass when it launches this August, the service does currently offer other SteamWorld games to enjoy.

        <p>Along with Replay mode and more.</p>

            <p>
Valve is expanding Steam's already teetering tower of built-in features with a new background gameplay recording and sharing system that's available in beta now.
</p>
<p>
As detailed on Valve's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording">Game Recording beta page</a>, Steam's new suite of console-like video features begin with two distinct recording modes. A Background Recording mode continuously saves gameplay to a preferred drive - users can set duration and storage limits - while an On Demand Recording mode enables users to start and stop recording as they choose.
</p>
<p>
A new timeline feature and player-added event markers are intended to make it easier to find key moments (achievements, screenshots, and in-game events in supported games can also auto-generate markers if desired) and recordings can be clipped using new "lightweight" tools.

<p>
There's also a redesigned Recordings &amp; Screenshots interface where users can edit and share footage, and a one-click sharing option for posting video into a chat session with a friend or to the world at large. Valve says recordings can easily be transferred to another device - Steam Deck to PC, for instance - and temporary links to MP4s can be sent via the Steam Mobile App or a QR code.
</p>
<p>
And finally, a new Replay mode is accessible from the Steam Overlay in every game, enabling users to quickly jump back through their recent gameplay. "Useful for things like seeing what went wrong when your hero died," Valve notes, "or recalling something mentioned by an NPC earlier."
</p>
<p>
Steam's new Game Recording system - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording">detailed more thoroughly here</a> - is currently available in beta for all users, and developers can access a new SDK and API. To explore the new features, Steam users should go into Settings &gt; Interface &gt; Beta Participation then select either Beta option. Background or On Demand recording can then be enabled via Settings &gt; Game Recording. Expect a public release after Valve has ironed out any kinks.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-will-never-guess-wordle%E2%80%99s-terrible-hilarious-original-name.912615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24186786/wordle-original-name-mr-bugs-wordy-nugz-wardle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wordle</em> is a pretty clever name for the very good word game created by Josh Wardle. But when he was first working on it in 2013, Wardle had another name in mind that isn’t quite as catchy.</p><p>“This is true: I was going to call <em>Wordle,</em> <em>Mr. Bugs’ Wordy Nugz</em>,” Wardle revealed as part of a presentation about <em>Wordle</em> at Figma’s Config conference on Wednesday. He also showed a slide that spelled out the name in big yellow letters. “Had I called the game <em>Mr. Bugs</em>, I like to think it would not have been successful.”</p><p>During the presentation, which <a href="https://config.figma.com/agenda/session?session_id=d418949a2beb&amp;lang=en">was about</a> the development decisions that he said “are the opposite of what you’re meant to do” but ultimately contributed to making the game a hit, Wardle also discussed the history of the game and showed off a bunch of early prototypes. Wardle had wanted to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html">make a game for his partner</a>. He liked words and liked the game <em>Mastermind</em>, so in 2013, he mashed the two ideas together and started making what would become <em>Wordle</em>.</p><p>His first prototype was for Android, and much of the core game was there: you had six guesses to figure out a five-letter word. But this early version was an endless game, meaning that as soon as you figured out one word, you could try and solve another. It also picked from five-letter words at random, meaning you might have been trying to figure out more obscure words like “<a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/zizel">zizel</a>” or “<a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/yrneh#:~:text=(%CB%88j%C9%9C%CB%90n%C9%AA%20),unit%20of%20inverse%20electrical%20inductance">yrneh</a>.”</p><div><p><cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>In order to whittle down the word list to a set of words that “people could reasonably know,” Wardle then built another game where you could press a button to say if you knew a word, didn’t know it, or maybe knew it. This helped him winnow the list down from 13,000 to about 2,500 words. </p><div><figcaption><em>Wardle says his partner categorized all 13,000 five-letter words.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>He also kept working on the game’s design. In some older iterations he included with his presentation, the game had things like a score or red X marks to denote “lives.”</p><div><p><cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>This all happened in 2013, when he was also considering the <em>Mr. Bugs</em> name. But then, Wardle said he lost interest in the game, “put it on the back burner,” and didn’t touch it for six years. </p><p>In early 2020, Wardle and his partner were playing a lot of <em>The New York Times</em>’ crossword and its <em>Spelling Bee</em> game. He noticed that they were both once-a-day kind of games —&nbsp;there is only one <em>Spelling Bee </em>a day,<em> </em>and the day’s crossword must be completed on the same day in order to maintain a streak. He decided to make a similar choice for what would become <em>Wordle</em>.</p><p>In 2021, he built a version of what would become <em>Wordle</em> that lived on his personal domain (which is where you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22892044/wordle-free-game-online-how-to-puzzle">might have played <em>Wordle</em></a> before <em>The New York Times</em> fully took it over).</p><p>“This was something else I did that you’re not meant to do. I made a website,” Wardle said. “I think a lot of the thinking around games was that you want apps so you can catch your audience. You can send them push notifications. I didn’t want to do any of that. It was just [my partner] and I playing the game. So making a website seemed so obvious to me.” He thinks being a website helped the game, as you could just share it with someone and they could play it.</p><div><figcaption><em>Wardle’s version of </em>Wordle<em> on his personal domain.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>For about six months, Wardle said it was just the two of them playing the game on his website. Then, he shared it with family, they shared it with friends, and it started to grow from there. After seeing people post their results in emoji form, he formally added <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22881995/wordle-emoji-results-auto-generated-tell-a-story">emoji results</a> as a feature to the game in late 2021.</p><p>On January 31st, <em>The New York Times</em> announced that it had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition">bought <em>Wordle</em> from Wardle</a>. “I think this took a lot of people by surprise,” Wardle said in his presentation. “It was a very clear decision for me to make to sell the game. I didn’t want to run a games business. I’m interested in creating things.</p><p>“It was obvious due to the success of <em>Wordle</em> that I could make my life if I wanted to,” Wardle continued. “But there are a bunch of things that I wouldn’t enjoy about running a games business. And it just felt so clear to me that that wasn’t something I wanted any part of.”</p><p>He also said that he didn’t want to monetize the game. “All of this comes back to [that] I’m building the game for my partner. I’m not going to show her ads or try and upsell her on a premium subscription. But it’s even though I didn’t want to make money from <em>Wordle</em>, it quickly became apparent to me that there were other people who were going to make money off <em>Wordle</em>, whether I was involved or not.” Wardle said that “selling to <em>The New York Times</em> was a way to just to step away.”</p><p>Wardle concluded by saying that, if he had wanted to make a viral word game, he wouldn’t have made <em>Wordle</em>. “I was trying to do something that was authentic to me. I was trying to build something for someone that I loved. It just so happened a bunch of other people loved it.” </p><p>His advice for other people trying to make things? “Don’t try to make <em>Wordle.</em> Make the thing that you’re passionate about that is meaningful to you. And then everything else will follow from that.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Controller manufacturer Hori has announced a new Steam-focused wireless controller launching later this year. <a href="https://hori.jp/products/hpc/hpc-055/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori's wireless Steam controller</a> is officially licensed by Valve, and both companies worked together to ensure the gamepad and all its features are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4142827237888316811" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fully compatible with Steam</a> on desktop and Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve discontinued its own official Steam controller back in 2019, so this new collaboration with Hori is notable. As of now, it's the only controller for Steam that's in active production, which is pretty wild considering how massive Steam is.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the discontinued Steam controller, which used touch-based trackpads instead of thumbsticks and a unique button layout, Hori's pad offers a more traditional design similar to most other wireless controllers. All the expected face buttons, shoulder triggers, and thumbsticks are present, but there are also a few bonus features, including four remappable buttons—two on the front and two paddles on the back. It also has dedicated buttons for the Steam Big Picture Mode overlay and Steam Quick Access Menu.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4325326-hori.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325326" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4325326-hori.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325326"></a><figcaption>Hori Steam Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4325326-hori.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Hori's Steam controller uses offset thumbstick placement like the standard Xbox or Nintendo Switch Pro controllers. Unfortunately, the thumbsticks do not use anti-drift Hall Effect sensors, but they do have touch-sensitive stick tops like the Steam Deck's thumbsticks. It also lacks rumble support. However, there are plenty of other features, including turbo mode and gyro support.</p><p dir="ltr">As for connectivity, Hori's wireless Steam controller supports Steam Input over Bluetooth or wired USB, so it should work natively with Steam and Steamdeck. There's also an XInput mode so you can use the controller on Windows with non-Steam games, but that mode only works with wired connections and disables gyro controls. That said, Windows users can use Hori's desktop app to adjust settings like stick sensitivity, button mapping, and more. The controller has an estimated 12-hour battery life in Bluetooth mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Hori's wireless Steam controller launches on <strong>October 31</strong>. So far, it's only been announced for Japan. There's no word on if or when the controller will be available outside Japan, but for now, preorders are live at Hori's online store for ¥7,980, or roughly $50 USD. It comes in white, black, neon yellow, and neon purple colors. We'll be sure to update if the controller becomes available in North America. Interestingly, there is an an <a href="https://www.amazon.com//Hori-HORIPAD-Pro-Designed-Xbox-x/dp/B08LPY3BPK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox (wired) controller from Hori</a> that has a very similar design.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, if you're looking for our recommendations for more gamepads that work with Steam, check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-controller/1100-6496530/" data-ref-id="1100-6496530">the best controllers for PC</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Fighting game fans should also consider <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-street-fighter-themed-fight-pads-have-unique-tournament-grade-features/1100-6524524/" data-ref-id="1100-6524524">Hori's newly announced Street Fighter controller</a>.

Sure, it’s not the first 3D game ever developed, but it popularized many features and mechanics that continue to exist in modern games. It was groundbreaking and relied heavily on the then-newly released N64 and its advanced (for the time) hardware.

                <p>Ubisoft has some big releases planned for later this year, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-preorder-guide/1100-6522523/" data-ref-id="1100-6522523">Star Wars Outlaws</a> dropping on August 30 followed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on November 15. Picking up both will cost you $140 at minimum, and there's a good chance you'll have explored everything they have to offer by next summer, right? If that describes you, signing up for a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fubisoft.pxf.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F864200%2F12050%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-ubisoft-deal-is-great-if-you-want-star-wars-outlaws-and-assassins-creed-shadows%2F1100-6524527%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one-year Ubisoft+ Premium membership</a> could be a great alternative to buying the games outright. For a limited time, you can save $45 on an annual Ubisoft+ Premium membership, which drops the price from $180 to $135.</p><p>The discounted Ubisoft+ Premium annual membership is a limited-time offer that expires on July 11--so you've still got a bit of time to check out the service and see if it's a good fit. But if you plan on playing both Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin's Creed Shadows, it's an easy way to save five bucks while also granting access to all new Ubisoft games as well as a back catalog of just about every title from the publisher released in recent years (plus a bunch of classics). The Premium plan gets you day-one access to new releases, so you won't have to wait to play any of the big hits arriving this year.</p><p>Better yet, a Premium member <strong>unlocks the ultimate edition of both games</strong>, giving you tons of additional content to enjoy--including season passes and in-game cosmetics. You'll also get three-day early access to both games, allowing you to play Outlaws on August 27 and Shadows on November 15. Considering you'd spend $260 to get both Outlaws and Shadows ultimate editions, the value of this Ubisoft+ Premium subscription is pretty obvious. Even the standard editions cost $140 combined, though.</p><p>Along with Outlaws and Shadows, becoming a Ubisoft+ Premium member gets you access to a library of over 100 games from the Ubisoft catalog, such as Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Beyond Good and Evil's Anniversary Edition, and Far Cry 6, among dozens of others. You can see a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fubisoft.pxf.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F864200%2F12050%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus%2Fgames%3Foffer%3Dpremium&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-ubisoft-deal-is-great-if-you-want-star-wars-outlaws-and-assassins-creed-shadows%2F1100-6524527%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list of games here</a>.</p><p>You'll also save 20% on any games you decide to purchase and earn exclusive monthly rewards. Signing up today means you'll have until next June to beat both games before canceling your membership (if you choose to do so).</p><p>Premium members can play on PC or Xbox, as well as through the cloud with Amazon's Luna game streaming service. Note that you'll need to cancel your membership before it automatically renews, as pricing will jump to its regular $180 per year once your discounted membership ends.</p><p>It's not quite as enticing as the above deal, but Ubisoft is also slashing the price of its Classics plan, which is now $60 (down from $80). It won't get you day one releases, but it does offer a catalog of 50 games, including Rainbow Six Extraction, Far Cry 6, and Immortals Fenyx Rising. This deal also expires on July 11, so swing by the Ubisoft Store and check out the offers while you can. Note that PlayStation users get Ubisoft+ Classic as part of their PlayStation Plus Extra subscription.</p><p>If you're not interested in Ubisoft+ or happen to be a PlayStation user who doesn't have access to the Ubisoft+ Premium offer, you can check out every edition of Assassin's Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws that's available to preorder now.
