            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/exoborne-playtest-february<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Sharkmob has announced an&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest for February, so if you were looking for yet another extraction shooter to add to your list for some reason, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>The playtest will take place between February 12th and 17th, and unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta</a> (and, indeed, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">one prior to that</a>), you'll have to request access in order to be approved for the test.</p>

<p>Sharkmob doesn't specifically say which aspects of the game you'll be granted access to if you manage to get approved for the beta, so it sounds like you'll be able to test a slice of the game, which is exciting if you're an extraction shooter fan, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/exoborne-playtest-february-storm.jpg?itok=OPeg2gwx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/exoborne-playtest-february-storm.jpg?itok=0wPd3OKI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest is coming in February.</figcaption></figure><p>Playing the&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest for 60 minutes will earn you two extra keys, allowing you to recruit a couple of friends and "complete your squad", as Sharkmob says.</p>

<p>As for what the game actually is, Sharkmob describes&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>as an "open-world tactical extraction shooter set in a world torn apart by extreme forces of nature". An apocalyptic cataclysm (is there any other kind?) has ravaged the world, making resources scarce and hostile humans numerous.</p>

<p>You'll be let loose in the "vast open land" of Colton County, and it'll be up to you to scavenge for loot, deal with warring factions and enemy players, and try to survive when nature's fury comes a-calling once more.</p>

<p>If you want to know what&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>looks like on a moment-to-moment level, you can check out the playtest announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p>Between this, shooters like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0-16-0-0" rel="nofollow">Escape from Tarkov</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gray-zone-warfare-tarkov-players" rel="nofollow"><em>Gray Zone Warfare</em></a>, and experiments in other genres like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-playtest-early-access" rel="nofollow">Dungeonborne</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolcen-devs-project-pantheon-live-service" rel="nofollow"><em>Project Pantheon</em></a>, the extraction genre sure is gaining popularity.</p>

<p>Whether&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>can stand out in a landscape like that remains to be seen, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam</a> if you want to find out. That's also where you can request access to February's playtest.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Release Date Set for May]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date-set-for-may.1084185/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marvelous has announced the release date for upcoming farming RPG adventure&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, which will allow you to explore a "Japanese-inspired" land filled with unique twists on classic&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>gameplay.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC and Nintendo Switch on May 30th. There's no word on whether it'll also be released for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">newly-announced Switch 2</a>, but since that console is backwards compatible, I suppose the answer is technically "yes".</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will take place in the land of Azuma, which are "a shadow of their prosperous past" following the events of a mysterious calamity known as the Celestial Collapse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date-farming.jpg?itok=BEGzDpb- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date-farming.jpg?itok=bYhHC9rC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>brings more cozy RPG farming goodness in May.</figcaption></figure><p>The gods of nature have abandoned the land, but one hero makes a pact with a dragon in order to use its power to save the world from its encroaching blight. That, in case you hadn't twigged, is you.</p>

<p>You'll be able to choose from one of two protagonists, whose destinies are "closely tied together", according to Marvelous.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will also offer "reimagined and expanded&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>gameplay", meaning you'll be able not only to farm, but also to fight using new weapons like bows and talismans, as well as befriending local villagers and exploring the land of Azuma to your heart's content.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, which shows the kind of direction the game is going in, right here.</p>




<p>You won't just be farming in&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, either; you'll be rebuilding entire villages, constructing and placing buildings as you see fit. It's a wonder you can find the time for romance in between being an adventurer and a city planner.</p>

<p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864560/Rune_Factory_Guardians_of_Azuma/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch on May 30th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345133/sony-until-dawn-movie-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Sony has been saying that its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343454/sonys-until-dawn-movie-wants-to-channel-games-dust-yourself-off-and-try-again-energy">upcoming <em>Until Dawn</em> feature</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337875/sony-playstation-horizon-zero-dawn-helldivers-2-ghosts-of-tsushima-movie-tv-show=PlayStation">one of its new IP adaptations</a> — is meant to channel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/24/9187447/until-dawn-review-playstation-4">the game’s spirit</a>. But the movie’s latest trailer makes it pretty clear that this isn’t just going to be a one-to-one translation.</p></div><p>Similar to the game, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/16/world-premiere-of-the-until-dawn-movie-trailer/">director David F. Sandberg’s <em>Until Dawn</em></a><em> </em>revolves around a group of people who find themselves trapped in a time loop that resets as they’re each murdered in a number of different horrific scenarios. When Melanie (Maia Mitchell) goes missing under mysterious circumstances, her younger sister Clover (Ella Rubin) recruits her friends Max (Michael Cimino), Megan (Ji-young Yoo), Nina (Odessa A’zion), and Abel (Belmont Cameli) on a mission to find her. In the trailer, group’s search brings them to what looks to be an inn run by Hill (Peter Stormare), an odd man who warns them that wandering farther up the road will only bring trouble into their lives.</p><p>Though one seems all that bothered by how the weather acts strangely around Hill’s inn, they know something is up when their car vanishes, and they find Melanie’s signature written in a dusty old guest log. Things only get spookier as night falls, and <em>something </em>starts lurking in the darkness around Clover and her friends. But it isn’t until people start dying that they realize they’re somehow being resurrected and challenged to survive until the morning as various ghouls try to kill them in inventive ways. </p><p>The trailer makes it seem like, despite revolving around new characters, it’ll hit many of the classic <em>Until Dawn </em>beats<em>. </em>And when the movie hits theaters on April 25th, it’ll probably keep audiences guessing as to who exactly is going to make it out alive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Grinding Gear Games has <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3695606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced full details</a> for Path of Exile 2 Patch 0.1.1, including releasing the full patch notes. The update, which will be available for players on Friday, features hundreds of changes and bug fixes to Skills, Monsters, Endgame content, controller support, and more.</p>



<p>You can check out the full Path of Exile 2 Patch 0.1.1 Notes below. The game is available now, in early access, on Steam. </p>



<h6 id="h-more-insider-gaming-nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year">MORE INSIDER GAMING: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Announces Nintendo Switch 2, Launching This Year</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-patch-0-1-1-notes">Path of Exile 2 Patch 0.1.1 Notes</h2>



<h3>Endgame Changes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added 4 new Tower Map areas: Alpine Ridge, Bluff, Mesa, and Sinking Spire.</li>



<li>The Lost Towers Map area has also been revamped.</li>



<li>To address the problem of only having one attempt at the Arbiter of Ash Boss fight, you will now have up to six respawn attempts at this fight. Respawns can only be triggered by the person who put in the keys, and everyone in your party will be respawned at the same time. Leaving the Map still forfeits your attempt so you’ll still need to fight the boss with the build you walked into the Map with. Higher difficulties of the Boss will lower the number of respawn attempts you receive. We’ll be looking to add respawn attempts to other Pinnacle content over time.</li>



<li>The Arbiter of Ash can no longer be interrupted during his falling flame seed skill. His flaming gale skill can no longer be blocked.</li>



<li>The Arbiter of Ash Boss is now invulnerable for longer during its emergence and now takes significantly reduced damage while emerging.</li>



<li>The Arbiter of Ash is now way less likely to target minions when using his sword, which could prevent some of their skills being used.</li>



<li>Added checkpoints to Map areas.</li>



<li>Map areas now contain a minimum of 3 Rare Monsters.</li>



<li>Citadels can now appear closer to the Ziggurat Refuge.</li>



<li>Improved the visibility of Citadels on the Endgame Map.</li>



<li>Maps now display their Biome when hovered in the Atlas UI.</li>



<li>Added the new Overseer’s Precursor Tablet, a currency item which can be placed in completed Towers to add Map Bosses to valid Maps in radius. These tablets drop from Map Bosses, and can roll exclusive modifiers that affect Map Bosses.</li>



<li>Map areas have been adjusted to have more distinct specialities for the content they contain. For example, one Map area might have more total number of monsters, while another is more likely to contain additional content such as Strongboxes, Essences or Shrines. Generally speaking, the more difficult a Map is to clear, or the smaller it is, the more axes it will specialise in. Here’s an overview of changes we’ve made to give Maps more discernibility:</li>



<li>A number of Maps now spawn up to double the number of Chests, and twice as many minimum Magic or Rare Chests.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now contain up to double the number of Monsters.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now contain 50% more Magic Monsters.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now contain 50% more Rare Monsters.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have a higher minimum number of Rare Monsters you will encounter.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have a lower minimum number of Rare Monsters you will encounter.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Essences.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Strongboxes.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Shrines.</li>



<li>Maps that are only exclusively found in Biomes containing Citadels now have 50% more chance to contain Essences, Strongboxes and Shrines.</li>



<li>Unclaimed Hideout Areas now have substantially more Magic Monsters, and fewer Rare Monsters.</li>



<li>Monsters in the Untainted Paradise have been breeding. Untainted Paradise now contains 100% more Monsters, of which spawn 100% more (thus quadruple) Magic and Rare Monsters.</li>



<li>Improved the highlightability/clickability of Shrines.</li>



<li>Reduced the damage scaling of Monsters in Simulacrum encounters with added Difficulty.</li>



<li>Adjusted the chance for Maps to contain Bosses, you should be encountering a Boss roughly every 1 in 4 Maps.</li>



<li>The chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher has been reduced to account for the increase in total number of Map Bosses.</li>



<li>The Radiant Waystones Atlas Notable Passive now provides +15% chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher (previously 25%).</li>



<li>The small Map Boss Waystone Chance Passives now provide +6% chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher (previously 10%).</li>



<li>The “I’m not afraid of you!” Delirium Atlas Passive Skill now grants “Delirium Bosses in your Maps drop 100% increased Simulacrum Splinters” (previously 50%).</li>



<li>Reduced the number of monsters and small chests from Breaches by 15%.</li>



<li>Increased the amount of Simulacrum Splinters found in Maps by 20%.</li>



<li>Added dedicated 2D art for Waystones that are instilled with layers of Delirium.</li>



<li>Crisis Fragments, Breachstones, Simulacrums, and An Audience with the King now have a more appropriate gold value to vendors.</li>



<li>Increased how far you can zoom out on the Endgame Map on keyboard and mouse input, to match the zoom level on controller input.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Skill Changes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Supercharged Slam now has “Each successive aftershock gains +0.5 metres to radius, up to 3 metres (previously uncapped).</li>



<li>Scavenged Plating now grants you stacks for a duration based on the enemy’s rarity. Normal enemies grant 1 stack, Magic enemies grants 2 stacks, Rare enemies grant 5 stacks, and Unique enemies grant 10 stacks.</li>



<li>The Lightning Bolt Skill granted by the Choir of the Storm Unique Amulet has been renamed to Greater Lightning Bolt to differentiate it from the Skill granted by Staves. Triggered Greater Lightning Bolts are now unable to trigger a subsequent Greater Lightning Bolt if the first was a Critical Hit. Greater Lightning Bolt now deals roughly 3.5 times more base Lightning Damage compared to Lightning Bolt.</li>



<li>The Temporalis Unique Body Armour can no longer reduce the cooldown of a Skill to below 100ms.</li>



<li>Skills socketed in a Meta Gem’s sockets can no longer gain energy.</li>



<li>Clarified Vine Arrow’s description to explicitly state that it hits enemies on landing.</li>



<li>Removed the Aura tag from Pain Offering for consistency with other minion skills, as the skill does not directly create an Aura (the Aura is created by the summoned minion).</li>
</ul>



<h3>Monster Changes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Monsters now have increased Toughness per Essence modifier affecting them.</li>



<li>Added a small delay before monsters released from Essence Monoliths can use their skills.</li>



<li>Forsaken Miners now throw less grenades, which have also had their damage reduced and their visuals improved.</li>



<li>Rudja, the Dread Engineer’s grenades now deal less damage in Cruel and Maps.</li>



<li>Reduced how far away Faridun Plaguebringers can use their Detonate Dead skill from. The telegraphing for this skill has been improved.</li>



<li>Reduced how far away Lost-men Zealots can use their Meteor skill from. The visuals of this skill have also been improved.</li>



<li>The Lightning Storm skill used by Lost-men Zealots should now always strike at the telegraphed marker, as opposed to somewhere random.</li>



<li>Filthy Crone no longer uses their Projectile Vomit skill point blank in front of you (because that’s just rude), and now has a basic projectile attack.</li>



<li>Reduced the leap distance of Vile Vulture’s Leap skill. The visuals of this skill have also been improved.</li>



<li>Reduced the axe throwing distance of Vaal Axemen.</li>



<li>Reduced the area of effect for Filthy First-born’s on-death explosion. The visibility of the area of effect has also been improved.</li>



<li>The vomit skill used by Rotting Hulks and Bog Hulks now deal less damage, and can no longer be used point blank in front of you.</li>



<li>Adjusted the damaging area of The Bloated Miller’s slam skills to more closely match the visual effects.</li>



<li>Adjusted the damaging area of Zalmarath, the Colossus’ attacks to more closely match the visual effects.</li>



<li>Adjusted the player targeting behaviour for Zalmarath, the Colossus. Their arms are no longer targetable.</li>



<li>Adjusted the damaging area of Bahlak, the Sky Seer’s Tornadoes to more closely match the visual effects. Tornadoes now push you slightly away when they appear, and now deal less damage when they first appear before ramping up.</li>



<li>Reduced how often Prowling Shades can use their invisibility skill.</li>



<li>Adjusted the frequency of some monsters such as Prowling Shades and Gelid Zealots.</li>



<li>Vaal Zealots are now less likely to repeatedly use their Eye of Winter skill.</li>



<li>Improved the visual effects of Fiery Zealots’ Fire Storm skill.</li>



<li>Adjusted the damaging area of the Executioner’s attacks to more closely match the visual effects. The telegraphing for his Guillotine Slam has also been improved.</li>



<li>Improved the visibility of Cultists Archers’ skills. Their Toxic Rain skill also now deals less damage.</li>



<li>Jamanra, the Risen King’s zombie skirt no longer spontaneously explodes on death.</li>



<li>Mighty Silverfist’s Commando Roll skill now deals significantly less damage.</li>



<li>Reduced how often Azak Stalkers use their Slam skill.</li>



<li>Walking Goliaths no longer deal damage twice when they fall over. Their slam now deals more damage in the centre, and less around the edges.</li>



<li>Reduced the distance of which Urnwalkers in the Trial of the Sekhemas are able to initiate their skill. We’ve also fixed an issue where they were not dealing damage correctly, meaning they now deal more damage.</li>



<li>Slitherspitters no longer deal damage twice with their projectile attack. Their melee attack now deals Physical damage instead of Chaos.</li>



<li>The density of monsters in Utzaal has been reduced. Monsters contained in the area are now more likely to be of a weaker variety.</li>



<li>The density of monsters in Dreadnaught areas has been adjusted to result in less swarming encounters.</li>



<li>Improved the telegraphing for Azak Shamans’ Detonate Dead skill.</li>



<li>Improved the telegraphing for the crystals left by Vaal Goliaths when they die.</li>



<li>Chaos Pustules in Ritual encounters have had their visuals improved.</li>

<li>Added an exit portal to the Trialmaster arena.</li>



<li>Removed the level requirement to access Expedition Vendors.</li>



<li>Rarity of items in Expedition Vendor shops now increases with shop level, so shops generally have more rare items at higher levels. This doesn’t affect existing shops, and you will need to use a reroll currency to generate shops with the improved rarity.</li>



<li>Reduced visual clutter in many Map areas to improve the visibility of skills and effects.</li>



<li>Added a tutorial for activating your first persistent buff skill gem.</li>



<li>Improved and fixed inconsistencies for walkability throughout areas in the campaign as well as maps.</li>

            <p>Nintendo has reportedly set itself up with a supply chain network which will ultimately allow the company to sell in excess of 20m Switch 2 units during the console's first year on the market.</p>
<p>This nugget of information comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a> report citing Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu. To put that number into more perspective, Nintendo sold "around 15m" Switch units during its own first four quarters after release, so we are looking at (potentially) a 33 percent increase in sales during those first 12 months.</p>
<p>"Given the hardware segment drove 40 percent of fiscal 2024 top line, a successor to the 2017 Switch could go hand-in-hand with its stronger game pipeline in fiscal 2026, reversing what is expected to be the fourth consecutive year of lackluster sales growth in fiscal 2024," added analyst Nathan Naidu.</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">announcement of the Switch 2</a> has been a long time coming. Over the last two or so years, we have been presented with leaks and reports from what felt like every corner of the internet bar Nintendo itself.</p>
<p>Now, however, the day has finally come for Nintendo's Switch successor to take the spotlight. Along with what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">appears to be mouse functionality for its Joy-Cons</a>, Nintendo also teased a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Mario Kart game coming to Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>We will hear more about Switch 2 in April, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo hosts a Direct for the console</a>. As for when we will be able to get our hands on the hardware, it will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">available to play in London on April 11th to 13th</a>.</p>
<p>If it is still more Switch 2 you want, our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-pictures-switch-2-from-every-angle">Tom has broken down today's teaser so you can enjoy the console from every angle</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In what has become fine tradition, I have learned of an amazing mod on the same day I have learned that the mod has been kiboshed by publishers. The mod in question is the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> Liberty City Preservation Project, a six year project that rebuilds GTA 4's Liberty City in GTA 5's world. It launched earlier this month - and now it is no more, for Rockstar have descended like briefcase-wielding peregrine falcons and performed what is being called a "friendly takedown" on modding team World Travel. My brother did a "friendly takedown" on me once, and my elbow still doesn't bend the right way.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-5-mod-recreating-gta-4s-map-nuked-after-6-years-of-work-because-people-noticed-and-rockstar-insisted-on-a-friendly-takedown-if-you-know-what-i-mean/">PCGamer</a>, team member NK Jellman broke the news on the project's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/worldtravel">Discord</a>. "Due to the unexpected attention that our project received and after speaking with Rockstar Games, we have decided to take down the Liberty City Preservation project," he wrote. "We appreciate all the support that the project has received, and we look forward to continuing to pursue our passion for modding the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> series."</p>

<p>This may seem a very cheerful way to announce that six years of work have been for naught, but Jellman insists World Travel have nothing but love for Our Friends At Rockstar, to say nothing of Their Friends At Parent Company Take-Two. "We've noticed a lot of misconceptions and theories surrounding our latest announcement and would like to make a few things clear," added NK Jellman in a later Discord post. "This isn't a DMCA [Digital Millennium Copyright Act claim], rather a friendly takedown, mutually agreed upon by all parties involved. There is no negativity between us and Rockstar Games / Take-Two Interactive." </p><p>Prior to its mutually agreed destruction, the GTA 5 Liberty City Preservation Project brought back the entirety of GTA 4's warped New York complete with NPCs, the subway, the police forces, civilian traffic, car models, radio stations, and optional HD textures. All this for the low, low price of nothing at all.</p>
<p>Rockstar and Take-Two have a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-5-ai-mod-shot-down-by-take-two-even-as-rockstar-relax-policy-on-modding">track record</a>, of course, for bringing the hammer down on more ambitious GTA mods, though the criteria for a "friendly takedown" or worse remain ambiguous. This isn't the only <a href="https://fivemx.com/free/mlo/liberty-city/">GTA 5 Liberty City mod</a>. You could take it all as evidence that Rockstar are working on their own GTA 4 update, but according to reports <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-redemption-and-gta4-remasters-reportedly-scrapped-after-gta-trilogy-debacle">they shelved such plans in 2022</a> to focus on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The track is completely unfamiliar for one, but the karts themselves look totally different too, and seem to be in a sliiiiightly different style to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

They're cruising down a desert highway course we've never seen before complete with a Yoshi's Diner on the side of the course, NPC cars and trucks driving in the opposite direction, and an audience of cheering Toads. The karts themselves are also different from what we're used to in 8 Deluxe, and seem to be a little more compact and roundish, though it's hard to tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately we don't know much more about what this new Mario Kart is or how it plays.

Super Mario Odyssey was then later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/13/super-mario-odyssey-announced-for-nintendo-switch">officially shown off just a few months later</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's likely we'll get more information on this new Mario Kart game during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct that was just announced for April 2, 2025.

            <p>Nintendo has finally lifted the lid on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> and... well, it looks an awful lot like the Switch. But there are subtle differences, a few obvious new additions, and still some intriguing questions about the new hardware to be answered.
</p>
<p>Let's take a tour of the console hardware, as seen in today's reveal video, for a closer look.
</p>
<p>The trailer begins with a look at the Switch's top and bottom ports (no laughing please) which notably will include an extra USB-C slot at the top of the console. Perhaps this is just so you have a further option for where to plug in your Switch 2 - maybe it docks both ways up, to save a bit of fiddling around there? Or, is this an attachment for something else, yet to be revealed? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>Next up, a look at Switch 2's kick stand, which folds out from the rear of the console to allow you to play in tabletop mode. The kickstand has a new design and can support the Switch 2 from a much lower angle, all the way down to horizontal. Handy!</p>

Onto the Switch 2 Joy-Con, which have been given a fresh lick of paint. Gone are the old red and blue designs for Switch 1. These are slightly larger, to fit the larger Switch 2, and are now mostly black except for coloured side edges. As expected, the Joy-Con look to lock onto the main console unit via a magnetic connection, so there's no more fiddly rail to slide them into. Has Nintendo solved Joy-Con drift too? Let's hope so.

</p><figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Nintendo-Switch-2-%E2%80%93-First-look-trailer-1-1-screenshot.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The right Joy-Con, below, also features that mysterious extra button we saw from the console's leaks. It's been suggested this is referred to as the "C" button, though the final design has left the button blank - at least here. This is something we're likely to find out more about in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">April's big Nintendo Switch Direct event</a>.</p>

<p>Next is the mysterious Switch 2 optical sensor, seen at the top of the Joy-Con on the side it attaches to the main console. This sensor looks like it will enable a mouse-like control option for the console. </p>

<p>It's quick, but we can see an attachment being added to the edge of the Joy-Con to enable the controller to be held horizontal and shuffled around a surface like a wireless mouse.</p>

<p>The side of the Switch 2 where the Joy-Con attach is shown next, and looks much cleaner than on Switch 1 with its fiddly rail attachments.</p>

<p>A quick look at the Switch 2 dock shows it looking similar to that of the Switch 1, from the outside at least. We don't see inside of it, so there's no way of knowing how different it is. A previous report suggested it would not be compatible with the Switch 1, however.</p>

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our preview of the full <em>Soulbound</em> rulebook <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-soulbound-preview" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and our review of the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> core rulebook <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-4th-edition-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=8iJ-FJl0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=gbnjrgGP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set comes with a load of content for the GM to create adventures beyond the introductory adenture.</figcaption></figure><h2>High Fantasy This Is Not</h2>

<p>Before we get into <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em>, it's worth noting the difference between <em>Age of Sigmar (AoS),</em>&nbsp;and <em>Warhammer</em> (now known as <em>Warhammer the Old World</em> in Games Workshop's latest tabletop iteration). The original <em>Warhammer</em> was Games Workshop's fantasy wargaming system. In 2015 (a decade this year and we're still having this conversation) Games Workshop had a narrative event called the End Times, which ended the Old World and started the new <em>Age of Sigmar</em> system, along with moving the narrative completely away and into a new fantasy setting (with many of the same elements, but also a lot of changes). Games Workshop has also since re-released (in January 2024) the <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> game, which you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>I mention the above because Cubicle 7 publishes 2 <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying systems. <em>Age of Sigmar Soubound</em>, for which we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Soulbound Starter Set here</em></a>, is set in Games Workshop's premier fantasy setting, and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP),</em> which we are reviewing in this article, is set in Games Workshop's original fantasy system. <em>WFRP</em> also persevered throughout the removal of <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> from Games Workshop's wargaming range throughout the 2015-2024 gap.</p>

<p>We'll go into details of both settings in our coverage of the systems, but a quick summary is that <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> is set in a more traditional fantasy setting, with the races of humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and Skaven (ratmen) all battling over the map of the Old World, and&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em> sees the different races fighting across 8 different Mortal Realms, 8 unique planes of existence, connected through realm gates. A lot of the classic races are included, but they have a unique Games Workshop twist in <em>AoS</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=cZ2-Vr3C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=9ZBh7fBV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The players get quick reference cards for the rules they need, along with maps of the city and area, and handouts while they go through the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set adventure.</figcaption></figure><h2>True Dwarven Craftsmanship</h2>

<p>Most roleplaying products start with a single book, either a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween" rel="nofollow">Core Rulebook</a>, which contains everything players and Games Masters (GM) need to run the games,&nbsp;or a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow">Players Handbook</a>, which focuses on the core mechanics and player options, expanding into other books for the Games Master&nbsp;(which we see historically in <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> by Wizards of the Coast). <i>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay&nbsp;</i>has a Core Rulebook available, but also to make it even easier, the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set has everything 6 players, plus a GM need to play their first few games in one easy package, with no printing or other products required.</p>

<p>The <em>WFRP</em> starter set box includes a whole raft of contents, including 6 pre-generated fold-out character sheets, handouts, rules references for the players, and 2 10-sided dice. The <em>WFRP</em> system uses a percentile system, for which players roll both dice, one for the tens and one for the units, to get a roll between 01 and 100.</p>

<p>For the GM, the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set begins with the Adventure Book, and the adventure Making the Rounds, which leads both the players and the GM through their first game. Making the Rounds can be spread across several gaming sessions if the GM wishes. Alongside the core story, the Adventure Book also includes 10 additional scenarios that can be used throughout the adventure, or as separate tie-in adventures later on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The GM will need to read through the entire Adventure Book, in order to understand the rules and the adventure's story to best guide the players through, but this is usually the case for Games Masters, who do all the preparation in advance of gaming sessions. The starter set adventure book guides you through the system, giving you tips on how to GM, and acts as a tutorial for the rules as the players progress.</p>

<p>The first edition of <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> had players' initial characters at an extremely low level. They were capable humans, but not the heroic heroes that we find in A<em>ge of Sigmar. </em>In contrast, the 6 pre-generated characters in the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> starter set feel more heroic than first edition WFRP characters did, but not as heroic as Soulbound characters (especially not the immortal Stormcast Eternal who are reforged and reborn when they die).</p>

<p>The starter set characters give a fantastic view of those available in WFRP, whilst still being accessible to those not familiar with the setting. There's a noble soldier, a dwarf slayer (think shirtless barbarian berzerker), a halfling thief, a scythe-wielding wizard, an elf merchant (an incredible addition as a less combat-focused character,&nbsp; but still an elf, so still capable), and the classic WFRP Witch Hunter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=JAuv5voQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=XsI8NRl9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>WFRP</em> uses a percentile dice system, 2D10 to get a number between 1 and 100, and the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set comes with a custom set.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are The Chances!</h2>

<p><em>WRFP</em> uses a percentile system, the same as the original <em>WFRP</em> system, which gives it a more classical feel that suits the setting. This system requires players to roll 2D10, to get a number between 1 and 100, needing to score under their skill to succeed. The GM can add or subtract to the character's skill, depending on how hard to test is. There's also the option to have a dramatic test, where the amount under the tens number demonstrates how successful the test is (a roll of 10 against a test of 70 would be 6 dramatic successes for example).</p>

<p>The Starter Set keeps the level of detail light and accessible, with wounds and critical wounds, but leaves out the full level of detail on&nbsp;injuries, disease, corruption, and psychology that the full rulebook has. This is probably a good choice for keeping the rules straightforward, the product is aimed at new roleplayers and GMs, but it does leave out one of <em>WFRP</em>'s most interesting elements in the realism that it has over more heroic systems.</p>

<p>That doesn't take away from how good the starter set is, as a product, the adventure, and how well it introduces players to the gloriously dark <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> setting.</p>

<h2>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Starter Set </em>is a fantastic product. The components are thematic, immersive, and high-quality. The adventure it contains introduces players well to the setting and the system and can be expanded into several full sessions with the hooks in the adventure book, and the detail included in the Ubersreik Guide. Brand new GMs will have to do some work preparing for the adventure, but the adventure book does give you a lot of tips for running the game. But most importantly, everyone will have a blast playing through the adventure, which is full of character.</p>

            <p>The world looked upon the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxLUf2kRQRE">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and saw that it was good. Or is it? Observe its enlarged, bezel-shaved screen. Its all-black colour scheme. Its redesigned, more sculpted controllers. Clearly, this is a naked attempt at ripping off and cashing in on the <em>real</em> best gaming handheld of 2025, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>I, for one, won’t stand for it. Here are five reasons why everyone excited about the Switch 2 is wrong, and should buy a Steam Deck instead. Or maybe the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>, that one’s better.</p>

<h3>1. The Switch 2’s shoulder triggers don’t travel as far</h3>
<p>Look at that tiny clearance betwixt button and chassis. Sir, your travel depth is as shallow as your knowledge of ergonomics.</p>

<p>Now behold the vast, deep-pressing girth of the Steam Deck triggers – you could land a plane on that, and not just because I’ve massively zoomed in the photo.</p>

<h3>2. The Switch 2 still uses convex thumbsticks, ignoring current thumb shape trends</h3>
<p>I know over twenty people and none of them have a single thumb, let alone two, that curves inwards at the tip. As such, the Switch 2’s thumbsticks make no sense, unlike the concave sticks of the Steam Deck that will nestle your digits like a kitten in a fruit bowl.</p>

<h3>3. The Switch 2 vents are smaller so you can’t huff as much vent-smell</h3>
<p>I don’t care <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-huffing-your-steam-deck-vent-fumes-valve-plead-as-players-obsess-over-new-deck-smell">what Valve says</a>, this is my right as a consumer. Are you going to let Nintendo take away your rights?</p>

<h3>4. The Switch 2 controllers can’t transform into gaming mice</h3>
<p>This is actually a feature of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, rather than the Steam Deck. But the Steam Deck is a better handheld than the Legion Go, and since the Switch 2’s lack of improvised mouse sensors make it worse than the Legion Go, that means it’s also worse than the Steam Deck.</p>

<h3>5. The Switch 2 runs Mario Kart and I hate Mario Kart because my friend Nathan always beats me at it</h3>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/review-intel-arc-b580-is-a-compelling-if-incredibly-tardy-250-midrange-gpu/">Intel's Arc B580 graphics cards</a> have been its best-reviewed to date, maintaining the aggressive pricing of the old A-series Arc cards with fewer driver bugs, fewer weird performance outliers, and fewer caveats all around.</p>
<p>And this appears to be translating to retail success—the B580 is sold out across the board and difficult to find at its $249 MSRP. It's hard to tell if this is because demand has been good or supply was low (Intel says it has been restocking "weekly," for what that's worth). But regardless, there's clearly been some pent-up demand for an inexpensive-but-competent entry-level graphics card with decent ray-tracing performance and power efficiency and more than 8GB of RAM.</p>
<p>The Arc B570 is a less-powerful, less-interesting card than the B580, with fewer of Intel's Xe-cores, less memory bandwidth, and 10GB of RAM instead of 12GB. But it offers performance very similar to the RTX 4060 for $80 less—at least, if Intel and its partners can keep it in stock at that price—which makes it a dramatically more interesting budget option than $200-ish cards like the GeForce RTX 3050 or Radeon RX 6600.</p>
<h2>An Arc B580, but less</h2>

      Everything about the B570 is scaled down just a bit compared to the B580.

      </figure>

<p>The B570 uses the exact same GPU silicon as the B580 but with a slightly lower clock speed and a couple of Xe cores disabled. Memory bus width has also been nudged downward, from 192-bits to 160-bits. The downgrades also give it a lower total board power of 150 W—quite a bit less than the 190 W of the B580, but still enough to require a single 8-pin power connector from your power supply rather than being able to get all of its power from your PCI Express slot.</p>
<p>The card's 10GB of RAM just barely allows Intel to claim that the B570 is more future-proof than cards like the RTX 4060, which still ship with 8GB of RAM. Though 8GB won't limit your performance much at the resolutions that the B570 is powerful enough to render, a little more memory can help in a handful of edge cases, even if it's only 2GB.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          


<p>Like the B580, the B570 ships with an eight-lane PCIe 4.0 interface, and Intel's GPUs rely disproportionately on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/new-drivers-add-performance-boosting-memory-access-feature-to-older-amd-gpus/">Resizable BAR feature</a> to perform optimally (also sometimes called ReBar, Smart Access Memory, or SAM, depending on your motherboard). Neither of these factors is a big deal if you have a PC made within the last five years or so, but it does make Arc a worse fit if you're trying to upgrade an older system that uses PCIe 3.0 for the graphics slot or which doesn't support ReBAR. Just something to be aware of if you're trying to extend the life of an older desktop with integrated graphics.</p>

<h2>Performance and power</h2>
<p>On paper, you'd expect the B570 to run between 80 and 90 percent as fast as a fully enabled B580, and in our testing, that's almost exactly what you get.</p>


<p>The B570 hovers at right around the same performance level as the RTX 4060 and the 8GB version of the Radeon RX 7600 in our tests—sometimes a little faster, sometimes a little slower, but never by more than a few frames per second in any direction. It's also faster than the old Arc A750 and nearly as fast as the A770, with none of the game-specific performance dips (observe the <em>Assassin's Creed</em> titles in particular).</p>
<p>Like the B580, it also keeps pace with Nvidia's performance in games with heavy ray-tracing effects, taking roughly the same-sized performance hit as the RTX 4060 (though as a low-end card, even at 1080p you usually won't get stable 30 or 60 fps rates in most ray-traced games without a little boost from DLSS/XeSS/FSR upscaling). This means it blows both the 8GB and 16GB Radeon RX 7600-series cards out of the water in games with heavy ray-tracing effects.</p>


<p>In these games at these resolutions—and again, we're sticking to 1080p and 1440p, the resolutions this card will reasonably be able to hit—we don't measure a <em>ton</em> of extra performance that we can attribute specifically to the difference between 8GB of RAM and 10GB of RAM.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>We do see a hint of extra improvement in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, a game where the 8GB Radeon RX 7600 and the 8GB Intel Arc A750 do struggle compared to similar cards with a bit more RAM (Nvidia's 8GB cards seem to handle it fine, though). An extra 2GB of RAM isn't a ton, but it may be enough to make the difference with games that teeter right on the edge of being RAM-limited at 8GB. But as we saw with the 16GB RX 7600 XT, the majority of the time, the power of the GPU itself will still end up being the limiting factor.</p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>Finally, the B570's power efficiency when gaming is downright impressive, consuming around 30 W less than the B580, a little bit less than the RTX 4060, and a lot less than the RX 7600 (with the caveat that we are using software-reported power consumption figures, which aren't as accurate as the power usage measured with specialized hardware, and comparisons between different manufacturers and different GPU architectures are imperfect). It seems safe to say that Intel's Battlemage cards are quite competitive on power efficiency when they're playing games, something that wasn't really true of the A700-series GPUs.</p>
<p>It's worth noting, <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-arc-b580/38.html">as other reviewers have pointed out</a>, that Arc's&nbsp;<em>idle</em> power consumption is still fairly high compared to modern AMD and Nvidia cards, especially with multiple monitors connected.</p>

<h2>A competent Nvidia alternative if you can’t get a B580 for $249</h2>

<p>Buying an Intel card still comes with some caveats, even if you're only spending $220. Nvidia's GPUs remain dominant and well-supported, and buying anything from any other company means you lose out on DLSS upscaling and the wider universe of AI and rendering software that takes specific advantage of CUDA or other Nvidia GPU features.</p>
<p>I've also got to wonder how devoted Intel will be to its graphics cards in the long term—Intel's Michelle Johnston Holthaus said that the company remained "very committed to the discrete graphics market," though that's small comfort coming from a company's interim co-CEO.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>I've got to imagine that when Intel <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/intel-poaches-amds-top-gpu-architect-to-build-its-own-discrete-graphics-chips/">set itself to the task of developing dedicated graphics cards</a> many years and several CEOs ago, it was not the company's intent to produce exclusively sub-$300 1080p graphics cards. But so far, this incredibly competitive, low-margin, and price-sensitive market segment is the only one the company seems to be able to contest. Intel continues to rapidly shed or spin off side projects like the NUC, its series of cryptocurrency mining processors, the RealSense IR cameras, and Altera's FPGA business. Betting on the long-term health of the Arc GPU business still seems risky.</p>
<p>That said, I do like the B570 and B580 quite a bit, at least if you can get them at the prices Intel is advertising. Both are good alternatives to the dominant RTX 4060 that require fewer compromises than AMD's cards, and both demonstrate that Intel has learned from a lot of the mistakes and growing pains that were evident in the first-generation Arc cards.</p>
<p>For $30 extra, I'd still lean toward the B580 if you can find it at that price. The extra performance and extra RAM are worth paying a little more for. But if you're trying to assemble a decent gaming system for somewhere between $500 and $700, and if it stays as cheap as it's supposed to be, the B570 is a better answer to the RTX 4060 than anything AMD has been able to put out so far.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>It's cheap if you can get it at MSRP.</li>
<li>Performs in the same ballpark as the GeForce RTX 4060 and Radeon RX 7600.</li>
<li>Includes the niceties you get when buying a modern GPU rather than an older one that has come down in price, including AV1 video encoding support and competent hardware-accelerated ray-tracing performance.</li>
<li>Intel's drivers, performance consistency, and power use under load have all come a long way since last generation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Missing out on Nvidia-specific things like DLSS.</li>

<p>After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/the-thing-after-the-switch-how-overheard-chatter-led-to-a-nintendo-goose-chase/">months</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/nintendo-reportedly-showing-devs-switch-2-with-upscaled-breath-of-the-wild/">years</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/report-nintendos-next-console-ships-late-2024-still-supports-cartridges/">rumors</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/nintendo-pre-announces-a-switch-2-announcement-is-coming-eventually/">official hints</a>, Nintendo has finally pulled back the curtain on the Switch 2 with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itpcsQQvgAQ">a first-look trailer</a> (and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/index.html">sparse promo web site</a>) highlighting many small changes from the old Switch.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>The short trailer shows off the Switch 2's larger tablet and screen, and a slightly more rounded edge on the top and bottom. The new system also sports an additional USB-C port on the top (next to a headphone jack) and a wider, U-shaped kickstand along the backside that can support the system at a number of wider angles.</p>
<p>The trailer also shows off black Joy-Cons that are significantly larger than those on the original Switch, with colored accents behind the joystick itself. An extended, colored Joy-Con "rail" on the inner edge features wider shoulder buttons and a new connector in the center. Rather than sliding in vertically, like the plastic rail on the Switch Joy-Cons, the controllers on the Switch 2 snap in horizontally with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/report-switch-2-joy-cons-will-attach-via-magnets/">what appears to be a magnetic connection</a>, and disconnects with the aid of a horizontal lever to the side of the shoulder buttons.</p>

          </p>
  </div>

<p>The right Joy-Con on the Switch 2 sports an additional small, square button below the Home button. Its function is currently unknown.</p>

While Yoshida isn't employed at Sony any longer, he still offered up his thoughts on why a remaster hasn't happened, per <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1879721711568060488?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X user Shinobi602</a>.

                <p>Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida left the company recently, and he has been sharing some thoughts on the game industry and the PlayStation brand, such as why the PlayStation Vita trailed behind in popularity with competitors like the Nintendo 3DS.</p><p>In a new interview, he said that there was a combination of factors that lead the Vita to sell poorly. One reason was its proprietary memory cards. They were incredibly expensive and just added more costs for the consumer. While the PSP had the proprietary memory sticks, players were also able to use micro SD cards with an adapter.</p><p>In addition to the beautiful OLED screen, the Vita also had a back touchpad. While it provided some clever mechanics and gimmicks for some games, it was ultimately unnecessary. Both the OLED screen and touchpad further contributed to costs. One feature that was removed from the final product was a video-out option, which was present in the development kit version.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jMsGB2PItes" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Game developers would be able to use it in order to connect to a screen, but it was removed in order to reduce some costs. Ironically, the PSP had a video out option, which let players connect their device to a TV or another external display.</p><p>However, Yoshida said that the Vita's failure came down to the fact that Sony didn't have enough bandwidth to support both the Vita and PS3 concurrently, especially with the PS4 on the horizon. "I think the biggest reason Vita didn’t do as well as we had hoped was we had to split all our efforts and resources into two different platforms," Yoshida explained. "We didn’t have that resource."</p><p>Sony is back in the handheld market, but with a different approach. The PlayStation Portal is only a remote-play device, but Sony is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/" data-ref-id="1100-6528023">reportedly working on a PS5 handheld</a> that would compete with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Switch 2</a> and Steam Deck.</p><p>In the same interview, Yoshida theorized that director Hidetaka Miyazaki is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">too busy to remaster Bloodborne</a>, as From Software's next project is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>.</p>

The bezel also appears smaller, which increases the screen real estate.

			<p>We've repeatedly reported that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 was extremely successful. Saber Interactive's long-awaited third-person shooter sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units in the first twenty-four hours on the market and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the five-million milestone by the end of November.</p>
<p>It was one of the best-selling games released in 2024, which made it also very profitable for license holder Games Workshop. In their <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/1alE9DriNd0GJq1SYKn3ZY/e14d3ff03635ea919c569f075b25c60a/2024-25_half_year_report_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half-year financial report</a> published on Tuesday, they explained:</p>
<p><em>During the period, our licensing partners launched two new video games; Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, a third person shooter for PC and console and Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, a combat racing game. Established games continue to contribute, alongside royalty income earned following the success of Space Marine 2. We recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly, we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income. [....] </em></p>
<p><em>Licensing revenue from royalty income increased in the period by £18.0 million to £30.1 million (at constant currency rates, an increase of £19.3 million to £31.4 million). Royalty income is recognised in line with IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’; ‘guarantee income’ is recognised in full at the inception of the contract where the performance obligations of the contract have been met and additional ‘earned income’ is recognised when it can be reliably measured following reporting by licensees. Earned income was £26.1 million (2023/24: £5.9 million), the increase being mainly from Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</em></p>
<p>Games Workshop is very much right about the volatility of such successes. There's been a plethora of Warhammer and Warhammer 40K games in the last decade or so, but no title ever came close to this level of commercial acclaim. It won't be easy at all to find another big hit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Saber Interactive plans to expand Space Marine 2 with lots of new content <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-outlines-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> for the rest of 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-update-011-full-patch-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>Update 0.1.1 lands tomorrow, and Grinding Gear Games has revealed the official full patch notes ahead of the update's release.</p>

<p>You can expect an update that's roughly on a similar scale to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-update-010e" rel="nofollow">December's Update 0.1.0e</a>; while there's no single massive feature that will completely overhaul&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s gameplay, there are tons of smaller changes that should result in a smoother experience.</p>

<p>Four new endgame tower map areas have been introduced in the form of Alpine Ridge, Bluff, Mesa, and Sinking Spire, and the Lost Towers map has been revamped in order to make it a little more interesting to explore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.1-tower.jpg?itok=tnyqoAUN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.1-tower.jpg?itok=EVJA7PK0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>Update 0.1.1 brings changes to the endgame, plus lots more.</figcaption></figure><p>The Arbiter of Ash boss fight has also been redesigned so that you'll have more attempts; rather than only getting to try this boss once, you can now tackle it up to six times, with higher difficulties lowering the number of respawns you get.</p>

<p>Other changes have also been made to this boss fight; the falling flame seed skill can't be interrupted anymore, and the boss is now invulnerable for a longer duration after emerging.</p>

<p>As you might expect, the new&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>update has an absolute ton of changes besides the ones I've listed here, so if you want to see the full changelog, you can check out the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3695606" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes via the game's official forum</a>.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. Like its predecessor, the game is an action RPG, but unlike its predecessor, it's not free-to-play;&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>started out as a massive update for the original game before its devs realized it was big enough to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-will-be-standalone-game-closed-beta-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">spin off into a separate title</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2-game-preview/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Update 0.1.1 lands tomorrow.

            <p>Thousands of people who bought the "N95-grade" Razer Zephyr face mask during the Covid-19 pandemic are finally getting a refund for the dodgy mask, months after US agencies ordered a $1 million payout from the gaming hardware company. The Federal Trade Commission are sending out cheques as we speak. I don't know if I should be glad that a trading standards agency has done its job, or depressed that over 6,700 people thought this mask looked good enough to buy in the first place.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Razer launched their Zephyr face mask during the pandemic, advertising it as a medical-grade N95 mask capable of filtering out the harmful virus. But that was false: the mask was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/razer-to-pay-out-over-1-million-in-refunds-over-its-misleading-and-hideous-zephyr-face-mask">never proven able to do that</a>. It wasn't even submitted to the federal agencies in the United States who could deem it worthy of the important N95 badge of reliability. In other words, this was a case of "deceptively" advertising a false product, say the Federal Trade Commission, who this week are sending out the refunds in the form of cheques and PayPal transfers to 6,764 people who bought the mask.</p>
<p>"Recipients will get a full refund," say the FTC in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-sends-more-1-million-full-refunds-customers-deceived-false-claims-n95-grade-zephyr-face-masks">a post explaining that the money is rolling out</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/razer-sold-bogus-n95-mask-for-100-in-2021-users-finally-get-refunds/">Ars Technica</a>). "Consumers should cash their check within 90 days, as indicated on the check, or redeem their PayPal payment within 30 days."</p>
<p>The RGB-lit face mask was tried out by tech reviewer Naomi Wu when it first appeared in November 2021. She pointed out the mask's weird design in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDzhGjbvVGc">a video</a> titled "The Razer Zephyr is completely useless - but it has potential". She argued that it was not medically certified as an N95 mask, even if it used the same components as other masks that had passed through the official grading process. Razer's PR department saw the reviewer's remarks and went into something of a tailspin, with the PR chief sending internal emails to ask about the mask, recognising that the unsubstantiated claims were a big problem.</p><p>"Do we have any certifications to back the N95-grade claim? Are we currently in the process of being officially certified/listed as a N95-grade product?... From a consumer and media POV, the key question here is: Does Zephyr offer the same protection as an N95 face mask? If it does, how can we prove that? And if it doesn't, our marketing is misleading."</p>
<p>At the same time, Razer PR were also pressuring the reviewer to change her video's title, which is quite overbearing behaviour from a press perspective. </p>
<p>But lo, the gondola of goofs does not end. During the mask's development, a company called Intertek were hired by Razer to test the mask's filtering capabilities. And thoses tests showed it did not live up to N95 standards. "[We] suggest not to indicate N95," an Intertek employee told Razer, "as it is not relevant to this product, and the claim will cause confusion." Razer seems to have ignored that recommendation.</p>
<p>The FTC, unsurprisingly, took a dim view of all this. "Accordingly, Razer was aware from Intertek, its own employees, and Ms. Wu that their claims regarding the Zephyr’s N95 status were misleading," said the trade body in their lawsuit.</p>
<p>The mask is no longer being sold by Razer, who soon agreed on the settlement of $1 million in refunds with the FTC. Despite all this evidence that piled up <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Razer-PACER-No1-Complaint.pdf">during the FTC case</a>, the hardware company have denied doing anything wrong. </p><p>"We disagree with the FTC’s allegations and did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement," they said in a statement following the FTC's ruling back in May. "It was never our intention to mislead anyone, and we chose to settle this matter to avoid the distraction and disruption of litigation and continue our focus on creating great products for gamers."</p>
<p>Great products? Well, let us be the judge of that. I first heard about the crap mask when James and Alice B (RPS in peace) discussed it on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OR5gfr5Yyxe4oOOzDE0q1?si=f6c5eb4bc85a42bc">the Electronic Wireless Show</a>, delivering some very funny takedowns of the hideous-looking accessory. </p>
<p>"I'm not going to mourn the Zephyr," said James, "besides the fact that it was overstating effectiveness against Covid at a time when people were literally dying of Covid, it's just a stupid product - I hate it. Never mind all the medical tests. It fails the test of: if you wore this while walking down the street would you look like a bellend?"</p>
<p>Razer have since turned their attention to Snap Tap, a keyboard feature that has been banned from several esports tournaments for giving high-level players an unfair advantage when it comes to pushin' buttons fast. Although hardware czar James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inside-snap-tap-the-new-hotness-keyboard-feature-outlawed-by-valve">thoroughly tried it out</a> and says us regular schmucks will experience no such boost. Another point to him for cutting through the noise. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
