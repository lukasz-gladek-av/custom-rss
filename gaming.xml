<p>Much of The Veilguard appears to center around factions, specifically in one you create alongside a group of companions. However, during character creation, players will have an opportunity to select one of the six main factions in the game as a starting point. It’s part of your backstory. Here’s a look at the Dragon Age: The Veilguard factions!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-faction-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Every Faction in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>



<p>Supposedly, the game will feature a reputation mechanic that affects how much each faction likes Rook. Your choices during character creation, specifically your faction origin, influence this metric greatly. However, your actions in the world will also change their outlook and willingness to help. Here are all six of the factions in Dragon Age: The Veilguard:</p>



<ul>
<li>Antivan Crows</li>



<li>Grey Wardens</li>



<li>Lords of Fortune</li>



<li>Mourn Watch</li>



<li>Shadow Dragons</li>



<li>Veil Jumpers</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, alongside choosing one of the game’s factions as your starting point, which determines who you were before meeting Varric and becoming part of The Veilguard, each of the game’s companions stems from one of the factions.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-do-factions-vary-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">How Do Factions Vary in Dragon Age: The Veilguard?</h2>



<p>Depending on which faction you select as your starting origin, you’ll receive different buffs, unique dialogue, and perhaps even different quests and pathways to select from in the game’s quests. There’s still a lot of mystery surrounding each of the game’s factions, along with how they interact with each other and the game world, however.</p>



<p>That said, they all play a role in the overarching story of The Veilguard. Our player character will interact with all six at some point in the story, either asking for their assistance or recruiting their members to your party.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-plucky-squire-is-clever-charming-mix-of-2d-and-3d-gameplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Sometimes, a video game feels like it was made just for you. That’s never true, of course, unless you’re a solo developer making your own indie game, but I reckon you know the feeling. It happens when a game just speaks to you, when the art, music, and gameplay feel tailor-made to your taste and you can’t keep a smile off your face while you’re playing it. That’s how I felt playing The Lucky Squire, the first game from All Possible Futures.</p><p>You step into the shoes of Jot, the titular Plucky Squire, a… well, squire of great renown who defends the land of Mojo, a place of unbridled creativity, from the malevolent Humgrump. Jot’s also something of a writer, and his skill with a quill means he turns his adventures into books that people adore. World-saving hero, beloved author? What more could a guy want?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Plucky Squire PlayStation Showcase 2023 Trailer</h3></div></output><p>The first thing you’ll notice about The Plucky Squire is its look. It’s quite literally set in a children’s storybook, with areas mapped to each page. When you move on, the page will turn, taking you to the next area or revealing a bit more of the story, and each “level” in The Plucky Squire is its own chapter. It’s a charming setup, but a great conceit is only half the battle. The Plucky Squire pulls everything together with beautiful sprite art that evokes childrens’ books you might find on the shelves of your local library. Everything is bright, colorful, and gorgeously animated. Seriously, I think this is one of the prettiest games I’ve ever seen. I mean, just look at it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Seriously, I think this is one of the prettiest games I’ve ever seen.</p></div><p>My three-hour demo started by sending me on a quest to help my wizard friend, a sunglasses-wearing, Merlin-from-The-Sword-in-the-Stone-looking dude named Moonbeard get some beeswax so he could press some more vinyls. What can I say? He likes to DJ. A suitably humble origin story, but every hero’s journey begins somewhere. The Plucky Squire starts off playing like the top-down Zelda games of yesteryear; Jot’s armed with little more than a sword, a rolling dodge, his wits, and a cunning hat with a quill fit for the Bard. You’ll cut down small goblins and bugs, but it feels as good as it looks.</p><h3>Master of Magics</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But that’s not all that Jot or The Plucky Squire is. There’s platforming segments that wouldn’t be out of place in a Mario game, and to nab the beeswax that Moonbeard needs, you’ll have to face down a honey badger in a boxing match that looks like it was plucked (get it? Do you get it?) straight out of Punch-Out. All right, Plucky Squire. I see you. Needless to say, Jot lands the knockout blow, because that's what heroes do.</p><p>Yes, everything’s coming up Jot until Humgrump starts causing trouble again. And that’s when things truly get wild. See, Humgrump has figured out that all the world’s a stage and you’re merely players. The story’s been written, which means he’s destined to lose every time he and Jot throw down, and he’s not a fan. Not one bit. Lucky for him, and unluckily for Jot, Humgrump’s a wizard. That means magic, and he uses it to kick Jot out of the book and into the real world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Suddenly, I wasn’t playing a 2D game anymore; I was playing a 3D game. The beautiful sprite art? Replaced by equally gorgeous 3D models that look like they’re visiting from the Switch remake of Link’s Awakening. I had to get home to Jot’s storybook, which meant platforming around Sam’s, the kid who owns this particular copy of The Plucky Squire, desk, all while avoiding Sam’s pet beetles.</p><h3>Mightier Than the Sword</h3><p>Jot may not be as powerful in the real world as he is in his storybook, but he soon picks up a new trick from a friendly bookworm named Page: the ability to enter any piece of paper as his sprite self, A Link Between Worlds-style, provided it has a portal to let him in, and bring objects into the book from the real world, and vice versa. Armed with the power to enter and exit the book and turn the pages at will when he’s on the desk thanks to a pair of special gloves called the Turn Gauntlets, you head back into the storybook.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Plucky Squire Screens</h3></div></output><p>And this is where The Plucky Squire really, and I mean really, gets interesting. Humgrump used his magic to really mess with the story of the book, but that’s not going to stop Jot. He's a writer, which means he can manipulate the words on the page, and by doing so, change the book, too. Can’t get to what you need in this forest? Swap the word “forest” for “ruins,” and you’ll be able to maneuver more easily. A huge bug blocking your path? Switch the word “huge” for “tiny” and you’ll get past him in no time.</p><p>What makes The Plucky Squire so delightful and unique are how all of these mechanics come together to create fun, interesting scenarios. Here’s an example: at one point, I needed to make it daylight on a page so I could get around the frogs who come out at night to sing. Now, I like a good chorus of frogs at night as much as the next man, but they were blocking the paths I needed to access. So I exited the book, went back to a previous page, grabbed the word “daytime,” turned back to the page I needed, jumped back into the book, and replaced “night” with “daytime” to let the sunshine in and move them out of the way. Of course, that caused new problems, but between my ability to enter and exit the page in multiple places and Jot’s skill as a wordsmith, I managed to get to the next page.</p><h3>A Real Page-Turner</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And the special, one-off section where I played Punch-Out against the honey badger? Stuff like that is everywhere. Once, in need of a bow, I jumped into a Legally Distinct Magic Card on Sam’s desk to do battle with an elven archer. She was certain I was in league with Humgrump, but I managed to convince her otherwise. The cool part, though, was that the whole sequence played out like a turn-based battle in an RPG. And later, when I had to use the bow to take out the bugs? I was essentially playing a lightgun game. All of these sections were fun and unique, and none overstayed their welcome. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All of the special, one-off gameplay sections were fun and unique, and none overstayed their welcome. </p></div><p>Of course, the core gameplay is no slouch either, whether you’re platforming around Sam’s desk or fighting goblins in the storybook. Oh, and did I mention that you can use the currency you find in the world to upgrade Jot with things like the ability to throw his sword or use a spin attack or buy concept art? Because you can, though there’s not enough to buy everything, at least not in the sections I played, which will hopefully open up interesting build choices in the full game. And then there’s the delightful supporting cast, from the funky-yet-wise Moonbeard to Jot’s friends, the powerful trainee witch Violet, who should probably believe in herself a little more, and the totally radical mountain troll, Thrash, who… well, just seems like he’s there to have a good time. Oh, and Minibeard, a mini version of Moonbeard who doles out puzzle advice. Minibeard rules.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>If I had to sum up my time with The Plucky Squire in two words, I’d go with “charming” and “unique.” You can pick out The Plucky Squire’s influences, but what I played was so well put together that it never stopped feeling like anything other than itself and its excellent sense of pacing meant it never overstayed its welcome. It’s a game that immediately clicked with me, and when my time with the demo was over, I was a little sad. It’s rare to find something that feels this unique, and I can’t get over the feeling of wonder I had while playing it. I hope All Possible Futures can maintain that feeling throughout the full game.</p><p>As any good writer will tell you, a good story takes time, and I’m more than willing to wait for All Possible Futures to write the final words and lay down their quill. In the meantime, I’ll be pouring over the chapters I’ve read, looking for things I missed, trying out the other upgrades, and just enjoying the vibe, waiting until the time comes to turn the next page.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It always feels like the video game voice acting community doesn’t receive enough credit for the work they produce. Without voice actors, where would the iconic characters we love so much stand today? They’d be long-forgotten, for the most part. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the Dragon Age: The Veilguard voice actors!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-voice-actors-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">All Voice Actors in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>



<p>As of right now, there’s a rather large cast of characters in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. There are a total of 17 characters with voice actors attached to the project currently, with more likely to come thanks to expansions and post-launch content. For now, here’s the voice acting cast:</p>



<ul>
<li>Miranda Raison – Cassandra Pentaghast</li>



<li>Claudia Black – Morrigan</li>



<li>Brian Bloom – Varric Tethras</li>



<li>Erika Ishii – Rook</li>



<li>Ali Hillis – Lace Harding</li>



<li>Jessica Clark – Neve Gallus</li>



<li>Bryony Corrigan – Rook</li>



<li>Jee Young Han – Bellara</li>



<li>Nick Boraine – Emmrich Volkarin</li>



<li>Gareth David-Lloyd – Solas</li>



<li>Ike Amadi – Davrin</li>



<li>Jin Maley – Taash</li>



<li>Zach Mendez – Lucanis Dellamorte</li>



<li>Alex Jordan – Rook</li>



<li>James Lewis – Strife</li>



<li>Jeff Berg – Rook</li>



<li>Mika Simmons – Queen Anora</li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll note multiple voice actors assigned to the role of “Rook.” That’s the main character, and during character creation, you can select from one of four available voices—two male and two female.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-voiced-companions-does-dragon-age-the-veilguard-have">How Many Voiced Companions Does Dragon Age: The Veilguard Have?</h2>



<p>In total, there are seven recruitable companions in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. They all include a unique voice, backstory, likes and dislikes, and fighting style to set them apart from each other. You’ll have an opportunity to build the party of your dreams as you found The Veilguard in a lengthy single-player campaign.</p>



<hr>



<p>Now that we know the official release date of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, it’s time to start delving into more of the game’s story, characters, and mechanics. We’ll have more about the game for you soon!</p>

Essentially, this chest armor empowers your abilities as you use them, so when you can quickly recharge them via the Prismatic Super, it can make you even deadlier. Feel free to give this roll of the Exotic a skip, as most of the essential stats are incredibly low.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 22</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 17</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 68</li></ul><h3>Mechaneer's Tricksleeves (Exotic Hunter gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4351669-destiny22024-08-1619-04-24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351669" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4351669-destiny22024-08-1619-04-24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351669"></a><figcaption>Mechaneer's Tricksleeves</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4351669-destiny22024-08-1619-04-24.jpg"></figure><p>Mechaneer's Tricksleeves rarely show up in Xur's inventory, so this is a rare chance to get Hunter gauntlets that offer a wide range of buffs for sidearms.

These were nerfed a bit a while back, but ideally, you'll still get out four grenades if you're quick enough, turning a battlefield into an active volcano. The stats on this Exotic are a bit odd because while they do boast high discipline and resilience, mobility is too high and recovery is extremely low. It's not the worst we've seen, and if you're building a grenade-centric Warlock loadout, these Sunbracers could still work decently.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 17</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience:

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

            <p>Baroque wilderness-builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a> has not been doing brilliantly since Ed Thorn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingale-early-access-review">described the launch early access version</a> as "a numbers grind disguised as a gaslamp <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game". We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update. </p><!--more-->
<p>In particular, I like the sound of the new "handcrafted" or "Storied realms", which sideline the procgen in order to make each of the game's dimensions "feel more unique and differentiated". They'll form part of a revised and more "structured" story campaign which "takes you across previously unexplored Realms from the corrupted woods of Sylvan's Cradle, to the gravity-torn desert of Welkin's Reach, and beyond".</p>
<p>Here's the skinny from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4347747997086214402">the Steam post in question</a> - it's the second of two blogs about Realms Rebuilt. "The Storied Realms are handcrafted Realms set within the existing biomes, each designed with its own theme, aesthetic, and challenges," the developers explain. "Storied Realms will be introduced as part of a new campaign that will arrive with the next update. As you progress through the main questline, you'll unlock unique Realm Cards - each leading to a new Storied Realm to discover and explore."</p>
<p>To access these Storied Realms, you'll set forth from a new Abeyance hub realm that houses a mystical Crossways - aka, a collection of ancient portals. The Abeyance Realm also contains locations where you can unlock tools and recipes, including new additions such as the bow and arrow.</p>
<p>It's a "big step forward" for Nightingale, the developers say, not least because it will apparently increase "the speed the studio team can create new biome and Realm content". Nightingale's existing, looser survival game format will persist in some form, however. "While Storied Realms become the defacto worlds for mainline quests, procedurally-generated Realms will still play an important part in your journey as a Realmwalker," the post continues. When not exploring a Storied Realm, you can still use the old Realm Cards to open portals to (read: set the parameters for) procgen Realms, which harbour resources and challenges.</p>
<p>Realms Rebuilt should go live this summer. There's a lot more to it: a new progression system, a Regency tileset for the people who wish Jane Austen novels had more pickaxes in them, increased structure limits due to memory optimisations, and assorted new gaspunk gadgetry. There's also a catch: you'll need to start a new character to sample the additions, though you'll be able to save your existing Respite Realms and any structures they contain to visit in offline mode. You can read more in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4347747997066982653">the first blog post</a>. Will it be a Final Fantasy 14-style turnaround? I'm not sure there's quite enough excitement for Nightingale as a concept, but you never know.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The conversation between Rhodes and Orton meandered through topics both heavy and lighthearted, with a tangent into the later’s ongoing gaming hobby. “I almost don’t even want to say,” Orton began. “I’m at like, now, keep in mind this game came out...I was out with spinal fusion surgery so I had a lot of time on my hands. I’ve got like six hundred hours on the game.”</p><p>That last part was delivered almost as a whisper with both hands clasped over his face. “I love that game,” he continued. “DLC just came out.” Real heads will remember that Orton previously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wwe-randy-orton-elden-ring-runes-pay-level-up-difficult-1850900520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wwe-randy-orton-elden-ring-runes-pay-level-up-difficult-1850900520">paid someone $1,000</a></span> for a bunch of easy runes to level up his Tarnished. </p><p>Rhodes then shared a confession of his own: that he hasn’t been keeping up with the latest frenzy of excitement around <em>Elden Ring</em> and its recent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC</a></span>. While far from the most gut-wrenching thing the two talked about, it was the most immediately relatable for anyone who’s ever been left behind by their gamer pal.</p><p>“Here’s how far things have come,” Rhodes said. “You asked me something about <em>Elden Ring </em>the other day. I didn’t lie to your face I just kind of went ‘yea...’ You mentioned you were playing and I’m like, ‘eh...I’m not really...’ you know like I didn’t know?” Instead of ragging on him, Orton came to his defense.</p><p>“Dude, you’re killing it and you don’t got the time, I understand why,” he responded. “I would love to chop it up about some <em>Elden Ring </em>with ya, trust me, I wish you were a fellow tarnished, but you’re not.” <br></p><p>Real friends accept one another no matter what, even if they don’t play <em>Elden Ring</em>. Go watch the whole interview. It’s great.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Black Myth: Wukong Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>"It's not uncommon to go from one boss fight into another and then another, and it's in these elaborate battles where Black Myth: Wukong shines," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/" data-ref-id="1900-6418269">Black Myth: Wukong review</a>. The moments in between, however, aren't quite as strong, sometimes devolving into aimless tedium. But its satisfying combat and unique variety of boss fights mostly manages to overcome these flaws."</p><p>If you're looking to buy the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-pc-preorders-discounted-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch/1100-6525868/" data-ref-id="1100-6525868">Black Myth: Wukong preorders are currently discounted</a> at Fanatical.</p><ul><li>Game: Black Myth: Wukong</li><li>Platform: PC, PS5</li><li>Developer: Game Science</li><li>Release Date: August 20</li><li>Price: $60</li></ul><h2>GameSpot -- 8/10</h2><p>"Black Myth: Wukong is an uneven game where the highlights often outnumber the lowlights. Its triumphant boss battles and fast-paced combat make up for the stale moments in between, where bland level design and a scarcity of enemies will have you clamoring for the next face-off with a deadly Yaoguai. I appreciate that it's not just another souls-like in what is now a crowded genre, and the choice to go for a boss gauntlet is unexpected and, honestly, quite refreshing. It's disappointing that it falters outside of its cinematic clashes against mighty beasts, but designing this many rousing boss battles while avoiding a sense of fatigue is no mean feat and deserves praise." -- <em>Richard Wakeling</em> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/" data-ref-id="1900-6418269">Full review</a>]</p><h2>PC Gamer -- 87/100</h2><p>"Wukong is one of the most joyful action RPGs I've played simply for how lovingly it treats its world and characters and, by extension, how much it clearly wants me to love them too. It worked: Punchy combat aside, I wanted to keep working through each area to meet another weird little creature with a mysterious quest or to get jumped by another animal who learned MMA." -- <em>Tyler Colp</em> [<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/black-myth-wukong-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>IGN -- 8/10</h2><p>"As GameScience’s debut action game, Black Myth: Wukong is mostly a great success, despite some major technical black marks and localization issues that are likely to cause some frustrations at launch. Combat is fantastic thanks to a great balance of careful resource management and lightning-fast, twitch-reaction gameplay that tested my skills as much as Elden Ring ever has, despite being a more traditional action game than FromSoftware’s style." -- <em>Mitchell Saltzman</em> [<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>GamesRadar -- 4/5</h2><p>"With strong combat and a fascinating world that mostly rewards exploration, Black Myth: Wukong is a fun action RPG that feels like the modern God of War games viewed through the lens of Chinese mythology." -- <em>Austin Wood</em> [<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Polygon -- Unscored</h2><p>"Black Myth: Wukong is an astounding triumph, one that blends a story celebrating Chinese and other East Asian cultures with an original retelling that has resonant themes, all complemented by spectacular design and exhilarating combat. While the narrative is confusing at first--as I can personally attest to--it nonetheless encourages you to embrace that sense of strangeness and wonder as you venture into distant lands, much like a certain journey written centuries ago that has stood the test of time." -- <em>Jason Rodriguez</em> [<a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/440941/black-myth-wukong-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>SiliconEra -- 8/10</h2><p>"Overall, Black Myth Wukong is a gorgeous game that has taken great efforts to make an interesting and exciting reimagining of one of East Asia’s most popular myths. The game is solid, and outside of frame drops, otherwise performs very well. And it’s probably one of the best action RPG I’ve played all year." -- <em>Kazuma Hashimoto</em> [<a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-black-myth-wukong-is-a-gorgeous-chinese-epic/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Rock Paper Shotgun -- Unscored</h2><p>"Black Myth: Wukong is a triumph. A surprising triumph in the sense that I can't quite believe it's as good as its drip feed of screens and trailers looked over the last few years. It's a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox." --<em> Ed Thorn</em> [<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p>

Video gaming's premier horn honker, Trombone Champ, is bringing its comedic rhythm-tooting to virtual reality helmets - meaning PC, PlayStation VR 2, and Meta Quest players might want to pucker up in preparation for a vigorous tromboning session this autumn.
</p>
<p>
Trombone Champ: Unflattened, as the new VR version of the 2022 rhythm-action sensation is known, is one of the first official VR adaptations from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-flat2vr-studio-launches-dedicated-to-vr-experiences-of-flatscreen-games">Flat2VR Studios</a> - the developer comprising of modders behind unofficial VR versions of games like Half-Life 2 and Doom.
</p>
<p>
Created in conjunction with original Trombone Champ developer Holy Wow Studios, Trombone Champ: Unflattened is set to feature more than 50 songs across its single-player campaign, with tracks including Ode to Joy, Sakura Sakura, God Save the King, and more.

<p>
It also features mixed reality support, additional (and customisable) trombones for parp-fiends to unlock, cards to collect, and a range of animated 3D environments to stand in while players honk to their heart's content - such as the opulent concert hall featured in Trombone Champ: Unflattened's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eolsfo_9yIo">announcement trailer</a> above.
</p>
<p>
Trombone Champ: Unflattened doesn't have an exact release date yet, but it'll be causing a racket on Steam VR, PSVR2, and Meta Quest this autumn. And if you haven't yet familiarised yourself with the original Trombone Champ yet, I think Eurogamer contributor Liv Ngan said it best when she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2022-trombone-champ-was-the-best-way-to-experience-failure-and-fun-together">wrote</a>, "It's safe to say that 2022 has been another weird year for us all."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gardens-in-partnership-with-pragma-for-online-multiplayer-support/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gardens is a <a href="https://gardens.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputable games studio</a> with a background in games such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-the-infernal-hordes-now-live/">Diablo IV</a>, Skyrim, Journey, Firewatch, and many more across the team's resumes. Gardens has teamed up with Pragma, the backend game engine that built platforms for some of the biggest live-service games, to get the best online multiplayer support possible for their newest game. These games include League of Legends, Destiny 2, and Plants vs Zombies 2.</p>
<p>By teaming up with Pragma, they can continue developing their unannounced project without worrying about technical limitations. "It has been really great working with our team of game designers to get all of their ideas and come back with implementations. And I am much more flexible and can accommodate their unique requests with Pragma because they gave me an extensible system that lets me not give just a one-size-fits-all answer," said Serge Knystautas, Head of Engineeering at Gardens Interactive.</p>
<p>By teaming up with Pragma, Gardens now has a platform they can extend without building the entire engine from scratch or investing too many resources into maintaining it. This is because the Pragma Backend Game Engine gives the developers a single backend solution that stays consistent and has all the basic tools and needs for an online live service game. Not only this, but Pragma allows Gardens to customize the tools to their liking so that they can be as basic or as sophisticated as they want.</p>
<p>Not much is known about Gardens' upcoming project, as it doesn't have a name yet. However, it is said to build on the special ways members of the team have designed shared online experiences in the past by allowing players to cross paths and join each other's journeys by shape-shifting and exploring fantasy wilds.</p>
<p>It is said that the company is edging closer to revealing the game title and giving the interested audience more information about what to expect from the upcoming project. Still, at the moment, the information is minimal.</p>
<p>We know that some people working on this project worked on games such as Sky: Children of the Light and Journey, both of which utilize live-service online gameplay uniquely compared to other live-service games.</p>
<p>Gardens was founded in 2021 by Chriss Bell, Lexie Dostal, and Stephen Bell, and the team has grown exponentially since its opening. They had independent backer funding, raising $4.5 million in July 2021 in a Seed round led by Transcend Fund. Additionally, they raised $31.1 million in Series A funding led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Krafton.</p>

            <p>
There you are, rambling through the woods of Interactive Entertainment with an empty pack and a spring in your step. Here I am, lying in wait behind a tree. Wham! Bam! You reel back in consternation as I bounce into the path and clobber you with a sack containing no less than eight venerable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition">Baldur's Gate</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue's Trader</a> - well over a thousand hours worth of dungeons, dragons, dicerolls, dwarven shopkeepers and many other things I refuse to spend time alliterating, all of which will (currently) set you back just £32.07. 
</p>
<p>
Were you planning to spend this weekend playing some cute two-hour artgame sideshow, without any levelling at all? Shut up, you DOLT. You will play what the nice journalist tells you to play! Best lay in extra caffeine tablets, because it's going to take you till Monday just to get through the character creators alone.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The eight-game deluge in question is <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/beamdog-owlcat-rpg-masters">the latest Humble Bundle</a>, which is made up of RPGs and RPG remasters from Owlcat and Beamdog. The most expensive iteration of the bundle earns you Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (and its season passes), Pathfinder: Kingmaker Enhanced Plus edition (and its season pass), Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition: Complete Adventures, Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate 1 Enhanced Edition, Planescape: Torment Enhanced Edition, and Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition. That's in addition to some DLC and a discount voucher for Beamdog's Mythforce.
</p>
<p>
If the idea of buying all of those at once makes your ears catch fire and spin like Roman Candles, I guess you could just spend three bob for Planescape and Icewind Dale. Or around a fiver for both of those plus the two Baldur's Gates and Pathfinder: Kingmaker. I am a forgiving man.</p>
<p>You could also hold off purchasing till next week, and while away the weekend playing the aforesaid artgame you're being so <em>precious</em> about - the latest Humble Bundle runs for 19 more days, though as always, the price will change over time. Which artgame is this, by the way? I personally don't have much time for massive RPGs nowadays, though I'm always tempted when I see them going for a song. Honestly, this "ambushing you in the woods" thing was actually a cry for help. Please, please come back. Recommend me a smaller game I can play instead of buying that bundle. I'm begging you.

It’s the dominating thought of my hours spent sampling the sequel’s new maps, weapons, loadouts, movement, abilities, and more. Despite the fact that it literally chugged on my PC (my own setup’s inadequacy, not the game’s), everything about it was quick. I barely had time to consider my loadout before I was brusquely pushed into the match. Once the action began, everything became a bit of a blur before coming to an abrupt stop mere moments later. Bullets flew, people spilled out of portals, and within about two minutes, the first round was over before I could even make sense of the changes <em>Splitgate 2 </em>was making to the gameplay I’d loved in the original.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196766" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Do I Suck At FF7 Rebirth's Piano Mini-Game?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="196766,196163,195358" data-current="196766"><div><p>Why Do I Suck At FF7 Rebirth's Piano Mini-Game?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196766/196766_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196766/196766_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196766/196766_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196766/196766_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22321.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>From everything that Ian Proulx, the game’s creative director, shared in our short briefing prior to the preview, he and the team at 1047 certainly seemed like they wanted to amp things up like this. In that regard, I’d consider <em>Splitgate 2 </em>a pretty immediate success. The <em>Splitgate</em> brand of rapid-fire skirmishes and tactical portal placement is as polished as it’s ever been. The original game always felt good enough, but the sequel feels <em>tight</em>. There’s just a part of me that worries that, in scaling everything up, it may have lost a little bit of what made the original such a knockout.<br></p><p><em>Splitgate </em>was touted as the meeting between <em>Halo </em>and <em>Portal</em>, two widely beloved and entirely different series of first-person games. But something they do have in common was this kind of space that either gave you to find your footing, whether it be in an online deathmatch or in a room you’re inspecting for puzzle solutions. <em>Halo </em>matches aren’t drawn out, but they also aren’t over in the blink of an eye, and <em>Portal </em>doesn’t enforce any time constraints, giving you all the time you need to solve its conundrums. Both were great at providing this sandbox for possibility and experimentation, and <em>Splitgate </em>did a decent job of channeling that spirit. That no longer feels like the case with <em>Splitgate 2</em>.</p><p>The original game wasn’t slow, but it felt methodical at times. Maps weren’t sprawls, but they had nooks and crannies that lent themselves to different kinds of encounters. It paid off to be surgical rather than gung-ho. <em>Splitgate </em>may have been a little floaty, but that was a fun alternative to <em>Call of Duty</em>’s emphasis on twitchy movement. <em>Splitgate 2</em> abandons some of these tenets and falls in line with a number of ongoing trends in similar games, bucking what made the original so unique at the time in favor of some bid at even wider adoption. </p><p>I didn’t <em>love </em>how <em>Splitgate 2 </em>seems to forget what made the original game work for me. Team Deathmatch, as an example, used to be one extensive round in which the first team to 50 kills won. Now, <em>Splitgate 2 </em>has split it into several rounds with a maximum of 15 kills, and the first team to 3 wins takes the whole match. That meant that matches were over lightning fast. Before I could even get accustomed to the weapon I was using or the unique abilities of my loadout and class, the match was done.</p><p>Additionally, there’s a death mechanic that feels especially punitive. The more you die, which happens quite fast in <em>Splitgate 2</em>, the more time gets added to your respawn timer. The more I fumbled, the more I was denied the time and space to sort myself out in-game and establish a flow.</p><p>The other mode available in the preview, Hotzone, is similarly quick. A king-of-the-hill type mode, Hotzone’s conceit is that progression on the objective is shared between both teams. That means that you could come within a second of capturing, but if the enemy team takes you out and jumps on the point, they can claim it for themselves after only standing on it for a second. The idea appears to be to add some kind of pressure to act impulsively, but without any real way to combat the possibility of a sudden takeover, it just appears like a mean-spirited mechanic that can be manipulated to force early wins with little contention. </p><p>To aid things along, a lot of smaller aspects of <em>Splitgate </em>have been fine-tuned in the sequel to facilitate this faster and more aggressive pace. There is now a slide function, and your jetpack feels more propulsive than before, which should help you cover more ground. Portals are now tied to a single button, and the game has a system built to essentially guess which portal you meant to place down in order to eliminate some of the thinking that’d previously go into such a process. Portals can also be placed on top of enemies’ portals now, encouraging you to be bold and take the flank route more often.</p><p>On some level, these changes are absolutely welcome as quality-of-life features that just reduce the amount of inputs necessary to do anything. When taken into account among the wider changes to the game, though, such as the introduction of factions—classes with abilities like a wall-hack scan, a burst of speed, or a deployable shield—I worry that <em>Splitgate 2 </em>may be an entirely different game.</p><p>I love a good competitive shooter, but I think what a lot of people adored about <em>Splitgate</em> was how light-hearted and casual it <em>could</em> feel, with room for ventures into the more hardcore modes and lobbies if desired. Maybe <em>Splitgate 2 </em>will make a similar distinction, but from what was on offer for me, it seemed to lean entirely into the latter, abandoning a large audience that just wants something fun to pick up and play. I don’t like feeling that I have to be locked in every time I play a game, but that’s what playing <em>Splitgate 2 </em>for an afternoon felt like.</p><p>Which isn’t to say the game’s poor or bad, but that it feels like <em>Splitgate 2 </em>lost itself in this transformation. If this is the final form that 1047 hoped for out of the original <em>Splitgate</em>, well, then maybe that first game was a bit of a fluke. If you want another movement-heavy and highly competitive shooter with a unique central premise, <em>Splitgate 2 </em>certainly fits the bill. If you were drawn to the casual playfulness of the original title and expected the sequel to double down on that, though, you may be in for disappointment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Movie</em>.” But how are 4DX screenings created and programmed? And how did this exhilarating way to watch movies come to be? I sat down with Paul Kim, senior vice president of content and production at CJ 4DPLEX, a Seoul-based cinema tech company pioneering the medium, to find out more about the technology and the impressive team behind it. </p><h2 id="h23012"><a id=""></a><strong>The rise of 4DX</strong></h2><p>“Movies are a huge part of the entertainment culture in Korea,” Kim says over video call. “We had so many big movie theaters that ran 24 hours a day, because people go to see them at four in the morning. And any sort of new technology, a new way to view movies, [the Korean audience is] always leading into it. 4DX just made a lot of sense.” </p><p>The first 4DX movie was 2009’s largely forgotten <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em>, shown at the CGV Sangam theater in Seoul, South Korea. But the popularity of the medium skyrocketed after <em>Avatar </em>debuted in the same theater several months later—since then, the 4DX team has coded “close to 80 films a year,” according to Kim. Part of the allure of a 4DX viewing (which Kim admits “isn’t for everyone”) is the immersiveness, but he suggests there’s something else that makes it extra-special.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="346b6659113a094b0ef7b2daa235ba70" data-recommend-id="image://346b6659113a094b0ef7b2daa235ba70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A picture of the 4DX Theater in Regal Times Square.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“You’ll sit down and there’s always a good amount of people who have never seen a film in 4DX, and the first thing or shake happens and you just hear giggles throughout the entire theater, and that’s almost cathartic, right?” He continues, “That’s the whole point, you’re in a movie theater, you’re there to enjoy yourself, and everyone’s looking around saying ‘is it okay for me to laugh, is it okay for me to enjoy it that much?’ But everyone’s doing that, and it becomes this communal thing.”<br></p><p>There are currently 678 4DX theaters spanning 65 countries, and though America didn’t get its first one until 2014, it currently has the biggest one in the world: Regal Times Square, which boasts nearly 300 seats (an impressive feat considering how large 4DX chairs have to be). I tell Kim this is where I saw <em>Twisters</em>. “It’s massive. Unheard of,” he says, smiling. </p><h2 id="h23013"><a id=""></a><strong>How 4DX movie screenings are made</strong></h2><p>There’s something I am desperate to understand about 4DX, something that’s been nagging me since I walked out of that theater blissfully dazed: how the hell the movies are programmed. It would certainly seem like such a massive, global corporation would utilize the highest-end tech to streamline and speed up the process of translating a film to the 4DX format, but Kim assures me it’s far more bespoke than that. </p><p>“There’s a misconception that this is an automated process of sorts. It’s not. We have a full team of artists, or editors as we like to call them, that work on every 4DX film,” Kim explains. “We get the final cut of the film, or even sometimes a work-in-progress version, weeks before the initial release. Our editors will then sit down in front of their computers, we have software that works with our equipment, and they will go scene-by-scene. At times, when there’s a lot of action like in <em>Twisters</em>, they’ll go frame-by-frame if necessary to ensure that every little bump of the truck, every lightning strike, matches and syncs properly. I have to give credit to the team because it is such a creative process, it’s not just something that happens, it takes a lot of time and work and labor and effort.”</p><figure id="" data-id="2580245fa18dcf24d0f4af05f895aa37" data-recommend-id="image://2580245fa18dcf24d0f4af05f895aa37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Daisy Edgar-Jones and Anthony Ramos on the official Twisters 4DX poster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Daisy Edgar-Jones and Anthony Ramos on the official Twisters 4DX poster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal Pictures / CJ 4DPLEX</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2580245fa18dcf24d0f4af05f895aa37" data-recommend-id="image://2580245fa18dcf24d0f4af05f895aa37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Daisy Edgar-Jones and Anthony Ramos on the official Twisters 4DX poster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kim outlines the opening <em>Twisters</em> sequence, and how the team designed the 4DX experience for it. “There’s a calm before the storm where you’re introduced to the characters in their trucks. And as the tornado started to build up, we had to think about, ‘well, who’s the character right now that we want to emphasize? Is that the truck driving away from the tornado or the tornado [itself]?’ And at a certain point we decided, ‘okay, the truck we’re going to de-emphasize, because right now it’s all about the tornado,’,” he explains. “It’s just about which character we want to highlight—and by character, it doesn’t necessarily have to be a human character.”<br></p><p>It takes the 4DX editors about two weeks to program the experience for a two-hour film. “On average, you have two teams working on this,” Kim says. “One team works specifically on the chairs, the motion of them and the vibrations. The other team then layers on top the effects, the water, the air, the strobe lights, the fog, all of that. And then there is an art director, or as we call them, the lead producer. And they watch all of that, like a conductor of an orchestra, and make sure all of the pieces work together cohesively and are additive to the story.” </p><p>The 4DX team then brings in a producer on the film to see the final cut and offer suggestions. Kim says this part of the process is always incredibly fruitful, like with <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, which released earlier this year. “There’s a sequence where there’s a device right, a thumper to call the sandworms. And when there’s a close-up of the thumper, we added a vibration in the seats. But when it’s away and you don’t see it, we stopped that vibration because it was no longer on-screen. One of the <em>Dune </em>editors came in and said, ‘you know what would be really cool? Even if it’s not on screen, just keep it thumping, keep the vibration going…it’s in the background, you know it’s happening, there’s a sandworm, you know it’s coming, but it gives that little extra bit of anticipation and suspense.’ That was the coolest idea ever.”<br></p><figure id="" data-id="8c47a715795b4d87548abd43f81f5637" data-recommend-id="image://8c47a715795b4d87548abd43f81f5637" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Multiple sandworms streak towards people running on the sand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Multiple sandworms streak towards people running on the sand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

She’s been coding or editing 4DX films for 15 years, she’s done over 315 by herself, she knows this thing inside and out,” he says. “And she was telling me that she bought a gyroscope and accelerometer for <em>Godzilla Minus One</em>, a lot of which takes place on boats or ships. She rented a boat and went out with the gyroscope to see how much it would sway, and she went go-kart racing with the accelerometer to see how much force is applied when turning tight curves. It’s not just, ‘okay it looks like it’s turning left, so let’s make the chairs turn left.’ It’s the nuance, there’s a real sense of genuine care that goes into designing 4DX for every film.”<br></p><p>Kim tells me that <em>Twisters </em>in 4DX was a “match made in heaven,” but the team was still pleasantly surprised at the hype. “It just took with audiences, it made sense, as you said, it’s a perfect storm.” But he thinks there’s another new movie that is a must-see in the 4DX: <em>Alien: Romulus</em>. “I highly recommend you see that in 4DX,” he says, grinning mischievously. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-is-a-solid-sequel-but-with-a-big-esports-influence/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Splitgate has always had a special place in my heart since I first played it in mid-2019. It felt familiar and fluid thanks to its Halo-esque gameplay, and its portal mechanics gave something new and exciting to the arena shooter genre. It was simply fun, and after playing for several hours during a recent playtest of Splitgate 2, I can safely say that Splitgate is back with a very strong sequel, but its changes to cater towards Esports may be a turn-off to some.</p>



<p>I’ll be the first to admit that Splitgate 2’s initial gameplay reveal was a fairly big eyebrow-raiser for me. Four-on-four matches, factions, abilities, and perks, all while being commentated by esports professionals, instantly told me where the game was heading. It felt like changes were being made for the sake of the esports appeal rather than continuing where Splitgate had left off with pure mayhem and fun, and after my time playing, that initial feeling still looms, despite the game being a ton of fun to play.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a pre-playtest briefing, 1047 Games CEO and founder Ian Proulx told us that Splitgate 2 was the studio’s “game of their dreams,” which had to have the two fundamental parts that made the original game a success: portals and great gunplay. The gunplay is still stellar, and the new sliding mechanic adds to the overall fluidity in movement, creating some feel-good moments as you zip around the map in and out of portals. </p>



<p>Portals have also been tweaked and improved from the first title, from only needing a single button to use both portals to how a teammate’s portals will now move left or right to give your own portal room to spawn. These improvements limit hesitation and make Splitgate 2 similar in chaos to its predecessor despite the matches seeing a reduction in players.</p>



<p>One of the biggest causes for concern I saw from the community was the addition of Factions in Splitgate 2. It was an initial concern for me, too. But after playing, they do work incredibly well. The game has three different factions: Aeros, Meridian, and Sebrask, all of whom have different abilities, weapons, and perks. Thanks to Splitgate’s unique gameplay loop, not one faction screamed out as being better than the other during my time playing, but the new Faction-based system pushes players to play as a team rather than just running solo. </p>



<p>During the playtest, we had two different game modes to choose from: Team Deathmatch and Hotzone, both of which were round-based. Hotzone is a King of the Hill mode where teams have to cap two hills to win the round, and to win the match, teams have to win three rounds. An additional twist with Hotzone is that the hills take 20 seconds of shared capture time, meaning that, in theory, your team can control the hill for 19 seconds but have that point taken away from you if the enemy team captures the last second. This gameplay decision was described to us in a pre-playtest briefing to “encourage teamplay” and to create those “big moments.” It’s arguably a perfect gameplay decision for two full teams that talk to each other. However, for someone playing solo with three teammates without mics, it created immensely frustrating moments.</p>



<p>The round-based system is also incorporated in Team Deathmatch, with the first team reaching 15 kills winning the round, with 3 rounds to win the match. Rounds are so that players can change their faction if needed during a match, which for a mode like Hozone made a lot of sense, but for a mode like Team Deathmatch just sucked all momentum out of play. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Overall, Splitgate 2 is a very solid sequel. It’s built on the strong foundations that the original game left behind, with a prestigious AAA feel, beautiful maps, and some great improvements to gameplay. But after the playtest, I have been pondering whether some of its bigger changes to seemingly chase esports and competitive will be a turnoff to those who loved the original’s simplicity. While I still have the itch to play again, I hope the game offers a more casual playlist on its final release.</p>

<p>Any progress you make in the demos will carry over to the full game.</p>
<p>In Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag. There's an eerie smiling face drawn on it, much like the victims of Emio, the Smiling man, a killer of urban legend.</p>
<p>"Playing as an assistant private investigator, you are tasked with helping police solve this crime, which is reminiscent of a series of unsolved murders from 18 years ago. Has a serial killer returned, or is this the work of a copycat?" the description teases.</p>
<p>"Are these crimes inspired by the Smiling Man story, or the origin of it?"</p> <div>

<p>After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-uploaded-a-bizarre-horror-game-teaser">brief glimpse</a> that got horror fans very excited last month, it's now confirmed that Nintendo's mysterious horror game is in fact a new entry in the Famicom Detective Club series.</p>
<p>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will launch on 29th August. If you're unfamiliar with the retro adventure series, this is a Nintendo-developed franchise originally released in the late 1980s. Two games were released, but only in Japan. And there they remained for more than 30 years, until a Nintendo Switch remake of the pair launched worldwide in 2021.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
