            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> is finally out after a long and difficult development — and despite some bright spots, the game really shows its age.</p><p>Nintendo has a long and celebrated history of doing things its own way. During the original Switch era, going back to<em> Super Mario Odyssey</em> in 2017, Nintendo has focused on bringing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/707449/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-nintendo-design-open-world">open-world style exploration elements</a> to many of its major releases. That strategy has worked very well, breathing new life into storied franchises like <em>Donkey Kong</em>, <em>Mario Kart</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. But it hasn’t quite added the same revolutionary touch to <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>.</p><p>In all of the other games that got the open-world-style treatment, those elements were additive to the experience. Exploring vast stretches of Hyrule in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a></em>, for example, inevitably led to some kind of new discovery — a shrine to crack, a korok to uncover, or a treasure to find. We had never seen Hyrule rendered like that on a Nintendo console, and it was neat to traipse about it and take it all in.</p><p>In <em>Beyond</em>, though, that kind of exploration is more of a chore than a treat. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch">In his review</a>, Andrew Webster described the desert hub world Samus travels through as “a bare and boring place.” There are things to discover, but they’re no more than mile markers on a long stretch of desert.</p><p>The problem is that for the type of game <em>Metroid</em> is, free-roaming exploration doesn’t work, or at least not in this execution. In the early hours of <em>Beyond</em>, while zipping across the desert on the extremely cool-looking VI-O-LA bike, I encountered a wrecked structure belching smoke. After taking care of a few enemies, I looked around to see if there was any puzzle to solve or treasure to take, only to find nothing. There seemed to be <em>something</em> higher up that I could interact with, but I couldn’t reach it. So I left.</p><p>A Metroidvania gates progression behind power-ups. When you encounter a roadblock, that’s typically your signal to come back later. That works in a closed environment like the biomes of Viewros, the new planet Samus explores, but it kills momentum in an open world because there’s no guaranteed payoff for your time. It makes the world feel emptier in a way it didn’t for <em>Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. In those games, I knew that my noodling would net me something more than bug gunk all over my sleek biker suit power armor. I could probably return to that crash site when I have whatever required power, but I don’t feel compelled to go back.</p><p>I’m also really annoyed with <em>Beyond</em>’s illusion of choice. In your first time zooming across the desert, a colleague named Mackenzie, speaking with an authority that sounds like a message to the player from the developers, says that you can go wherever you want next. But when I did that, I immediately hit a wall of fire I could not pass. It felt like the developers were playing a prank on me, like, “lol, we <em>said</em> you could go anywhere but we really want you to come back when you have the right stuff.” <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> wouldn’t do me like that.</p><p>Another element that demonstrates just how late Nintendo is to the party is the companions. They are all too quick to tell Samus what to do, where to go, and what she’s doing wrong. That kind of guideposting was and still is all the rage in big-budget action-adventure games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/20/14665114/horizon-zero-dawn-review-ps4"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a>, and it can be helpful when you get stuck. But part of <em>Metroid</em>’s appeal is using your wits and skills to figure shit out on your own.</p><div><p>I don’t need you to show me how to get back to Fury Green. I’ve been there several times already! </p></div><p>All that goes out the window, though, when Mackenzie, your primary companion, chimes in with tips unannounced and unasked for, condescending to both me and Samus. Samus Aran is the baddest bounty hunter this side of Zebes, a fact everyone around her acknowledges except when it’s time for her to do the very things they all rightfully venerate her for. No, Mackenzie, I don’t need you to show me how to get back to Fury Green. I’ve been there several times already!</p><div><p>Nintendo’s biggest mistake with <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, though, is that it feels too much like the original <em>Metroid Prime </em>trilogy. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Nintendo’s other recent major mascot titles is that they all share the same basic structure of their predecessors, but have some new twist that makes the old feel new. With <em>Odyssey</em>, it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">Cappy’s transformation powers</a>. In<em> Tears of the Kingdom</em>, it was the Ultrahand powers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24115898/tears-of-the-kingdom-physics-gameplay-design-gdc-2024">working in tandem with the physics engine</a> to create <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23734533/zelda-totk-controls-weapons-fuse-rewiring-brain">unique emergent gameplay experiences</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23737921/tears-of-the-kingdom-bridge-physics-game-devs-explain/">that felt magical</a>. In <em>Bananza</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">the simplicity of being able to break nearly everything on screen</a> did the same.</p></div><p>Nintendo gave you weird, often simple tools and let you loose on the world, and it resulted in some of the best games the company has ever made. There’s none of that in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>. The psychic powers Samus gets are mere remixes of powers she’s had before. A psychic lasso is just a spicy grapple beam.</p><p><em>Beyond</em> isn’t without merit, because there’s still nothing quite like the <em>Prime</em> brand of 3D exploration. But it seems that eight years and a development reboot should yield something more impressive than this, especially considering the treatment Nintendo has given its other franchises. In <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, the old doesn’t feel new, and the new doesn’t feel good.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/838428/metroid-prime-4-analysis-open-world-nintendo]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you were Senior Floor Manager of Earth, and a weird planet innocently appeared on the fringe of our solar system, what would you do? I would probably not zip out there and plant a factory on that planet, in much the same way that I wouldn’t high-five a bear-shaped shadow on the edge of a campsite. But I am not the modder behind beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a> mod Ultracube, who is now part of game developer Dubious Design.</p>
<p>The latter have just announced the very Factorio-esque Substructure, which is being published by Hooded Horse. A new Hooded Horse joint tends to get a certain automatic level of attention round these parts. We’re partial to factory sims, too. Substructure seals the deal by sort of being a horror game as well. I mean, they’re not actually calling it that, but it seems creepy as balls. The trailer below sees whole segments of production line sinking below the surface like Atlantis.</p>

<p>It’s a factory sim in which you slowly colonise the layers of the aforesaid weird planet, constructing new production lines on each level. As players of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> will know, striking the earth tends to make it strike back, but there <em>is</em> a lot of cool stuff down there you can use for upgrades. Please do your best to get hold of that stuff, while avoiding the stuff that has teeth.</p><p>You can expect both the routine smokestacks and industrialised agriculture, which makes for a relatively picturesque factory sim. You can program the elevators, though the press release doesn’t go into details, and there’s co-op too. As you’d expect given the dev’s pedigree, the press release makes a big deal of the mod support. “From day one, add new resources, buildings, or just balance the game as desired!” it trills.</p>
<p>You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3012600/Substructure">Steam</a>. A little more on the Dubious Design: they’re based in the UK, and consist of two people. “May the future be dubious,” the developers declare in announcement materials. I like the energy, but I would like the future to at least contain an early access release date.</p>

            <p>Crank up the pounding metal riffs and make sure you're covered in spikes. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/carmageddon">Carmageddon</a>: Rogue Shift, a roguelite-infused take on the old school automotive murder-battler from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redout">Redout</a> devs 34BigThings, has just been revealed and is set to smash onto the scene early next year.</p>

<p>You're a person in a big spiky car with guns or missiles. The folks you're racemurdering as you drive around are also in big spiky cars with guns or missiles. One of these 15 big spiky cars with upgradeable guns or missiles is a not-quite VW camper van dubbed "Iron Lady". Finally, a chance for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/send-thatcher-back-to-hell-in-this-new-doom-2-mod-today">Margaret Thatcher's evil powers</a> to be used for good.</p>
<p>"By day, the skyline smolders; by night, zombie hordes - the Wasted - flood every avenue and turn them into kill-zones," reads the synopsis. "Your only way out is to win the Carmageddon: a chain of lethal underground races whose champion earns a shot at the last spaceport beyond the mountains."</p>
<p>Making that escape means fighting your way through roguelike runs of car murder, battling through districts bossed by the likes of "corrupted enforcers, supermutated Wasteds, and monstrous war machines". Between runs, you spend beatcoins on building the perfect combo of car, weapon, and perks. There are 13 different kinds of deathbringer, including shotguns, railguns, and lasers if you want to get all fancy. Progression's permanent, and it sounds as if you'll be reincarnated as a slightly stronger driver each time you pop your clogs.</p><p>Having taken in the trailer, it looks like it could offer me the sort of Wreckfesty rush I regularly crave, though that'll largely depend on how satisfying the cars handle and smash together. The weapons'll also need to be sufficiently weighty. As of writing, I've only ever given the demo of 34BigThings's Wipeouty spaceship racer Redout a go, and I recall that not quite scratching my itch as much as its classic inspiration in what was a very limited sample, to be fair.</p>
<p>Rogue Shift's certainly one I'll be keeping an eye on, though, because its premise sounds like it could be killer if executed as well as your average murdercampervan missile barrage.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Outer Worlds 2 Gave Me Exactly What I Wanted From An RPG Inventory System And I Hated It]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-rpg-inventory-weight-encumbered-2000650641</link>
            <guid>1373527</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I was running around somewhere in Golden Ridge,</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"> <i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i></a><span>’s second major location, when I dared to look up a question that had been tickling the back of my brain for several hours: Does </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> have an inventory carry capacity limit?</span></p> <p><span>I was afraid to learn the answer. The odds that it was what I wanted to hear were not in my favor. What I wanted is practically unheard of in Western-style action role-playing games. But there were encouraging signs from the first dozen or so hours of my initial playthrough that this time might be a rare exception. I’d made it through Paradise Island, the game’s first open area, without sparing a thought about how much loot I was carrying. I couldn’t find the genre-typical “infinite home base storage chest” anywhere on my ship. I scoured the game’s inventory menu for tiny numbers I might have missed with a more casual glance. Nothing.</span></p>

 <p><span>Cautiously, I typed my question into a search engine. And there it was, the answer I hadn’t dared hope for: No, it doesn’t. I could steal as much superfluous crap from the various corpses, human and animal alike, I left in my wake as I wanted; I could stuff my pockets with all the wild plants, spare mechanical bits, and errant severed arms I came across and I’d never have to schlep it all the way back to a settlement or my ship to sell or store everything just to clear some space so I could pick up more junk and do it all over again. I could simply hoard it all, every tiny piece of trash and bulky piece of armor, and never have to worry about weight limits. It was exactly what I wanted. And by the time the credits finally rolled, I had come to hate it.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650644" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650644"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650644">Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In early role-playing video games, inventory limits and encumbrance were necessary due to the limited memory and file sizes of cartridges and discs. Annoying but understandable. But many modern action RPGs still have inventory limits even when they aren’t a technical necessity.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some game designers point to realism as an explanation; as</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-the-kotaku-review-1703766283"> <i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i></a><span> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz told</span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/encumbrance-sucks-so-why-is-it-still-so-common/"> <i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>, “Having a limit to how much equipment Geralt can carry plays a part in making the character and the world around him more believable.” It’s possible to take this too far, though, as</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-says-it-plans-to-fix-fallout-76-s-item-storage-1830321275"> <i><span>Fallout 76</span></i></a><span> and</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-news-iv-inventory-bag-management-1850722800"> <i><span>Diablo 4</span></i></a> <span>proved with their way-too-small carry capacities. </span><span>No one wants to spend more time rummaging through inventory screens than gleefully chopping off monsters’ heads.</span></p>

 <p><span>The realism argument makes sense, but I’ve never found it especially compelling. I grew up almost exclusively playing point-and-click adventure video games where reading and critical thinking were a major part of the gameplay, and when I finally made the jump to action RPGs, I was immediately taken by them because of how gloriously constant, quick, and varied the dopamine hits were. I didn’t have to wait for the payoff of sometimes tedious puzzles or long-winded interrogations. I could just run around, pick something up, and marvel at the new thing I had, whether it was useful to me or not.</span></p>

 <p><span>I was enamored with these types of games because of how open they were, how few limits there were on what I could do or how I could solve a problem. That’s why I’ve always found inventory limits such a huge point of frustration. It’s not going to break immersion for me if my character has some sort of magical, unspecified access to all their equipment while moving around in the world. Thinking about how much equipment my character could realistically carry and where they would store all of it is not integral to my role-playing experience.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>If anything, forcing me to stop and manage my inventory is </span><i><span>more</span></i><span> immersion-breaking for the type of gameplay I’m seeking. I’ll only craft something if I can’t find a strong enough stock weapon, and I’ll only visit a vendor if I need to sell something. Games with encumbrance systems always force me to do at least one of those two things. They add busy work without interesting trade-offs. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> let me skip that entirely.</span></p> <p><span>Tim Cain, co-director of the original </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-outer-worlds-will-rattle-your-idea-of-a-perfect-pla-1839238442"><i><span>Outer Worlds</span></i></a><span>, which was released in 2019, looks at carrying capacity limits from a more practical perspective. As he told</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-game-designers-handle-the-burden-of-encumbrance"> <i><span>Game Developer</span></i></a><span>, “[Without encumbrance,] You end up with enormous inventory sizes and there’s the issue of well, how do you manage that? And there’s different ways. You can say ‘Well, we’ll limit how much they can pick up,’ but you’ve now done encumbrance. You’ve just given it a hard limit. Or you can say, ‘We’ll break things down into categories or we’ll let things stack,’ but then you’ve just introduced all these extra issues of now you have pages of inventory or categories, or stacks of items.”</span></p> <p><span>Notably, </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span> does limit how much stuff a player can carry around with them, but offers unlimited storage on their ship, which is a pretty common compromise for inventory systems in RPGs, but which is still, to my mind, an absolute pain in the ass. I wasn’t the only one relieved to see the sequel ditch it. “</span><span>Honestly it’s kinda a breath of fresh air not having to worry,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og5wps/anyone_else_happy_and_surprised_theres_no/"><span>wrote</span></a><span> one player praising the decision on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og5wps/comment/nle7o49/"><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span> subreddit</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650643" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650643"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650643">Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Somewhere around three-quarters of the way through </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>, a block of text popped up on my screen. My employer, the Earth Directorate, had found a flaw in me. I had used a single heavy machine gun for so long without switching weapons that the game was calling me out via one of its most unique and compelling mechanics: the flaw system, which triggers when you meet certain gameplay conditions and offers you a significant boost in exchange for a permanent debuff. </span></p> <p><span>This time, it offered me a bonus to armor penetration in exchange for losing my second weapon slot, which is, I think, a pretty good deal, but I was annoyed that the game had correctly identified a deep-seated insecurity that I have, which is that, left to my own devices, I am a bad and lazy gamer, so I quickly turned it down and tried unsuccessfully to put it out of my mind.</span></p>

 <p><span>After that, out of spite, I started sneaking around and bopping unsuspecting enemies over the head with a frightfully high-damage telescoping baton that had the added bonus of being topped with the head of the Auntie’s Choice Moon Man mascot to add a bit of whimsy to the proceedings. As much as I hated to admit it, it was pretty fun. And then I started investigating what else I was missing out on.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yeah, my beloved heavy machine gun was pretty good when it came to damage, but its ammo capacity was relatively small. Maybe I could craft a mod that could change that? Once I started interacting with those systems, I finally realized how much I had been floating through the game without really engaging with it and how detrimental that experience had been compared to playing RPGs that imposed limits. I was just running around, picking up stuff I’d never use, and telling myself I’d sort it out later, which I never did.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650647"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650647">Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>By the time I finished </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>, I was carrying 142 weapons, 110 pieces of armor, and 98 helmets. Many of those were duplicates: I had an egregious seven identical copies of a single uniform that I hadn’t worn once. I’d put on a wonderfully daffy-looking helmet and robes I found in a hidden cache on Golden Ridge somewhere around the midpoint of the game and wore them straight through to the end because they were good enough and looking at them made me giggle.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I collected the 25 unique tossball cards I needed to get access to a vendor’s exclusive inventory and then didn’t buy any of it because I didn’t want to bother learning what each item could do. Consequently, I never got to experience the admittedly gimmicky but still very cool effect of putting on one of that vendor’s helmets and</span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/outer-worlds-2-new-point-of-view-mk2/"> <span>having the game’s graphics turn into pixel art</span></a><span>. Many of the game’s most unique, bizarre, and delightful weapons sat untouched in my inventory because I’d chosen the path of least resistance. It didn’t feel good.</span></p> <p><span>I keep thinking about what my experience playing </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> would have been like if carrying a lot of stuff was a flaw. Maybe the game would tell me I’m a pack-rat, decrease the price vendors are willing to pay me for anything I sell them, and increase the chance of finding weapons and armor with a mod already installed. I’d probably turn it down—and then head off to the nearest shop to sell all my duplicates and finally start thinking about the way I interact with the game again.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation may have leaked the official release date of Romeo is a Dead Man. The leak comes only a day before the game’s dedicated presentation by the developer.</p>



<p>Revealed during June 2025’s State of Play, the action-packed Romeo is a Dead Man is the next title from Grasshopper Manufacture. Led by No More Heroes creator Suda51, it looks like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/romeo-is-a-deadman-avoiding-firm-release-date-because-of-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a wild thrill ride</a>, fitting for the creator and his resume. The bloody action title was met with positive reactions from fans and critics after an initial preview. A presentation regarding the game is set for December 5th, but it seems PlayStation might have leaked one of the big announcements: its release date.</p>







<h2 id="h-romeo-is-a-dead-man-releasing-in-february-playstation-leak-states">Romeo is a Dead Man Releasing in February, PlayStation Leak States</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Romeo is a Dead Man release date leak comes from <strong>PlayStation itself and the PlayStation app</strong>. It was first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1996636997373644861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HazzadorGaming on Twitter/X</a>. When you click on the game on the app, instead of the 2026 or ‘Just Announced’ filler used for the icon, it says <strong>February 11th, 2026</strong>. Furthermore, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official PlayStation store</a> <strong>mentions the date as well</strong>, giving more leeway to it. However, it’s important to note that is is not official yet, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>It’s likely PlayStation jumped the gun on the reveal, which would’ve likely been revealed at the presentation. The ‘Grasshopper Direct’ is only five minutes and solely focused on Romeo is a Dead Man. Regardless, fans will still see new gameplay and such, so not all has been spoiled. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> slowly approaching, hopefully, no other games will get release date leaks. Even still, this does mean that, if true, players can add Romeo is a Dead Man to their 2026 must-plays.</p>

We want our players to adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on zombie hordes with glee behind the wheel of a killing machine.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Rogue Shift will hit with those who fondly remember the legendary series, and those who are discovering it for the first time – reignited, reinvented and more thrilling than ever.”</strong></p>



<p>While no release date has been announced yet, it was confirmed that the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. It’ll also be available for GeForce NOW subscribers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The legendary Carmageddon engine roars back to life, reimagined for a new era of vehicular combat.</p><p><em>Carmageddon</em> smashes back with brutal roguelite vehicular‑combat mayhem. Adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on post‑apocalyptic zombie hordes. The legacy lives on, reinvented and unforgiving.</p><p><strong>The Long Night</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The year is 2050, and the world you know is a post‑apocalyptic wasteland.</p><p>Hordes of nightmare creatures, the Wasted, lay siege to humanity. Every night, the streets are overrun, forcing everyone to barricade themselves in their skyscraper-homes for <a title="Genres > Survival [489 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>.</p><p>There is just one chance to escape all this: the Carmageddon.</p><p>These deadly races promise power, prestige, and valuable prizes to the participants. Most importantly, the champion wins the right to attempt the perilous journey that leads to the spaceport beyond the mountains. The only one left, the only chance to flee this dying world.</p><p>You enter the <em>Carmageddon</em> as one of countless racers, equipped with little more than a rust bucket, scavenged fuel, and a makeshift weapon. You’ll face off against rival gangs like the Autoscum and other rogues in a fight for survival. Each destruction race is an opportunity to win parts and upgrades, a step towards the ultimate escape.</p><p>As the night descends, the Wasted take the streets, and you with them.</p><p><strong>Drive to Survive</strong></p><p>The original <em>Carmageddon</em> spirit of vehicular mayhem has been refined and redesigned. We looked at the past and the present to create a visceral, fast and accessible form of combat racing.</p><ul><li><strong>15 Upgradeable Vehicles</strong> – FWD, RWD, and AWD, each with unique weight and suspension</li><li><strong><a title="Platforms > Meta [164 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>l‑on‑Metal Car Combat</strong> – Crash, shove, boost and side‑bash rivals</li><li><strong>13 Weapon Classes</strong> – From shotguns to railguns, all fully upgradable</li><li><strong>Over 80 Perks</strong> – Craft outrageous synergies for destruction racing supremacy</li><li><strong>Dynamic Weather and Day‑Night Cycle</strong> – Rain slicks the tarmac, fog shrouds ambushes</li><li><strong>Elite and Boss Events</strong> – Colossal war‑rigs, corrupted Enforcers, and endless zombie hordes</li><li><strong>Extensive Visual Damage Model</strong> – Windshields, hood, doors, bumpers and trunk lid will bend, crumple, hang and detach.</li></ul><p><strong>The Roguelite Campaign</strong></p><p>Every Campaign run offers a unique journey through a randomly generated graph.</p><p>Win Events and smash opponents to gain Credits. Maneuvers such as killing Wasteds, drifts, jumps, and flicks also grant rewards.</p><p>Strategically plan your route so you can reach Shops. In these safe havens you can repair your car, swap weapons, or install one of the 80+ unlockable perks.</p><p>Adapt to the dynamically increasing difficulty and conquer elite events and bosses.</p><p>With branching paths, varied objectives, and ever-changing time-of-day and weather conditions, no two runs are the same.</p><p>But the <em>Carmageddon</em> ain’t over when your vehicle is wrecked. Another driver will step up, and the challenge will resume anew, in a typical roguelite loop. Earn Beatcoins to unlock permanent bonuses and new content between runs in the Black Market. Find synergies between these elements to create the ultimate killing machine: the Carmageddon never ends.</p><p><strong>Opponents</strong></p><p>The Carmageddon hosts a diverse assembly of marauders, rejects, and lowlifes. Some prefer to rush in front of the pack. Others will chase you and try to bash you out of the way. Some will wait for the chance to unload their weapons into your car. Some are more skilled or better prepared than others. You may recognize some familiar names in the crowd.</p><p>Corrupt police forces known as the Enforcers impose their brutal rules on those spared from mutation. The Enforcers will force you off the road to strip your car for spare parts and ammo, if you let them.</p><p>Each area of the city is controlled by a particularly fierce opponent, commonly known as “the Boss”. These are the biggest, baddest, fastest, more armed vehicles that you can find. The rules of the Carmageddon demand that you beat each Boss before advancing to the next stage.</p><p>Every race is a brutal test of skill, demanding you master driving, melee, and ranged attacks against a diverse and unpredictable roster of foes. To do so, you must work on your car, find upgrades and weapons that combine well together, and consistently perform behind the wheel.</p><p><strong>The Wasted</strong></p><p>The Third World War and a series of devastating natural disasters left Earth in ruins. Amidst the chaos, a food supplement called MiVis was introduced to address food shortages, and became a ubiquitous part of daily life.</p><p>However, long-term consumption of MiVis led to a horrific cellular mutation, transforming people into Wasted – monstrous, empty husks consumed by the supplement’s side effects.</p><p>Now, they have become a mass of unsentient, super-aggressive beings that threaten survivors as soon as the sun starts to set.</p><p>A lone Wasted is no match for your chariot of fury. Things start to heat up when more Wasteds show up. Boost into the hordes of humanoid husks swarming the track, parting the waves of Wasted like a Moses on wheels! But be careful not to get stuck in the high tide: too many Wasteds will surround your car and smash it to bits with the remains of their raw hands.</p><p>And then there are Special Wasteds… horrible supermutations of the Wasted, morphed into something even less human.</p><p>They may explode, shoot you from a distance, lunge at your car, or produce even nastier surprises.</p><p>They pose a real danger and tend to show up late at night.</p><p>And then, there’s the ultimate abomination. A creature whispered about, rarely seen; the monster that guards the only mountain pass towards salvation, and your final challenge.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/carmageddon-rogue-shift-launches-in-early-2026-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-2-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

          <p>When Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">announced its upcoming Steam Machine hardware last month</a>, some eagle-eyed gamers may have been surprised to see that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">the official spec sheet</a> lists support for HDMI 2.0 output, rather than the updated, higher-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 standard <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/hdmi-2-1-spec-released-ushering-in-new-era-of-dynamic-hdr-video/">introduced in 2017</a>. Now, Valve tells Ars that, while the hardware itself actually supports HDMI 2.1, the company is struggling to offer full support for that standard due to Linux drivers that are “still a work-in-progress on the software side.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/hdmi-forum-to-amd-no-you-cant-make-an-open-source-hdmi-2-1-driver/">we noted last year</a>, the HDMI Forum (which manages the official specifications for HDMI standards) has officially blocked any open source implementation of HDMI 2.1. That means the open source AMD drivers used by SteamOS can’t fully implement certain features that are specific to the updated output standard.</p>
<p>“At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements,” AMD engineer Alex Deucher said at the time.</p>
<h2>Doing what they can</h2>
<p>This situation has caused significant headaches for Valve, which tells Ars it has had to validate the Steam Machine’s HDMI 2.1 hardware via Windows during testing. And when it comes to HDMI performance via SteamOS, a Valve representative tells Ars that “we’ve been working on trying to unblock things there.”</p>
<p>That includes unblocking HDMI 2.0’s resolution and frame-rate limits, which <a href="https://www.extron.com/article/hdmi2faq">max out at 60 Hz for a 4K output</a>, according to the official standard. Valve tells Ars it has been able to increase that limit to the “4K @ 120Hz” listed on the Steam Machine spec sheet, though, thanks to a technique called <a href="https://www.cablematters.com/Blog/HDMI/a-comprehensive-guide-to-chroma-subsampling?srsltid=AfmBOooodBYO5jloAUOgV_BWD8o479zIqMeMVxuI9lO9vsXT29AVrfEW">chroma sub-sampling</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>From 1997 to 2005, the Carmageddon series brought an explosive destruction derby to PCs, consoles, and handhelds through a trilogy of games and a couple of spin-offs. In 2014, Stainless Games revitalized the long-dormant franchise through Carmageddon: Reincarnation, and followed it up two years later with Carmageddon: Max Damage, but the series has been quiet ever since. Today, during the PC Gaming Show, that changed, as a new spin-off entry, Carmageddon: Rogue Shift, was announced.</p><p>As the name implies, Carmageddon: Rogue Shift adds a roguelite twist to the arcade-style vehicular combat of the series. True to that style of gameplay, you can unlock various weapons, classes, perks, and more as you battle bosses, race through the streets, and choose your path through a branching map. Each run drops you into a world with a day/night cycle with dynamic weather, where hordes of zombies emerge into the streets at night. Your only hope of escape is by winning the Carmageddon street-racing tournament. This entry promises stylish driving mechanics, tactical loadouts, and destruction-based racing.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7mFmSbChgC8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7mFmSbChgC8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"We are bringing something fresh to the franchise and the racing genre," game director Giuseppe Enrico Franchi said in a press release. "Carmageddon means explore, experiment, paint the streets red, and crumple up opponents. We want our players to adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on zombie hordes with glee behind the wheel of a killing machine."</p><p>The previous two Carmageddon console games, Reincarnation and Max Damage, did not fare well critically, with each holding a Metacritic average score in the 50s. However, Rogue Shift brings in a new developer, 34BigThings. The studio's most recent game, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/redout-2/">a racing title called Redout 2, has as high as a 78 on Metacritic</a>, with its sense of speed serving as one of the most commonly sung praises in reviews.</p><p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC in early 2026.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/carmageddon-rogue-shift-brings-back-the-vehicular-combat-cult-classic-series]]></content:encoded>

<p>Both the Switch 1 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shuten-order-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> will be getting a physical in the US courtesy of PM Studios, with Reef Entertainment's European release sticking with just the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>And for those physical collectors out there, yes, the Switch 2 physical will have the full game on the cartridge. That's a nice little announcement, given that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/shuten-order-nintendo-switch-2-edition-out-now-includes-paid-upgrade-for-switch-owners">Switch 2 upgrade <em>just</em> came out last week</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ruhxik&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>So, if you're on the fence about grabbing the game on the newer console <em>and</em> are reluctant to dive into a digital release, then you only have to wait until Spring to get your hands on a fully boxed version.</p>
<p>That cover art is nice, too!</p>

<p>Just in case you've never heard of the game before, Shuten Order is from <strong>Danganronpa</strong> creator Kazutaka Kodaka (who is one of the key writers). The game is a blend of multiple genres but it's ultimately a mystery game where you play as a character who has been murdered, and you must find your killer.</p>
<p>While we praised the ambition of the game on Switch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/shuten-order">we ultimately felt</a> that it felt a little long in the tooth and not quite up to par with Kodaka's previous works. It looks nice, though, and the Switch 2 version allows you to reach between 60-120fps docked and handheld and use Mouse Mode.</p>

<p>Are you a Shuten Order fan? Will you be grabbing the physical release next spring? Let us know in the comments<em>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As a third-person shooter with just a single gun in its arsenal that lets you scope in, one almost never sees much of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ gorgeous environments and explosive gameplay through first-person view.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">Extraction Shooter Player Puts Down Guns And Starts Selling Fruit Instead</a></p> <p>But there’s a way to get a look at post-apocalyptic Italy through the eyes of a Raider: Binoculars. They come with a heavy vignette and some HUD elements to make it feel like you’re using a zoomed scope, but on PC, if you hit F10, not only do you hide the HUD, but the vignetting on the binoculars goes away, leaving you with a suitably grainy image that’s perfect for taking some pretty shots of the game.</p>

 <p>That’s exactly what one IRL photographer, who shares his process on YouTube as Topside Flicks, has done, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">leaving behind weapons</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p562bp/you_guys_liked_the_last_binocular_photos_i_posted/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">brave the wilds of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ violent environments</a> to catch some of the most gorgeous screenshots of the extraction shooter yet. Check out some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/BKyBjT-y-pE">gameplay here</a>:</p>

  <p>The grainy-ness of these shots is quite fitting for <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ kitbashed world where Raiders have to make due with what objects they can find to get the job done. I could imagine a photographer in this world hacking together found objects to be able to snap some stills. It really looks the part. Have a gander:</p> <div id="gallery-1"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000650627"> 				© © Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000650625"> 				© © Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>I’m <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-photo-mode-bethesda-screenshot-save-location-1850835812">something of an amateur photographer myself</a>, having studied the craft briefly in college; I also grew up with a family member who made a living picking up the camera. I love a good shot, IRL or otherwise, so I had to learn more about the experience of capturing the beautiful vistas of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ world and freezing in place the sudden and intense bursts of violence the game is known for.</p>

    <p>Topside Flicks, who’s real name is Levi, and I chatted a bit over email. He said that the beauty of the game itself simply demanded he find a way to take shots “I was playing with a friend and I couldn’t stop marvelling at how great this game looked,” he told me. “I’m a photographer by trade so I’m always seeing photo opportunities.”</p> <div id="gallery-2"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000650631"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000650632"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> clearly makes for wonderful capture opportunities. Much of this, I suspect, has to do with the lack of color-grading and filters the game uses, as <a href="https://youtu.be/ST_fD5NL_pg">Embark Studios talked about in episode two</a> of their behind-the-scenes featurettes.</p>

 <p>Aside from the practice range, every map in <i>Arc Raiders</i> is an active digital warzone. I asked Levi how dangerous the photo trips are. “I die plenty of times,” he said, “but the beauty of these runs is that I’m not doing any looting, so if I die, all I lose are binoculars and some defibrillators.”</p> <div id="gallery-3"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-3-2000650633"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-3-2000650634"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>But as you can see from his videos, Levi isn’t afraid to get up close to some intense firefights to grab a perfect shot. Naturally, he’s had many close calls. “I get set on fire quite a lot in my videos,” he said, “the Fireballs are my arch-nemesis when I don’t have a weapon,” he added, referring to <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-stella-montis-north-line-patch-refiner-fireball-2000644048">the rolling Arc balls</a> that love to cook players with their flamethrowing ability.</p>

While some images clearly have some post-processing edits, as any good piece of photography does, these are some strong captures, and impressive considering he’s jumping headfirst into violent warzones purely for the sake of the craft, not the loot.</p>

            <guid>1373449</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">So far this Star Wars-flavored expansion is a bit cringey, but works surprisingly well.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Destiny has always been the “we’ve got Star Wars at home” looter shooter, and with Destiny 2: Renegades, Bungie has decided to lean into that directly with a crossover expansion. Weirdly enough, so far that decision seems to have kinda worked out alright! Renegades doesn’t solve many of Destiny 2’s longstanding issues, including the fact that it’s been awkwardly spinning its wheels for over a year now (reminiscent of the MCU post-Endgame), but embracing the cheesiness and over-the-top drama of Star Wars is at the very least a surprisingly nice change of pace in what has become quite a predictable universe. The story is silly, to be sure, but introduces a few new mechanics and weapon types that are a welcome change, and there’s an impressive level of enemy density throughout practically all of the activities that keeps the action interesting. I’ve still got a lot more questing and looting to do before my final review, but so far this expansion has been a pretty compelling breath of fresh air in a game I’ve otherwise been far less excited about than usual.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve read any of my previous expansion reviews (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/09/destiny-2-shadowkeep-review"><u>of</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-beyond-light-review"><u>which</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-review"><u>there</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-review"><u>are</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review"><u>a</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-review"><u>lot</u></a>), then you’ll already know I am one those weirdo Destiny fans who has stuck with this game through thick and thin – so it should mean something when I tell you that saying I am also a Star Wars fan would be such a massive understatement that I’m actually too embarrassed to elaborate further publicly. But even with my undying love of space wizards, I was initially mortified to learn Destiny 2 was planning a crossover with it. For me, it was the ultimate sign that Destiny was out of ideas, had gone “full Fortnite” in a way that seemed cheap and tacky, and was making one last desperation play during the slow death it’s been suffering for a number of years now. And, yeah, that all pretty much turned out to be true. But when I found myself watching two lightsaber-wielding foes square off in an epic cutscene while listening to the John Williams-esque music this expansion makes heavy use of, I’ll admit it won me over… at least a little.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Renegades does go out of its way to include every little Star Wars reference to a degree that can feel a bit forced – a crutch that’s continuously leaned upon in lieu of any original ideas. For example, you find yourself trapped in a garbage compactor during the very first mission, rescue someone from off-brand carbon freezing, and make a jump to lightspeed while a brooding, masked villain angrily watches you escape his grasp. It’s extremely on the nose stuff, and I was just as likely to experience a full-body cringe as I was to smile about it. But the complete “screw it” energy at play here as it full-throatedly embraces all the corniness and drama for which Star Wars is known does have a certain kind of refreshing charm that’s at least a distinct direction for Destiny 2. I’ve been complaining about this game feeling stale for at least five years now, so I’ve got to give Bungie a bit of credit for trying something new here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also a fair number of new mechanics that I wasn’t expecting, like a shielding system for certain enemies that forces you to deal a whole bunch of damage in a short span of time before you can actually hurt them, AT-ST-inspired walkers that have some unique attacks I wasn’t expecting, and even some new weapon types, like battery-powered guns that can be fired until they overheat and need to cool down. None of this is massively game-changing stuff, but they’re decent little tweaks to the sandbox that are welcome additions. Of course, there’s also a ton of stuff that hasn’t changed at all, and even while you’re facing off against a new kind of enemy in theory, you’ll still be fighting the same Cabal armored warriors and bony Thrall monstrosities you’ve been shooting for over a decade, which has made this feel like a cheap reskin at times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m still fairly early into my space opera journey (I haven’t even crafted my lightsaber yet!), so I have a whole lot more to play before I can definitively say where Renegades lands. But so far this expansion seems much better than I expected… though that’s partially because I expected very little. I’ll have much more to say once I’ve completed the campaign and begin to dive into the endgame activities.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For gamers of a certain age, Warhammer Quest is a name to conjure with. The original 1995 release was the premier <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon-crawler</a> of its day, a rare cooperative title in an age of head-to-head conflict games. Once it was out of print it became, and remains, highly collectable. But in 2016, publisher Games Workshop resurrected the brand with the well-received Silver Tower. Darkwater is the latest iteration, with a few new tweaks and a lot of new toys on board to try and uphold its considerable legacy.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><div catalogid="5c848b5c-737b-48d3-b764-893eede8d035" id="233318"><div id="233318" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Warhammer Quest: Darkwater</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop is rightly known as the premier producer of plastic miniatures and, even by its own exalted standards, the range of figures included in this set are a little bit special. Six of them are heroes, the remainder are their enemies, servants of the noxious, squelchy plague god of the Warhammer universe, Nurgle. The Nurgle range has always been a terrible beauty, crammed with unpleasant details of open sores and drooling maws and there’s plenty of that on display here. But what makes these stand out is a sense of character, something that’s often missing in modern, dynamically posed figures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These pop out of your tabletop with an air of individuality, particularly the heroes who display a fine mix of old-school adventurer alongside the current sensibilities of GW’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-dominion-review">Age of Sigmar</a> setting. Facial expressions and poses seem to tell you something about each of them, from the dour scowl of mercenary Bren Tylis to the gloating grin of the central villain, Gelgus Pust. And it’s worth noting for less experienced modellers that the box’s claim of push-fit is largely true. Most of the figures are fairly easy to assemble, although a couple will benefit from a drop of polystyrene cement. Painting them is another matter, however, as the level of detail may be a bit daunting for novices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the miniatures, GW boxed games often skimp on the remainder of the components. That’s not the case here: this is a lavish production at every level, and you can see where the considerable asking price has been spent. Once you’ve lifted the figure sprues out of the box, the cards and punch-out tokens have their own carefully packed sub-box, with the cards for each of the game’s campaign acts presented in their own sealed envelopes. Although the cards could use more, and more varied, artwork, they’re sturdy, shiny and clear to read.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"This is a lavish production at every level."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most surprising of all is the book of maps that are used in the skirmish scenarios that make up most of the game. While this is hardly a new idea, most examples are clunky and spiral-bound. This one is hard-bound, yet it still lies flat, making it an absolute pleasure to use. And the maps within are full of the kind of detailed art that we should also have seen on the cards, effectively evoking the plague-corrupted environments of the game’s setting, the Jade Abbey. More detail on the setting and narrative are provided in the game’s rulebook, offering up a great foretaste of the adventures to come.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251119-195821015-mp-1764789085874.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer Quest: Darkwater is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a>, but you’ll play with four heroes in every game, so it’s best with two or four players: solo is possible, but you’ll end up juggling a lot as the campaign progresses. It has two game modes, a one-off skirmish fight or a longer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign game</a>. The focus is definitely on the latter mode, as single fights can be unbalanced depending on the scenario you end up playing, and you don’t get the fun of slowly building up your characters and revealing your own narrative of attempting to free the Jade Abbey from Nurgle’s putrefaction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A campaign consists of three acts, each of which sees you dealing out 14 random encounter cards from that act’s deck, with a boss card beneath. You then get a choice of two possible encounter cards for each adventure, and this is an important decision. Many of the encounters aren’t skirmish fights but little narrative snippets or mini-games. Most of these are of the push your luck or risk versus reward variety, but there are a couple of the more imaginative designs that made Silver Tower’s scenarios such a pleasure.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251119-200931912-1764789104928.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to battle scenarios, it’s important to read the cards carefully and consider how the fight might play out. They offer a variety of maps, of enemies to fight, sidequests, victory conditions and special rules. These cause them to vary wildly in difficulty, and some can be almost impossible if you haven’t found certain rewards for your party. This is a big deal because the price for failure is high: you lose some rewards and get to try again, with a second fail ending the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duking it out on the map is based on a set of rules from another game in the series, Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QrAron?object_uuid=38ddcc60-bd01-4ab2-acfc-c334713f18e4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>). Each hero has three action cards: move, attack, and aid. Using one requires you to expend energy, which is most commonly obtained by exhausting one of said cards, either for the action you’re taking or one of the others. Essentially this boils down to heroes taking three actions each turn, which can be any combination of the available options, although some of the rewards you can get later in the campaign complicate the picture a little.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat involves you rolling dice, almost always a pair, hoping to achieve a target number depending on what you’re fighting. Many enemies have a defense value that cancels out an equal number of hits, meaning you’ll have to hit on both dice to hurt them. Between the probabilities involved and the flexibility of the action system, this provides a satisfying balance of decision-making and randomness. This is not a deep game by any means, but you’ll often be torn as to how to best distribute your actions, while the turn limit on completing each battle can lead to some thrilling, high-stakes rolls towards the close.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251119-202234130-mp-1764789122637.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Between each hero’s turn, the monsters get to activate. How they behave depends on a dice roll, and most enemies switch between a sedate black die and a more threatening red die with each passing battle round. Mostly they’ll move toward a target at variable speed and try to attack, although all the monsters also have a special effect: horrible little pox-wretches spawn new companions, while the tough daemonic cankerborn blast all nearby heroes with an area effect attack. This roll can have a major impact on the difficulty of a scenario, as monsters sometimes do nothing and sometimes unleash a terrifying onslaught, a quirk that the rules put down to their chaotic nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One flaw in this system and the map design is that most of the boards have one or more choke points caused by impassable hexes, and most of the scenarios require players to get somewhere and do something in order to win. The result is that both players and monsters get funneled toward the tight corners and scenarios can bog down in repeated roll-offs until you either clear the enemies or the time runs out. Some character abilities and items can bypass this – the dwarf ranger Drolf Ironhead can move through the odd impassable hex – but while this gives some scenarios the feel of a spatial puzzle, in others having one or two characters get a shortcut doesn’t make much difference to achieving the goal. This issue also causes a sense of repetition, despite the fairly varied scenario design.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251124-194023242-1764789139244.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Victory, and the completion of sidequest goals, results in reward cards being doled out to the adventurers. Like the scenarios themselves these vary in power, with better items being available later in the campaign, but the more impressive items are often one-shot, while more minor power-ups can be re-used. They all add more tactical options to battles, which is absolutely a good thing. Weighing up whether or not to throw your magical one-off widget into the mix in an attempt to save a scenario that’s going south is always a knife-edge decision and adds extra frisson to the dice-rolls that usually result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even on-board battle scenarios only last about 30 minutes so, when you mix in the much shorter mini-game encounters, playing through an act doesn’t take all that long. “Saving” the game state between sessions is a minor pain but perfectly possible. All the adventure cards have their own text preamble to set the scene and, as you progress through the campaign, there are secrets to uncover and some new playable characters to unlock. The unfolding narrative isn’t going to win any literary awards but it’s effective at giving your playthrough a solid storybook backbone. Nurgle is a particularly fun opponent to tackle, his servitors by turns fatherly and feculent, so freeing the once-pristine Jade Abbey from their clutches feels like a worthy goal.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251128-113953298-1764789159676.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgmxY?object_uuid=38ddcc60-bd01-4ab2-acfc-c334713f18e4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Warhammer</a>  </li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 4, 2025 6:13 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Compared to the long grind that characterized the last Warhammer Quest game, Cursed City, Warhammer Quest: Darkwater feels like a breath of fresh air. It’s faster, lighter and more approachable, and is very much a coherent miniatures game rather than a box of cool figures with some rules thrown in as an afterthought. Despite the cracking production quality, this won’t win over any GW naysayers: play is still very random and the difficulty is uneven. But the unfolding tale is compelling nevertheless, with enough decision making to engage your neurons and plenty of exciting moments. Fundamentally, whether you’re willing to pay the considerable asking price on this package likely boils down to how much you want the amazing miniatures. But if you do invest, you’ll find that it can capably stand toe-to-toe with a lot of modern dungeon crawl designs.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-quest-darkwater-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Left 4 Dead was one of our early inspirations"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you love PvE co-op games but murderous robots are giving you low level PTSD, Cast Outs is here to stir up the genre with a modern take on fantasy. Designed from the ground up for co-op, it takes the usual Dungeons &amp; Dragons tropes of goblins, elves and magic spells, and turns them into a 2-4 player playground to battle in. It's got pedigree too, because while it's the first game from UK studio Twisted Works, that studio is home to veterans who have worked on games like Horizon Forbidden Resident Evil 7, Killzone, and the Total War series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Left 4 Dead was one of our early inspirations as one of those games where you had to just realize that you're not going to do this alone," explains James Brace, Twisted Works CEO and the Cast Outs Creative Director.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There is no single player mode. As a studio, when we approached this game we wanted a very sharp, narrow focus on this genre of co-op combat. As a team, you get to experience a whole bunch of missions and modes, different ways to play. We have runs, not unlike the Left 4 Dead kind of experience, but we also have sandbox areas, we have Horde modes. It balances everything we loved about scripted elements - those cinematic wow moments that we love in games like Left 4 Dead - with these playgrounds that allow a lot more freedom of exploration, and a lot more emergent gameplay."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fantasy Co-op Cast Outs First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As one of a team of three refugees from a doomed realm in another dimension, the aim for you and two battle buddies is to fight through a fantastical version of modern day London with a mix of team combos, magical powers and parkour style agility. Talking to the teams there's clearly a lot of thought that's gone into the story - with references to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Percy Jackson referenced as team favorites, but the focus is also one letting players create their own weird and wonderful Tiktok share worthy moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're going to have a lot of visual storytelling, what I call passive storytelling. It's there in the world. You can see it. You can absorb at your pace. It can come through the characters. We can have a lot of lore come through the characters like we've seen in a lot of roster based games, but in terms of your adventure, your run, that's your story. The first kind of thing we wanted to try and do is make sure there's enough dynamics in the experience to create unique stories," says Brace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, Cast Outs is built with short sessions in mind, but adds a progression system to keep you coming back for more. As well as learning your particular preferred combination of magic and run-based, Roguelike lite upgrade systems, there will be cosmetics to show off your Cast Outs skills and tenure, and a charm system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While playing, you're collecting ingredients. Those ingredients can be crafted into charms - it's where some of the magic still exists in London from the people who came over - and you can wear these charms and take them into battle," says Brace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You're going to have charm slots so you're going to have dilemmas about how many charms you're going to take in. I'll be going, 'Oh what are you carrying in? I'm taking this.' And it's ultimately driving the progression system to get all the charms and to have the most flexibility on play styles. You'll be able to support your team with charms. A lot of our charms aren't individual. They're helping the team more like perks and buffs for the group. I think people are going to like them because it enables you to um, take the classes and turn your tank into a bit more like a support tank or a bit more DPS."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Planned for release on PC, PS5 and Xbox with crossplay, there's no release date yet, but the Twisted Works team is big on playtesting and building its community to help shape the game. Check out the studio's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tBNw5AnRt7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord</u></a> to find out more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're still shocked that through our play testing that players are telling us about and showing us new ways to play with our own magic that we never thought of, which is absolutely fantastic."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Bundled in a thick jacket and scarf to ward off Chicago’s chilly fall winds, congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, 26, approaches an outdoor podium. At a mid-November arraignment, she has just <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/kat-abughazaleh-codefendants-plea-not-guilty-broadview-protest-charges/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pleaded not guilty to federal charges</u></a> raised against her and five other protesters of interfering with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Broadview, Illinois. If convicted, she could face years in prison on counts of conspiracy and intimidation. “This case is not a 'conspiracy,'” she says to gathered media. “It is a political prosecution to silence dissent.” Now she needs to win on election day <em>and </em>in court – which, among other things, makes her fundraising efforts more urgent than ever. Time to play some video games. </p><p>Just a few days later, on November 16, Abughazaleh is in her apartment, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSzcBsmqZME&amp;t=2648s&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>streaming <em>Five Nights At Freddy’s</em></u></a> – a game she has never played – to hundreds of concurrent viewers across <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/katabughazaleh?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Twitch</u></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@katmabu/streams?ref=aftermath.site"><u>YouTube</u></a>. She’s taken to streaming multiple times per week since September, following an experimental period in which she and her campaign staff tested its viability as a fundraising tool. The results were more than satisfactory: As the <em>FNAF </em>broadcast progresses, the campaign inches ever closer to having raised $100,000 through livestreams alone. By the end of the night, they pass that milestone.</p><p>Abughazaleh attempts to surveil the game’s titular pizza restaurant while interacting with chat. One viewer asks how she’d support small businesses like, if it existed, Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. She replies with a platform that includes taxing the wealthy and lowering taxes for the working class as her eyes dart nervously around the screen. Two of her campaign staff, her producer Asha Buerk and her field director Andre Martin – who are sitting off screen, just a few feet away – give her shit.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSzcBsmqZME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Campaign Stream #19: Sticker Stream + FNAF !donate !discord"></iframe></figure><p>The mounting in-game tension is clearly getting to her; she notes that where Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, specifically, is concerned, she would simply “set [it] on fire.”&nbsp;</p><p>"We need to be actually supporting small businesses, putting a cost of living exemption for people's personal taxes– oh my god, guys, this is awful," she blurts.</p><p>Not long after, Foxy, one of <em>FNAF</em>’s nefarious animatrons, bursts into Abughazaleh’s in-game command center, prematurely ending her playthrough. She yelps in surprise, eliciting laughter both from chat and those in the room with her.</p><p>Witnessing this scene, it’s easy to forget the gravity of the moment surrounding it. In some ways, that’s by design.</p><p>"Running for office is the most rewarding thing I've ever done, but it's also the most exhausting thing I've ever done,” Abughazaleh told Aftermath while taking a moment to relax on her couch after wrapping up the stream. “It can be grueling at times. People go into running for office excited and wanting to make the world better, but then get worn down by how exhausting it can be. And so a lot of our events are things that bring me joy, that I want to share with other people. We did this punk night that was one of the most fun nights of my life; we had local punk bands come, and it was a night of defiance and community. We've had board game nights. Video games are something I enjoy doing. So it's just another aspect of that."</p><blockquote>"There's no more whiplash going from post-arraignment press conference to <em>Five Nights At Freddy's</em> livestream than there is just living in America right now."</blockquote><p>But these sorts of juxtapositions, Abughazaleh thinks, also come part and parcel with living under – and fighting – authoritarianism.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's no more whiplash going from post-arraignment press conference to <em>Five Nights At Freddy's</em> livestream than there is just living in America right now,” she said. “When we would protest at Broadview on Fridays, Thursday night you would have this tightening in your chest. While driving, you could feel the pepper spray in your lungs, even though it obviously wasn't there. I would always do my laundry on Thursdays so I could strip my clothes off when I got home to make sure I have something that's not covered in tear gas. I would sit there folding laundry on my floor being like 'This is so mundane while all the rest of this is happening.' That is more profound whiplash than anything else. For me, if you can't find joy during fascism, you don't have anything.”</p><h2 id="called-it"><strong>Called It</strong></h2><p>Abughazaleh and her team, a full-time staff of nine, decided to start streaming because they thought it’d be preferable to an especially loathsome facet of campaigning: call time. In short, a candidate directly calls prospective donors in an effort to talk them through goals and, ultimately, convince them to make – or increase – a monetary contribution. This method can be more effective than one-size-fits-all emails or calls, but it’s also arduous and time consuming – not to mention alienating to non-wealthy donors.</p><p>"We did a big recap and looked at our [livestream] numbers as opposed to call time, but also specifically what stream segments were good, which were bad,” Buerk told Aftermath. “We got a lot of positive feedback from our audience and from constituents of not only how good a tool it was for soliciting donations, but for community connection and constituent connection as well."&nbsp;</p><p>Call time, Buerk said, is also only really an effective use of time if people are donating the maximum amount, which is $7,000 from an individual.&nbsp;</p><p>"You have to know rich people,” said Abughazaleh. "That's not me or most of the people that support us. To those who have and can do that, we appreciate you, but we don't want to make that our only base. That means you're depending only on the people who can afford that to make a change in the world. ... You also have to have those [phone] numbers in the first place – or buy lists, and there's no guarantee those lists will work."</p><p>"How do you get those lists?” Buerk added. “It's usually people selling donor data, which we don't do."</p><p>Buerk said that Abughazaleh’s donors were the kinds of people who’d kick in hundreds of dollars, not thousands, and as a result, call time was not exactly pulling in money hand over fist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“In the best of times, we would get $600 an hour [from call time],” Buerk said. “The stream has obviously crushed that. Today we raised $12,000."</p><figure><figcaption><span>Abughazaleh’s cat, Heater (photo credit: Aftermath)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <em>FNAF </em>stream lasted two hours and, thanks to a simple offer of a sticker featuring Abughazaleh’s cat for anyone who donated $10 or more, performed as well as 20 hours of call time. Even during lower-yield streams – the floor, so far, has proven to be $2,000 during a single broadcast – that’s still far preferable a fraction of the money for double, triple, or quadruple the work.</p><p>"Kat is busy at events,” said Buerk. “Kat is dealing with a lot of really insane, horrible things. She doesn't have time to be calling people and trying to convince them to donate for 40 hours a week."</p><p>Streams aren’t easy to do right. While representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez famously pulled a record-breaking number of viewers to <a href="https://kotaku.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-streams-on-twitch-with-hasan-p-1845431479?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a star-studded <em>Among Us</em> stream back in 2020</u></a>, other politicians before and after have tried and failed miserably. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bernie-sanders-new-twitch-channel-needs-fewer-campaign-1835953254?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bernie Sanders</u></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-has-a-twitch-channel-now-1838956748?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Donald Trump</u></a> both launched Twitch channels in 2019, but neither engaged with Twitch as a platform or community, instead mostly airing rallies or leaning on campaign staff to host broadcasts. Kamala Harris’ Twitch channel, which <a href="https://aftermath.site/kamala-harris-twitch-stream-dnc-palestine/"><u>launched last year to little fanfare</u></a>, succumbed to the same issue. Most embarrassingly, disgraced ex-rep Matt Gaetz once <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/matt-gaetz-twitch/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>streamed to six viewers</u></a>.</p><blockquote>"Kat is dealing with a lot of really insane, horrible things. She doesn't have time to be calling people and trying to convince them to donate for 40 hours a week."</blockquote><p>In recent times, some politicians have demonstrated greater savvy where streaming is concerned, though they’ve pivoted away from trying to maintain their own channels. <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream/"><u>Trump’s 2024 stream with Adin Ross</u></a>, Kick’s king of snivelling suck ups, peaked at over 580,000 concurrent viewers. Tim Walz and AOC <a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-walz-crazy-taxi-aoc/"><u>played <em>Crazy Taxi</em></u></a>. Bernie <a href="https://aftermath.site/bernie-sanders-sykkuno-pokimane-valkyrae-austinshow-vtuber/"><u>learned what a Vtuber is</u></a>. And of course, NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani spent a day hanging out with Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker, which Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://aftermath.site/cuomos-latest-strategy-to-resuscitate-his-flatlining-campaign-go-after-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-a-twitch-streamer/"><u>tried to use against him to basically no effect</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“[Streaming] has certainly not been used as a [political] fundraising tool like this pretty much ever,” said Abughazaleh.</p><p>The idea for regular streams came straight from Abughazaleh, no stranger to social media herself, having made her name as a journalist who – in addition to publishing more traditional work at publications like <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/author/katherine-abughazaleh?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Media Matters</u></a> and <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/author/kat-abughazaleh/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Mother Jones</u></a> – watched and roasted <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katmabu/video/7362943343417953582?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a frankly incredible amount of Fox News on TikTok</u></a>. She parlayed this into videos about the far right more broadly, as well as <a href="https://aftermath.site/democratic-national-convention-creators-palestine-tiktok-instagram-twitch/"><u>advocacy for Palestinians at last year’s Democratic National Convention</u></a>. She owes the successful execution of her streaming plan, however, to a younger-than-average campaign team, with the effort headed up by Buerk, a college student who was “horrified” by rising authoritarianism and decided to walk into Abughazaleh’s office and submit a resume. After stints in call time management and policy, Buerk gave herself a crash course in Open Broadcaster Software (OBS).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I mentioned this idea, and Andre really pushed for it and then gave Asha the tools and ability to just devote time and resources [to learning how to stream],” said Abughazaleh. “It was a big risk; to not do four weeks of call time is a risk on any campaign, but we took it, and it was worth it."</p><p>Martin’s political background is much more traditional: An organizer who was feeling “demoralized” after experiences that included working with the Harris-Walz team and, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/05/john-fetterman-democrat-progressive-senator?ref=aftermath.site"><u>perhaps most dispiriting of all</u></a>, John Fetterman’s campaign, he made a promise to himself that he’d only assist politicians who practiced what they preached. An organizer friend recommended Abughazaleh, and the rest is (recent) history.</p><blockquote>“[Streaming] has certainly not been used as a [political] fundraising tool like this pretty much ever.”</blockquote><p>According to Martin, Abughazaleh’s streaming setup – which includes professional-looking ring lights and a tripod light off to the side, as well as just, like, some lamps – cost the campaign just $160.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We're very lucky,” Martin told Aftermath. “We have a very online section of our volunteer base, and the campaign staff is young enough that some of them have natively already streamed. Getting them to explain it to those of us who hadn't was very helpful in building something from scratch."</p><p>Despite doing an admirable job of replicating the look and feel of your standard, down-to-earth Twitch stream, Abughazaleh is not just some Twitch streamer.</p><p>"We have FEC rules we have to contend with,” said Martin. “We have to go through Act Blue, which was not built to ever be part of a stream."</p><p>This means those who donate have to click out to another page and provide personal info like their occupation and employer. Twitch viewers, who are used to simply pressing a button and receiving a near-instant reaction from their favorite streamer, are not accustomed to this. So far, however, it hasn’t impeded the campaign’s efforts.</p><p>"Being able to still raise this much while going to another website and then inputting information that isn't already there is... I'm really impressed with how it's gone,” said Abughazaleh.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qO8-0b150ZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Campaign Stream #15: HOT ONES STREAM🔥🔥🔥!donate !discord"></iframe></figure><p>But convincing people to open their wallets while riding a wave of novelty is one thing; keeping the money flowing is another.</p><p>"It's very easy for streams to become rote, and while that's good for a certain audience of people, we're a congressional campaign, so it's important that we keep streams engaging and push the meta beyond just 'play video game, react to thing,'” said Buerk. “Obviously you saw us playing video games tonight, but we always need to make sure that there's some form of additional element to keep the streams exciting. So we do higher-level production streams. The most recent goal stream we did was, chat raised $7,000, and so Kat built a Lego set on stream. We also produced a <em>Hot Ones</em>-[inspired] stream where we wrote down a bunch of questions, had the questions on stream, and Kat tried 38 hot sauces."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I did really well on most of them,” Abughazaleh added. “I just wanted that on the record."</p><h2 id="of-ice-and-indictments"><strong>Of ICE And Indictments</strong></h2><p>But a larger question looms over Abughazaleh’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online/"><u>social-media-savvy</u></a> efforts: Will an extremely-online campaign convince voters in her district to spend one day at the polls instead of five nights at Freddy’s? Especially for a young candidate who <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/05/12/9th-congressional-race-schakowsky-replacement/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>moved to Chicago relatively recently</u></a>?&nbsp;</p><p>Abughazaleh would be more concerned if that’s all she and her campaign were doing.</p><p>“For getting the word out, [being] online is great, but it doesn't necessarily translate to votes,” she said. “I think we've seen this in other campaigns, especially by young people, where that translation just doesn't happen. So from day one, we have been translating that online support into tangible actions that people are taking in preparation for election day. For our kickoff event, for instance, people found out about it online, and I asked them to come not with monetary donations, but with pads and tampons, which we were donating to Chicago's Period Collective. And sure enough, we hit max capacity. ... That was an early predecessor to all these things we're doing on the campaign, whether it's asking for people to donate to our mutual aid hub at the campaign office or knocking doors, petitioning, doing phone banking, donating coats, [or] a blood drive for Halloween and a bone marrow registry drive as well."</p><p>"The stream is just another part of that,” she continued. “It used to be that the internet wasn't real life, and now it's not that the internet is real life; they're just both components that exist at the same time.”</p><p>This approach has actually led to <em>less </em>donation money overall than competing campaigns, Abughazaleh said, but more support. Roughly four months from the March 2026 primary, <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2025/11/20/il-09-democratic-primary-poll-shows-early-leaders-four-months-out-from-election-day?ref=aftermath.site"><u>polls show</u></a> that Abughazaleh is tied with another candidate, Daniel Bliss, for first. In relatively little time, she’s managed to make a major impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"We have less [money] than most people, and that's because we're a grassroots campaign, and we aren't supported by rich people,” Abughazaleh said. “Doesn't matter how much money you donate, though; that only translates to one vote."</p><blockquote>"For getting the word out, [being] online is great, but it doesn't necessarily translate to votes."</blockquote><p>In this regard, Abughazaleh has been both encouraged and inspired by the success of another young, progressive politician: Zohran Mamdani, NYC’s soon-to-be mayor who’s already a global celebrity. His campaign, similarly, married consistent pro-working class messaging with <a href="https://defector.com/selling-zohran?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an entertaining but calculated social media presence</u></a> and local events, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-scavenger-hunt/"><u>a gargantuan city-wide scavenger hunt</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"When he won his primary, I posted something like 'Huge night for grassroots progressives with ethnic last names,'" Abughazaleh said. “I feel stronger knowing that Zohran has led the way for a lot of us. It's scary to be doing so many experimental things with your own campaign, but then to see other people trying their own things as well as prove that they can work – and that you don't have to sell out in this way or that way to win an election – is so inspiring to me."</p><p>But also, she added: "We were planning a scavenger hunt for months, and then he did it, and I was like ‘Everyone's gonna think I copied him.’"</p><p>One of Abughazaleh’s ground-level efforts has made national news, albeit not for the reasons she initially expected. Though she’s not outwardly sweating the federal indictment that followed anti-ICE protests in Broadview too much – one which, notably, targeted other Democratic politicians and candidates as well – it has materially impacted the lives of herself and her campaign staff.</p><p>"We – not just me, but people – are trying to do the things that matter, and that means standing up for people. Right now that means you might get beaten up by ICE or a masked man that you're not even sure works for the government,” said Abughazaleh. "We now have legal expenses on top of campaign expenses, but being a candidate at Broadview means I'm not going to go bankrupt. We're able to use those expenses for the other as well. So really now I'm just running the campaign like I would, except now we also go to hearings sometimes. ... And I can't leave the continental United States."</p><p>Martin, who was among those charged alongside Abughazaleh, has clearance to visit Puerto Rico due to family ties.</p><p>“I got permission to go to one island,” he said dryly.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ats4shmeia7i7ildqm3denmd/app.bsky.feed.post/3m5k4aqe4l22t" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreibw6yfur65nqaem4yru4wzui3krpst4z6uu6vffve5nfsjx4dkyh4"><p lang="en">Yesterday, I pleaded not guilty to the charges that Trump’s DOJ has hit me with in federal court.

This administration is targeting me because they can see that I’ve spoken out against them and will continue to stand up to them.</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ats4shmeia7i7ildqm3denmd?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Kat Abughazaleh (@katmabu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ats4shmeia7i7ildqm3denmd/post/3m5k4aqe4l22t?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-11-13T21:27:47.349Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>But just because Abughazaleh and her staff can joke about a grim situation doesn’t mean it’s not weighing on them. Few understand this dichotomy better than Ben Collins, aka Tim Onion, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/04/the-onion-sold-g-o-media-global-tetrahedron-1235895683/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>CEO of The Onion</u></a> and Abughazaleh’s partner.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm not one of those people who do the thing where they track each other on their iPhones,” Collins told Aftermath. “It's disgusting and weird behavior, but it was necessary when she went to Broadview. The day she got thrown to the ground [by an ICE agent], I was in LA for work, and I was up from 2 AM onward just trying to make sure she got home."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"It's really hard, because [ICE has] everything,” he added. “They have all the weapons, they have all the power, and they seem to literally get off on it. And there's a reason they target her over and over again."</p><p>But this is precisely why Abughazaleh decided to run in the first place – and why Collins, who was in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/g-s1-46738/infowars-alex-jones-onion-bankruptcy-judge-sandy-hook?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a legal battle with Alex Jones over The Onion’s attempt to buy Infowars</u></a> at the time, did nothing to stand in her way.</p><p>"When we saw there was no one in government standing up for everyone we knew and loved [in the months following the presidential election], Kat was like 'I think I should do it,'” Collins said. “I think a person with as much on his plate [as me] – I was actively in a legal fight with the world's most insane person [Alex Jones] – would typically say 'Alright, yeah, maybe in a couple years or something.' But she's uniquely equipped to deal with these people. I think you see it out there: Everyone is following her lead. All these other candidates went to Broadview because of her. She helped amplify what is a clear human rights injustice going on there, both inside and outside that facility. ... So in those few months after [the presidential election] where no one was stepping up, when she told me she wanted to run, I was like 'OK, let's fucking do it.'"</p><blockquote>"[ICE has] all the weapons, they have all the power, and they seem to literally get off on it. And there's a reason they target her over and over again."</blockquote><p>Now, facing down a second, even less anticipated legal battle, Collins – like Abughazaleh – can at least find some humor in it: “It'd be scarier if she did anything wrong, certainly, but it'd be scarier if they <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/kat-abugazaleh-indictment-interview?ref=aftermath.site"><u>spelled her name right</u></a> in the indictment," he said.</p><p>All Abughazaleh can do is meet the moment with the seriousness it deserves, which is both as much as she can muster and none whatsoever. During the mid-November <em>FNAF </em>stream, she made the kind of wager characteristic of someone with nothing left to lose: “If we raise $20,000 in one stream, I will read a paragraph from my One Direction fan fiction that I published in middle school.”&nbsp;</p><p>She didn’t quite hit the goal that night, but there’s always next time.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-friday-connoreatspants-interview-gavin-newsom/"><div><p>How Fortnite Friday Grew From A Bit Into An Institution That Could Pull Gavin Newsom</p><p>The unlikely rise of one of the internet’s best talk shows</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Grinding Gear Games has confirmed that Path of Exile 2: The Last of Druids will drop on December 12. This free update is the third major post-early access debut patch for the hack-and-slash action RPG after <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawn of the Hunt</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-the-third-edict-update-0-3-0-adds-act-iv-three-interlude-acts-trading-and-several-significant-gameplay-changes-in-massive-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Third Edict</a>. The main features of The Last of the Druids include the new titular hybrid class, a dungeon‑crafting league, and a broad endgame overhaul that lands alongside a free weekend from December 12–15 on PC and consoles. </p>



<p>The Druid is Path of Exile 2's first hybrid Strength/Intelligence class, able to weave between spellcasting in human form and three distinct animal forms: bear, wolf, and wyvern. Its addition expands the game with 21 new Druid skills, over 30 new support gems, 11 uniques, and more than 250 additional passive skills.</p>



<p>From a lore standpoint, the Druid is a survivor of the King in the Mists who lost his humanity in the forests of Ogham and now seeks his missing wife and a way back to his former self. Mechanically, his identity revolves around Animal Talismans, a new weapon type that determines which form he can assume and grants that form’s basic attack as a skill; casting a spell instantly returns him to human form, making form‑swapping a core part of regular combat.</p>



<p>The developers from Grinding Gear have described bear form as raw devastation. Players will be using Maul to generate Rage, then spending that Rage on big slams, Rampage, and the ultimate Walking Calamity, while also converting Rage into Endurance Charges for Ferocious Roar, a warcry Meta Gem that can socket warcries like Infernal Cry or Seismic Cry from other classes. </p>



<p>Wolf form, on the other hand, emphasizes mobility and cold damage: skills such as Lunar Assault, Rake, Pounce, and Cross Slash can be combined to freeze enemies, generate exploding ice fragments, and maintain a pack of summoned wolves, with Pounce acting as a Meta Gem for mark skills from other classes and Lunar Blessing transforming the Druid into an Arctic Werewolf for faster, harder‑hitting attacks.</p>



<p>Wyvern form rounds out the Druid's kit with a mix of melee and ranged elemental attacks built around Power Charges and corpse‑eating via Devour. Rend and Wing Blast inflict melee and lightning damage, Rolling Magma and oil spit can be used for fire and ignite setups, and a channeled lightning Barrage and Flame Breath for sustained ranged damage. All these skills are supported by human‑form nature spells, such as Entangling Vines and Thunderstorms. The latter can inflict the wet status on enemies to amplify shock effects.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Druid_Shaman-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Shaman is one of two available Druid Ascendancies.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Path of Exile 2: The Last of the Druids launches with two Druid ascendancies, Shaman and Oracle, with a third planned to be released later. Shaman focuses on spellcasting that converts Rage into elemental power: nodes like Druidic Champion and Furious Wellspring tie spell damage and temporary buffs to Rage, while Wisdom of the Maji adds Shaman‑exclusive modifiers to Runes and Idols and Bringer of the Apocalypse triggers roaming multielemental storms after sustained elemental damage.</p>



<p>Oracle uses foresight and timeline manipulation, with Fateful Vision showing future self‑casts of specific skills that gain large damage bonuses when replicated, and Converging Paths enabling Moment of Vulnerability to hit both present and future versions of enemies when they are susceptible to freeze, stun, or electrocution. Ascending as Oracle unlocks more than 130 new passives in the Druid section; allocating The Unseen Path grants access to options such as Self‑Sacrificing, which increases total minions at a higher reservation cost, and Corruption Endures, which adds a small chance to avoid death. </p>



<p>Path of Exile 2: The Last of the Druids is set to add a fresh wave of support gems and Meta Gems designed to cross‑pollinate class mechanics. Spell Totems, for instance, are a Meta Gem that lets players spend three Endurance or Power Charges to create a totem which automatically casts any socketed spell, opening up new lines of automation for casters and for Druids who generate charges via Rage and Devour.</p>



<p>Over 30 new support gems, including multiple Lineage Supports, are confirmed. Examples include Fan the Flames for fire spread on wind skills, Accelerated Growth for explosive plants grown by rain, Advancing Storm to move storm skills across the battlefield, Echoing Cry for repeating warcries, and Grounding Shocks to turn shocked enemies into lightning beacons. As part of a balance pass, 21 existing Lineage Supports were reworked, and roughly ninety active skills were adjusted across all classes.</p>



<p>On the league side, Fate of the Vaal sends players back to the height of Vaal civilization to challenge the Royal Architect and ultimately Atziri, positioned here as a new pinnacle boss. Xipocado, devoted to Atziri, stands between the player and access to the deeper temple. Overcoming him grants entry to additional crafting tools and a step closer to confronting the queen. Worshipped for her unparalleled beauty, Atziri was the infamous Queen who led her devotees into downfall; now she stands as a new Pinnacle Boss. Rewrite history and alter the fate of the Vaal.</p>



<p>One of the rewards from defeating her corrupted form is Atziri’s Rule. This powerful new staff elevates all corrupted gems and enables players to exchange life for increased damage output. While wielded, Mirrors of Refraction periodically manifest across the battlefield; projectiles fired into these mirrors erupt into a splitting nova and can chain from one mirror to the next, dramatically amplifying offensive potential.</p>



<p>In maps, players encounter corrupted Vaal remnants that attract monsters; powering six of these devices opens a portal to Lira Vaal, an underground temple once ruled by Atziri, where a console allows players to assemble a custom layout using six room tiles per run.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Vaal_Atziri_Cinematic2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Queen Atziri, driven by the impossible pursuit of eternal youth, prepares to sacrifice her empire, forcing players to intervene.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The developers revealed that with Path of Exile 2: The Last Druids, the previous league, Rise of the Abyssal, is being folded into the core game as a permanent endgame mechanic. Abysses will no longer appear in every area by default, but can show up randomly in endgame or be targeted using new Abyss Tablets, which can be crafted to add Abyss‑specific modifiers and now have their own atlas passive tree with options for more monsters, deeper interactions with other leagues, and specialization in particular Abyss factions.</p>



<p>Abyss crafting and Instilling on Waystones are removed entirely to cut down on micromanagement and visual clutter; in exchange, Tablet modifiers are significantly buffed and can be upgraded to rare quality with four mods after defeating the Arbiter of Ash. The developers stated that future leagues will avoid adding more crafting directly to Waystones, while Fate of the Vaal provides an alternative in the form of Tablet corruption, which can yield a range of random outcomes.</p>



<p>Grinding Gear is also pushing to make endgame mapping feel less overwhelming without reducing rewards. Monster density no longer scales up in higher‑tier maps; instead, regular enemies gain roughly 40% more life, drop about 40% more items, and grant around 40% more experience at the top tiers, while monster speed modifiers are toned down and Delirium fog visuals are significantly reduced for better clarity.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, the developers have also taken to heart the many complaints about the game's current performance. They claim that Path of Exile 2: The Last of the Druids includes CPU and multithreading optimizations that are expected to improve frame rates by at least 25% in many scenarios and reduce frame time spikes, particularly on consoles. Additional performance improvements are currently under development and will be rolled out over the coming months.</p>



<p>Path of Exile 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-servers-currently-down-early-access-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn't have the best early access launch</a>. Still, one year later, its reception is slowly improving, as evidenced by the fact that recent user reviews on Steam are very positive, with a 93% rating. In contrast, the total review rating (including older reviews) sits at 75%. The Last of the Druids seems to be another solid step toward the full 1.0 launch, which still has no release window.</p>

Studios and Cryptozoic Entertainment aim to bring the quirky energy of the cult show about riffing on cheesy movies to gaming tables, and it is already a major success.</p><h2>The <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Game</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2><p>As the campaign page explains, <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Game</em> is a competitive experience where you and your friends riff on key moments in chintzy sci-fi movies.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>In the broadest strokes, the game is similar to <em>Apples to Oranges</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cards-against-humanity-sues-spacex-for-15-million" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Cards Against Humanity</em>.</a> A Movie Moment card is drawn at random and placed in the playspace. This moment is from a notoriously bad movie featured on <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em>, including <em>Manos: The Hands of Fate</em>, and <em>Santa Claus Conquers the Martians</em>.</p><p>Each player has a hand of riff cards with different responses, and one player rotates as The Mads, or the judge. All players submit a riff card randomly to the judge, and whichever riff is the funniest gets that player points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.</p><p>Interestingly, the game does have some extra modes for more creative tables. Instead of Movie Moment cards, you can simply play a random movie and pause it at certain parts, prompting riff responses. The game even includes several dry-erase cards for submitting your own custom riff. With the right people, this game can turn into a competitive bad movie night blast.</p><picture>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grinding Gear Games pulled back the curtain on what’s coming next for Path of Exile 2 in update 0.4.0, and it’s one of the game’s largest updates yet. Also known as Last of the Druids, update 0.4.0 releases on December 12 and introduces the long-awaited Druid class, complete with three shapeshift forms, alongside an entirely new league, major crafting systems, performance upgrades, and sweeping balance changes across the board.</p>



<p>The reveal opened with Game Director Jonathan Rogers introducing The Druid, a hybrid Strength/Intelligence class the team says has been “one of the hardest classes for us to design.” The class blends traditional spellcasting with fluid shapeshifting between Bear, Wolf, and Wyvern forms, each built around completely different playstyles. Rogers emphasized that form-swapping is designed to be “seamless and immediate,” letting players weave in and out of forms mid-combat without friction.</p>







<p>Each form offers its own mechanics: Bear specializes in heavy, rage-powered melee; Wolf leans on mobility and cold damage to build a pack of summoned companions; and Wyvern unleashes long-range elemental breath attacks while consuming corpses to gain power charges. Human-form spells like Volcano, Entangling Vines, and Thunderstorm stack on top of that, creating setups that fuel form-based combos. The class also introduces a new weapon type—Animal Talismans—which determine which form is active and provide the form’s basic attack.</p>



<p>The Druid is also launching with two ascendancy classes: the Shaman, which channels rage into spell damage and enhances elemental chaos around the player, and the Oracle, which uses Foresight to predict incoming skill opportunities and unlocks more than 130 additional passives through alternate-timeline “future selves.”</p>



<p>A third Druid ascendancy will come later, but for now, players can look forward to several new support gems, over 20 Druid skills, and a standout unique item called Fury of the King, which transforms Bear form into a fire demon using the Molten Crash slam.</p>

<h2 id="h-introducing-the-fate-of-the-vaal-league"><strong>Introducing the Fate of the Vaal League</strong></h2>



<p>Alongside the Druid comes Path of Exile 2’s newest league, Fate of the Vaal, which dives deep into the lore surrounding Atziri and the ancient Vaal civilization. Game Director Mark Roberts walked through the new league structure, which revolves around uncovering arcane Vaal remnants across Wraeclast. Fully activating them opens a portal into a lost underground temple once belonging to Atziri herself.</p>



<p>The twist is that players essentially build the dungeon themselves. Every run offers six rooms that can be placed to shape the temple layout, link pathways, and position reward rooms. Room interactions matter as much as placement—Garrisons strengthen next to a Commander, Golemworks can power a Smithy, and generators can energize the entire system. Once a layout is set, players enter the temple, clear each room, and begin preparing for the next rebuild.</p>

<p>Things escalate when the player gains access to a prototype time-portal device. Roberts explains that it takes players back to “right before Atziri triggered the cataclysm,” unlocking an entire suite of past-only rooms with some of the update’s most powerful crafting opportunities. These include multi-stage corruption chambers, new Soul Cores, and the league’s wildest mechanic: limb replacement at the hands of a Vaal Flesh Surgeon, complete with random upgrades that disappear when the player dies.</p>



<p>Defeating the league’s Architect boss unlocks special reward rooms and a path to finally confront the Queen of the Vaal in a reimagined boss fight during her moment of transformation. One of the highlight drops is <strong>Atziri’s Rule</strong>, a staff that increases levels of all corrupted gems and causes projectiles to split into novas when fired at spawning mirrors around the arena.</p>







<h2 id="h-rise-of-the-abyssal-becomes-core-in-path-of-exile-2"><strong>Rise of the Abyssal Becomes Core In Path of Exile 2</strong></h2>



<p>Rise of the Abyssal is officially moving into the core endgame, though players won’t see Abysses in every area. Instead, a new Abyss Tablet allows players to force Abysses into maps and craft Abyss-specific modifiers. Grinding Gear has also built a full Atlas tree around the mechanic, letting players specialize in bosses, factions, or internal league interactions.</p>



<p>At the same time, GGG is addressing one of the biggest complaints about the endgame: monster density. Instead of scaling monster counts up by Tier 15, the team is now keeping density consistent and scaling rewards instead. According to the reveal, monsters will “drop 40% more items, grant 40% more experience, and have 40% more life” as tiers rise—without ballooning horde sizes.</p>



<p>The team is also toning down delirium fog visuals, removing Instilling from waystones, and shifting similar power to Tablets, which last ten maps and reduce micromanagement.</p>

<h2 id="h-performance-upgrades-and-huge-balance-pass"><strong>Performance Upgrades and Huge Balance Pass</strong></h2>



<p>Performance is another focus in Path of Exile 2’s update 0.4.0, with Rogers noting players “should see frame rates at least 25% higher” thanks to significant CPU-side optimizations. This includes better multithreading and fewer frame spikes, particularly on consoles.</p>



<p>The update also includes broad balance adjustments:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>11 new Unique items</strong></li>



<li><strong>21 rebalanced Lineage Supports + 9 new ones</strong></li>



<li><strong>Major ascendancy updates across nearly all classes</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rebalancing of 90 active skills</strong></li>



<li><strong>Over 250 new passive skills added</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Roberts confirmed that additional endgame content originally planned for 0.4.0 has been pushed to 0.5.0, but emphasized that a “significant overhaul to the atlas passive tree” and new pinnacle bosses are already in development.</p>

            <p>Action role-playing game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> is about to get a significant performance boost on all platforms - one that, apparently, will be especially noticeable on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X.</p>
<p>The boost comes from a change in the game's code to allow it to utilise multiple CPU cores better, developer Grinding Gear Games explained in a press presentation for the game that I attended.</p>
<p>"The primary issue is CPU load," co-game director Mark Roberts said, "and to address that a lot of things have been optimised, and we have done a lot of work to take advantage of more of your CPU cores. You should see frame-rates at least 25 percent higher, and a lot less bad frame spikes during gameplay. It does make quite a big difference, especially on consoles."</p>

<p>That 25 percent estimate, however, is an understatement, as I found out while talking to the other game director, Jonathan Rogers, in an interview following the presentation.</p>
<p>"The reason why we mentioned consoles specifically is that they tend to have slower CPUs generally," Rogers said, "which means that on console, you are more likely to run into performance problems at endgame compared to players with PCs. And of course on a console, the hardware is the hardware: you can't upgrade it. You can't do anything about it. It is what it is. So we obviously have to make sure that it's good enough in any situation. That's why there was that call-out specifically.</p>
<p>"I would say, if anything, it's understated. I was willing to commit to 25 percent because I know that we're definitely hitting that, but honestly, in a lot of situations, it's straight up double."</p>
<p>Incidentally, those changes naturally benefit Steam Deck performance as well, and while we're on the topic of handheld gaming devices, has Grinding Gear Games given any more thought putting the game on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>?</p>
<p>"I haven't," answered Rogers. "It's been suggested to us a few times, but... Look, it's not like it couldn't happen. It's just it's one of those things where we have a lot to be doing that isn't that right now, unfortunately. At the end of the day, our engine team is only four people, and we've got a lot of platforms to support. It's one of those things that we can look into once I no longer feel like I've got a problem with performance on the other platforms."</p><p>The performance boost will be one of the many game changes coming to Path of Exile 2 on 12th December, as part of a quarterly update. This will bring, notably, a new druid class to the game and a new league (world) with an underground temple you need to piece together yourself, inspired by the indie game of a few years ago, Loop Hero.</p>
<p>But it's another, smaller, incidental detail - besides the performance boost - that's likely to appeal far more immediately to the Path of Exile 2 playerbase, and that's the dispersing of the Delirium fog. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1pe32vr/a_meme_a_day_until_they_make_a_toggle_to_turn_off/">The game's Subreddit is currently covered in memes about this fog</a>, each of which are a variation on 'I can't see anything because of it'.</p>

</span></p><p>Thankfully, Grinding Gear Games has heard your fog-muffled cries, and toned it down "significantly", Rogers said. It's still there because it's a fundamental part of going to a Delirium world, but it's been dramatically altered.</p>
<p>"Part of the reason why it's an issue is because the game currently has Instilling, and the way that Instilling rewards you effectively meant that it was completely mandatory to use. There is no downside to having it so therefore every map should have it, and therefore every map is just grey fog. So the first thing to do is to straight up remove the requirement to use it," he said.</p><p>"But then there's still Delirium, the league, that we still want to be a thing. So for that, we can't really remove the fog entirely, because then Delirium just wouldn't really be anything at that point - it would just suck. So really, what we need to do is make the fog be a nice experience, so that's what you can see in the [presentation] video where we changed it very significantly. It's not nearly the same as it was before. It's much more fine. So it's fixed in two ways: it's not mandatory and when you do get it, it's way less annoying."</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 is currently available in early access on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S/X. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-release-date-slips-again">A full 1.0 release</a>, which will include all six Acts in the campaign, will likely not happen until later next year.</p>
