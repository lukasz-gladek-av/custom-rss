<figure data-uuid="a331f14a956ca"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a331f14a956ca/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The world of video games hasn't provided much respite from global issues recently, not for those of us who love games and the people who make them. The issues facing the industry and players post-COVID — including mass layoffs, cancelled projects, questionable acquisitions, the encroachment of generative AI, rising prices, an unstable economy and a cost-of-living crisis — mean it's easy to assume there's no going back.</p>
<p>But just when you catch yourself pondering whether the good ol' days of games as an artistic medium and pastime are numbered, just when it looks like we're hurtling down a F2P, games-as-a-service slide greased with AI-generated turds, Nintendo goes and proves that there's life in the old console model yet.</p>
<p>All the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">hardware numbers following launch</a> have been encouraging, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">today's financial results</a> give a much better picture of Switch 2's status, including figures from its first full quarter on the market. Any console from the big platform holders would be expected to sell well early doors, but numbers from July to September have maintained good momentum throughout a summer period where sales traditionally dry up in the biggest gaming territories.</p>
<p>To recap, Switch 2 has sold 10.36 million units since launch, causing the company to bump up its first-year sales forecast from 15 to 19 million ahead of the holidays. Software forecasts have also been bumped from 45 to 48 million.</p>
<figure data-uuid="061603600aafb"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/061603600aafb/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>As you might expect, especially when its successor offers very broad backwards compatibility with performance improvements, Switch 1 numbers have plummeted 60% year-on-year. Yet 1.89 million isn't a bad figure either, and Nintendo still thinks it can sell 4 million OG Switches this financial year, half a million fewer than previous forecasts. Switch 1 is just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">10,000 units away from DS' all-time console record</a>, with only the PS2 ahead of that. And despite the hardware decline, S1 software forecasts have gone up by 20 million to 125 million. More positive news for Nintendo's accountants.</p>
<p>Games-wise, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle worked wonders (with most people presumably avoiding the $80 standalone price), with 9.57 million copies of the game out there as of 30th September. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has sold 3.49 million units to date. Not Mario Kart numbers, but healthy for a non-bundled release; around a third of all Switch 2 owners also have a copy of DKB. It's never going to trouble MKW's current, colossal 92% attach rate, but the ape is holding his own.</p>
<figure data-uuid="931c4e78e3c32"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/931c4e78e3c32/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>High prices and uncertainty in the US made it a tricky launch; with Microsoft and Sony increasing hardware prices this year, Nintendo had a tricky needle to thread with its pricing. But despite the hashtags and general dismay at an $80 Mario Kart — at present, Nintendo's only non-NS2 Edition game at that price point — and increased accessory costs, the numbers speak for themselves. They threaded that needle well enough.</p>
<p>The system could have been rushed out last year, but again, holding back and stockpiling hardware to satisfy demand has paid dividends, with the ball rolling nicely over the summer months. Despite industry trends and suboptimal circumstances, Nintendo has proved that the market is still there, the appetite still healthy. People <em>are</em> still willing to pay for quality. The slow and steady approach has paid off. The strategy is working.</p>
<p>The third-party support has been excellent, too. Sure, multiplatform gamers may have played a lot of these games before, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a> discontent is real, but looking at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-best-nintendo-switch-2-games">the best games on Switch 2 so far</a>, 'old' games or otherwise, the quality is undeniable.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ecc82dfd0fd1"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ecc82dfd0fd1/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The wider problems with the games industry surround us still. While PS5 is selling well, Sony's hardly had the most exciting generation, benefiting as Microsoft lurches between <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/10/price-increases-are-never-fun-for-anybody-says-xbox-exec-defending-game-pass-changes">PR disasters</a> and makes Xbox a less viable option by the day. Price increases across the board, however, seem to be making the value proposition of gaming hardware and subscription services worse all the time.</p>
<p>Yet here's Nintendo putting out a little tablet console that, against the odds, is tracking very favourably with its trailblazing predecessor. Switch 2 certainly isn't cheap, and it's arguably still lacking its truly killer app, its 'I <em>must</em> own a Switch 2 to play Game X!' Mario Kart was a great opening salvo. Bananza is brilliant, but it's not a Mario. Switch 2 doesn't have its Breath of the Wild yet. (In fact, you could argue that, weirdly, Switch 2's BOTW <em>is</em> BOTW, but that's another article.)</p>
<p>What it does offer, though, has been enough for more-than-enough people. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-one-month-on-how-did-nintendos-switch-2-launch-go">The launch had its stresses</a>, but Nintendo has maintained the momentum beyond that opening month and is very well-placed to get stuck in over the holidays and into the new year with a packed and varied lineup. Next quarter's results — the October-November-December crop — will include figures for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>.</p>
<p>That's four brand new games, including two S2 exclusives, and we already know that Pokémon had a monster-sized launch, scoring <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-legends-z-a-scored-us-biggest-physical-game-launch-since-totk">the US' biggest physical launch since</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Packed, varied, and super effective indeed - and that's just the first-party-published stuff.</p>
<figure data-uuid="41c00c3939cc3"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/41c00c3939cc3/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the past few months, I've pondered if peppering umpteen NS2 Edition upgrades between its brand new S2 exclusives would be enough to get people on board and sufficiently excited to splash out on a pricey console, despite the pent-up desire for something new. For all the buzz, the next Animal Crossing is, well, the 'old' Animal Crossing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">with some Bells and whistles</a>. Will that be enough? Will the inevitable 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Hyper Fighting Dash Dojo EX' keep this ball rolling?</p>
<p>All evidence points to 'Yes, absolutely.' Well played, Nintendo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has announced the first batch of games coming to Xbox Game Pass for the month of November 2025, with the big ticket of the month being Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which is only available to PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, but will still undoubtedly make the biggest splash.</p>



<p>Surrounding Call of Duty is a slew of indie games, almost like Xbox didn't want to go out and grab anything too major for November for fear of overshadowing its golden goose. That's just some joking speculation, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-far-behind-battlefield-6-pre-order-sales/">it would be difficult for any game, no matter how big, to overshadow a Call of Duty release</a>.</p>



<p>That said, the games you'll be able to check out on Xbox Game Pass include Pigeon Simulator, a game where you play as a pigeon that is a member of a top-secret unit that has orders to deal with dangerous anomalies harming New Squawk City. Winter Burrow is a woodland survival game where you play as a mouse coming back home for the winter. Dead Static Drive is an indie survival horror game with Eldritch themes while carrying a spooky tone underneath it all.</p>



<p>All of those games, along with Black Ops 7, are available on their launch days, and as day one releases are only available to those at the Game Pass Ultimate tier.</p>



<p>For those not at the top tier, you'll be able to add Sniper Elite: Resistance, Voidtrain, Great God Grove, and Lara Craft and the Temple of Osiris to your gaming time this month.</p>



<p>Here's a full list of what's coming to Xbox Game Pass in November 2025, and which tiers they'll all be available for:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dead Static Drive - November 5 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Sniper Elite: Resistance - November 5 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Egging On - November 6 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Whiskerwood - November 6 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Voidtrain - November 7 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Great God Grove - November 11 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris - November 11 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Pigeon Simulator - November 11 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Relic Hunters Legend - November 12 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Winter Burrow - November 12 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - November 14 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, with games entering the subscription service, there are games leaving. This month, five games will leave the service, a couple of them being major departures. The departures are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Football Manager 2024 (both the PC and console versions)</li>



<li>Blacksmith Master</li>



<li>Frsotpunk</li>



<li>STALKER 2: Heart of Chernobyl</li>



<li>Spirittea</li>
</ul>

              <p>The computer role-playing game, most widely known as the RPG, turns 50 today! Well, as close as we can pin it, anyway. Happy birthday, RPGs!</p> <p>In 1974, the year <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> began publication, a couple of guys at Southern Illinois University called Gary Whisenhunt and Ray Wood became interested in programming in the TUTOR language for the educational computer system PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations). PLATO was kind of extraordinary: a network of around a dozen mainframe computers running processes for several thousand terminals around the world. And like all educational devices, the University of Illinois’ PLATO was frequently misused by students, in this case to create a role-playing game on that proto-internet. That game was to be <em>The Game of Dungeons</em>, more commonly known—because of its filename—as <em>dnd.</em></p> <p>In 1975, a University of Illinois resident called Rusty Rutherford—aware of the as-yet unfinished <em>dnd</em> but not involved—spent a handful of weeks creating his own RPG for PLATO. His was called <em>The Dungeon</em>, but again due to filenames became known as <em>pedit5</em>. Due to the speed with which Rutherford worked, <em>pedit5</em> would release first, and as such take the mantle of the first-ever RPG.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, at the Claremont University Center in California, student Don Daglow (the person responsible for the first-ever baseball game in 1971, <em>Baseball</em>, and the first-ever RTS game in 1981, <em>Utopia</em>) worked on a game for the DEC mainframe computer, the PDP-10, also based on 1974’s breakout pen-and-paper hit <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. It was called—wait for it—<em>Dungeon</em>. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_(video_game)">Wikipedia</a>, it’s unknown whether the game released in 1975 or 1976, but given Daglow’s propensity for being first to genres, the former seems more likely. (He also made the first MMO in 1991, <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>.)</p>

 <p>Oh, and on November 4, 1975, another PLATO-based RPG—this time multiplayer—was released by John D. Daleske and Gary Fritz among others, with the groundbreaking title of…<em>Dungeon</em>.</p> <p>So whether&nbsp;<em>The Game of Dungeons</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Dungeon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dungeon,</em> or&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> was first, what we know for sure is that they appeared in 1975, 50 years ago, and one of them on this exact day. Which is plenty of reason to mark today as the day to celebrate the birth of the genre.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641119" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641119"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641119">© John D. Daleske et al</figcaption></figure> <p>It seems to be generally accepted that Rutherford’s&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em> was the very first of them all, a game about wandering through a single floor of a dungeon while doing the two most important RPG things: killing monsters and collecting treasure. There were spells to cast, with randomly generated enemies and loot, and a battle and leveling system based on the rules of the brand new <em>D&amp;D</em>. It was all there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707162725/http://armchairarcade.com/neo/node/1948">albeit limited to around 50 rooms and only 20 stored characters across the whole network</a>, due to the hefty limitations of the system. That name, <em>pedit5</em>, <a href="https://insight.ieeeusa.org/articles/going-rogue-a-brief-history-of-the-computerized-dungeon-crawl/">came from the area in which the code was stored</a>, sectioned off for Rutherford’s department of the Population and Energy Group. The group had five slots, the first three used for relevant programming, while the fifth stored&nbsp;<em>The Dungeon</em> and the fourth contained its manual. As a result, the university naturally deleted this frippery to make room for “proper” programs, but Rutherford persistently re-added it.</p>

  <p><em>dnd</em>, meanwhile, was a story as old as time: a game with large ambitions that was thus delayed and scaled back before eventually being “released.” The intention had been for the game to be a graphical multi-user dungeon (MUD), but this was never achieved, and the game eventually emerged as a more complex version of&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em>. From my reading, there appears to be a fair amount of confusion over whether developers Whisenhunt and Wood created their game contemporaneously with&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em>, or whether it eventually became an embellished version of the earlier game. Either way,&nbsp;<em>dnd</em> offered a multi-layer dungeon called Whisenwood, in which players sought a mystical Grail and Orb. Once again, it merrily ripped off <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ core rules, leveling and spells, although didn’t feature <em>pedit5</em>‘s randomization. But it also boasts two extremely important firsts of its very own.</p>

 <p>The first first for&nbsp;<em>dnd</em> is nonlinearity: Players were able to return to previously explored levels, approaching the game in their own preferred order, relying on the fixed position of enemies and items to let the computer network to store all that data. The second first, and perhaps the more significant, is that this was the first game to feature a boss encounter. Heck, this post could easily have been titled “Happy 50th Birthday, Boss Fights.” Each dungeon’s exit was guarded by a high-level monster, including the Golden Dragon that protected the Orb.</p>

 <p>Then, come November 4, we get the release of the PLATO network’s&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> which,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/101218/dungeon/">according to <em>Mobygames</em>,</a> is considered one of the first-ever MUD games. However, there’s a weirdly small amount of information out there about this one other than that, none of which supports its being multiplayer. The <a href="https://crpgadventures.blogspot.com/2014/08/dungeon-1975.html">wonderful obsessives over at&nbsp;<em>CRPG Adventures</em></a> have been similarly stumped, unable to get it running at all.&nbsp;<a href="https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2021/06/brief-everything-we-know-about-1970s.html"><em>CRPG Addict</em> also had no joy</a>, finding the game missing from many retrospectives, but noting that it was <a href="https://www.daleske.com/plato/plato-games.php">marked by co-creator Daleske</a> as “incomplete,” and also as a “predecessor to <em>Moria.”&nbsp;</em>That would appear to be 1975’s PLATO <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/100905/moria/"><em>Moria</em></a> by Kevet Duncombe and Jim Battin, yet another RPG from that year, but this one able to have ten players joining in together. It was played in the most basic form of first-person you can imagine, but that’s enough for it to claim the title of first 3D RPG! All in that same year!</p>  <p>Obviously none of these games were technically “released,” instead being stored on university servers and spread by word-of-mouth among students and staff. This had been the case since the early 1970s, with text-based adventures already proving popular on the same systems. Others took over development of some of the games mentioned above, elaborating on them through the late ’70s as the technology improved, but it wouldn’t be until 1980 and the arrival of <em>Rogue</em> as a commercial product that anything like an RPG could be considered as becoming mainstream as opposed to mainframe.</p> <p>But it remains undeniable that 2025 marks the 50th anniversary of the RPG as a computer game, and with&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> (PLATO)’s November 4 release, today as good as any date on which to recognize it.</p> <p>Happy birthday, RPGs! 50 years old and still one of the most popular types of games on the planet. From <i>dnd </i>to&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the impact of the <em>D&amp;D</em>-inspired genre on video games cannot be overstated.</p>

(generally witnessed among those in project and studio leadership, but some anecdotes described team leads guilty of them as well) can dramatically and unnecessarily slow down how games are made.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Failing to understand the realities of game development">Failing to understand the realities of game development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers we spoke with described different scenarios where key decision makers did not understand the nitty-gritty details of making games. 3D rigger Sol Brennan said they've witnessed experienced leads decide to skip the "grey-boxing" step of level design and dive straight into art production, not recognizing how much of that work would need to be redone whenever a necessary change came to the level design.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a

- Game Developer Podcast Ep. 55</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, an anonymous game designer said they worked under project leads with outdated expectations of the development process </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> leads with zero experience at all. This designer described how at multiple studios, project leads would approve content to go in production, then throw it out after review, sometimes just because they'd become bored with playing it over and over again.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They called it "circular iteration," as often the final content would be so similar to discarded earlier versions. These leads were also the most likely to be irritated when encountering bugs in a build, seeming to forget they would be hopefully removed in the final version.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They sometimes demanded extra work because they couldn't picture what their colleagues were pitching them. "Frequently, management staff don't come from dev backgrounds and won't be able to understand what they see unless it looks like a final game," explained producer Masao Kobayashi. To appease these leaders, developers produce what he called "fancy concept art and highly-polished, super early demos."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Usually all of this is fake and is thrown out as soon as it is made," he said. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-s-the-real-reason-games-are-taking-longer-to-make-">As we noted last time</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, ever-improving graphical fidelity standards have made this a more lengthy process—and time spent on that wasted content is time not spent on making the final game.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kobayashi also said that across the multiple games he's shipped, leaders often have poor understanding of project timelines and departmental dependencies—the kind that can leave some teams spinning their tires while others are overwhelmed by poorly-scoped tasks.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Failure to trust employees">Failure to trust employees</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An anonymous game writer we spoke with said that across their work in triple-A games, double-A games, and indie games, it was leadership on triple-A games that seemed to actively distrust their employees. They described one big-budget project where every department needed sign-off on their work not just from department leads, but leads from departments who had little-to-no experience on the work they were reviewing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whenever these leads couldn't come to a consensus, it led to weeks of work hanging in limbo, as these individuals were (justifiably) busy and difficult to get in the same room at the same time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This to me was a lack of trust in the people who worked for them," they said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The industry's dismissive attitude towards quality assurance as a discipline can also lead to leaders ignoring colleagues who are the first to ring the alarm bell. Community manager and QA specialist Rose Whitcomb recalled a project where developers deprioritized bugs centered around less popular selectable characters. "The dev played into community favorites and would prioritize those while directing QA to focus on them despite the piling issues for the others," she said. Some of these bugs triggered hard crashes when underplayed characters were paired together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then the game launched—after those under-loved characters had been improved and were more likely to be selected for missions. The team lost precious time hotfixing an issue that could have been cleared up months before.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Treating developers as interchangeable">Treating developers as interchangeable</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Time and again, Kobayashi and the other employees we spoke with watched their employers greenlight games or shift direction solely on the basis of what was commercially successful in the last quarter. Setting aside the fact these games weren't as safe a bet as companies believed, they also were dangerous projects because studio leads didn't understand their employees may have little-to-no experience in the new genre they were chasing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, developers used to family-friendly platformers can't quickly pivot to making a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-like MOBA. MOBA developers may struggle to understand third-person "hero shooters," even if there's design overlap. And developers experienced with hero shooters may struggle when working on family-friendly platformers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Studio leads might also dig their heels in when it comes to refusing pay or promoting key employees, observed Brennan. That refusal would come back to haunt the team when said employees when searching for better-paying jobs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That interchangeability gets worse when you consider what happens when developers leave the studio—either as a result of being laid off or because they received a better offer at a competitor. This phenomenon is only growing more frequent as studios rely on external development studios like Keywords or Virtuos, said Kobayashi. "With the massive layoffs and increased reliance on external co-dev partners, these previously-solved problems became novel problems that cost more and take more time to solve," he said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The failure of slow decision-making">The failure of slow decision-making</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another anonymous developer recalled their experience making games in the 2000s where for unexplained reasons, their department lead was incapable of making decisions. "He was confoundingly incapable of making decisions," this developer recalled. If the team presented this lead with three options—all equally executable—it would sometimes take them months to make a final call.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What was this unnamed team lead doing while his team waited in frustration? Apparently obsessing over minor details of the game's story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This trait can be another consequence of top-heavy approvals process like the kind discussed by the anonymous game writer. Even if individual leads can make decisions on a feature, the requirement for consensus bogs down the project. Whether it's one person or a committee—the refusal to make a decision can have massive downstream effects on development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Providing useless or unclear feedback">Providing useless or unclear feedback</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers we spoke with said one of the most frustrating moments they encountered was when their leads criticized their work, but offered vague guidance on how to improve it. The anonymous level designer recalled their coworker summarizing the vacuous feedback they both received from their lead.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Another designer described it as 'get me a rock. No not that one, a better rock,'" this person said. "They would just do that until string lock forced us to ship whatever was the last iteration."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vdsJ27p61uM?si=PJbgNmIKiQybR52K&amp;start=1731" height="315px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Readers interested in a clear case study of this phenomenon should revisit Double Fine and Two Player Productions' documentary </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/vdsJ27p61uM?list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_">on the making of </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/vdsJ27p61uM?list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_">Psychonauts 2</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It highlights how unclear feedback from studio &nbsp;founder Tim Schafer and then-project lead Zak McClendon frustrated employees and left some designers working on R&amp;D while the game was working towards an Alpha build.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Demanding sudden changes due to playing other games/watching shows">Demanding sudden changes due to playing other games/watching shows</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over a decade after FromSoftware and Bandai Namco released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dark Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2011, game designers still joke about what might be called the "Dark Souls phenomenon," where creative leads in game development head home for the weekend, play a (deservedly) popular game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dark Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and return to the office with sudden directives for new features inspired by these titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The anonymous writer pointed out that these changes sometimes happen after the game director watches a hotly-talked-about movie or TV show as well. Sudden narrative changes can have a drastic downhill effect on all departments if they happen too late in the process.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The willingness to make these pivots can be compounded by the lack of trust for employees and a lack of understanding for the cost of implementing these changes. The developers we spoke with said that the best leaders they had listened to workers when they explained a requested feature wasn't possible or might take too much time. They didn't always cancel the feature, but they would either give direction on how to implement it, or adjust their demands based on the team's capabilities.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Vague crunch policies">Vague crunch policies</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Crunch is a consequence of poor planning," goes the industry refrain. Poor planning can strike in all manner of ways, not just as a consequence of bad leadership. But when crunch hits, how leaders manage the need for overtime can bring a team together or grind them into the ground.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some crunch failures might come down to poor team culture, while others can be about company policy. On the team culture level, the developers we spoke with described how "no-crunch" policies began driving conflict between developers when some workers would be vigilant about their work hours while others pushed into overtime. Not only did they see some colleagues express resentment for their decision to leave on time, they felt pressure from leadership to crunch anyway despite stated policy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Companies that employ hourly workers can create a codified version of this by capping out the number of workable hours. If team leads set unrealistic goals, but employees can only put so many hours on the clock, it's inevitable they'll start doing unpaid work in their time off. Then the game they worked on might go to make millions of dollars while they don't see a penny for the extra time spent.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="When is bad leadership a structural problem? When is it an individual one?">When is bad leadership a structural problem? When is it an individual one?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A quote from writer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/01/magazine/robert-caro-working-memoir.html">Robert Caro</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> rang through my head as I listened to these different stories: "Power reveals." It's a more complex phrase than "power corrupts," which implies anyone in leadership will inevitably become harmful and self-serving. "Power reveals" asks us to define not only a leader's actions, but the nature of the authority they possess.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is no one way to speed up game development. And there is no one way to improve leadership across the video game industry. Sometimes educating how much power a small group of individuals can have over the project will clear mid-development blockers. In other occasions, leaders who plan early and stick to decisions made early in the process, changing course only when needed, can turn studios into game-making powerhouses. Change what "power" means in game development, and you can change what it "reveals" about those who hold it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there are those in leadership who, when given power, will always reveal themselves to be unworthy of it. They might verbally abuse colleagues, lock key team members out of meetings, or pit workers against each other. At the very worst, they might join the ranks of those accused of harassing or discriminating against developers, only keeping their position until some exposé shines a light on their deeds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the contradiction at the heart of the game industry's leadership struggles. Structural reform is necessary. But poor leaders sometimes sneak through any attempts at positive change, keeping power thanks to close relationships with people up the food chain.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AI can't fix any of this. If you want to speed up game development, you need to do the one thing bad leaders refuse to: listen to the people who actually make games.</span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-poor-leadership-slows-down-game-development]]></content:encoded>

<p>Back in April, we went hands of with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, saying, <em>“For now, though, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is easily one of our most anticipated games for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s sure to be a great experience on the original Switch as well, but pushing the graphics to higher levels and the mouse mode are the cherry on top.”</em></p>

			<p>In Ninja Gaiden 4, Yakumo can use, at the end of the campaign, five different weapons all coming with unique properties and attacks, which are further expanded by their Bloodraven forms.While all of these weapons have their own unique uses, and are fully viable to complete the game at any difficulty, using some of them is going to make your life much easier. Here are the best of them.</p>

<figure><figcaption><em>The Dark Dragon Blade is the best weapon in Ninja Gaiden 4</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-dark-dragon-blade">Dark Dragon Blade</h3>



<p>The Dark Dragon Blade is undoubtedly the <strong>overall best weapon</strong> Yakumo can use. Its damage output is only slightly lower than Ryu's Dragon Blade, but it combines that power with exceptional <strong>ease of use</strong> and high utility.</p>

<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Damage &amp; Speed:</strong> Features very high base damage and one of the fastest light attacks in its Bloodraven/Shadow-gleam form.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Utility &amp; Crowd Control:</strong> Offers great utility with its circle motion input skills.

<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Defense:</strong> The fast Shadow-gleam form light attack can reliably stop most Power Attacks, making it excellent for boss battles as well.</li>

This effort, however, is well worth it.</p>



<h3 id="h-kage-hiruko">Kage-Hiruko</h3>



<p>Being the only ranged weapon in the game, the Kage-Hiruko grants great long-range combat capabilities that are extremely effective in the hands of expert players.</p>

<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ranged &amp; Launchers:</strong> Excellent for long-range engagements and features a wealth of launcher attacks, including a quick light-heavy attack (X/Square - Y/Triangle) laucher string.</li>



<li><strong>Unique</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Flying Swallow:</strong> Has a unique version of the ever-useful Flying Swallow technique that also functions as a launcher.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Excellent Bloodraven Form Attacks:</strong> The Nocturnal Rain AOE attack (A/Cross - X/Square) is massively useful, launching multiple enemies in a wide radius. The fast Bloodraven form light attack is perfect for stopping Power Attacks and break guards at all ranges.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">:</strong> The Kage-Hiruko loses out to the Dark Dragon Blade due to lower damage and moveset complexity.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Takeminakata twin blades are balanced weapons that hold their own at any difficulty level</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-takeminakata"><strong>Takeminakata</strong></h3>



<p>The twin blades are Yakumo's starting weapon, but they should absolutely not be dismissed. While their damage output is only acceptable, the weapon's strength lies in its <strong>incredible versatility and utility</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Provides quick access to multiple launchers and a handy area-of-effect (AOE) attack (circle motion - Y/Triangle).</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Crowd Control:</strong> Offers amazing crowd control in Bloodraven Form. This includes the two heavy aerial attacks, which are easier to charge than ground attacks, and the Rising Stance: Spin technique (A/Cross - X/Square), which can decimate multiple enemies in a single strike while in Berserk State.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downsides</strong>: While utility trumps damage, the Takeminakata's lower damage makes it a less reliable choice at high difficulty levels, where fights must be ended quickly.</p>



<h3 id="h-magatsuhi">Magatsuhi</h3>



<p>Heavily reminiscent of the glorious Lunar Staff in Ninja Gaiden 2, the Magatsuhi staff is a solid weapon that deals <strong>good damage</strong> via its ground multi-hit combos.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Crowd Control:</strong> Thanks to the staff's hitboxes, these combos work well as crowd control attacks, hitting enemies behind and to the sides of Yakumo, making it invaluable against enemies that swarm Yakumo in greater numbers.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Bloodraven Form Attacks:</strong> The massive hammer into which the staff turns into in Bloodraven mode has surprisingly fast and strong attacks. By pressing A/Cross, Yakumo can also launch high in the air to escape pressure and unleash damaging downward AOE attacks.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong>: The Magatsuhi staff doesn't have easy access to a basic launcher attacker, mostly forcing a grounded playstyle. Its most damaging combos also require long execution times which are often interrupted at Hard and Master Ninja difficulties.</p>



<h2 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Yatousen isn't a bad weapon, but every other weapon in the game does what it does, and better</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-yatousen">Yatousen</h3>



<p>The Yatousen rapier is an interesting weapon characterized by its exceptional <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">mobility and speed</strong>. However, its overall usability is extremely limited by a few core design conflicts.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Mobility: Many of the Yatousen combos have great mobility, which can help Yakumo get out of danger while keeping up the pressure</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downsides:</strong> The lack of a quick launcher to set up Izuna Drops, the low attack power in base form and the limitations of Bloodraven form, which requires Yakumo to stand still to deal max damage in any combo string, make it a situational weapon that works best against bosses only in Bloodraven form.</p>

              <p>Those familiar with Nintendo are likely aware of the company’s litigious proclivities (that is, except when <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222">a certain governmental body is using its intellectual property</a> to promote the brutalization of human beings). And <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-summon-digimon-2000624724">scoring a patent for summoning monsters</a> and having them fight on your behalf, known as the “397 patent,” was an essential victory in Nintendo’s battle against “<i>Pokémon</i> with guns” survival game <i>Palworld</i>. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/5-game-mechanics-legally-protected-by-the-companies-that-made-them/">Patenting a game mechanic</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/5-game-mechanics-legally-protected-by-the-companies-that-made-them/">is nothing new</a>, but this particular patent has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patent-pocketpair-court-2000640115">regarded by many as, well, <i>absurd</i></a>, and acquiring it hasn’t exactly been the victory the Pokémon Company seems to have been hoping for in its quest to deal <i>Palworld</i> an irreversible loss.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patent-pocketpair-court-2000640115">Nintendo Was Just Dealt A Big Blow In Its Battle Against <i>Palworld</i></a></p> <p>Joining the chorus of folks saying “this is silly” is Trump nominee John A. Squires, director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/us-patent-office-boss-orders-reexamination-of-nintendos-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-which-ip-lawyer-claims-further-undermines-credibility-of-its-case-against-palworld">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>). Squires has highlighted two older patent applications from Konami and Nintendo as “prior art” that might invalidate Nintendo’s claim to owning the concept this particular patent focuses on. As a result, Squires has ordered the merits of the controversial 397 Patent to be reconsidered.</p>

 <p>It doesn’t look good for Nintendo’s aggressive efforts.</p> <p>Some, such as <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/"><i>Games Fray</i>’s Florian Mueller</a>, are describing this move by Squires as a major loss for the company. As Mueller notes, Squires has not ordered the patent to be yanked. Reexamination orders, according to Mueller, “can result in a patent being upheld.” But this specific <i>Pokemon</i> case seems unlikely to be one of those situations. Nintendo has two months to respond to the reexamination, and in that time other companies are free to challenge the merits of the patent.</p> <p>These days it feels hopeless to expect any sort of fairness or equitable decision-making to come out of the federal government, but it seems like, at the very least, Nintendo’s power grab might be reined in.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6’s ‘Take A Shower’ Screen, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-take-a-shower/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98take-a-shower%E2%80%99-screen-explained.1343467/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’d like to think that everyone regularly showers to keep clean and healthy. While you may be sitting down for long Battlefield 6 sessions, we should be keeping that shower active. Players are reportedly being told by Battlefield 6 itself to take a shower, with the keyword being ‘reportedly.’</p>



<p>It can be hard to take anything for granted at face value in 2025. The overwhelming influx of AI means that so much of what we see online is up for debate. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-ps4-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> is an excellent shooter, and it’s easy to lose yourself, as Eminem once told us. But you definitely shouldn’t miss your opportunity to go outside, touch some grass, and keep on top of your personal hygiene!</p>



<p>Allegedly, EA is reminding you that this is the case.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-battlefield-6-s-take-a-shower-screen">What Is Battlefield 6’s ‘Take A Shower’ Screen?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>To stink or not to stink, that is the question. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>An image circulated on social media of a Battlefield 6 player’s screen featuring a simple message: “Take a shower.” They were allegedly banned for a “few hours” as a result.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the alleged Battlefield 6 in-game message in its entirety:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Take A Shower. You have been playing for 16 hours straight we cannot allow you to continue on Battlefield 6 servers. We have restricted your account for a few hours please take a break. We have an obligation to keep our players and community safe. This ban is only temporary polease try again soon.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This would be quite an unprecedented message from a developer to stop the community from enjoying their game. Still, because the image is out there, it’s raising questions about its legitimacy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-6-s-take-a-shower-screen-real-or-ai">Is Battlefield 6’s Take A Shower Screen Real Or AI?</h2>



<p><strong>We can’t officially confirm if the message is fake, but all signs and evidence point to the Take A Shower screen being a semi-convincing case of Photoshop or AI.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, we haven’t had a single session of Battlefield 6 for 16 hours or more. Officially, we can’t debunk this. But there are several factors that should reinforce that this isn’t a real image.</p>



<h3 id="h-grammar">Grammar</h3>



<p>Where do we even start with the grammar? There’s a random space before “You” begins the paragraph, there are missing commas galore, and the sentence’s construction feels very sloppy and inorganic.</p>



<h3 id="h-qr-code">QR Code</h3>



<p>Quite simply, the QR Code doesn’t work. That’s about as big a telltale sign as you need, really. Unless our device was malfunctioning when we tried to scan it, it highlights that this image probably isn’t real.</p>



<h3 id="h-restricted-button">Restricted Button</h3>



<p>We’ve allegedly been told about the ban, why it’s happened, and that you can’t play anymore. It makes sense to have a “Quit” button, so why would there be a “Restricted” option? It reeks of an AI prompt that hasn’t fully grasped the initial request.</p>



<p>Feel free to make up your mind on the Take A Shower Screen. We don’t advise this, but if you desperately need clarification, there’s an easy way to test this: Either play the game for over 16 hours, or keep it running for that time.</p>



<p>If you manage to do any of this, let us know. Send us a picture, or go to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, so we can solve this bizarre mystery once and for all!</p>

                <p>One of the most terrifying things you'll ever see in life is a fresh ding or a scrape on your car, but Wreckfest 2 developer Bugbear Entertainment is embracing this horror with the next update for the game. Whereas other car games allow you to create four-wheeled art with their livery editors, Bugbear is instead focusing on hurting the resale value of your digital jalopy with its car editor, fittingly dubbed the "CRAP-IT" toolset.</p><p>As demonstrated in the video below, you can create crimes against pixels by ruining the body of your car with bumps, watch the paintwork decay as rust sets in, and make car collectors lament the fate of your vehicle when you attempt to cover up the damage with badly placed decals.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hWHQ2GpVjY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-hWHQ2GpVjY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to the new feature that allows you to craft your very own car culture sins, the update has also improved the game's tire physics--"boing"--introduced faster loading times, added a new track called Crash Canyon 2.0, and introduced a new car in the form of a Volkswagen Beatle--an awful vehicle that deserves to feel the full force of the CRAP-IT system.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wreckfest-2-will-bring-its-penchant-for-destruction-to-early-access-in-march/1100-6529218/">The early-access journey for Wreckfest 2</a> kicked off in March this year, and the game is scheduled to be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S eventually.

The roughly 70-second video features the bounty hunter's gunship in aerial combat and a pretty slick motorcycle move by Samus that's an homage to <a href="https://x.com/GameSpot/status/1726305588693389790" rel="nofollow ">the Akira slide</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Metroid Prime 4 trailer--seen below--also highlights a variety of locales on the mysterious planet. Samus finds herself in a lush jungle, outside a spiky black building that would look at home in The Matrix, and what we can only assume is the obligatory lava area at one point. The bounty hunter also scans a new enemy mechanoid called a psy-bot soldier as well as fights the boss Aberax (previously highlighted during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/metroid-prime-4-beyond-17-minutes-of-official-gameplay-nintendo-switch-2/2300-6465874/">a Nintendo Treehouse stream</a>).</p>

Last but not least, Sylux appears at the end, teasing the rival hunter as the main antagonist for the Switch and Switch 2 game.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-metroid-prime-4-beyond-ad-shows-a-curious-new-boss-fight/1100-6535658/">leaked Metroid Prime 4 ad seemingly revealed a new boss</a>. The commercial in question shows a player using mouse controls with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/">the Switch 2 Edition</a> of the game before encountering the spherical Xelios foe.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, GameSpot got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/">hands-on time with Metroid Prime 4</a>. The game from developer Retro Studios is set to launch on December 4--exactly one month away. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/">two of the game's Amiibo</a> arrive this week.

<p>In addition to that historical retrospective and a 12-page Dragon Quest Reimagined cover story, which features my thoughts after playing the game for two hours alongside words from the game's various development leads, this issue is jam-packed with excellent features. Senior Associate Editor Marcus Stewart spoke with Edmund McMillan, the creator of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a>, about his new game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>. Freelancer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/imluisgutierrez.bsky.social">Luis Joshua Gutierrez</a> plugged a hole in <em>Game Informer </em>coverage with an awesome look at the culture surrounding the mega-phenomenon that is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/05/17/five-nights-at-freddys-2-gets-december-2025-premiere-date">Five Nights at Freddy's</a>. The entire GI crew banded together to create a round-up of the best co-op games to play during the holidays!&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of holidays, Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller scoured storefronts to bring you 10 pages of great gifts for the gamers in your life. Elsewhere in this exciting issue, we have a look at the history of games that <em>Game Informer </em>has awarded the prestigious 10/10 review score (because this issue features a review for a game we gave a 10!), the top five dragon quests, a look at Riot's upcoming League of Legends card game, Riftbound, a look back at 2025 aka The Year of the Ninja, and even a post-launch <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> interview with Sucker Punch Prodcutions.&nbsp;</p><p>In case you haven't seen it yet, here's another look at the beautiful and vibrant Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover, which features Prince Keifer, Hero, and Maribel avoiding the gaze of a stone golem in the game's unique visual style, which is based on real-life dolls Square Enix created:&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Dangen Entertainment and developer Friends of Safety have announced that the action horror RPG Kingdom of Night will be available from December 2nd on PC. A console version is due at a later date. Kingdom of Night is an isometric title that has a 1980’s theme to it, and in it players choose their class and abilities to deal with a variety of monstrosities, some of which can be seen in the new release date trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom of Night - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKuC0YZZhuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story of Kingdom of Night follows John as he embarks on a mission to save the town of Miami from the forces of Baphomet who seeks to conquer. In addition to fighting Baphomet’s monsters, John also has to deal with high school bullies. John can be one of five classes, Barbarian, Knight, Rogue, Necromancer and Sorcerer, with each giving base powers and stats that can be improved upon in the skill tree. The game can also be played in local co-op, so someone else can accompany John to face the forces of evil and the high school bullies.&nbsp;Players will be able to freely explore the town of Miami, finding quests to tackle as they do so as well as secrets which could deliver some powerful gear.</p>
<p>Kingdom of Night will be available on Steam, GOG, Humble Store, and itch.io, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1695580/Kingdom_of_Night_Demo/">with a demo currently available on Steam.</a></p>

And folks, it's looking and sounding <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>This is the third Hyrule Warriors game and is completely canonical, set long before the events of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Taking place during the Imprisoning War, it follows Zelda after she's been transported back in time, basically filling in the gaps on what the princess was doing while she was stuck in the past.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSFfvavDRTdA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>For our very own PJ O'Reilly, it's probably the best Hyrule Warriors game to date, with near-perfect performance, deliriously fun combat, and a pretty solid story, the only downside is that the maps are a little safe. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">PJ's 9/10 review</a> concludes that "Lessons have been learned from both Hyrule Warriors and Age of Calamity, resulting in a game that balances big-time story with top-notch combat that's got proper depth to it."</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:192867 @ 1762277401 -->
<p>But of <em>course</em> we're not the only ones who have covered the game. While some outlets are holding back until launch day (due to embargo restrictions), there are plenty of critics willing to share their thoughts on Age of Imprisonment.</p>
<p>Let's start near the top, shall we? <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/">RPG Site</a> is equally as glowing as us on the game, rewarding it a <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/18880-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-review">9/10</a>, with reviewer James Galizio even calling it "a sleeper hit for my personal game of the year." The story strikes a good balance between Zelda and the other characters, and the game is stuffed full of the best Musou combat to date:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Age of Imprisonment isn't just a great Zelda spinoff, but confidently stands among some of the singular best games in the entire Zelda series."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming down a notch, <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/">CGMagazine</a>'s Chris de Hoog awards Age of Imprisonment <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">an 8.5/10</a> and an Editor's Choice, calling the story "a fulfilling complement" to TOTK, with particular praise given to the blend of the mainline game's combat with the Warriors formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> had me hooked for its entire 30-hour+ quest, always torn between wanting to see what happened next in the story and seeking out the components to unlock new features for the characters."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another outlet praising the game's combat is <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/">VGC</a>, with friend of the site and NL contributor Chris Scullion awarding Zelda's Musou outing <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">a 4/5</a>. If you're still worried about the frame rate, then here's another review stating that "noticeable" dips below 60fps are "rare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The combat is the best in the Hyrule Warriors series to date, and once you’ve reached the credits, about 18-20 hours in, there’s still a hell of a lot to do thanks to a large map filled with side-quests, unlockable characters, and other missions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TJ Denzer over at <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/">Shacknews</a> joins the performance cheers with <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/146650/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-score">an 8/10 review</a>, but is less enthusiastic about the sidequests and music. However, the combat is once again the star (we're also <em>big</em> fans of that headline, 'Ultrahanding out beatdowns'):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trying out Switch Skills and Sync Attacks between practically every pair of characters were some of my favorite things in this game and I hope Koei Tecmo tries something like them in future games..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slipping into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/">7/10</a> scores we have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">GameSpot</a>'s Richard Wakeling, who says that performance issues "are almost completely absent". The downsides come in the form of an inconsequential story and a lack of mission variety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The story doesn't feel essential enough to satisfy pure Zelda fans, but by ironing out its predecessor's performance issues and introducing a varied roster of rewarding characters, Age of Imprisonment marks a high point for the spin-off series thus far."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/">Gamesradar+</a>'s Oscar Taylor-Kent is a little more muted, awarding the game a <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">3/5</a> citing "underutilized" spaces and "bland maps" with many missions lacking "depth", but combat is "sharply improved" compared to previous Hyrule Warriors games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I have more fun revisiting the less fully featured Age of Calamity, something has gone amiss. They did call it Age of Imprisonment, I suppose – but I wish they'd let me off the leash a little. Zelda's beam sword hungers for more."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is sitting on a respectable <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">78 on Metacritic from 52 reviews</a> (at the time of writing this), but that number will change over the coming days. OpenCritic sits at a similar <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/19291/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">77 but from only 18 reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Still, you'll be able to judge for yourself when Age of Imprisonment launches on Switch 2 on <strong>6th November 2025</strong>. What a treat, hey?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of interesting news and other stuff you might care about. Don’t worry, I’m not mad that you didn’t call at all while you were away. I’m used to it, really. Anyway, let’s move on and talk about <em>Concord</em>, a new<em> Vampire Survivors</em> spin-off game, bad news for <em>PUBG</em> fans on PS5, and good news for <em>Battlefield 6</em> players craving a big new map to play on.</p> <p><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> finally has a big Conquest, but EA didn’t make it</strong></p> <p>Since <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s beta earlier this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803">players have been begging the devs to make bigger maps</a>. And a few fans have grown tired of waiting and have used <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s own in-game content creation tools to turn the shooter’s recently added (and very big) battle royale map into a few different massive conquest levels. You can see some gameplay of this below via Jackfrags.</p>

  <p>Watching gameplay of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1on9ras/two_new_br_maps_with_three_conquest_gamemodes/">Golf Course conquest map created by Kurtinthegrind</a> and a few other players has me both excited for the future of Portal<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --><em>BF6</em>‘s mode dedicated to user-created levels and modes<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and sad that we don’t have a big map like this in the official game yet. Portal, while fun, has various restrictions, including smaller XP rewards and less populated matches and servers. And from what I can tell, this big new conquest map made by fans runs well on console and PC. So the engine seems capable of handling this kind of experience.</p>

 <p>Honestly, if I were running Battlefield Studios, I’d be porting at least the Golf Course map into the main game ASAP as a bonus extra new level for this season. Don’t even tease it. Just drop it and watch fans go wild.</p> <p><strong><em>Concord</em> directly mentioned during UK government debate over consumer laws</strong></p> <p>Remember <em>Concord</em>? It was that short-lived hero-based FPS from Sony that <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">shut down just two weeks after launch</a>. Well, <em>Concord</em> was brought up in the UK House of Commons during a debate about consumer rights and laws regarding live-service video games, an issue raised by the Stop Killing Games movement. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concords-sudden-shutdown-is-such-a-big-deal-its-been-brought-up-during-uk-government-debates-on-video-game-consumer-laws">According to <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, MP Ben Goldsborough led the debate on Monday.</p>

 <p>During the debate, another MP specifically named <em>Concord</em>, stating: “A recent example is <em>Concord</em>, a game released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in August 2024. Following a disappointing launch, Sony Interactive Entertainment made a commercial decision to shut it down. To their credit, they did refund all purchases, but this isn’t always the case.”</p>

 <p>Don’t expect any change to UK laws to come from this, as the government <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0195/">has already stated it has no plans to change consumer laws</a> in regards to live-service, online-only video games.</p> <p><strong><em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Warhammer</em> collide in new official spin-off</strong></p>  <p>As announced on November 4, the folks behind<em> Vampire Survivors </em>are teaming up with the <em>Boltgun </em>devs to create a new spin-off game officially known as <em>Warhammer Survivors.</em> In a press release for the newly revealed game, <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/dmvj6ri9/tear-through-hordes-of-tyranids-and-skaven-in-upcoming-video-game-warhammer-survivors/">Games Workshop describes it</a>&nbsp;as a “brand new and completely standalone survivors-style game” that is set in the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> universes. <em>Warhammer Survivors</em> launches sometime in 2026.</p> <p><strong>You’ll have to re-earn all your <em>PUBG</em> trophies on PS5</strong></p> <p>The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 ports of <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> will soon be dead and done, <a href="https://kotaku.com/well-bad-news-for-pubg-players-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-2000617500">as previously announced in August</a>. The devs are going to focus on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S ports of the battle royale game instead. But a new wrinkle for PS4 players is that when you leap to PS5, you’ll have to re-earn all your trophies again. This was confirmed in a new blog post from the devs who say they “explored various options with Sony Interactive Entertainment to make trophy transfer possible,” but due to how much data was involved, it would be “technically difficult to implement.” So they aren’t going to do it. “We kindly ask for your understanding,” <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9355">said the <em>PUBG</em> team.</a></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-fan-made-courage-the-cowardly-dog-game-perfect-creepy-dreams-ps4-2000640924">New<em> Courage the Cowardly Dog</em> fan game looks good</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-eternity-3-turn-based-mode-update-avowed-crpg-2000640875">RPG <em>Pillars of Eternit</em>y is getting a turn-based option a decade later</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-loot-hack-cheat-embark-studios-2000640831"><em>Arc Raiders</em> devs returning loot to people killed by cheaters</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

The Peruvian bear has captured the hearts of children and adults alike in his books, television series, and, most recently, his beloved live-action films starring Ben Whishaw. Now, the British icon has returned to the theater for the first time in 40 years with </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical</span></i><span>, and I’m so obsessed with how the show brings the anthropomorphic bear onto the stage.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The London production began this weekend, with its first show debuting in the West End on November 1. You can recreate the sets, cast brilliant actors as the human characters, and have excellent songs to bring it all together, but the entire show would have fallen apart if they couldn’t bring Paddington himself convincingly to life on stage. Instead of merely using a puppet, </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical </span></i><span>utilizes a combination of animatronics, an on-stage actor, and an off-stage voice to bring the character to the show, and the results are so impressive that it’s almost uncanny.</span></p>

   <p><span>The actor you’ll see in costume on stage is Arti Shah, a little person who dons the full-body Paddington suit. While she’s interacting with the other actors, James Hameed stands off-stage and recites Paddington’s spoken lines. The costume is also fitted with animatronics so the little guy can move his mouth, blink, and be expressive on stage, which Hameed controls to match his line delivery. It’s a multi-person job, but it’s hard to argue with the results. Fans who have seen the show live are smitten with Paddington, and those of us unlucky enough not to be in London are desperate for the show to come stateside. I’ve only seen a handful of Broadway shows since moving to NYC, but I will be there for </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical </span></i><span>if it comes over.</span></p>   <p><span>For now, </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical </span></i><span>is only in London, so if you’re looking for a dose of marmalade-flavored feel-good joy and don’t live there, you can still boot up the excellent live-action movies on your movie streaming service of choice.</span></p>

<p>When you play Battlefield 6 online, you expect to face the wrath of human players. There’s been a lot of discussion about whether or not bots exist in Battlefield 6’s main online multiplayer modes, and we’ve got all the answers and more.</p>



<p>Barely a month into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-dlc-trophy-list-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>‘s launch, and the word bot has been used to death. It literally means nothing anymore; it’s been said or typed that much. A bot is an AI-controlled character, and you usually find them in training modes, single-player campaigns, and they’re seldom seen in online multiplayer. Which is why it’s more curious that Battlefield 6 players think BF 6 has a bot infestation.</p>



<p>There was a clear and obvious answer to this question for a long time, and then Battlefield Studios made it even easier.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-battlefield-6-have-bots">Does Battlefield 6 Have Bots?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>For those seeking a chill time. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 does feature bots in its online multiplayer component, not just the campaign.</strong></p>



<p>It’s official, Battlefield 6 has bots. They were already appearing in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Portal</a>, and in multiplayer from the game’s launch (more on this later), but EA and Battlefield Studios made this mainstream information on November 1 with the addition of the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-casual-mode-added-with-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Breakthrough</a> playlist option.</p>



<p>Here’s what the Battlefield Comms page said about it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We understand that sometimes you want to jump into Battlefield but without the intensity of a full PvP lobby. To create a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges, we’re introducing Casual Breakthrough and this new mode is now live in the main menu under the Multiplayer tab.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Casual makes it so that the majority of the lobby is AI bots—with a sprinkling of human players. This is to give users a more relaxed environment without the worry of human sweats ruining their evening. Bots are very easily identifiable as they won’t move authentically.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Introducing: Casual Breakthrough</p><p>We understand that sometimes you want to jump into Battlefield but without the intensity of a full PvP lobby. To create a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges, we’re introducing Casual Breakthrough…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1984667774430691819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Their movement patterns are more robotic and stiff. They also tend to stand on the spot and shoot, and you won’t find them jumping and sliding about everywhere in a bid to kill you with motion sickness. If you choose Casual Breakthrough, you’re guaranteed to come up against bots, but let’s find out why you’re coming up against them outside of this mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-are-bots-appearing-in-battlefield-6-matchmaking">Why Are Bots Appearing In Battlefield 6 Matchmaking?</h2>



<p><strong>Bots can be used to populate any Battlefield 6 server if the matchmaking system is struggling to fill the lobby.</strong></p>



<p>This has been an ongoing issue since day one: Lobbies being filled up with extra bots to make up the numbers. Battlefield 6 has a more than healthy player count, and will continue to do so for months, maybe years. The game is popular, everyone is enjoying the return to form, and it’s bizarre that bots can appear so regularly.</p>



<p>I’ve encountered my share of bots during later EU hours, and it’s been reported that “Outside peak hours, most lobbies are filled with bots in non-EU/US regions,” according to Reddit.</p>



<p>Multiple regions are reporting that they encounter bots outside of the peak windows, too. Adding bots is simply the most effective way to ensure lobbies are filled with players and there’s no team disparity—especially chaotic 64-player Conquest games, for example.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Worryingly, EA nor Battlefield Studios (as of writing) has yet to address the problem. The closest they’ve come to acknowledging bots is the Casual Breakthrough announcement, and that’s it. Given that a big goal for Battlefield 6 was complete player communication, we’re hoping for some feedback or acknowledgement sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>How frequently are you encountering bots in non-Casual Breakthrough matches? Is it harming your enjoyment of the game?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> developer Epic Games has issued a fresh user survey polling players over its pet-like Sidekicks — and in particular, the need to rebuy each creature to get another version, after your basic design choices are made permanent. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, Fortnite forces fans to lock in their Sidekick's body color, shape and style upon first use, and warns players that their decision cannot be changed again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, just one Sidekick animal is available — banana dog hybrid Peels, which you get two of within Fortnite's current The Simpsons battle pass. Upon first equipping the pooch, you must decide from three banana skin colors (yellow, yellow-green, or mottled), an ear shape (pointy, less pointy, flat) and a body style (slender, or thicc).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After this, each Sidekick also comes with its own mini battle pass of cosmetic add-ons (Peels has an emote where it dances with maracas, and also a couple of shirt options it can wear  that can be equipped at will). But the creature's base design choices are indeed no longer changeable, leaving players who want to try other body options seeking a separate Peels incarnation to change from the ground up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later this week, on November 7, a selection of additional Sidekicks will be available separately via the Fortnite in-game shop, with upcoming creatures set to include more dog breeds, a dinosaur, and even a Fishstick fish in a bubble. Each will cost either 1,200 or 1,500 V-Bucks (around $10-$14), and each is expected to offer numerous permanent cosmetic options fans will have to buy numerous versions of to own them all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the backlash to this decision, Epic Games has sent a fresh user survey sent to Fortnite players, including myself, that specifically asks for feedback on Sidekicks' permanent customization mechanic — offering some fans a glimmer of hope that the whole thing is being reconsidered.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">We Build the LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"How do you feel about the Sidekicks cosmetic?" asks one question. "Did you know that Sidekicks have basic features that you can only customize once upon claiming that Sidekick (e.g. its color and shape?" asks another. And then:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"How do you feel about having to purchase an additional copy of the same Sidekick if you want to customize your Sidekick with different basic features?" asks a third query, with various options to reply, from "strongly dislike" to "strongly like."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have suggested Epic Games originally envisaged buying Sidekicks to be like adopting a creature from a pet shop — with a specific design you bond with over time (and as you unlock their battle pass). Others have also said that the pricing here, while steep, is little different to Fortnite's also widely-disliked Kicks (digital shoes), which often cost upwards of 1,000 V-Bucks for licensed designs, and regularly require players to buy multiple copies to access different colors. (Around a dozen near-identical digital pairs of Crocs exist in the game, each of which must be bought separately.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But others have compared Sidekicks to the highly customizable nature of many character skins — and indeed, the color options available to Fortnite's more-basic Pets, which launched back during the game's earlier years, and can be customized at will.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certainly, it feels like the widespread response to Sidekicks' design limitations has struck a chord. Far from a fun new cosmetic type — and one that could prove hugely lucrative, when licensed Sidekicks like Grogu and Stitch arrive — launching to positive sentiment, their soft-launch via Peels has only stirred up a backlash, with various reddit threads and social media posts now encouraging other players not to buy more when they do go on sale later this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Epic Games change course? Time will tell, though answers to that survey (and the sales from this week's shop update) may play a part.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

But don’t worry – unlike Zelda’s 100-year-long wait for Link to emerge from the Shrine of Resurrection, our delay will only last a couple of days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/mrhurgy/reviews">Logan Plant</a> is reviewing Age of Imprisonment for IGN, and that review is basically in the can and ready to go live already. So why the wait? Well, the embargo restrictions Nintendo sent alongside a review code were particularly strict this time around, preventing reviews that publish ahead of launch from discussing <em>any </em>non-public story details whatsoever. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we always try to avoid spoilers in our reviews, and are generally happy to steer clear of specific surprises a developer wants to preserve if requested, not being able to discuss what happens in the story <em>at all </em>is something we simply could not agree to. So, we decided to hold the review until Age of Imprisonment comes out later this week so we can publish our full thoughts without those limitations. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That doesn’t mean we're going to spoil anything major about Age of Imprisonment’s plot, because even being able to discuss non-spoilery details is important here. When Nintendo itself has put an emphasis on Age of Imprisonment telling the canonical events leading up to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom in its marketing for this game, it’s pretty critical that we can clearly and candidly tell you how we feel about those events in our review.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll publish our review when Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment becomes available on the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop, which we’re expecting to happen at around 9 p.m. PT on Wednesday, November 5.

A few hints for Fortnite Chapter 7 have started to emerge, and signs point to the immanent arrival of The Bride, a character played by Uma Thurman in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2.</p><p>Fortnite content creator NickEh30 posted a teaser for Chapter Seven that has a set of coordinates that lead to the Hollywood sign. The text in the teaser says, "Now Playing / Zero Hour / Chapter Seven / Fortnite After Dark With Q&amp;U." In Kill Bill, Q&amp;U was the abbreviation that Tarantino and Thurman used for their collaboration.</p><p>The new season of Fortnite should arrive near the end of November, which be only a few days before the release of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair on December 5. Both halves of Tarantino's movie have been edited back into a single film of this limited theatrical event. That may explain the timing of The Bride's Fortnite debut. If other Kill Bill characters appear, we wouldn't bet against the Deadly Vipers, the Crazy 88, or even Bill himself.</p><p>Fortnite characters were also spotted at the Los Angeles Dodgers' World Series victory celebration in Los Angeles. One of the signs held up said, "Game 7 first, Chapter Seven Next!!" The "Nov 29" date in the sign held by Big Dill may also be the launch point for Chapter Seven.</p><p>Fans have also noticed that Chapter Seven is breaking format slightly by listing the number as a word.
