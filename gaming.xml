			<p>A few hours ago, Bethesda Game Studios revealed that Starfield has now <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1858930054572523833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 15 million players. The game had <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-13-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> 13 million in December 2023 and 14 million this past <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June</a>. To celebrate the occasion, the team not only released a new patch (previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-beta-update-1-14-74-reintroduces-uncapped-frame-rate-on-xbox-series-x-improves-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on the Steam beta build) that unlocks uncapped frame rates on Xbox, but they also released a free quest and vehicle.</p>
<p><em>As a special gift to our players for our 15 million player landmark, get ready to conquer the terrain of unexplored planets with the all-new Deimog, the latest addition to Starfield’s lineup of high-performance land vehicles. Built for speed and endurance, the Deimog features a fully enclosed cabin to keep you protected as you race through rugged landscapes. Its exceptional handling allows you to navigate even the trickiest terrain with ease, while a powerful rocket launcher ensures you’re prepared for any threats—be it hostile wildlife or clusters of enemies.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield Creations: Deimog" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BotRDlQZYhw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Starfield questline is centered around cooking:</p>
<p><em>In the spirit of Thanksgiving, The Perfect Recipe invites you on a heartwarming journey through Akila City, where the past and present collide in the hands of an unlikely dreamer. This character-driven questline introduces you to Harbhajan, a gifted mechanic with a hidden passion for the culinary arts. When you stumble upon a dusty recipe book during your travels, you learn it belongs to Harbhajan—a once-hopeful chef whose ambitions were set aside for a more practical life. Returning the recipes ignites a spark, rekindling old dreams of becoming a galaxy-renowned chef. But could it be too late for a second chance?</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield Creations: Perfect Recipe" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/urwankF0m64?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moreover, following the request of the community, Creations released through the Verified Creators Program will have the option to be achievement-friendly. In simpler terms, they won't block achievements unlocked during your Starfield playthrough. Do note that Achievements won't retroactively unlock on previous game saves with Creations, even if those Creations are now achievement-friendly.</p>

Users have reported a range of issues — including post-installation loads stalling before completion, long login queues, and the game itself crashing — with the $70 flying sim <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2537590/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_">currently tagged as “Overwhelmingly Negative”</a> in customer reviews on Steam.</p><p>Some players are seeing their downloads freeze at 97 percent, while others were stuck on a login queue page at launch for several hours that says “too many users are trying to connect at the same time.” <a href="https://x.com/MSFS_Support/status/1859015159143969106">Microsoft advised players</a> to check the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status">Xbox Support Status page</a> for updates, which doesn’t list any ongoing issues with the game at the time of writing.</p><p>“We are aware of user reports of long initial loading times into <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>,” Microsoft said via the <a href="https://x.com/MSFS_Support/status/1858932444260421714">Flight Simulator support account on X.</a> “With so many users initializing the sim concurrently, we have a large number of server requests. We are working to help resolve the issues as soon as possible.”</p><p>For now, Microsoft is advising players to reboot the game if they’re unable to finish loading beyond 90 percent. Some users lucky enough to clear these hurdles and play the game are also experiencing bugs like disappearing cursors and assets not loading correctly — mirroring similar issues that occurred during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376978/microsoft-flight-simulator-glitches-maps-bugs">its predecessor’s launch in 2020</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-worldwide-launch-shipments-could-be-in-the-7-million-units-range-%E2%80%93-rumor.1040487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-shipments-7-million/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launch could be one of the biggest to date, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gvm2fa/alleged_information_on_switch_2s_initial_shipment/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, the same user who provided a basic sketch of the system last month on the Famiboards forums, which was sort of corroborated by more reliable insiders, provided some more information on the Nintendo Switch 2 launch stock, which was apparently recently finalized. The user couldn't disclose the exact number, but in the United States alone, the volume should be 2.5 times higher than the volume for the original system. If the 2.5 times increased volume will apply to worldwide shipments, Nintendo is planning to ship between 6.5 and 7 million units, which would indeed make it one of the biggest console launches of all time.</p>
<p>While we have to take the information shared today with a grain of salt, hearing that the Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be massive isn't particularly surprising. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-easy-find-stores/">Earlier this year</a>, we heard that 10 million units would be produced for the first fiscal year of availability, and Nintendo itself later confirmed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/">July</a> that the company was focused on producing enough units to meet demand and prevent scalpers from taking advantage of shortages like they did with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles, although the difficulty to find consoles in stores at launch was decisively made worse by other factors, including the pandemic.</p>
<p>As of now, very little is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2 console, other than the fact that it will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">backward compatible</a> with its predecessor. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-4-0-firmware-stuttering-fixed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-portal-4-0-firmware-update-addresses-stuttering-issues-and-more.1040484/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-4-0-firmware-stuttering-fixed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation Portal's latest firmware update, which went live a few hours ago, finally addresses one of the biggest issues that has impacted the system since its launch last year.</p>
<p>The 4.0 update, which also introduces the Cloud Streaming beta that expands the system's functionality by allowing PlayStation Plus Premium members to play select streaming games for PlayStation 5 on the console, also introduced some unspecified system software performance and stability improvements. According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1gvjh1w/update_40_microstutter/">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1gvmd5y/the_microstutter_issue_is_completely_gone_with/">online reports</a>, these improvements are far from being minimal, as with the new firmware update, Sony finally addressed the widely reported micro stuttering issues that the vast majority of users experienced on the PlayStation Portal since launch.</p>
<p>With a single firmware update, Sony managed to improve the system considerably, as the streaming quality issues and the lack of cloud gaming support were undoubtedly the PlayStation Portal's biggest issues that prevented it from being a much more appealing system. You can learn more about what the console did great right from launch in Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The PlayStation Portal isn’t quite the portable successor that players have been asking for from Sony since the decline of the PlayStation Vita. That being said, the PlayStation Portal does one job and does it exceedingly well. It might not reinvent the remote play experience, but for those relying on controller clips to mount a phone to the top of a DualSense controller or third-party controllers that use a mobile device as the display, an official Sony product just makes sense for a unified solution. It might not replace those Backbone controllers and other devices that players might have in their home, but the PlayStation Portal might wind up being the controller that players start reaching for first.</em></p>

                <p>This week marks the 20th anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/half-life-2-review/1900-6113062/" data-ref-id="1900-6113062">Half-Life 2</a>, Valve's seminal first-person shooter and arguably one of the genre's greatest games. To celebrate the occasion, Valve released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-gets-big-20th-anniversary-update-as-new-information-on-episode-3-revealed/1100-6527820/" data-ref-id="1100-6527820">a nearly two-hour documentary</a> on the making of the game, which included the story of how Valve's future was threatened by a lawsuit from its former publisher, Vivendi.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YCjNT9qGjh4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As related by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/a-summer-intern-once-saved-valve-from-a-near-fatal-lawsuit-after-a-publisher-decided-to-go-world-war-3-on-it-and-it-all-hinged-on-one-email/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> and <a href="https://80.lv/articles/valve-steam-the-entire-pc-gaming-industry-were-saved-by-a-single-intern/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">80 Level</a>, the story behind the lawsuit begins about one hour into the documentary, and that tale flows in and out of the background of Half-Life 2's development over the next 43 minutes of the movie. At the heart of the lawsuit was Valve's assertion that Vivendi was distributing Counter-Strike to South Korean cyber cafes without permission from Valve itself.</p><p>In response to Valve's lawsuit asserting its rights, Vivendi responded with multiple counter-claims against the former, as well as Valve COO Scott Lynch and co-founder Gabe Newell. The legal battle was such a drain on Valve's resources that the company nearly went bankrupt. Newell also revealed that he was nearly personally bankrupted as well, and he had to put up his house for sale in order to keep fighting.</p><p>A deal with another publisher gave Valve some much-needed breathing room. But the turning point in the case came when Vivendi handed over millions of pages of emails during the discovery phase, which were all in Korean. As it happened, Valve had a summer intern--a native Korean speaker who is only mentioned by his first name, Andrew--who found the proverbial smoking gun in all of those messages. In an exchange between two of Vivendi's vice presidents, one of them mentioned that he had "destroyed those Valve documents like you asked."</p><p>"I did a lot of lawsuits for a long time," recalled Valve general counsel Karl Quackenbush. "I never saw anything like that. Never. Maybe there was document destruction that couldn't be proved, but that was like, 'We're talking about it in writing.' I'd never seen that before. At that point, Judge Zilly said, 'All matters of fact are now according to Valve. You don't get to contest any of those. Now we're just discussing the [settlement], how much you're gonna have to pay and what the damages are.'"</p><p>Valve emerged from that lawsuit with a settlement that returned its IP from Vivendi and secured its future as a publisher and as a distributer for other publishers through Steam. That bright future might never have happened without Andrew. But the documentary never mentions whether Andrew was offered a job with Valve, which would have been a fitting reward for saving the company.</p>

With cloud streaming, PS Plus Premium subscribers will be able to use the Portal to stream PS5 games, even without a PS5 console, similarly to how Xbox Cloud Gaming works for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. </p>

<p>The beta includes support for select PS5 games in the PS Plus game catalog, including Dave the Diver, Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Monster Hunter Rise, and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, among others. The beta doesn't currently allow for streaming games that have been purchased off the PS Store.</p><p>Players will be able to stream up to 1080p/60fps, with a 1080p stream requiring minimum 13 Mbps, and 720p requiring at least 7 Mbps. The cloud streaming beta is opt-in, and interested players with an active PS Plus Premium subscription can enable it under "Cloud Streaming (Beta)" in the setting menu of their Portal device.</p><p>"PS Portal was an ambitious product for us, and we have been delighted by the positive response from our fans and to see that our vision has resonated with the community," Sony said in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a> post about the new update. The device has been popular in its first year of release, with stock often hard to come by, though it appears to be a little <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/" data-ref-id="1100-6520876">easier to get your hands on</a> now.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Playground Productions and Mega Cat Studios announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-is-back-but-were-not-sure-exactly-how-yet/1100-6525954/" data-ref-id="1100-6525954">the revival of the Backyard Sports franchise</a>, which began with a remaster of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/backyard-baseball-97-review-hit-parade/1900-6418299/" data-ref-id="1900-6418299">Backyard Baseball '97</a> in October. While there are more remasters are on the way, Playground and Mega Cat have revealed that a brand-new Backyard Sports game is now in development, too.</p><p>Additional details about the new Backyard Sports game--or even which sport will be in the spotlight--weren't disclosed. Playground noted in a press release that Mega Cat will develop the title, which will include "all the original characters alongside a few new additions." The announcement also stated that it will have "the comedy, diversity, accessibility, and fun that made the original titles timeless classics." It's unclear if the new title will only be on PC or if the game will be available on consoles as well.</p><p>The new Backyard Sports game doesn't currently have a release date, but the next retro remaster is arriving soon. Backyard Soccer '98 is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170410/Backyard_Soccer_98/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam's wishlist</a>, and it will be launching on November 27. The game will feature six-on-six matches between the Backyard Sports kids, with a total of eight kids on each team. Players have the option of choosing pick-up games or League Play, which allows the assembled team to compete in division play before going on to the Astonishingly Shiny Cup of All Cups Tournament.</p><p>Backyard Soccer '98's return <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-continues-comeback-with-five-more-titles-on-the-way/1100-6527118/" data-ref-id="1100-6527118">was announced in October</a> alongside four other upcoming remasters from the history of the franchise. The remaining titles include Backyard Football '99, Backyard Basketball '01, Backyard Baseball '01, and Backyard Hockey '02. Although none of those games currently have release dates, their wishlist pages are active on Steam.</p>

            <p>Activision has confirmed that players who own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> get a 30 percent XP boost in Warzone.</p>
<p>This little nugget of XP insight comes from a new Black Ops 6 and Warzone trailer, which was released yesterday. "Get Black Ops 6 and receive a XP boost in Warzone," the description reads, while the footage itself adds: "Level up faster in Warzone."</p>
<p>The After Action Report screen in Warzone has also been known to advertise a "premium XP boost" for players who purchase Black Ops 6, as noted by Charlie Intel on X.</p>

<p>In addition, Activision has released a fresh set of patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-01-patch-notes">Call of Duty: Warzone Season 01</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes">Black Ops 6 Season 01</a>.</p>
<p>Here, it confirmed the Black Ops 6 team has addressed those indefinitely spawning zombies on the Terminus map. It has also issued a number of stability fixes.</p>
<p>In Warzone, meanwhile, the team has sorted an issue that allowed players to redeploy with the Specialist Perk Pack still active, among other tweaks.</p>

<p>"Right now, the world is crying out for a big shooter to come along with some new ideas, to grab the genre and the medium by the collar and give it a good shake, perhaps conjuring up a bit of renewed energy in the process. Its arrival on Game Pass for the first time, effectively buying it an instantly expanded player base, ought to give Call of Duty room to take some creative risks," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Black Ops 6 multiplayer review</a>.</p>
<p>"But after such a promising campaign, Black Ops 6's multiplayer offering ultimately did the opposite for me, retreating to the safest of spaces in offering tightly confined, purely twitch-based shooting and little else."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-developer-cast-farscape-star-as-morrigan-after-hearing-her-beat-poet-rendition-of-noughties-rap-banger<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Dragon Age fan favourite character Morrigan found her voice after Farscape and Stargate SG-1 actress Claudia Black sent in a demo tape containing a surprising recording. 
</p>
<p>
Medieval poetry? Fantasy literature? No, it was Black giving a beat poet rendition of Smack That by Akon (feat. Eminem).
</p>
<p>
Writing on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbdpsilhg22c">Bluesky</a>, Dragon Age creator David Gaider today revealed that BioWare had previously wanted Morrigan to be a teenager. There were also plans for the character to be Middle Eastern, though this fell through when legendary actress Shoreh Aghdashloo was no longer available to voice Morrigan's mum Flemeth.

<p>
As plans changed around him, Gaider recalls being given Black's recording and instantly becoming a fan. The rest is history. 
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, here are (some of) the lyrics to Smack That by Akon (feat. Eminem).
</p>
<p>
<em>I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow / Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo? / Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? / And possibly bend you over? / Look back and watch me</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Smack that, all on the floor / Smack that, give me some more / 
Smack that, 'til you get sore / Smack that, oh</em>
</p>
<p>
"I lost my goddamn mind," Gaider wrote. "Yes, I still have the recording. No, you cannot have it.
</p>
<p>
"Naturally, we jumped on that immediately. As I recall, this was met with resistance from higher up - they had this image of Morrigan as young, like 18 years old (no idea where this came from) and complained that Claudia sounded 'too old'.
</p><p>
"The first two sessions we asked her to pitch her voice up and it was AWFUL. So Caroline [Livingstone, BioWare's veteran VO Director] and I did the sneaky thing, and on the third session we asked her to just... act. Use her natural voice. We loved her performance so much we had the feeling that the team would love it too and forget their nonsense. They did."
</p>
<p>
BioWare recently said that a Dragon Age trilogy remaster "wouldn't be easy", because hardly anyone at the studio still knows how its old engine works. This differs from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, which was made in the still-friendly Unreal Engine.
</p>
<p>
For now, then, there's the excellent Dragon Age Veilguard - in which Morrigan, of course, once again appears. "A fantasy role-playing game of astonishing spectacle," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>.

			<p>A modded and overclocked Nintendo Switch console can become an excellent emulation machine, so much so that every entry in The Legend of Zelda series can be played on it, including two games whose remasters were long rumored to be in the works.</p>
<p>In a test video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a> shows how an <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-60-fps/">overclocked system</a> sporting double the RAM of the vanilla system, 8GB instead of 4GB, has no trouble running Wii U games such as The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and Wind Waker and a few other titles, including New Super Mario Bros U, and epic Mickey 2. Interestingly enough, the modded and overclocked system also manages to run Zelda Wind Waker at 1440p resolution at an acceptable frame rate. Even more interesting to see is how the modded Nintendo Switch cannot run the Wii U version of Breath of the Wild, as the game freezes shortly after the beginning of the intro.</p>
<p><iframe title="CEMU on Nintendo Switch - 9 Games Tested" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7lKR1ohpFxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 still continuing to be shrouded in mystery, it is not surprising to see users try to create their own pro version of the original system to make the wait easier to bear. With 2024 almost over, it's almost certain that the first proper look at the new console will only be coming in 2025. The last we heard about the system was earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">this month</a>, with the confirmation that it will be backward compatible with the current system coming straight from Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa.</p>

            <p>On 11th October 2024, three video game studios announced themselves near-simultaneously as the creators of “spiritual successors” to ZA/UM’s mournful Marxist RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>. First came <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">Longdue</a>, a conspicuously corporate operator who are making an untitled “psychogeographic RPG”. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">Dark Math Games</a> followed around lunchtime - they’re making a sexy Antarctic ski resort mystery called <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xxx-nightshift">XXX Nightshift</a>. Finally, there was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">Summer Eternal</a>, the mouthiest and Marxiest of the lot, who have set themselves up as a workers co-operative and have yet to announce a specific project.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All three new studios owe their rise to the sad break-up of the original Disco Elysium team – a torturous series of events involving <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-legal-battle-reaches-court-centres-on-alleged-48m-fraud">legal proceedings</a>, firings, allegations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-says-former-employees-were-fired-for-egregious-misconduct">misconduct</a> and claims of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-lawsuit-woes-continue-as-fired-devs-double-down-on-claims-of-fraud-at-studio-zaum">a fraudulent studio takeover</a>. All three new studios claim to have former Disco Elysium devs on the books, though Longdue have yet to share any names.</p>
<p>Dark Math’s founding members include former Disco executive producer Kaur Kender and art director Timo Albert, while Summer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eternal">Eternal</a>’s members include former Disco writers <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/argo">Argo</a> Tuulik (who resigned from ZA/UM earlier this year, apparently because he suspected he was about to be fired for talking to the press) and Olga Moskvina, together with several former ZA/UM staff - principal writer Dora Klindžić, senior concept artist Anastasia Ivanova, and graphic designer Michael Oswell.</p>
<p>The triple Disco Elysulike announcement was a real gift to wise-ass leftists on social media - for what better way to follow up what is probably the definitive leftwing video game than by having the developers promptly Balkanise themselves into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WboggjN_G-4">rival Monty Python factions</a>. Summer Eternal, especially, seem up for a fight with the other two, commenting acerbically in a press release that "we must be living at the dawn of a cultural Golden Age, when like mushrooms after rain the companies promising 'the next Disco Elysium' are popping up every hour on the hour”.</p><p>Now here’s IGN's Wesley Yin-Poole with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick">an insider report</a> on the competition between the studios, based on a mixture of interviews with Summer Eternal’s Tuulik, statements from Dark Math and Longdue, and chat with anonymous sources at all three studios. It’s all rather messy, and it’s getting messier, for Tuulik has now commented on the article on Twitter, calling it “not a bad writeup of what admittedly is a comically confusing situation”, while offering a number of caveats and sharing additional documents. I’ve tried to pack everything into one article.</p>
<p>According to IGN, Tuulik and Klindžić actually once worked at Dark Math, where they were game director and narrative director respectively on XXX Nightshift. According to documents seen by IGN, their contracts were terminated in July 2024 “due to creative differences”, but IGN also suggest that Tuulik and Klindžić’s departure was the result of more personal disputes. As shared by anonymous sources and corroborated by Tuulik himself, Tuulik accused Dark Math founder Kaur Kender of showing naked photos of Kender’s ex-wife to him and other people at the studio, supposedly to provide inspiration for XXX Nightshift characters.</p>
<p>Kender and other Dark Math staff haven’t denied the accusation of sharing pictures, but have denied that Kender's ex-wife appeared naked in the photos. As for the rest of it, they "will not be commenting on the past" and "are focusing our energy and passions on the development of XXX Nightshift."</p>
<p>Tuulik and Klindžić subsequently worked with Longdue founder Riaz Moola at Moola’s other company CoGrammar - according to IGN, they were consultants on Longdue’s new game. Moola is an enigmatic figure in all this - he’s also one of Dark Math’s investors, so he stands to benefit from the success of both Longdue and Dark Math. Following the publication of IGN’s report, Tuulik has asserted on Twitter that both he and Moola “are equal parts minority shareholders in Dark Math Games”.</p><p>According to documents IGN have seen, Tuulik resigned and left CoGrammar at the end of September, for reasons not given. CoGrammar have subsequently taken legal action against Tuulik and Klindžić for breach of contract. They’ve obtained an injunction in the Business and Property courts of England and Wales, preventing Argo and Dora from working on any new games, Disco-related or otherwise, at Summer Eternal until April 2025.</p>
<p>CoGrammar have told IGN that they offered to free from Tuulik and Klindžić from the contractual restrictions in question. However, CoGrammar also allege that Tuulik and Klindžić declined to sign CoGrammar's release contract, which included clauses that would have confirmed that the pair no longer owned any intellectual property belonging to CoGrammar, and a commitment not to talk about CoGrammar in the press. They also say that they reached out after Tuulik’s departure in an attempt to settle matters before taking the legal route, but were rebuffed.</p>
<p>Tuulik disputes aspects of IGN’s reporting here, <a href="https://x.com/mixedmartialarx/status/18589983230443073932">commenting</a> that he never actually worked as a consultant on Longdue’s game, because Longdue was founded two days after he resigned from CoGrammar. With regard to CoGrammar’s mention of trying to patch things up after Tuulik’s departure, he’s also published what he says is <a href="https://x.com/mixedmartialarx/status/1858998327431594160/photo/2">a list</a> of demands made by Longdue with regard to Summer Eternal. These require Summer Eternal to give Riaz Moola a C suite advisory role at Summer Eternal and the right of first refusal on investment offers of up to £150,000, as and when Summer Eternal’s working stucture is established.</p>
<p>There’s also a broad demand not to compete with Longdue’s game for attention or funding until early-mid 2025, in return for Longdue helping to market Summer Eternal’s game thereafter. Tuulik further <a href="https://x.com/mixedmartialarx/status/1858998337502138829">alleges</a> that Moola and CoGrammar do not currently employ anyone who actually worked on Disco Elysium, and that the thinking behind the injunction was simply “to silence me with legal threats and then use my name to promote his project”.</p>
<p>Tuulik is also the subject of a legal complaint from ZA/UM’s lawyers, as detailed in a letter dated 10th October. It isn’t notice of a lawsuit, but it alleges breach of contract, breach of confidentiality, and copyright infringement.</p>
<p>What is the specific subject of this complaint? Well, IGN cite several sources at Longdue, CoGrammar and Dark Math who claim that Tuulik has been showing off a 20 minute playable build for a cancelled Disco Elysium sequel, codenamed X7. Speaking to IGN, Tuulik denied the accusation, calling it "absurd." Tuulik has also accused ZA/UM and Moola of teaming up to bombard him with “baseless” legal threats. CoGrammar have denied these accusations, stating that their legal proceedings against Tuulik have nothing to do with ZA/UM.</p><p>It's a lot to digest - and all this is without mentioning the <em>fourth</em> Disco Elysium successor studio, Red Info, founded by Disco Elysium’s lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov, both fired from ZA/UM in 2022 for alleged misconduct. Kurvitz and Rostov are reportedly making a game with the backing of Chinese internet company NetEase. They’ve yet to say anything publicly about the other three studios, and for the sake of my sanity, I hope they never do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft has apologised to users who were facing login issues during the Flight Simulators 2024 launch.</p>



<p>Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator, Jorg Neumann apologised during the Developer Launch Day Update video uploaded to their official YouTube channel.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, the excitement, we knew the excitement was high for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, but frankly, we completely underestimated how was high and it has really overwhelmed our infrastructure,” he said. </p>



<p>He later continued, “Again, while it was a great launch day, we know a lot of people are frustrated, we are really sorry, we want to apologise, this video, we made it to be as transparent and as honest as possible.”</p>



<p>Asobo’s Sebastian Wloch&nbsp;went into more detail on the issues, citing that the team had tested up to 200,000 concurrent players, but that launch day exceeded that player count. </p>



<p>“We are doing our best and going as fast as we can to make sure everybody can go in,” he said. Even players who do make it into the game may find that some content, such as specific planes, is missing and this is connected to the same server issues, Wloch continued.</p>



<p>You can watch the full explanation of the launch day issues on the official YouTube channel below.</p>

Those player numbers were boosted, of course, by Starfield’s day one launch into Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're thrilled that so many of you have embarked on this journey with us, and we appreciate your feedback,” <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/mqjRpu4DgOPKOdHE20SC1/starfields-november-update-is-now-live" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bethesda said in a post on its website</a>. “We are always looking for ways to improve your experience playing the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Bethesda has released a new update that makes a number of important changes and additions. Creations by Verified Creators now have the option to be achievement friendly, there are two new free creations (a vehicle and a quest), and there are new quality-of-life improvements, such as an uncapped framerate option for Xbox Series X. However, Achievements will not retroactively unlock on previous game saves with Creations, even if those Creations are now achievement friendly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 1.14.74 adds the newest land vehicle, the Deimog, as a “special gift” to all players for hitting the 15 million landmark, Bethesda said. Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Built for speed and endurance, the Deimog features a fully enclosed cabin to keep you protected as you race through rugged landscapes. Its exceptional handling allows you to navigate even the trickiest terrain with ease, while a powerful rocket launcher ensures you’re prepared for any threats — be it hostile wildlife or clusters of enemies.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">And the new quest is called The Perfect Recipe, made available to players for free “in the spirit of Thanksgiving.”</p><blockquote>The Perfect Recipe invites you on a heartwarming journey through Akila City, where the past and present collide in the hands of an unlikely dreamer. This character-driven questline introduces you to Harbhajan, a gifted mechanic with a hidden passion for the culinary arts. When you stumble upon a dusty recipe book during your travels, you learn it belongs to Harbhajan — a once-hopeful chef whose ambitions were set aside for a more practical life. Returning the recipes ignites a spark, rekindling old dreams of becoming a galaxy-renowned chef. But could it be too late for a second chance?</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda released the first Starfield expansion, Shattered Space, at the end of September. It was billed as a return to form for the studio, but Shattered Space is currently on a 'mostly negative' user review rating in Steam. According to Xbox boss Phil Spencer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-wondered-if-starfield-should-have-delayed-buggies-for-shattered-space">Bethesda development chief Todd Howard wondered whether Starfield should have delayed buggies for Shattered Space</a> so it had a bigger impact.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Starfield Update 1.14.74 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>General</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>General performance and stability improvements.</li><li>The uncapped frame rate option is available again for Xbox Series X users.</li><li>The Message of the Day now displays more consistently on the Xbox.</li><li>Addressed an issue where some console commands did not disable certain achievements.</li><li>Shattered Space will now show ownership correctly for Steam users.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Features</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Creation Kit: Lipsync animation data generation is now available.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Annihilator Particle Beam damage-over-time effect no longer triggers companion reactions.</li><li>Resolved a Leadership skill issue that could cause companions to not speak up.</li><li>Improved function of the stealth bar while around crowd NPCs.</li><li>Addressed an issue where destroyed ships could load in without collision.</li><li>Addressed an issue where loading a save the relied on missing content could place the player in an undesirable location.</li><li>Trackers Alliance - Roach will now accurately track the number of completed bounties.</li><li>Trackers Alliance - Bounty targets will now appear in Akila, Gagarin, and Cydonia.</li><li>Trackers Alliance - Fixed an issue where the player could receive additional credits by extorting the target and then killing them.</li><li>Trackers Alliance - Bounty targets should now have a larger variety of appearances.</li><li>Trackers Alliance - Bounty targets will now be removed after being dealt with and leaving the area.</li><li>Trackers Alliance - Extorting or bribing a bounty target is no longer a guaranteed success.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Quests</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Starjacker - The correct quest objective will display when the player boards the Junker Watchdog.</li><li>Legacy of the Fang - Addressed an issue that could cause the key to no longer open the door if the player had left the area.</li><li>The Duel - If the player attacks Danika and gets arrested, they are now able to speak to her afterwards to complete the quest.</li><li>The Scaled Citadel - Anasko’s ID Key is now flagged as a quest item.</li><li>What Remains - Addressed an issue where having certain creations installed could make the hatch on The Oracle non-interactable.</li><li>What Remains - The Engineering Bay Access Card is now flagged as a quest item.</li><li>A House Divided - The doors in the Radiology center will stay unlocked during this quest if the player exits the area and returns.</li><li>A House Divided - The player can now obtain the keycard from Madri after the quest is completed.</li><li>Zealous Overreach - Fixed an issue that could occur if the Va’ruun Zealots at the exterior of Shadow Station Epsilon were killed before receiving the quest.</li><li>Zealous Overreach - Addressed an issue that could prevent the player from speaking to Razma or Viktor if the quest “Conflict in Conviction” is started at the same time.</li><li>Zealous Overreach - Vortex Phantoms will no longer spawn close enough to interrupt the negotiation scene.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>Striking Distance Studios was set up by Dead Space alum Glen Schofield. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-review-a-dead-space-alike-built-on-simpler-pleasures">Eurogamer's Callisto Protocol review</a>, our Vikki acknowledged that while "Dead Space comparisons are impossible to avoid", she felt it made up for some of the missing tension "with production value and bloody-minded fun".</p><p>Despite this, however, The Callisto Protocol reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">failed to hit sales targets</a>, which caused publisher Krafton's share prices to fall. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-developer-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-32-employees">Striking Distance subsequently laid off 32 employees</a> in August last year - a month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">Schofield left the studio</a> "to pursue new opportunities". More recently, Schofield said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-publisher-krafton-insisted-on-releasing-it-too-soon-says-director-glen-schofield">Krafton forced Striking Distance to release the game early</a>.</p>

<p>The statement follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">yesterday's report Sony is looking to acquire Kadokawa</a>, which would include Dark Souls and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> studio FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Sony already owns the rights to Bloodborne and Demon's Souls, both of which were PlayStation exclusives.</p>
<p>The news has certainly interested Bloodborne fans hoping for some form of re-release, should Sony be in complete control.</p>
<p>It's not just Souls games, though. Kadokawa also owns <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> developer Acquire, Pokémon Mystery Dungeon and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a> developer Spike Chunsoft, and RPG Maker developer Gotcha Gotcha Games.</p>
<p>Further, Kadokawa is a big name in anime, which would support Sony's growth in the area after acquiring Crunchyroll.</p>
<p>Earlier this year FromSoftware boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">Hidetaka Miyazaki discussed the interest in a Bloodborne remake</a> with Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"Put simply, it makes me very happy to see it's a title with a lot of specific memories, both for me and the staff who worked on it," he said. "And when we see those passionate voices in the community, of course it makes us feel thrilled, it makes us feel very fortunate to have that and to have those memories."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Kadokawa Corporation, the owner of FromSoftware, among other game development studios, confirmed the rumors that started circulating <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday</a> regarding Sony's interest in purchasing the company.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/gematsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, Kadokawa released a new statement today confirming reports that Sony has expressed the intent to acquire the company, but a decision has yet to be made. If there's any update, the statement concludes, an announcement will be made in a timely and appropriate manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">*Update* Kadokawa Corporation has published a statement confirming reports that Sony Group Corporation has expressed the intent to acquire Kadokawa Corporation, but a decision has not yet been made. <a href="https://t.co/8ljzVfJl9Z">https://t.co/8ljzVfJl9Z</a> <a href="https://t.co/LPgn4wFCmN">https://t.co/LPgn4wFCmN</a> <a href="https://t.co/pA1nlN1axx">pic.twitter.com/pA1nlN1axx</a></p>
<p>— Gematsu (@gematsu) <a href="https://twitter.com/gematsu/status/1859192371595849753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>FromSoftware owner Kadokawa Corporation is among the oldest Japanese companies still active today. Founded back in 1945, the company has become, over the years, a media conglomerate that operates not only in the video games industry but also publishes manga and anime. Besides owning around 70% of the Dark Souls and Elden Ring developer, Kadokawa also owns Spike Chunsoft and Acquire, which are known for being the developers of the Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi series, which received its latest entry only <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/">last month</a>, and the classic stealth series Tenchu. Acquire has also worked on other successful games in the past few years, such as the two entries in the Octopath series, both developed in collaboration with Square Enix Business Division 11, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-and-luigi-brothership/">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, the latest entry in the Mario &amp; Luigi series released earlier this month.</p>
<p>The latest game released by FromSoftware, which could become a Sony-owned studio if the acquisition of Kadokawa goes through, is the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. You can learn more about it by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-confirms-acquisition-talk/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fromsoftware%E2%80%99s-parent-company-kadokawa-has-confirmed-sony%E2%80%99s-intent-to-acquire-the-company.1040427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-confirms-acquisition-talk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following reports that Sony was in talks to acquire FromSoftware’s parent company Kadokawa, Kadokawa has confirmed that Sony has expressed interest in acquiring the company.</p>



<p>The update comes following mass media reports, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-buy-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originated from Reuters</a>, that talks between the companies were ongoing. </p>



<p>The full statement reads, “There are some articles on the acquisition of KADOKAWA Corporation (hereinafter “the Company”) by Sony Group Inc. However, this information is not announced by the Company. The Company has received an initial letter of intent to acquire the Company’s shares, but no decision has been made at this time. If there are any facts that should be announced in the future, we will make an announcement in a timely and appropriate manner.”</p>



<p>Presently, Kadokawa owns a 70% stake in FromSoftware, and Sony has around a 14% share. Rolling it up, Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa Corporation, but other gaming titans, like Tencent, also own a piece of the company.</p>



<p>It’s unclear at what stage the talks are currently at, so if the desire for the acquisition is successful, it could be a while before any announcement is made.</p>



<p>What do you think of Sony trying to acquire Kadokawa? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Impressive indie puzzler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> will arrive for PlayStation 4 and PS5 next month, on 3rd December.
</p>
<p>
Developed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sayonara-wild-hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> and Year Walk studio Simogo, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes was greeted by positive reviews when it first arrived PC and Nintendo Switch back in May.
</p>
<p>
A non-linear and mostly monochrome puzzle game, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is set in a world of fragmented memories designed to make players question their surroundings. Solving puzzles, of which there are more than 150, gradually offers a greater understanding of what's going on.

<p>
The game looks stunning - which fits its wider philosophical themes that consider the nature of art - though how much you will understand even after completing the game is a matter of debate.
</p>
<p>
"You'll never have it all figured out, and Lorelei's story stays impenetrable even after it's completed," Ashley Bardhan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review">Eurogamer's Lorelei and the Laser Eyes review</a>, nevertheless praising it for "some of the most visually and technologically stunning scenes I've ever witnessed" in a game. 
</p>
<p>
"Simogo weaves together interlocking puzzles, infinite timelines, and supernatural mischief with only minimal clumsiness," she wrote, awarding Lorelei and the Laser Eyes four out of five stars.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elite-dangerous">Elite Dangerous</a> developer Frontier looks to have canned its upcoming F1 Manager 25, following poor sales of the franchise.
</p>
<p>
In September, Frontier said in a <a href="https://frontier-drupal.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/production/frontier-corp/s3fs-public/press-releases/financial/Frontier-FY24-Financial-Results.pdf">financial statement</a> it had held "commercial discussions with an IP partner" that had "resulted in the voluntary termination of a contract for a future game before full development started". 
</p>
<p>
The identity of that game had previously been kept out of the public eye. Now, however, private analysis from investment research firm Zeus Capital has been shared online, identifying the game in question as F1 Manager 2025.
</p>
<p>
As first reported by <a href="https://traxion.gg/f1-manager-2025-cancelled-as-sales-below-expectations/">Traxion</a>, this analysis claims the F1 Manager series is yet to turn a profit, compared to Frontier's other profitable franchises Elite Dangerous, Planet Coaster, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a>.
</p>
<p>
Zeus Capital's analysis is not intended for public dissemination. However, Eurogamer can verify the information is as reported. We've contacted Frontier for comment.

<p>The cancellation of F1 Manager 2025 does not come as a huge surprise following the poor performance of the series to date. The studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frontier-share-price-plummets-following-f1-manager-2022-flop">share price tumbled after the release of F1 Manager 2022</a>, and the company was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frontier-latest-studio-hit-with-layoffs-following-f1-manager-disappointment">hit by a wave of layoffs in October 2023</a> following the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-manager-2023">F1 Manager 2023</a>. This year's F1 Manager 2024 also seems to have not made much of an impression.</p>
<p>A report published in April <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f1-manager-developer-frontier-accused-of-mismanagement-in-wake-of-layoffs">accused Frontier of mismanagement in the wake of the layoffs</a>, and said the company had struggled to handle its expensive, multi-year deal with the F1 brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frontier-making-third-jurassic-world-game-with-two-additional-management-sims-due-over-next-three-years">Frontier's future hopes are pinned on a return to its more traditional management sims</a>, such as the just-released Planet Coaster 2 and the upcoming Jurassic World Evolution 3, which is due next year.  A third unannounced management sim is also in production, due to release during its financial year 2027.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-reportedly-reviving-its-divisive-steam-controller-trackpads-now-different-sizes-and-shapes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Following the debut and eventual discontinuation of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-controller-revealed">original Steam controller</a>, Valve is now said to be working on another iteration, under the codename Ibex.</p>
<p>That's according to knowledgeable Valve source Brad Lynch (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">The Verge</a>). Lynch states the Steam Controller 2, as Valve has reportedly called it, is set for "a mass production goal in their factories" at this very moment in time.</p>
<p>"That's why I know they're in later stages of productisation," Lynch wrote in a post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Lynch did not go into much further detail, but did reply to another user to say the "biggest change will be the shape/size of the trackpads", which will essentially get the controller "into that gamepad-y form".</p>
<p>In addition, the company is also said to be working on a set of wand controllers (codenamed Roy). Again, these wands are said to be aimed at mass production.</p>

<p>Reportedly, these wand type controllers would be for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOEgUmkhzOU">Valve's rumoured "Deckard" VR headset</a>, which will allegedly function as a standalone hybrid VR headset. The company previously debuted its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valves-vr-headset-is-real-heres-our-first-look-at-valve-index">'Index' VR headset back in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>As for the original Steam controller, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-calls-time-on-its-divisive-steam-controller">this chap was discontinued, also in 2019</a>. Eurogamer alums Johnny Chiodini and Chris Bratt went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-hands-on-with-the-steam-controller">hands on with the controller on its release</a>, and you can check out their impressions thanks to a little bit of vintage EG video goodness above.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Final Fantasy XIV – A Realm Reborn has had the unlikeliest journey to success. The original release was widely panned, crucially flawed, and so bad that they needed to sit the hard reset button, and yet here we are, 14 years later, with the game consistently standing as one of the biggest MMO’s in the world. Today, we’re witnessing a new chapter in the game, as Square Enix have announced Final Fantasy XIV Mobile, an all-new version of the game that you can take on the go with you.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV MOBILE – Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n1vk2A--ZbY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Now, if I were a pessimistic man, this would seem perilous territory. Final Fantasy XIV is one of the most addictive and time-consuming games in modern times; the need to go outside has, for many, been the only reason why they’ve not been playing Final Fantasy XIV, so this could be an important moment in human history.</p>
<p>The journey through Eorzea is one that every gamer should experience – the world is beautiful, the character’s compelling and memorable, and the gameplay remains top tier – and if you are yet to jump in, you can play up to <a href="https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/">Level 70 now for free</a>, without any restrictions on your time.&nbsp; Sorry, I may just have damned you.</p>
<p>The mobile version is being developed by Lightspeed Studio, though they’re very keen to point out that it’s under the supervision of Square Enix. You can expect a series of beta tests around the world, before its initial launch in China, though no dates have been given yet for this.</p>

<p>The most recent expansion, Dawntrail, continued the run of incredible success, with Reuben awarding it a stunning 10/10 and saying, “Dawntrail’s shift in narrative focus injects a vibrancy into Final Fantasy XIV with this more lighthearted romp, while still keeping track of a greater story. With an increase in challenge of the instances, a couple of excellent new Jobs, an introduction of new characters, and the development of existing ones, Dawntrail clearly shows there’s life after averting the end of the world and I – for one – wouldn’t change a damn thing.”</p>
<p>I’d be excited. Very excited.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/luma-island-review-indiana-jones-meets-stardew-valley.1040355/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/luma-island-indiana-jones-meets-stardew-valley<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d2a677d2-7696-414f-a338-b9b6f0d36f5b" href="https://techraptor.net/games/luma-island" rel="nofollow"><em>Luma Island</em></a>&nbsp;is an RPG simulation adventure game from Feel Free Games. It has multiple professions or side quests you can choose to follow, a town that needs repairing after a natural disaster, and an ancient prophecy that's starting to become reality. There are elements of adventure games, exploration, puzzles, creature collection, and life simulators woven throughout the title.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With all there is to do you can easily get 30-40 hours of playtime in. Even when you complete the main quest you load into the game and can continue with any professions you haven't mastered or relax with your animals. You can hop into your friend's game to help them with a puzzle or have them visit for a farm tour. There's plenty of value in the different things you can do in <em>Luma Island</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luma-island-town.jpg?itok=-M8_mxpy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luma-island-town.jpg?itok=DZ615dCV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A Different Story</h2>

<p>One of the main highlights of&nbsp;<em>Luma Island</em>&nbsp;is the story. Unlike the majority of cozy farming simulation games available, you don't come from a hectic job to revive a farm and small town. Your background isn't clarified, all you do know is you bought a used caravan and moved to the island. Instead, the focus of the story is on an ancient prophecy and the mysterious happenings of the island itself. The characters are humorous, often giving you important information sandwiched in between jokes. The prophecy itself isn't even taken seriously in the beginning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You go through trapped temples to obtain prized artifacts. Traps include dodging flaming projectiles, falling rocks, and rolling saws. Then there are puzzles, like rotating flamethrower statues to create a pathway. On top of that, there are ghosts and bats that live in the ruins. It really feels like you're an intrepid archaeologist searching for hidden treasure.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luma-island-ancient-farm-temple.jpg?itok=ZrGPAtJ9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luma-island-ancient-farm-temple.jpg?itok=Bra_tXwq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you try to play through the whole story without taking time to explore the regions, advance in your profession, or just relax, you may find yourself getting burnt out. The Forest, Mountain, and Jungle regions require you to go through three ruins in each, with traps and puzzles increasing in frequency and complexity. I found myself burnt out on puzzles, and overstimulated by all the flying, falling, and rotating contraptions by the time I was in the jungle. Puzzle lovers, however, will find themselves with at least 25 hours of content to play through.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The downfall of the story is the ending. Not the ending itself, but you have to make a decision and there's no manual save. If you want to see both endings, you have to do two separate playthroughs. Once the ending cinematic plays the game is saved and you'll load in after your decision is in effect. I found this a bit off-putting as I wanted to experience both conclusions. For those with the time, however, this shouldn't have too much of an impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luma-island-farm-color-sound-puzzle.jpg?itok=h31Fya1b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luma-island-farm-color-sound-puzzle.jpg?itok=lzWIxiVX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Animals of&nbsp;<em>Luma Island</em></h2>

<p>If you're interested in <em>Luma Island</em> for the creature collecting part of it, sorry to say, but that's the least satisfying element in the game. There are many different Lumas, each hatching from their own adorable egg. You feed them, pet them, and can take one with you as you explore the different regions and towns. They can find hidden treasure and their energy is used in the different professions when crafting. That's all you do with them, however. They don't do anything on the farm, don't react to other creatures, and don't give additional perks in situations they might be helpful in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A rabbit-type Luma could help with the weeds similar to actual rabbits, or a horse type could be ridden to shorten the time spent traveling to collect resources. Even the farm animals have more impact than these special creatures. While the Lumas are cute and have their own little quirks, they do the same task that a cat or dog can do.</p>

<p>Depending on the profession you pick, like Treasure Hunter, you'll even get a pet for free. Lumas' purpose in the main story doesn't even come into play until the very end, leaving a lot of possibilities for the creatures on the table.&nbsp;It feels like Lumas were included for the story and given little thought to their utilization in other areas of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luma-island-animals-luma-garden.jpg?itok=WchDwzXN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luma-island-animals-luma-garden.jpg?itok=mov7hmSM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Speaking of farm animals, how&nbsp;<em>Luma Island</em>&nbsp;does gardening and farming is refreshing. You can start to grow plants but find they have weeds. Instead of spending time picking the weeds every day, rabbits will take care of the problem. Chickens will clear bug infestations, but a fox will try to get into the hen house. Goats chase away the foxes and pigs can dig up Ginger for cooking. That's on top of their "normal" farm purpose of providing milk, eggs, and fertilizer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would've enjoyed&nbsp;<em>Luma Island</em>&nbsp;more if the main story ruins and professions were more seamlessly blended. They could almost be two separate games, of which I would enjoy the profession title more than the puzzler. It's also easy to not progress through the main story unless you're working on the archaeologist profession, which needs items found in the ruins. If the two sides of&nbsp;<em>Luma Island</em>&nbsp;were more cohesive, the experience for both would be better.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luma-island-map-quest-log.jpg?itok=8WMnQxu- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luma-island-map-quest-log.jpg?itok=NbXvEZwO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thankfully, the actual implementation of the game and playing it is a rewarding experience. After 34 hours I had only experienced two bugs. The first was a vase that wouldn't smash and the second, which occurred in hour 33 of gameplay, was glitching into a statue and being unable to move. Using the unstuck button in the game menu sent me home, so the overall impact was quite low.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Luma Island</em>&nbsp;is a well-executed simulation game with a variety of side quests, crafting, and regions to explore, but a few too many of the same puzzles and a lack of creativity when it comes to the Lumas.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Workers at Reflector Entertainment, the Montreal studio that recently released third-person action adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unknown-9">Unknown 9: Awakening</a>, have been hit by layoffs, according to a number of employees who made the cuts public on social media. The studio is owned by Bandai Namco and released the game about a month ago. The exact number of people out of work isn't known, as Reflector haven't made a public statement about it. (<strong>Update: </strong>A <a href="https://reflectorentertainment.com/en/news/message-to-the-reflector-community">statement from Reflector</a> says the layoffs amount to 18% of the total workforce). Among those affected are folks working in art, design, UI, lighting, and narrative. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The layoffs were spotted by Kotaku reporter Ethan Gach, who pointed it out <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lbdcdushd22s">on Bluesky</a>. Sure enough, a glance at LinkedIn shows several game workers announcing they are looking for new jobs. Among those I've seen are a 3D modeller, character artist, UI programmer, community manager, lighting expert, game designer, narrative designer, and a senior environment artist. That range of roles suggests the layoffs are widespread, affecting all departments. </p>
<p>Unknown 9 is set in an alternate history earth, in which you play a "Quaestor" with special abilities, travelling the globe to fight a shadowy secret society. Bandai Namco liked the look of it enough to buy the studio in 2020, and there was enough invested in the world to produce two novels, a scripted podcast, and a comic book. It's unclear from these layoffs whether the fictional world itself is also being retired or if Bandai Namco intend to keep it going. Reflector management claim that the layoffs are unrelated to the game's performance, nor are they the result of publisher pressure.</p><p>

"Today’s announcement isn’t driven by commercial success or external pressures, but stems instead from our current reality, which is that at this time, we cannot guarantee tangible work for all of the talented individuals we employ," said General Manager Marc-André Séguin in <a href="https://reflectorentertainment.com/en/news/message-to-the-reflector-community">the company statement</a>.

</p><p>For the real people affected, however, it may simply feel like more brutal cost-cutting. Bandai Namco have recently been <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bandai-namco-is-reportedly-cutting-workforce-following-cancellation-of-several-titles">axing jobs</a> in their Japanese studios (via a very unpleasant method if <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/bandai-namco-begins-to-cut-headcount-after-culling-game-titles?">reports by Bloomberg</a> are accurate). Early this year they also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-publishers-bandai-namco-cancel-at-least-five-games-target-future-emphasis-on-quality">cancelled several games</a> due to "higher than expected" development costs. </p>
<p>As for Unknown 9 itself, the game seems to have sold quite poorly, and currently has an average "mixed" rating on Steam. It was arguably under-marketed for a game of its production values. We saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unknown-9-awakening-is-a-brand-new-game-that-already-has-a-big-weird-expanded-universe">a 90-second teaser trailer</a> in 2020, then heard no more about the game itself until earlier this year, when it reappeared to show off a mix of Tomb Raider adventuring, Assassin's Creed conspiracy theories, and Star Wars force powers. 

</p><p>Former RPS editor Katharine Castle continues to earn her reputation as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-it-with-all-the-bland-new-multiplayer-shooters-that-will-die-in-six-months">a hellish prophet</a>, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-years-of-silence-unknown-9-awakening-re-emerges-as-a-supernatural-mash-up-of-assassins-creed-with-star-wars-force-powers">playing a preview</a> of the game earlier this year and speaking to the studio's head of production Jean-Francois Deschamps. During which she suspected the game's final months of creation would be a challenge.</p>
<blockquote>Ultimately, it's a challenge that's "really exciting" to try and meet as a studio, [Deschamps] tells us, though given everything that's happened to the industry over the last 12 months, with studios big and small having to down-size or outright shut up shop after failing to make back their development costs, I do worry how long that excitement will last when Unknown 9 launches later this summer.</blockquote>
<p>If any of this sounds familiar, it's probably because something similar happened recently with multiplayer shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>. After a financially disastrous launch, the studio behind the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">unceremoniously shut down</a> by parent company Sony earlier this month. Once again, it is the workers who are most impacted when big companies get over-excited.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/the-playstation-portal-is-finally-getting-ps-plus-cloud-streaming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-portal">PlayStation Portal</a> will finally get support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> game streaming, fixing one of the most glaring omissions from the remote play device’s feature set.</p>
<p>PS Plus game streaming on PS Portal has now been added in a new system software update, and is available to PS Plus Premium members, allowing a selection of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> games to be streamed directly from the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog.</p>


<p>Once you’ve updated, you need to opt in. You do this via:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open “Quick Menu” and access “Settings” on your PS Portal.</li>
<li>Select the “Cloud Streaming (Beta)” button</li>
<li>Switch the Cloud Streaming (Beta) toggle on (this will be off by default).</li>
</ol>
<p>The features available for the cloud gaming beta are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stream select PS5 games in the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog
<ul>
<li>Over 120 PS5 games from the PS Plus Game Catalog, including Dave the Diver, Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Monster Hunter Rise, and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, will be accessible on PS Portal via cloud streaming*</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Streaming up to 1080p/60fps**</li>
<li>DualSense wireless controller features, including haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, speakers, touchpad (emulated on the touch screen for PS Portal), and motion sensor***</li>
<li>PlayStation Plus Cloud storage
<ul>
<li>Save data and game progress can be stored up to 100GB and will be automatically synced with your PS5 console, making it easy to switch seamlessly between local and streaming gameplay, and between multiple devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is initially being labelled as a beta, and does have some minor compromises and feature limitations, when compared to the regular remote play experience from a home PS5 console and PS Plus in general. The biggest limitation is that you can only play PS5 games, with PS4 and PS3 game streams quite bizarrely locked off from the PS Portal. You also can’t use Game Trials, you also cannot stream games purchased from the PS Store, and you can’t use system features like party chat, the Create button, 3D audio or in-game purchases.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the system update does also fix one of the more aggravating aspects of the PS Portal, that it was just so damn loud on its quietest setting! The update patch notes also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaker audio output adjustment to make the volume lower when the audio level is set to minimum</li>
<li>You will now be able to adjust settings of your PlayStation Link device from the PS Portal Settings menu, allowing you to optimize the volume and sidetone volume.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly there’s still no support for generic Bluetooth headphones. It’s either Sony’s locked in PlayStation Link headphones and earbuds, or you’d better have a wired headset handy.</p>
<p>Nobody knows why it took Sony quite so long to figure out that the PS Portal should be a PS Plus streaming device – literally everybody could see this is what it should be able to do – but it’s great to see them finally get around to adding the feature.</p>
<p>We’ll just have to see how well it performs in that role, considering that the streaming experience from a PS5 console to Portal isn’t always the best.</p>

			<p>Square Enix and Tencent's LightSpeed have finally announced the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-reportedly-in-development-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> Final Fantasy XIV Mobile. LightSpeed is developing the game with the supervision of FFXIV Director and Producer Naoki Yoshida, who stated:</p>
<p><em>It has been 11 years since Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn launched, and this new mobile game will be a sister to Final Fantasy XIV, aiming to recreate the grandeur of the original’s story and combat mechanics on mobile devices. Non-combat features, such as Disciples of the Land and Hand, will also be faithfully implemented and we look forward to growing alongside the passionate Final Fantasy XIV community.</em></p>
<p>The official website of this new version of the game includes a detailed overview of its features.</p>
<p><em><strong>Relive the Grand Tale, Confront the Primals</strong></em></p>
<p><em>In Final Fantasy XIV Mobile, you are beckoned by the Mothercrystal, carrying the light of hope to the world of Hydaelyn. Heed the Mothercrystal’s call, embrace your destiny as an adventurer, and confront the primals to deliver Eorzea from certain destruction. An epic story and endless challenges await, with every heart-wrenching moment creating unforgettable memories within this vast realm.</em></p>
<p><em>Test your skills in battle with controls optimized for mobile devices, enabling you to experience dynamic and intense combat from the palm of your hand. Immerse yourself in stunning visuals and audio as skills and boss effects dazzle, culminating in a glorious finale with a limit break!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Choose From a Myriad of Playable Races and Switch Jobs with a Single Tap</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile offers a variety of playable races, each with its own distinct appearance and background. Nine jobs will be available at launch, and the Armoury system allows you to switch jobs freely. The freedom to change roles on the fly brings endless possibilities to your adventures.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Fishing, Triple Triad, and Chocobo Racing: Take a Respite from Adventuring</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Intense and thrilling battles are just one part of your journey. In your spare time, you can wander over to the Gold Saucer for some chocobo racing and the Triple Triad card game. Customize your own cozy home, take part in various festive seasonal events, or express yourself with an array of outfits and glamours for your Warrior of Light. The first release of the mobile game introduces 11 crafting and gathering classes, allowing you to experience a different pace of Eorzea; cast your line as a master fisher, become an adept miner, alchemist, and more.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Play Together or on Your Own. Enjoy a Relaxed Social Community</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile inherits the relaxed and welcoming community aspects of the original game, allowing you to enjoy social interactions the way you want. You can experience the game in your own way, whether solo or alongside other players. Beginners and mentors, party members, and even adventurers you meet by chance can become your friends. Explore the unknown, share moments of joy, and make Eorzea a better place through the bonds of friendship.</em></p>

<p>The game will begin playtesting shortly in China, and the developers hope to launch it globally soon after. You can stay up to date on the official <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>.</p>
<p>The visuals of Final Fantasy XIV Mobile certainly look very faithful to the highly popular PC and console MMORPG, which has now surpassed 30 million registered players (the figure includes free trial accounts) and was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-releases-patch-7-1-crossroads-for-final-fantasy-xiv-will-follow-up-with-more-updates-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> with patch 7.1.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 1pm UK: </strong> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Mobile will be free-to-play and won't include gacha mechanics.</p>
<p>This news was confirmed by Japanese publication <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23633">Famitsu</a> in an extensive article. How exactly the game will be monetised remains unclear, though presumably it will be through costumes and mounts in the game's online store.</p>
<p>This differs from other <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> mobile games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis">Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-final-fantasy-mobile-game-ends-global-service-this-time-the-one-with-ariana-grande">recently ended Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius</a> that heavily include gacha mechanics.</p>
<p>Further, the game will have controls optimised for mobile devices, likely including a virtual joystick.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 8am UK:</strong> A mobile version of Final Fantasy 14 has officially been revealed.</p>
<p>The in-development game was announced by Final Fantasy 14 director and producer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-owned Lightspeed Studio behind development. The studio previously developed PUBG Mobile.</p>
<p>"This is our latest MMORPG title specifically tailored for the mobile platform," said Yoshida in a video announcing the project. "Despite these adjustments Lightspeed Studios is working with tremendous enthusiasm and dedication to faithfully recreate the story, duties, battle content and other aspects of the original game."</p>

<p>He continued: "I hope both current FF14 players and those who are interested in exploring its story will look forward to what's coming next."</p>
<p>The video provides a first look at gameplay, which shows a fully-realised version of Eorzea from the cities of Ul'dah and Limsa Lominsa, to the Gold Saucer and even a battle against the Primal Titan.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">FINAL FANTASY XIV MOBILE is revealed! <br>Licensed by SQUARE ENIX and developed by Lightspeed Studios <a href="https://twitter.com/__lightspeed___?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@__lightspeed___</a> ,this game brings the vibrant world of Eorzea to your mobile devices.<br>In this reveal trailer, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FFXIV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FFXIV</a> Producer &amp; Director Naoki Yoshida shares an exciting message,… <a href="https://t.co/2yaS42zIjO">pic.twitter.com/2yaS42zIjO</a></p>— FFXIV_MOBILE (@FFXIV_MOBILE_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FFXIV_MOBILE_EN/status/1859054054086693332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As noted on the <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/">game's website</a>, nine jobs will be available at launch out of the full game's 22 battle jobs. While these aren't listed, imagery suggests the likes of Black Mage, Warrior, Dragoon, Bard, and White Mage will all be playable.</p>
<p>What's more, all 11 crafting and gathering jobs will be included, as well as side activities like Triple Triad, chocobo racing, and home customisation.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 14 has already received over 30 million registered players and has proven a huge success for Square Enix. It's no wonder a mobile version is in development to boost that further.</p>
<p>This mobile version, along with the Tencent collaboration, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-reportedly-coming-to-mobile">rumoured back in July this year</a>. A month later, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-game-is-approved-in-china">approved in China</a>.</p>
<p>While a release date is unknown, a demo through multiple play tests will soon be available in China, with a global launch planned afterwards. Fans can pre-register now.</p>
<p>The expansion to mobile is part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's "aggressive" push to multiplatform releases</a> to "diversify earnings opportunities".</p>
<p>For current players of Final Fantasy 14, the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9b42b2425f3a680caea3281ccd65c99677cb00e2/">latest Patch 7.1</a> was released earlier this month, bringing the Final Fantasy 11 themed raid series as well as new story content.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
