            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>studio Ubisoft is reportedly considering creating a new gaming-focused business entity that will include some of its core IP, including the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Per a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which is behind a paywall), Ubisoft has contacted some of its shareholders, including Tencent, to see if they have any interest in purchasing a minority stake in the new venture.</p>

<p>Bloomberg, which cites "people familiar with the situation", says that no final decision has been made as yet and that considerations are still ongoing. If this report is true, though, it's probably part of Ubisoft and its shareholders' ongoing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">exploration of options</a> regarding what has been a pretty rough time for the studio recently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-new-gaming-entity.jpg?itok=GVElqXqh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-new-gaming-entity.jpg?itok=in6gTTpI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is reportedly considering creating a new entity for its core gaming IP.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in September, Ubisoft announced it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delaying upcoming flagship RPG&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a>, and as part of the same report in which the delay was revealed, the company also acknowledged that open-world game&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>had underperformed.</p>

<p>Following that announcement, an activist Ubisoft shareholder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">called for "strategic and structural change"</a> at the company, and Ubisoft's woes continued to mount with employee strikes, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy" rel="nofollow">data policy lawsuit</a>, and, uh, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game" rel="nofollow">weird NFT game launch</a>.</p>

<p>As part of its fiscal report for the first half of last year, Ubisoft revealed it was effectively <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">hemorrhaging money</a>, and the studio would go on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">shut down FPS&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>and close down <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three of its locations</a> in an effort to cut costs.</p>

<p>Whether or not the new venture would solve any of these problems remains to be seen, but it seems like an attempt to spin off the more successful elements of the business in order to drum up interest and value.</p>




<p>As for what effect the new entity would have on Ubisoft's strategy with regards to its games, that remains to be seen. After all, let's not forget Ubisoft hasn't officially confirmed this move, nor has it been finalized according to Bloomberg's sources. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/saber-ccos-comments-suggest-kotor-remake-is-still-coming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Saber CCO’s recent statement hints that Star Wars KOTOR Remake is still in development.</p>



<p>Tim Willits, Saber Interactive’s Chief Creative Officer, recently shared some information on the games they are working on. Willits stated on <a href="https://x.com/TimWillits/status/1900374508113961250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> that the studio is currently working on several games across different genres; however, all the games Saber has spoken about are “still in development.” This statement has led many to speculate that the KOTOR remake is still in development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details about the KOTOR remake have been scarce since the game was confirmed in 2021. Since then, Embracer Group has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kotor-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken about</a> all the games in development “as of May 24, 2023.” The list included the likes of Tomb Raider (final title TBC), Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine II, Remnant 2, Ride 5, and Star Wars: KOTOR remake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have not received concrete details about the Star Wars: KOTOR remake or an official confirmation from developers. The original KOTOR was released in 2003, and players had to become the last hope of the Jedi Order and master the power of the Force to save the Republic. The game has a unique Star Wars RPG experience with unique characters, creatures, vehicles, and planets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KOTOR encourages players to learn to use the Force and wield 40 different powers while building their lightsaber. Players get to explore some of the most popular regions in the franchise, including Tatooine and the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk. Several customisable characters can be added to your party, and there are eight enormous worlds in the player’s starship, Ebon Hawk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Star Wars Eclipse developer is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-eclipse-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unaffected by Netease’s restructuring</a>. Also,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-star-wars-collab-heresy-act-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Destiny 2 recently</a> received Star Wars skins. What are your thoughts on Saber Interactive’s CCO suggesting that a KOTOR remake is still coming?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, March 14, 2025. Below, we take a look at how the unusual platformer had a spark unlike anything else in the series.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When fans think of the Donkey Kong series' platforming games, it's easy to consider the timeline as one that began with Rare and its groundbreaking CG graphics in the SNES era before the baton was eventually picked up by Retro Studios with Donkey Kong Country Returns. In Nintendo's history of wacky and inventive ways to play games, there is perhaps nothing quite as bizarre as Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, released in North America in 2005 for GameCube, which gave the iconic ape a stopgap to remember in between the Rare and Retro eras.</p><p dir="ltr">The credit can't all go to the Kyoto company though, quite literally so because this was in fact the debut of its newly established EAD (Entertainment, Analysis and Development) Tokyo studio designed to attract new talent from Japan's capital. Even the technology that's front-and-center in Donkey Kong Jungle Beat wasn't created by Nintendo but rather Namco in its 2003 music spin-off Donkey Konga.</p><p dir="ltr">The DK Bongos felt like a natural extension of drumming in its popular Taiko no Tatsujin series. While a microphone also detects hand claps, it otherwise follows rhythm game conventions of tapping the drums of clapping in time to notes on screen.</p><p dir="ltr">Call it another example of lateral thinking, but the strange minds at EAD Tokyo, led by Super Mario Sunshine co-director Yoshiaki Koizumi, somehow came up with an unconventional way of using this controller, all while taking Donkey Kong back to his side-scrolling fundamentals.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather divisively, Jungle Beat eschews many of the staples from the Donkey Kong Country series--no rolling jumps, no collectible jigsaw pieces or KONG letters, not even Diddy Kong--in favor of a simple story where DK goes through different kingdoms battling evil kings from across the animal kingdom in a bid to come out as the top banana.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6dw0F8_zz8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S6dw0F8_zz8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The stripped-back approach was in service of the simpler controls. Beating the left or right drum individually makes DK move in that corresponding direction--rapidly to make him move faster, while beating both together makes him jump. Meanwhile, clapping your hands sends out a shockwave that stuns enemies caught in the radius, collects nearby bananas, and interacts with objects like vines and catapults. Helpfully, this also mitigates the need for exact precision.</p><p dir="ltr">While the game garnered some criticism over being more simplistic and lacking in the secrets and challenge of the Country series, Jungle Beat is anything but easy. What makes it replayable is its score-attack system. Rather than just getting to the end of a level, it's about earning as many bananas as possible, and the way to get more bananas is by earning more beats. For instance, you could just walk and jump to collect the bananas onscreen, but if you clap, the shockwave collects them all around you instantly, which in turn increases your beat score.</p><p dir="ltr">Defeating enemies and interacting with objects also gains beats, but the real trick is performing all these actions together while airborne, which builds up a combo. The higher the combo, the more beats and bananas you get--one way of gaining more beats is not from bananas but flowers. At the end of each kingdom, your banana total also determines your rank, where you're awarded a crest for bronze, silver and gold, which is important as it's also how you unlock more levels in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather than a world map made of different levels that culminate in a boss fight, each kingdom is made up of two levels and a boss battle, which have to be completed before you're scored. However, you can't collect any more bananas during the boss battles, some which include rival Kongs that take the form of one-on-one brawls where you have to avoid a punch at the right time before bashing the drums for a counter.</p><p dir="ltr">It then ups the stakes, as you try to avoid getting hit, which causes you to lose bananas, which also counts as your health. Having hundreds means the game is incredibly generous when it comes to life, but there's nothing worse than having racked up over 800 bananas (the number required for a gold crest in the first two stages) only to mess up against the boss and drop a rank.</p><p dir="ltr">While this simple control scheme still allows for some interesting maneuvers like backflips and wall jumps, the execution isn't without its flaws. Even if the instruction manual warns that the bongos are highly sensitive, in the heat of playing Jungle Beat, it's all too easy to beat the drums so hard (especially when it feels like a beat hasn't been registered) that the microphone mistakes it for a clap instead, while even a brief session is likely to leave your palms sore from so much clapping. But even though you can technically play with a regular GameCube controller, and some would argue using the C-stick triggers shockwaves with more precision than hand claps, that would also largely rob the game of its unique charm.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking back, Jungle Beat might be more of a curio before Retro picked up the baton years later, while EAD Tokyo arguably went on to far greater feats, its next project being all-time classic Super Mario Galaxy. Yet with its design to make a more approachable game that could appeal to more players with a unique control scheme, you can see that kind of thinking as a precursor to the Wii's philosophy. It did receive a Wii port sans bongos. And while it may not have resulted in a sequel, I can't help but think that it was influential in its own way. I wouldn't be surprised if the streamers who beat Dark Souls with a dance mat or a banana hadn't come across Jungle Beat first.</p><p dir="ltr">With Retro focused on the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4</a>, there's been speculation that Nintendo is once again internally developing a new Donkey Kong game, which would make sense following the opening of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-will-join-universal-studios-japan-in-spring-2024/1100-6519697/" data-ref-id="1100-6519697">Donkey Kong Country area in Universal Studios' Super Nintendo World.</a> Whatever the future holds, I can only hope that it contains ideas even a fraction as bananas as Jungle Beat's.</p>

<p>The news was shared by director and producer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fydpys-4P4w">latest Letter From The Producer stream</a>.</p>
<p>Highlights from the stream include this look at the flamboyant raid boss coming to The Arcadion a week after patch launch:</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-patch-72-due-end-of-march-with-even-more-final-fantasy-9-references">mentioned in the previous Letter From The Producer</a>, the 7.X series will continue with references to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>. However, it's the Occult Crescent field operation that's perhaps most intriguing.</p>
<p>On a separate island, players can explore the field together to fight monsters and bosses, with a different levelling system based around knowledge collecting. The difference between your level and that of enemies will influence damage dealt and taken, and if incapacitated, players will lose experience points when not revived, which could ultimately result in a loss of knowledge level.</p>
<p>Players will also have a secondary support job to boost their abilities, with classes similar to those in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-v">Final Fantasy 5</a>. This field operation looks to provide a fresh twist on the MMO's co-operative gameplay.</p>
<p>Cosmic Exploration, meanwhile, is a new activity for crafters and gatherers, with new moons arriving with each new patch to explore. Players will explore moons, gather resources, and build bases in a communal experience - its story is all about building a spaceship launching base.</p>
<p>Ahead of the livestream, Yoshida was interviewed by Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/36244">Famitsu</a>, where he stated this patch would be the largest to date. That will please fans who have burned out on the game since the release of Dawntrail.</p>
<p>Other smaller changes Yoshida mentioned include being able to use a mount while running and a new jog mechanic once your sprint runs out in cities and safe areas, both of which will aid with the speed of exploration.</p>
<p>Further, Yoshida told Game Watch he was initially skeptical of including so many Final Fantasy 9 references in Dawntrail and these following patches (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-14-yoshi-p-was-initially-unsure-about-referencing-final-fantasy-9-in-dawntrail/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"Regarding FF9 elements, I was rather torn... At first, I thought it might be best to distance ourselves a little from homages to FF9 and was going to go with that approach," he said.</p>
<p>"FF9 is a masterpiece, and everyone has a strong emotional attachment to it, so I wanted to avoid consciously pulling the story too much in that direction. However, I now think that the current flow of the story is appropriate in light of future developments."</p>
<p>Of course, series fans will be aware of rumours of a Final Fantasy 9 remake, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is yet to officially reveal any such project.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Square Enix revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-series-has-now-sold-over-200m-copies-worldwide">Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200m copies worldwide</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft is considering the launch of a fresh business unit, part-owned by outside companies, that could manage its biggest video game brands.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers">new Bloomberg report</a>, which claims that Ubisoft shareholder <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> is being considered for a minority stake in the new venture.
</p>
<p>
The move would likely include lucrative franchises such as Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry. These series would then be owned by this new entity, rather than Ubisoft directly. 
</p>
<p>
This business tactic could see Ubisoft's new entity valued higher than the company itself currently, Bloomberg's report states. At the same time, the Ubisoft mothership would remain owned by its founding Guillemot family - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets-report">something that has reportedly been a sticking point in discussions over Ubisoft's future</a> so far.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">Ubisoft confirmed it was undertaking a strategic review to help right-size the business</a>, following years of falling share prices and a string of disappointing game launches - most notably including big budget new hope <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.
</p>
<p>
The company's next big bet, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, has been delayed twice to ensure it arrives next week in the best possible state.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">Ubisoft has cut jobs repeatedly across the business</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">and closed several studios</a> - including its UK based Leamington team. Overall, the company has cut its total staff from 20,279 people in 2022, to 18,666 in September 2024, before its most recent round of redundancies.
</p>
<p>
"As we mentioned during our Q3 sales, the review of various transformational strategic and capitalistic options is ongoing," a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer this week. 
</p>
<p>
"The Board has established an ad-hoc independent Committee to oversee this formal and competitive process, so as to extract the best value from Ubisoft's assets and franchises for all stakeholders. Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materialises."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s.1134675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami and developer NeoBards Entertainment have officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, the newest entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>series of psychological horror games.</p>

<p>The game was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed" rel="nofollow">revealed back in October 2022</a> as part of a&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission showcase, but at the time, Konami didn't show much more than a short teaser trailer hinting at some of the game's concepts and story elements.</p>

<p>Now, Konami has fully unveiled the game, although we still don't know exactly how it will play since the debut trailer mostly seems to consist of narrative setup and cinematic cutscenes rather than actual moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-f-revealed-hinako.jpg?itok=dEf64WpE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-f-revealed-hinako.jpg?itok=5nv9pSg4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>has officially been revealed by Konami.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will focus on Hinako Shimizu, a young girl who lives in the remote Japanese town of Ebisugaoka. Of course, this being a horror game, Ebisugaoka is "consumed by a sudden fog", turning Hinako's home into a "haunting nightmare". Sounds like&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>alright.</p>

<p>Konami says&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>will have you "solving complex puzzles and confronting grotesque monsters" as you navigate the foggy streets of Ebisugaoka. It also looks like the town will transition between its regular appearance and a classic&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>-style haunted otherworld, which seems to have a strong floral motif this time around.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>right here. It's more of a mood piece than an informative trailer; while you won't find much gameplay, you can see what kind of direction Konami and NeoBards are heading in with the game.</p>




<p><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>will boast writing by visual novel scribe Ryukishi07, who's best known for the&nbsp;<em>When They Cry&nbsp;</em>series. Music will, of course, be handled by longtime series composer Akira Yamaoka.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>news, Konami revealed back in January that the Bloober Team-developed&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">surpassed two million sales</a>. The two studios are currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">working together on another project</a>, although we don't yet know if it's a&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>game or not.</p>

<p><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does launch, it'll be coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-72-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-release-date-revealed.1134672/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-72-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2, which will bring more raids, a new dungeon, and more later this month.</p>

<p>Per the recent Letter from the Producer showcase,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 officially launches on March 25th (which, coincidentally, puts it one day before the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.5</a>, so it's going to be a busy couple of days if you play both).</p>

<p>As <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-march" rel="nofollow">previously revealed</a> by Square Enix,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 will continue the post-<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>narrative and pick up where <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-71-release-date" rel="nofollow">Patch 7.1 left off</a>, and it will also bring new raid encounters, as well as the new Occult Crescent activity, which is set to continue the legacy of&nbsp;<em>Shadowbringers</em>' Bozja or&nbsp;<em>Stormblood</em>'s Eureka.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.2-release-date-raids.jpg?itok=elf4Qwc6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.2-release-date-raids.jpg?itok=BL-nOJpu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s Patch 7.2 launches on March 26th.</figcaption></figure><p>As usual, the new story will bring with it a new dungeon, the Underkeep, for you and your friends (or randoms!) to explore, and you can also expect four more Arcadion raid encounters to test your mettle, as well as a trial to face during the main story.</p>

<p>The real star of the show this time around, however, is the Occult Crescent, a new Field Exploration activity that you can take on alongside many other&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>players. It won't be arriving until Patch 7.25, though.</p>

<p>Patch 7.2 will also bring with it a new Unreal-difficulty Hells' Kier trial, in which you'll be able to take on a significantly more powerful Suzaku. This one's going to take all your skill (probably).</p>

<p>The full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 have not yet been released, but you can likely expect them closer to the update's launch, so you'll need to wait a little bit to see whether they've nerfed Dark Knight. Knowing my luck, probably.</p>




<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 launches on March 26th. The game, and its latest expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>, are available to play right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/39210/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ardenfall">Ardenfall</a> is almost cheeky in how close it is to a classic 'thesda game," Alice Bell wrote of the demo to this open-world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> back in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-this-indie-fantasy-rpg-the-morrowindlike-youve-been-looking-for">Aliceful year of 2023</a>. She also asked me about my own propensity for game discovery in my staff writer interview, to which I replied she knew I was OK at it because she nicked the idea for the Ardenfall article from a comment I left. Good taste, Alice, and good taste, me: Ardenfall is great fun. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154960/Ardenfall/">It's had a demo kicking</a> around since 2022, and now it's set for an early access release this year.

<p>Ardenfall is notable for its lack of marauding 'go here next' fingers. Instead you'll navigate its world through NPC hints and the original signposting itself, signposts. There are factions, conversation stats, quest reactivity, all that good stuff. As for combat, here's reliable old mate Steam with the goods:</p>
<blockquote>"Choose your weapon. Now choose another. If you are stuck, there’s always more options to get you out of a bind - a throwing potion, a single use spell, or a throwing knife of fire may do the trick. A mage specialized in summoning may spawn a great beast to do their bidding, while a thief may toss a potion of silence on their targets to ensure a clean kill".</blockquote>
<p>It's from sixteen-strong Spellcast Studios. That number includes voice actors, and they've been working on the game for seven or so years now. I imagine a good chunk of that time was spent on making every NPC killable, charmable, or stealable-fromable. Time well spent, say I.</p>
<p>*The official RPS term for 'trailer'. Unless Edwin ends up editing this, in which case I have no idea how that got there. <em>["troll-troll", morelike - Ed]</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Square Enix has announced a crystal-shattering sales milestone for the Final Fantasy franchise. Worldwide, the RPG series has now topped 200 million copies sold, with the achievement apparently coinciding with the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series surpassing 5 million units sold.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Final Fantasy account <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> shared the Ifrit-sized accomplishment for the series. The post also thanks players for "wherever you joined us on our adventures." The RPG franchise began in 1987 with the original Final Fantasy, with the most recent mainline addition being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/" data-ref-id="1900-6418081">Final Fantasy XVI</a> in 2023. Last year saw the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, and the remake made its way to PC at the beginning of this year. In fact, the game starring Cloud Strife and crew <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sets-a-new-record-for-the-longtime-series/1100-6529033/">set a Steam concurrent-players record for the series</a>. The PC release has also led to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth becoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1">one of 2025's best-selling games so far</a>. It's an intriguing development after Square Enix noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-says-final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-didnt-meet-sales-expectations/1100-6526552/" data-ref-id="1100-6526552">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI failed to meet sales expectations</a> in September.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series has sold over 5 million copies worldwide, and the Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200 million copies across the globe!<br>Wherever you joined us on our adventures, thank you. <a href="https://t.co/6eoIoDBXh0" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6eoIoDBXh0</a></p>  — FINAL FANTASY (@FinalFantasy) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series--consisting of the first six mainline games in the franchise--originally launched on PC and mobile devices in 2021. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-collection-is-coming-to-consoles-on-april-19/1100-6513014/">Square Enix then brought the Pixel Remaster series to Switch and PS4</a> in April 2023, with an Xbox Series X|S release happening in 2024. Speaking of Microsoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xivs-full-xbox-release-date-confirmed-alongside-free-game-pass-expansions/1100-6521644/">Final Fantasy XIV finally arrived on Xbox Series X|S</a> last year, too.

Meanwhile, Call of Duty is in a whole other stratosphere with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/">the FPS franchise passing 500 million copies sold</a>.

<p>As revealed earlier today, you can expect&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.5 to arrive on March 26th. It'll bring with it lots of new stuff, including the final tribe of Natlan in the Collective of Plenty, as well as two new characters, a new map, and more.</p>

<p>First up, you can explore the new Great Volcano of Tollan map, which promises plenty of secrets if you dare to delve into its magma-filled depths. As you travel to the mountain, you'll meet the Collective of Plenty and take part in their "friendly competitions" of strength.</p>

First up is 5-star Electro Catalyst wielder Varesa, who uses plunging attacks to deal extra damage and give her access to a special Elemental Burst ability.</p>

<p>Your second new fighter in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.5 is 4-star Electro Polearm wielder Iansan, who serves as a support character by buffing and healing her allies.</p>

<p>Varesa and Iansan will both debut in the first half of Version 5.5's cycle, with a rerun coming for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-introduces-new-five-star-anemo-character-xianyun" rel="nofollow">Xianyun</a> during that period as well. In the second half, reruns for Xilonen and Venti will be available.</p>

<p>Other activities include the return of the Bloomflower Trials, which will ask you to save an ill Saurian, as well as a new Treasure Seeker minigame that has you helping baby Saurians to "collect shiny treasures". D'awww.</p>




<p>As usual, HoYoverse also has some codes for you to help you get some free stuff. Here are this week's codes!</p>

Oh well…” Another was similarly disappointed. </p><p>“Oh people melting their 1* cards to get trade token while sitting on 100k shine dust and they lost nothing?” explained another. Not everyone is sympathetic. “If you traded a card in you didn’t have spares of, that’s on you man, idk what to tell you,” wrote a player debating the subject on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1jas52b/shinedust_is_the_new_trade_currency/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1jas52b/shinedust_is_the_new_trade_currency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PTCG</em>P subreddit</a></span>. Players who have been hoarding shinedust since launch, on the other hand, are quite pleased with themselves right now. </p><p>A future update will also let players publicize cards they want to trade for, streamlining the current clumsy process of needing to coordinate trades offline or risk blindly offering up a card with no clue what someone might offer to trade in return. Sounds great! Unfortunately, the timeline for both changes is simply by the end of “autumn 2025.” Huh.</p><p>The <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> is also looking at changing the current restriction on trading cards rarer than one-star, perhaps the thing players have complained about most regarding the game’s trade system. Instead of being able to trade with a friend for the hardest-to-get card, many hardcore fans are limited to trading for cards they already have. </p><p>“We are also looking into how to accommodate cards that are currently unavailable for trades, such as promo cards and two-star rarity cards,” the developers write. “Keep an eye out for more information about this topic in the future.” Given that trade tokens aren’t getting nuked for another six months as it is, I’m not holding out hope for two-star trading anytime soon. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hecz-curse-optic-texas-cdl-woes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new video uploaded by Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez, the President at OpTic Texas (amongst other things), the current ‘curse’ plaguing the Call of Duty League team was discussed at length. The 18-minute video offered a walkthrough of the offices that OpTic Texas plays out of, with HECZ talking to his team about the issues that have led to a 0-15 map record in recent weeks.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that <strong>something </strong>is wrong at OpTic Texas, as just a few months back, the team won the Call of Duty League Championship, the first COD world title for OpTic since 2017.</p>



<p>OpTic is trying anything at this point.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-think-it-s-this-room">‘I Think It’s This Room’</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas’ Dashy and Kenny both suggested in the video that the room they compete out of ‘might be cursed’, with HECZ revealing that he ‘saged’ the room, revealing at the end of the video exactly what that meant. He’d even taken the time to stencil the ‘Green Wall’ mantra on a whiteboard in the room to inspire his players.</p>



<p>Shotzzy took a similar path, suggesting that they need to relocate to the old office that used to house the squad in Dallas, Texas:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I know what it is, bro – I know what it is. We need to go back to the Dallas office.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pred, who recently returned to the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/huke-replacing-pred-in-optic-texas-starting-roster/">after a hiatus</a> lasting a couple of months, agreed with Shotzzy.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video from HECZ:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Enough is Enough" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0uP630Tamw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>HECZ stuck tightly to the theory that this is a curse, suggesting that the organisation has to try ‘supernatural’ solutions to kick out the bad luck that surrounds the team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Let’s talk about this curse. Let’s talk about this curse, because it can’t be anything else. It can’t be skill, they’ve proven to be world champions, they’ve proven to push through adversity – what made this happen?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revisited comments he made previously, wherein he stated that the current roster is the worst Call of Duty team OpTic has ever had:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I know that I jokingly and not jokingly said that this is the worst team we’ve ever had, but it is becoming more and more clear that, as talented as these guys are, there’s something else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>HECZ then walked around the office, demanding to know who had brought the curse upon the organisation. He then went off on a tanget about the talked-about ‘ring ceremony’ from COD Champs 2024, which is yet to take place. He stressed that ‘no matter how bad they’re doing’, the Green Wall and OpTic Texas <strong>deserve </strong>to see the ring ceremony.</p>



<p>What do you think is wrong at OpTic Texas? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Ubisoft is actively looking to bring more investors into the fold for what is described as a “new entity”. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published</a> on Friday, Bloomberg says that the company is “considering selling a minority stake in the venture and has contacted potential bidders.” These bidders include Tencent along with various funds located both in France and around the globe.</p>



<p>“Ubisoft has asked for preliminary bids to be made as soon as this month, the people added, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter,” Bloomberg says.</p>



<p>This new venture would include “some of its core” gaming franchises such as Assassin’s Creed. Tencent refused to comment on the claims while Ubisoft pointed to recent earnings reports where it stated that it was exploring all possible options for the company.</p>



<p>The idea of a “new entity” isn’t completely new. Back in January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was reported</a> that Ubisoft and Tencent had talks of a “new venture” that would allow the Guillemot family to retain control of the company while giving Tencent more control over various assets. At the time, Insider Gaming sources said that there was no firm decision or direction reached with the company continuing to look at every option.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft has continued to come under fire both outside and within the company. A minority shareholder has even called for a protest outside the company’s Paris headquarters after its claim that the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to disclose IP acquisition talks</a> with EA and Microsoft.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/commandos-origins-refreshingly-brings-back-the-stealth-tactics-marriage.1134600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/commandos-origins-refreshingly-brings-back-the-stealth-tactics-marriage<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The classic Commandos series was all about cleverly commanding a squad to pull off some daring operations aimed at crippling the Nazi war machine and putting a real stick in the eye of the empire. But it's also a series that's been in relative dormancy for some time, leaving other games like Shadow Tactics and Desperados to pick up the torch and offer a similar blend of real-time strategy and stealth gameplay that's all about pulling off some slick, decisive strategies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the upcoming Commandos: Origins from developer Claymore Game Studios, the series finally gets its long overdue successor following the 2006 FPS spin-off, marking a return to the original's old-school perspective and brutal difficulty. I recently got to play the opening missions of Commandos: Origins and came away appreciating this revival of an open-ended tactical stealth-action game – even if it took me some time to come to grips with it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a return to the classic gameplay and storytelling of the early PC games in the series, Commandos: Origins appropriately focuses on the founding of the elite squad. As green beret Jack O'Hara, he's recruited by commando Sergeant Hancock with a mission to strike back against the growing Nazi empire. Following a daring escape through a North African allied base overrun by the Axis army, the duo soon expands their crew to engage in a larger campaign to destroy key targets across Europe and even the Arctic regions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Origins taps into the style of pulpy, ensemble action films in the vein of The Guns of Navarone or The Dirty Dozen for its campaign. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Commandos: Origins works has both a modern update to the classic formula of the series, but also as a jumping on point for those who've never played the originals. Much like the previous games, Origins taps into the style of pulpy, ensemble action films in the vein of The Guns of Navarone or The Dirty Dozen for its campaign. The core gameplay is a blend of real-time strategy and a carefully paced tactics game, where you command a small squad to sneak through bases, take out targets, and make it out alive. Instead of moving turns like other tactics games, your squad and all enemies on the field will move and react in real-time, which pushes you to make your moves count – or else face the onslaught of enemies on the field.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to art director Thilo Gebhardt from Claymore Game Studios, he explained how the developer was specifically founded to help revive the Commandos series and how they approached modernizing it for Origins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The original owner of Kalypso Media, Simon Hellwig, who passed away, had the idea to bring back Commandos – he was a big fan of the original games," Gebhardt said. "He had the opportunity to acquire it, and once he decided to make the next game an in-house production, he founded Claymore Studios specifically to revisit the brand. [...] With other competitors in the genre recently they've shown that this type of game can still be updated to a more modern standard because it can be a hardcore experience. But we've also found ways to improve the interface and the pacing, and we hope to have made that experience more modern and less frustrating for new players."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With each mission giving you a list of objectives and a large map to explore, you're tasked with completing them efficiently and carefully. By taking advantage of blindspots in enemy line of sight and patrol patterns and using gadgets from the key members of each squad, you're given plenty of opportunities and a wide berth in how you clear a mission. In some ways, it felt like each stage was a puzzle box to solve – by way of a stealth-action tactics game, and I soon had to get comfortable with hiding guards after I had taken them out of commission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening mission in North Africa served as a solid tutorial in showcasing just how versatile but still specialized the squad members were. For instance, Sergeant Hancock takes on the role of the combat sapper, a combat engineer who can cut through wire barricades and plant powerful explosives to blow up targets. I found a lot to appreciate with how each squad member can coordinate, particularly with pulling off O'Hara's advanced traversal skills and quick stealth attacks to help clear the way for his allies to break the objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The stealth mechanics are impressive and really show a level of depth with the enemy AI and level design – particularly with how guards will remember which allies are in the area and how snowprints are visible in places that shouldn't be. While I mostly crawled through the stages to be on the safe side, I still appreciated the moments when I could get a solid jump on the enemy. One useful option is the command mode, which lets you plan out specific moves for multiple squad members to execute all at once. Following the opening mission, Commandos immediately put me to the test in the following mission, which chucked me into the deep end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, the difficulty here is super challenging. If just one commando dies, it's a loss. I ended up failing – a lot – and that meant reloading saves to try again. Much like early entries, Commandos: Origins sticks with a retro style of progression in each mission – and that means you'll need to embrace the retro concept of manually saving often – as auto-saves are not present in missions. In one instance during the second operation, I reached an important section of the stage but was quickly gunned down by patrolling troops. Because I was so focused on maneuvering my crew, I had forgotten to save and lost close to 10 minutes of progress.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the developers, the classic approach to manual saving was intentional, as it sticks close to the experience of the original games and doesn't seek to give players too many safety nets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We thought a lot about the fans of the original games, and for them, the aspect of how saving works was something you simply shouldn't change, it really comes down to taking away the liberty to decide on your own how you want to save your progress and what risk you want to take," the art director Gebhardt said. "Personally, I will save a lot, and there are some more daring and more experienced players who deliberately do not save. And they approach it like a little bit of a puzzle with a more creative way. So really for Commandos, it's about creative freedom of selecting your own safe points for."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>These repeated mission attempts, in some cases, turned out to be a blessing...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My losses regularly felt crushing, especially considering just how lengthy missions can be. I often felt the need to take a break, but I still rallied and came through. These repeats, in some cases, turned out to be a blessing, as they allowed me to go through the trial-and-error process and pick up new strategies, sometimes allowing me to satisfyingly make the best of a clumsy situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In one mission, I had to destroy a guarded comms tower. I originally took out all guards in the area and then destroyed the tower, but upon a redo of the area, I simply destroyed the tower and watched it crash down on two guards, with me walking away feeling like I was Agent 47 in Hitman. In one satisfying instance, I used my sniper commando to pull off a Saving Private Ryan-style series of quick sniper shots on alerted guards, giving my team some breathing room to rally.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The raw satisfaction that comes from tactics games is seeing a plan come together after taking a risk, and Commandos: Origins certainly offered up plenty of those moments – even after my crushing defeats. So far, Claymore Game Studios' revival of Commandos is offering a compelling case for its comeback, which can potentially put the series back on the map as an exciting and satisfying tactics game.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
