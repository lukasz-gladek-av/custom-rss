After months of leaks and rumors, the next-generation RTX Blackwell GPUs are now official, and there are four of them on the way. </p><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang revealed the RTX 50-series GPUs during a CES keynote this evening, announcing a $1,999 RTX 5090, a $999 RTX 5080, a $749 RTX 5070 Ti, and a $549 RTX 5070. Nvidia’s new RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs will both be available on January 30th, with the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 to follow.</p><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>The RTX 50-series GPUs include a new design for the Founders Edition, with just two double flow-through fans, a 3D vapor chamber, and GDDR7 memory. Surprisingly, the RTX 5090 Founders Edition will be a two-slot GPU and will be capable of fitting inside small form factor PCs.</p><p>The RTX 5090 has 32GB of GDDR7, a memory bandwidth of 1,792GB/sec, and a massive 21,760 CUDA cores. This all adds up to a GPU that Nvidia says will be two times faster than the RTX 4090, thanks to DLSS 4 and the Blackwell architecture.</p><p>Nvidia demonstrated <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> running on an RTX 5090 with DLSS 4 at 238fps compared to 106fps on an RTX 4090 with DLSS 3.5. Both GPUs are running the game with full ray tracing enabled.</p><p>The RTX 5080 is designed to be twice as fast as the RTX 4080 and will include 16GB of GDDR7 memory, a memory bandwidth of 960GB/sec, and 10,752 CUDA cores. Nvidia is promising big performance gains with the RTX 5080 over the previous RTX 4080 model as a result.</p><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s RTX 5080 performance promises.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>Nvidia is also launching an RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070. The RTX 5070 Ti includes 16GB of GDDR7 memory, a memory bandwidth of 896GB/s, and 8,960 CUDA cores. The RTX 5070 has 12GB of GDDR7, a memory bandwidth of 672 GB/sec, and 6,144 CUDA cores. Nvidia says the RTX 4070 Ti will be 2x faster than the RTX 4070 Ti, and the RTX 5070 should be twice as fast as the RTX 4070. </p><p>Nvidia is also bringing its RTX 50-series to laptops, with the RTX 5090 laptop GPU debuting with 24GB of GDDR7 memory. The RTX 5080 laptop GPU will ship with 16GB of GDDR7 memory, the RTX 5070 Ti with 12GB of GDDR7 memory, and the RTX 5070 with just 8GB of GDDR7 memory. RTX 50-series laptops will be available starting in March from a variety of PC makers.</p><div><figcaption><em>RTX 50-series laptops are coming in March.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>Huang demonstrated Nvidia’s RTX Blackwell GPUs with a real-time rendering demo at the beginning of the company’s CES keynote today. The demo included new RTX Neural Materials, RTX Neural Faces, text to animation, and even DLSS 4. “The new generation of DLSS can generate beyond frames, it can predict the future,” says Huang. “We used GeForce to enable AI, and now AI is revolutionizing GeForce.”</p><p>Nvidia’s new RTX Neural Shaders can be used to compress textures in games, while RTX Neural Faces aim to improve face quality using generative AI. The next generation of DLSS includes Multi Frame Generation, which generates up to three additional frames per traditional frame and can multiply frame rates by up to 8x over traditional rendering, according to Nvidia.</p><p>DLSS 4 also includes a real-time application of transformers to improve image quality, reduce ghosting, and add higher detail in motion. </p><p>Nvidia’s RTX 50-series announcement comes more than two years after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23362653/nvidia-rtx-4080-4090-price-release-date">RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 were announced</a>, based on Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace architecture. Nvidia’s RTX 40-series of GPUs focused on improving ray tracing with Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS)  version 3, and the RTX 4090 delivered some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23398201/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-test-benchmark">truly impressive performance gains</a> over the previous RTX 3090 GPU.</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <em>Helldivers </em>adaptation, meanwhile, will be made by Sony Pictures. Neither has a projected release date yet, which makes sense at least in <em>Helldivers</em>’ case. No one expected it to be such a big hit just a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, a militaristic parody of a futuristic fascist empire fighting off alien invaders, is sort of already a movie. It’s called <em>Starship Troopers</em>, the Paul Verhoeven action comedy based on the sci-fi novel by Robert Heinlein. Then again, this wouldn’t be the first time Sony made a movie from a game that’s loosely inspired by another movie. That is, after all, effectively what the <em>Uncharted </em>adaptation was, which starred Tom Holland as the Indiana Jones-esque treasure hunter Nathan Drake. </p><p>Sony also revealed that <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>will be getting an anime series called <em>Legends</em>. It’s being made for the streaming service Crunchyroll by Aniplex, the studio behind <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaib</em>a, and directed by Takanobu Mizuno, known for<em> Star Wars: Visions -“The Duel</em>.<em>” </em>It’s a ways off, though, as <em>Ghost of Tsushima: Legends</em> isn’t set to release until 2027.

<p>Sony is turning two popular game franchises into major motion pictures. During its CES 2025 keynote on Monday night, Sony announced that Helldivers and Horizon Zero Dawn are being turned into movies.</p>



<p>The Horizon film is being produced by Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions. Columbia Pictures is the studio that produced 2022’s Uncharted movie. PlayStation Productions is also handling the development of the Helldivers movie.</p>



<p>No other details about the movies were revealed at the time of the announcement.</p>



<p>Horizon Zero Dawn first launched in 2017 for PlayStation 4. The game was scheduled to get a series on Netflix before it was ultimately canceled. Now it moves to a live-action movie. </p>



<p>Helldivers, on the other hand, rose to unexpected prominence with the release of Helldivers 2 in February 2024. The game became the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, selling over 12 million copies in just 12 weeks. </p>

AMD claims the performance benchmarks will be roughly in the range of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4070 Super. That would put the RX 9070 series within a mid-range line of GPUs, rather high-end models--though we're curious to see how they'll stack up against Nvidia's upcoming RTX 5000-series GPUs, which are also expected to be unveiled at CES this week.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423407-9070info.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423407" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423407-9070info.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423407"></a><figcaption>Several manufacturers are readying Radeon 9070 series GPUs for launch early this year.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423407-9070info.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">What was confirmed, however, is that the GPUs' RNA 4 architecture will support the new FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4) AI-powered resolution upscaling, which AMD also previewed at CES. FSR is similar to Nvidia's DLSS and PS5 Pro's PSSR upscaling tech (which was based on FSR), but FSR 4 is built specifically for the RX 9070 series' new AI accelerators. FSR 4 will launch alongside the new Radeon 9070 GPUs and will support any games that already use FSR 3.1 and above, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as confirmed by Microsoft's Matt Booty during AMD's presentation. The company did not specify how FSR 4 upscaling will compare to its current FSR 3.5 or Nvidia's DLSS.</p><p dir="ltr">AMD did not reveal prices or specific release dates for the Radeon RX 9070 GPUs, but the first wave is expected to launch in Q1 2025, with models planned from multiple manufacturers, including Acer, Asus, ASRock, Gigabyte, and more.</p><h2 dir="ltr">New Ryzen 9 Flagship CPUs</h2><p dir="ltr">Alongside these new GPUs, AMD also unveiled its new flagship desktop CPUs, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, during its CES 2025 presentation. Pricing and specific release date were once again not confirmed, but we did get a more concrete release window of March 2025, and a clearer overview of its specs and performance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423406-ryzen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423406" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423406-ryzen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423406"></a><figcaption>AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPU</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423406-ryzen.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Ryzen 9 9950X3D features 16 Zen 5 CPU cores (32 threads), a maximum boost frequency of 5.7GHz, 144MB of total cache, and 170 watt TDP. The Ryzen 9 9900X3D features 12 cores (24 threads), a 5.5GHz maximum boost, 140MB of cache, and a 120-watt TDP. AMD says the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is 10% faster on average than Intel's current Core Ultra 9 285K flagship CPU, and up to 20% faster for gaming. Its gaming performance benchmarks are also within 1% of AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is widely considered the best gaming CPU currently on the market--and one that is notoriously difficult to find in stock.</p><p dir="ltr">The Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D are both set to launch in March, but no prices have been revealed yet.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're in the market for an AMD processor but don't want to wait, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9800X3D-16-Thread-Desktop-Processor/dp/B0DKFMSMYK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has restocked the popular Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU for $479</a>.

The device, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030930/sony-vr-spatial-smart-control-ring-ces">which Sony first teased at CES last year</a>, will come with 4K OLED displays, video passthrough, and support for third-party design, modeling, and production software.</p><p>Based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPBmlGIiAOE&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fvoxmedia.stories.usechorus.com%2F&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE">video shared by Sony</a>, it looks like wearers will be able to flip up the headset when they’re not using it. It doesn’t appear to come with the ring and pointer that Sony showed off last year, though.</p><p>Alongside the headset, Sony revealed Xyn Motion Studio, an accompanying Windows app that supports up to 12 Mocopi sensors, its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23780187/sony-mocopi-motion-capture-vr-avatar-us-price-release">wireless motion-tracking system</a> that V-Tubers and other creators often use to control virtual avatars. The software comes with motion-editing features, allowing creators to trim and merge motions, as well as adjust time and position.</p><p>There’s also a prototype of a “spatial capture solution,” which is supposed to transform images of real objects and spaces into “photorealistic” 3D computer-generated assets using Sony’s algorithm. One year out from Sony’s initial teaser, and details are still pretty slim on what exactly this headset will be capable of, aside from viewing and interacting with 3D objects.</p><p>Sony is planning to release its Xyn Motion Studio software in late March 2025, but there still isn’t any word on the availability or pricing of its headset.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-disclosed-the-cost-and-sales-of-some-call-of-duty-titles.1075482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cost-sales-call-of-duty-franchise/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’ve always wondered how much it costs to make a game in the Call of Duty franchise, now we have the answer. At least, a partial answer.</p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameFile</a>, the development costs and sales figures for some games in the Call of Duty franchise have been revealed. The figures were released by Patrick Kelly, the franchise’s current Creative Director, in a court case.</p>



<p>Let’s get to the data:</p>



<h2 id="h-the-cost-and-sales-of-the-call-of-duty-franchise">The cost and sales of the Call of Duty franchise</h2>



<p>Black Ops 3, released in 2015, cost an absurd $430 million dollars. The game sold 43 million copies. Modern Warfare 2019, the game that revitalized the franchise and brought back Warzone, cost $640 million and sold 41 million copies. Finally, Black Ops Cold War, released in 2020, cost 700 million dollars and sold “only” 30 million copies.</p>



<p>Despite the astronomical figures, the games manage not only to pay for themselves but also to generate a huge profit for Activision’s coffers. In addition to the direct sale of the game, which costs the full price of U$70, the publisher earns millions from the sale of skins and CoD Points.</p>



<p>For some time now, the Season Pass has been enhanced with Blackcell, serving as an incentive for players to spend more money. With the figures uncovered, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War takes over as the most expensive game ever made.</p>



<p>This is, of course, according to current public data. More recent CoDs, such as the recently released Black Ops 6, probably was more expensive to be made. Besides that, there’s no doubt that GTA 6’s costs must be just as enormous.</p>

                <p>Ghost of Tsushima, the critically acclaimed PlayStation title that sees players take on the role of a samurai defending his homeland, is getting an anime adaptation. Announced at 2025's Consumer Electronics Show, the upcoming series seeks to "offer fans an exciting new way to experience the game" alongside "bold and groundbreaking animation." As such, Sony Music and PlayStation Studios are collaborating with anime distributor Crunchyroll and Demon Slayer studio Aniplex to bring the show to life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4423434-ps2slim.png" data-ref-id="1300-4423434" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4423434-ps2slim.png" data-ref-id="1300-4423434"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Tsushima Legends art included in the anime series press release.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4423434-ps2slim.png"></figure><p>According to the series' press release, the upcoming show will not focus on Ghost of Tsushima main character Jin Sakai. Instead, it will adapt the game's Legends mode, a later addition to Ghost of Tsushima that introduced four-person co-op. In Legends mode, four characters--a samurai, a ronin, an assassin, and a hunter--band together to fight off creatures born from Japanese myths and legends, making for an experience that leans farther into the surreal and supernatural than the base game.</p><p>As of right now, many details about the upcoming series--such as its official name--are being kept under wraps. However, the studios did offer a tentative release window of 2027 and an announcement that the show will be a Crunchyroll exclusive.</p><p>The Ghost of Tsushima animated series is yet another one of PlayStation Studio's many video game adaptations that are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-a-look-at-the-playstation-productions-movie-animation-that-runs-before-uncharted/1100-6500707/" data-ref-id="1100-6500707">currently in the works</a>. Funnily enough, one of the most notable of these is John Wick creator Chad Stahelski's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-from-john-wicks-chad-stahelski-is-in-the-works/1100-6489332/" data-ref-id="1100-6489332">Ghost of Tsushima movie</a>, which is presumably still in the works. However, and as head of PlayStation Productions Asad Qizilbash noted, this series marks the studio's first anime adaptation.</p><p>"Having already proven the immense quality and versatility of our gaming properties across multiple successful film and television projects, we couldn’t be more excited to announce our first ever anime adaptation," Qizilbash stated. "Ghost of Tsushima's rich, immersive world and its fantastical Legends mode based on Japanese mythology provide the perfect canvas for this project, and Aniplex is the perfect partner to translate Sucker Punch Productions' hit video game into a stunning new anime series."</p>

The Lego Store recently sold through its stock at full price.</p><div title="6527822 - Monkey Palace Lego Set" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2831" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6527822 - Monkey Palace Lego Set" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Monkey Palace Lego Strategy Board Game</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$31.56 (was $40)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Monkey Palace turns building Lego into a fast-paced and varied strategy game for 2-4 players. It isn't the first officially licensed Lego board game, but it is the only one still in print at the moment. Older Lego board games tend to sell for rather high prices, so it'd be wise to add Monkey Palace to your collection sooner rather than later.</p>                      </div><p>What happens when a monkey stumbles upon an ancient palace in the jungle but decides to redecorate their new home? The entire place collapses, of course, so now you and up to three other players need to rebuild the structure from scratch.</p><p>To help the monkey live large again, humans take turns adding Lego pieces to makeshift staircases. Each piece is worth a certain number of Monkey Credits, which are exchanged for Monkey Cards. The Monkey Card you choose to play determines which brick type(s) you use to make and decorate the staircases. As you build, you rack up Banana Points, which are counted at the end of the game to determine the winner. Games last roughly 45 minutes.</p><p>Monkey Palace comes with 231 bricks and multiple game boards, each of which presents their own unique challenges and adds replay value. There are many different ways to build your palace, so while there are rules to follow, it is a fairly open-ended game that each player will approach from a different angle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4423438-monkeypalace.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423438" data-ratio="0.72" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4423438-monkeypalace.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423438"></a><figcaption>Monkey Palace: A Lego Board Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4423438-monkeypalace.jpg"></figure><p>Lego enthusiasts have no shortage of new building sets to choose from this month, as the brick-building giant released over 100 playsets and display models on January 1.

            <p>
Steam Deck too dinky for you? Always wished you could purchase a handheld gaming PC capable of obscuring your entire head? Then Acer might just have the answer. The company has unveiled its new Nitro Blaze 11, sporting a 10.95-inch screen and chunky form factor testing the limits of what might reasonably be considered a 'portable' gaming device.
</p>
<p>
Acer's <a href="https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11">Nitro Blaze 11</a> is, it's fair to say, a bit of a beast, measuring 36.4 cm x 17.1 cm x 1.59 cm and weighing in at 1050g - roughly the equivalent of 1.5 Steam Decks. It's unclear if those figures include the machine's two chunky detachable controllers - Acer's press release is vague on that point - but it's certainly not what you'd call an understated device. Judging by the promo images, it could comfortably be used to serve nibbles between gaming sessions too.
</p>
<p>
On the positive side, its hefty frame boasts some decent innards. That 10.95-inch screen, for instance, is a 120 Hz WQXGA 2560 x 1600 touch display capable of up to 500 nits of brightness, and it also packs in an AMD Ryzen 8040HS processor, 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and up to 2TB of NVMe SSD storage. That's on top of a built-in kickstand and those aforementioned detachable controllers, which now feature back buttons. And if that appeals, you'll be looking at a minimum price tag of $1099.99, depending on your storage requirements.

<p>
But if you're in the market for something a little more 
discreet - and a little cheaper - there's also Acer's new <a href="https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-8">Nitro Blaze 8</a>, which features an 144 Hz 8.8-inch screen and weighs in at a more modest 720g. This one measures 30.5 cm x 13.4 cm x 2.2 cm (controllers are definitely included here, seeing as they're not detachable) and costs $899.99. Both machines include three months of Xbox Game Pass and are scheduled to launch in Q2 this year.
</p><p>
Acer's expanded Nitro Blaze line-up won't make use of AMDs newly announced trio of next-gen Ryzen Z-series APUs - designed for handheld gaming PCs - but Digital Foundry has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-amd-announces-next-gen-ryzen-z2-apus-for-gaming-handhelds">little more to say about those</a> elsewhere on Eurogamer if you're curious.

It’s also got a built-in kickstand so you don’t have to strain your arms by always playing it handheld. It will be available starting in Q2 2025 and start at $1,099.99.</p><p><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24335612/belkin-stage-powergrip-battery-pack-camera-grip-stand">Belkin Stage PowerGrip</a></h3></p><p>Your smartphone may take great pictures, but it lacks the refined ergonomics of a traditional camera. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24335612/belkin-stage-powergrip-battery-pack-camera-grip-stand">Belkin’s new Stage PowerGrip</a> addresses that issue and battery anxiety. It’s a MagSafe power bank with a 10,000mAh battery, a retractable USB-C cable, and a design that adds a camera-like grip to the iPhone. It’s even got a physical shutter button that works with the iOS camera app over Bluetooth and a small LCD screen on the front showing the battery’s remaining charge. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced, but the PowerGrip will come in several color options.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Consumer Electronics Show is taking place this week in Las Vegas, and you know what that means: impractical tech announcements out the wazoo (and, like, three things that are actually cool). Among the former is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335423/acer-handheld-gaming-pc-nitro-blaze-8-11-specs-price" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acer’s new Nitro Blaze 11 gaming handheld</a>, which has a 10.95-inch screen. I love a gleaming, glorious window into the digital realm as much as the next guy, but I’m sorry: That’s too big.&nbsp;</p><p>I submit just one piece of evidence: the above picture. That should be enough, because look at it! My man is studying <em>Balatro </em>hands on a device five times the size of his own. He’s attempting a <em>Hades II</em> run while explaining to a child that the whole world is “thiiiiiiiiiiiis big.” He’s playing the <em>Tony Hawk</em> remasters on a surface he could attach wheels to and use as a skateboard.</p><p>This is a handheld only in the technical sense; it does indeed require hands to hold, but probably many more than you or I actually possess. Like any member of our exceedingly exhausted species, I enjoy playing my Steam Deck while lying down in bed. Due to the width of that device, however, my wrists, elbows, and shoulders tend to tap out after an hour or so. Imagine trying to use the Nitro Blaze 11 in that scenario. You’d succumb to cramps you didn’t even know your body could produce in seconds. </p><p>At the very least, the Nitro Blaze 11 includes a built-in kickstand and detachable controllers, but that merely gestures at the problem. It does not solve it. If you're mainly planning to perch this thing atop another surface and play it from a couch or a chair, you do not want a handheld; you're looking for a console or gaming PC, both of which you likely already have if you're the kind of person who'd considering buying a device like this for the low, low price of $1,099.99.</p><p>I’m guessing that Acer – which also announced the 8.8-inch Nitro Blaze 8 – is testing the limits here or engaging in a full-on marketing stunt, the kind which companies lean on during CES to stand out among a crowded convention hall. Either way, take it from me, somebody who plays almost everything on handhelds despite owning a pretty decent gaming PC: too big.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/open-thread-how-was-your-break"><h3>Open Thread: How Was Your Break?</h3></a><p>I did not turn off motion smoothing at my parents' house</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>Nearly two years ago, AMD announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/amds-ryzen-z1-chips-could-power-a-new-wave-of-handheld-steam-deck-clones/">its first Ryzen Z1 processors</a>. These were essentially the same silicon that AMD was putting in high-end thin-and-light laptops but tuned specifically for handheld gaming PCs like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">Asus ROG Ally X</a>. As part of its CES announcements today, AMD is refreshing that lineup with three processors, all slated for an undisclosed date in the first quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Although they're all part of the "Ryzen Z2" family, each of these three chips is actually much different under the hood, and some of them are newer than others.</p>
<p>The Ryzen Z2 Extreme is what you'd expect from a refresh: a straightforward upgrade to both the CPU and GPU architectures of the Ryzen Z1 Extreme. Based on the same "Strix Point" architecture as the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/ryzen-ai-300-performance-review-impressive-cpus-even-if-you-dont-care-about-ai/">Ryzen AI 300 laptop processors</a>, the Z2 Extreme includes eight CPU cores (three high-performance Zen 5 cores, five smaller and efficiency-optimized Zen 5C cores) and an unnamed RDNA 3.5 GPU with 16 of AMD's compute units (CUs). These should both provide small bumps to CPU and GPU performance relative to the Ryzen Z1 Extreme, which used eight Zen 4 CPU cores and 12 RDNA 3 GPU cores.</p>

<p>The Ryzen Z2, on the other hand, appears to be exactly the same chip as the Ryzen Z1 Extreme, but with a different name. Like the Z1 Extreme, it has eight Zen 4 cores with a 5.1 GHz maximum clock speed and an RDNA 3 GPU with 12 cores.</p>

The largest fantasy TTRPG competitor to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> has two books arriving in the first half of 2025. One is a remaster of an older book. The second is a supplement: <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Shining Kingdoms</em>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Shining Kingdoms</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq08pw5/discuss?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Shining-Kingdoms#tabs" rel="nofollow">official store page</a>, <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Shining Kingdoms</em> will focus on six key nations of the Inner Sea. The aptly named Shining Kingdoms are lands full of knightly orders, proud ancient cultures, and deadly court intrigue.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-andoran-artwork.jpg?itok=IjOv9aKp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-andoran-artwork.jpg?itok=K170xqoC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This new supplement for <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em> will delve into these six nations.</p>

<p>Andoran is the bastion of democratic freedom. Druma is the kingdom's trade hub. The Five Kings Mountains are the home of the fractured dwarven kingdoms. Galt is the land perpetually wracked with violent revolutions. Kyonin is the homeland of the elves cloaked in illusion. Last is Taldor, the ossified remnants of one of the Inner Sea's greatest empires.</p>

<p>Each region in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Shining Kingdoms</em> will present new player options. These include new archetypes, equipment, magic items, spells, and animal companions. Players can also learn more about each region's factions such as Andoran's Eagle Knights or the Shieldwrought Striders of the Five Kings Mountains.</p>

<p>For DMs, the supplement will include a bestiary of monsters and a fold-out poster map to serve as a centerpiece for a Shining Kingdoms campaign.</p>

If you already own the original version, it will remain compatible with this new version of the game. However, if you want the most up to date version, the option is here.</p>

Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman will join on January 10, seemingly alongside a new map, a balance patch, and a battle pass. The other two will join in the latter half&nbsp;of the season. Developer NetEase is rolling out information on Season 1: Eternal Night Falls throughout the week, so we’ll be updating this post with new details as they come. Here’s everything we know so far about <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Fantastic Four-focused season.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h2921692"><a id=""></a><strong>The Fantastic Four join the fight</strong></h2><p>Headlining the season are the Fantastic Four, with Mister Fantastic, The Thing, Invisible Woman, and Human Torch all joining the roster.
