		<p>Atari has agreed to acquire an 82% stake in Swedish indie publisher and developer Thunderful Games, purchasing shares worth SEK 50 million (around €4.5 million). Thunderful is best known for&nbsp;SteamWorld, Islanders and Lost in Random.</p>
<p>Sadly, a restructuring of the company’s studios will take place following the acquisition.</p>


<p>The purchase is subject to a shareholder vote, scheduled for 28th August, but has already received support of Thunderful’s Board of Directors and the two largest shareholders right now – Owe Bergsten and Brjann Sigurgeirsson – who currently hold 29.9% of the company’s capital and voting rights. The purchase is being made possible by issuing new shares, so their stake and voting rights going forward will be significantly diminished.</p>
<p>Wade Rosen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Atari said, “This Transaction marks another important milestone in Atari’s development with the expansion of its publishing and development capabilities in the European region. Thunderful is recognized for publishing and developing critically acclaimed games, and with the announced transformation plan, as well as the quality and commitment of Thunderful’s teams, we are confident that Thunderful will be returning to a profitable growth path while helping to further develop Atari operations in Europe.”</p>

<p>Thunderful has a complicated business history, but boils down to having started as a merger between indie developers Image &amp; Form (best known for the SteamWorld series) and Zoink (Stick it to the Man!, Fe, Lost in Random), and Swedish retailer and distributor Bergsala in the 2019. In the following years, Thunderful has acquired more developers and publishers, including Headup Games (for a while), Coatsink and others, but the company has struggled in the last couple years. Through 2024, they made layoffs, divested Headup Games, and branched off the distribution businesses to make Thunderful Group a purely game development and game publishing entity, which is what Atari is now acquiring.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-4-will-honor-its-predecessor%E2%80%99s-legacy-without-trying-to-outdo-it-says-narrative-director.1256139/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Witcher 4 will have plenty of new features, but it will also respect its predecessor's legacy without necessarily trying to outdo it, as video games aren't mathematical, and acclaim is subjective.</p>



<p>Speaking with GamesRadar+, the game's narrative director Philipp Weber commented on online discussions centered on how CDPR will top the third entry in the series, saying that it is one of his concerns as well. However, the developer was able to move away from them by acknowledging that video games aren't mathematical, acclaim is subjective, and attempting to top The Witcher 3 "mathematically" isn't really an option.</p>



<p>On the contrary, CDPR isn't developing The Witcher 4 with the idea that it has to beat its predecessor in some way. The studio wants to do justice to the legacy of the third entry in the series, and to do so, they are developing the new game using the same philosophies. At the same time, the development team wants to make the game feel like a proper sequel that doesn't retread old ground, so ultimately, The Witcher 4 will feature a <em>"healthy mix of really moving forward and also trying out some new things, but doing justice to what was there, not trying to beat it," according to Weber. </em>Ultimately, CDPR is developing the game to make sure some people will love it, and hopefully those who love The Witcher 3 also will.</p>



<p>Although The Witcher 4 is not being developed with the idea that it has to surpass The Witcher 3, there's no doubt that the next entry in the series is likely going to surpass its predecessor in terms of visuals, judging from the impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">tech demo</a> set in the village of Valdrest, which featured impressive NPC density. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-made-with-console-first-approach-60-fps-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-extremely-challenging-to-achieve-says-cdpr/">console-first approach</a> and the desire to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-dev-wants-to-take-full-advantage-of-the-generational-shift-since-the-witcher-3-tech-demos-village-npc-density-was-based-on-novigrad/">take advantage of the generational shift </a>since The Witcher 3, the fourth entry in the series promises to be a spectacle for the eyes, no matter the platform.</p>

            <p>There are a number of official Jumanji video games, but they don't seem very Jumanjish to me. You've got a bunch of nineties-to-noughties minigame compilations, a pachinko adaptation, and a few reportedly dismal games based on the recent Dwayne Johnson movies, also feat. Steve off Infiniminer and Amy Pond from Dr Avenger: Endgame.</p>
<p>Ludogram's just-announced streamerbait co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/invokyr">Invokyr</a> seems to be cleaving a lot closer to the 1995 movie, which is itself based on Chris Van Allsburg's book from 1981. The game sees you and up to three others playing a cursed boardgame that transforms the house it's played in.</p><!--more-->
<p>The one immediate complaint I have is that Invokyr's boardgame looks mega simple. Going by the screens, it has you rolling dice to move one piece to the end of a path. Not exactly Twilight Imperium then. Still, there's talk of "special dice", and the cursed boardgame itself is voiced by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> dungeon master Amelia Tyler. It's going to have a certain stage presence, if nothing else. Hopefully it'll do some crafty things with the movie's literal "we have colonialism at home" theme. There's a Van Pelt-adjacent "great white hunter" in the trailer, below.</p>

<p>The transforming house around the room containing the boardgame is a creature of Blue Principled abandon. It's big and mazey enough that you might get lost, claim the developers, and is capable of various generated biomes - "jungle, ice mountain, oversized toy chest". You'll have to worry about traps and also, creatures such as carnivorous plants and puppets in cages, each with a different mode of stalking. Sort of looks like they hunt the same way in the video, admittedly: sneaky-sneak, peekaboo, chomp!</p>
<p>I'd like this to have the variety of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>'s menagerie, in which some anomalies can only be thwarted by failing to notice them. A Lethal Company Jumanji mod would be fabulous, actually. I'd also like it if the board game in Invokyr were a smaller, real-time version of the house, with a very small model of the player looking down at very small boardgame that contains another, even smaller model of the player, etcetera.</p>
<p>At the very least, there needs to be a trap that maroons one player in another world until they have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enH1LsxIJI4">a beard bushy enough to sleep in</a>. It's out... in the future. You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3883570/Invokyr/">Steam</a>. Favourite cursed boardgames, anybody?

            <p>If you're the sort of player that jumps into the yearly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> experience, there's probably one thing that's stuck with you more than anything else: that obscene download size.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the catch-all Call of Duty app (often referred to as Call of Duty HQ) via Xbox wants me to free up 381.19GB of space on my PC hard drive in order to install all the 'recommended' files it needs to run. The Steam app only requires 'at least' an SSD with 128GB available space, which is still, frankly, too much.</p>

<p>In an announcement made via <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1949968296121344261">Activision's CODUpdates account</a> on X, the publisher announced:</p>
<p>"On July 29 at 9am PT, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will be moved from the main Call of Duty install and become standalone downloads."</p>
<p>That means, sometime this week, you will be able to load the games on their own - without the need for the massive download offered by the Call of Duty HQ app. In short, as soon as tomorrow (30th July), anyone that owns either of the games will be able to launch directly into the titles once downloaded. Read: no faffing with interstitial menus or confusing screens via the somewhat cumbersome app.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Legacy content for each title - this means MW2 and MW3 modes within the main Call of Duty HQ app - will be automatically removed on 7th August, freeing up space for players still wanting to access the other Call of Duty titles without bothering with the two affected titles.</p>
<p>Whether this indicates Activision is willing to remove other Call of Duty games from the app in the coming days and months remains unclear. It's also unclear why these two games have been targeted first: do they have a lower engagement rate than other titles? Are they simply easier to unhitch from the integrated ecosystem?</p>
<p>It also raises questions about upcoming series entry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> (the multiplayer aspect of which we can expect to see sometime 'this summer').</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3s-up-to-200gb-file-sizes">Way back in 2023</a>, Activision justified its decision to merge all the games into one app by saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusing-call-of-duty-hq-launcher-justified-by-activision">it allowed for easier file management and seamless switching between games</a>. Even back then, the decision drew fire from the community. Players criticised the publisher for putting the onus on individuals to "reduce the overall footprint" of the title. At the time, players became frustrated and confused when trying to access games they actually owned, as the app kept presenting them with opportunities to purchase the newest content added to the store. As you can imagine, this went down poorly.</p>
<p>Are you still playing either of the affected titles? Is this going to have a meaningful impact on you - or your SSD? Is there any reason for you to go back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-campaign-review-vapid-and-hastily-assembled">the "vapid and hastily assembled" Modern Warfare 3 campaign</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Achilles: Legends Untold, released in 2023, introduced us to a new developer with great potential. Sure, several aspects of the game were certainly rough around the edges, but there was enough quality gaming to be had in this action RPG to suggest Dark Point Game had what it took to release an absolute banger. Their follow-up game, Achilles Survivor, is the realisation of that potential, offering one of the most-compelling and thrilling experiences available in the embryotic bullet heaven genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Achilles: Survivor. Release date trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15ahxwZMgYg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Smartly reusing many of their gorgeous visual assets from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/03/achilles-legends-untold-review/">Achilles: Legends Untold</a>, Achilles Survivor bears an uncanny resemblance to its forbear. Played from a top-down perspective, Achilles or one of many other unlockable mythological characters, must survive for either ten or twenty minutes against an unending horde of monsters. This being a twist on Vampire Survivors, you do that with only one controller input: movement. You steer your character around the small, enclosed environment, dodging hordes of enemies, or smashing headlong through the smallest pack of them to break free.</p>
<p>Combat is automated, with each of your attacks auto-targeting foes on a repeating cycle. As you kill monsters, ranging from Ray Harryhausen style skeletons, to Cyclopes, and unpleasantly animated giant spiders, you quickly level-up. Doing so is crucial, as each incremental level provides you with a selection of additional attack powers or heightened abilities to choose from. Soon, you become the bullet hell, spewing out a multitude of deadly blades, a plume of poisoned griffin talons, and a parade of marching giants. It’s up to you to position and move your character just right to ensure you hit as many of your enemies as possible, whilst still being able to nimbly dodge their attacks.</p>


<p>One aspect that sets Achilles Survivor apart from many of its bullet heaven brethren is the rather neat building mechanic, which adds a lashing of strategy and consideration to your actions. As your survivor explorers the environment they’ll fine stone mines. Hang out around the perimeter of the mine and you’ll gradually accrue stone – this in and of itself adds to the tension, as gathering resources whilst a horde of enemies lumber towards you is quite the thrill – this can then be used to build defences at specific locations marked by a flag. You’ll get a random selection of four structures to choose from, some with offensive properties and others defensive in nature.</p>
<p>Defence types are varied, from flame thrower turrets and healing stations to poison emitting fountains and friendly warrior spawning Trojan Horses. Some defences only activate whilst you remain beside them, forcing you to bravely lure the enemies towards you before frantically fleeing at the last moment, while others work better in combination, such as a device that blasts enemies away so that they land in the spikey embrace of a nearby spear turret. Experimenting with different combinations to best thin the numbers of the enemy is all part of Achilles Survivor’s appeal.</p>
<p>There are various challenges to take on in each level that helps keeps things fresh. You can open up portals to add to the enemy count and ultimately be rewarded with some powerful loot, or close enemy spawn points by seeing off a set number of extra-powerful beasties. There are zones that if you remain within whilst killing enough baddies you’ll get a tasty bonus ability and treasure chests that can be peeked inside if you can just get past the veritable army blocking your way.</p>

<p>It all adds up to a ridiculously fun gameplay loop, satisfying and accessible, and one in which anyone could pick up a controller and have a riotous blast. Pacing is perfect, the volume of enemies gradually increasing until there are hundreds of the blighters on screen, as you desperately attempt to flank them before they close off your escape route, whilst the final remaining seconds on the clock tick down.</p>
<p>After each run, your character gains permanent upgrades, and also class specific bonuses which impact any other character you choose too. There’s always something cool to unlock, fostering that ‘just one more go’ mentality, be it new abilities, spells, buildings, characters, or levels. It’s intoxicatingly addictive, and before you know it hours of your life have gone by, as you sat with a glazed expression, slightly drooling from the ridiculous grin plastered on your face as you finally make it through a particularly challenging level.</p>


<p>My only complaint? Well, the bosses are a drag. They pop up infrequently but when they do, they often overstay their welcome. It’s not like they are particularly challenging – their area attacks can be easily dodged – it’s just that they are ridiculous bullet sponges who absorb a stupendous amount of damage. As such, the precise pacing and rhythm of the game is lost when the bosses turn up, turning proceedings into a slog until you finally whittle down their expansive health bar. One ten-minute level was doubled in length after a particularly gruelling battle with Paris – not the city, but the irritating prat from Troy. With any luck, a patch or two will refine the boss experience. Either way, bosses or not, Achilles Survivor staunchly remains one of the best examples of its genre currently available.</p>

<p>To meet this rising threat, we’ve also expanded the Knowledge Rank system to 9 &amp; 10 allowing players to unlock and develop a broader array of skills, passives, and combat techniques to become even more masterful.</p>
<p>New Game+ awaits! But before taking on the task of a new journey, you can upgrade the passives and skills of Naoe and Yasuke! Players will gain 1 new rank for multiple nodes in their Mastery Skills, and 10 new ranks for all existing Knowledge passives to become even more formidable.</p>
<p>A test of your skills is no match without the right gear! The Forge can now be upgraded to level 4, allowing players to upgrade all weapons and gear to level 80 to have the edge on the rising threats that await.</p>
<p>With new levels and ranks, come three new achievements and trophies waiting to be unlocked:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enjoy the Ride</strong>: Reach Level 80</li>
<li><strong>Stars Unseen</strong>: Reach Knowledge Rank 10</li>
<li><strong>Worth its Wait</strong>: Obtain the Gold Katana and Gold Long Katana (by completing the story on New Game+).</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/igda-calls-for-greater-transparency-amid-adult-game-bans.1256097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has issued a statement regarding recent adult game bans on platforms like Steam and Itch.io, calling for "greater transparency and fairness" in the matter.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://igda.org/news-archive/press-release-statement-on-game-delistings/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> on its website, the IGDA says it's "alarmed" by the way in which "legal, consensual, and ethically-developed games, especially from LGBTQ+ and marginalized creators", have been delisted and deplatformed by storefronts like the aforementioned two in recent weeks.</p>

<p>The association says that while it does not wish to engage in "the defense of harmful material", it does want to advocate for "reform, developer voice, and platform accountability", calling for developers' works to be assessed "fairly, transparently, and contextually".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/igda-statement-adult-game-bans-steam.jpg?itok=4TKURuPY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/igda-statement-adult-game-bans-steam.jpg?itok=_5FVIrWG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The IGDA says platforms like Steam aren't assessing adult games fairly or contextually.</figcaption></figure><p>The IGDA laments the sudden ways in which platforms like Steam and Itch.io are delisting and banning adult-oriented content, bemoaning the "lack of transparency around enforcement criteria, sudden shifts in policy, and...absence of appeal pathways" open to developers.</p>

<p>As the IGDA points out, these issues can lead to developers losing income, not to mention damage to their reputation; after all, some might be less likely to buy a developer's next game if they learn the previous effort was banned due to content Steam or Itch.io deem objectionable.</p>

<p>Not only that, but these policies can have a "disproportionate impact on marginalized voices", as the IGDA says. Censorship the association describes as "overreaching" may have a greater impact on "queer, trans, femme-identifying, and POC developers".</p>

<p>So, what does the IGDA recommend? The association is calling for clearer guidelines on what content is prohibited, as well as "timely communication" if action is taken. That's in addition to greater appeal pathways for developers, "advisory panels", and regular transparency reports.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-adult-content-bans-igda.jpg?itok=3geS6vM7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-adult-content-bans-igda.jpg?itok=rYqnAEAx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Itch.io has also been enacting adult content delistings in recent days.</figcaption></figure><p>This all began a couple of weeks ago, when a report by the activist group <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Collective Shout</a> alleged that platforms like Steam and Itch.io were hosting content that glorified sexual abuse and contravened the guidelines of payment processors like PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard.</p>

<p>Following that campaign's commencement, both Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages" rel="nofollow">and Itch.io</a>&nbsp;began deindexing and delisting adult games from their platforms, the rationale being that if payment processors objected, then they may withdraw their services, leaving customers unable to pay for games.</p>

<p>However, this scorched-earth approach has already begun to affect creators it arguably shouldn't even go near.&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>creator Cara Cadaver, for instance, recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" rel="nofollow">reported that her game had been banned from Steam</a>, despite the fact it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer" rel="nofollow">about as far from a glorification of sexual abuse or violence</a> as it's possible to get.</p>

<p>Let's hope the IGDA's statement stops this issue from getting too out of hand. It's all too easy to imagine a world where developers don't feel confident creating games with any adult themes in them at all for fear of upsetting nebulous organizations that have very little to do with the games they're causing to get banned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Godbreakers</em> is a multiplayer roguelike with some interesting ideas but a lot to prove. It’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this year and hoping to reverse a recent trend of underwhelming games by parent publisher Thunderful, which was just purchased by Atari amid its latest round of layoffs. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196307" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="657" data-playlist="196307,196539,195891" data-current="196307"><div><p>10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21857.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Godbreakers</em> is a third-person action game in which you brawl your way through short levels to take on big arena boss fights. You can do it solo or in squads of up to four players, with loot and upgrades to collect along the way. One of the key things differentiating <em>Godbreakers</em> in a fun but overcrowded genre is a mechanic that allows players to explode low-health enemies and steal their powers. The one-shot abilities offer DPS, crowd control, and other benefits with the potential to augment the usual roguelike buildcrafting with an extra layer of strategy. </p><p>I played a recent demo that left me intrigued but somewhat unconvinced. The action is fairly tight, with cancelable animations, responsive dodge dashing, and some crisp combos, including a fun slide attack that feels surprisingly good for this type of game. But the demo didn’t leave me with a good sense of the overall flow of a playthrough, or whether levels will be less boring and more visually interesting in the finished game. A loadout menu back at the home base before launching missions also showed cosmetics for customizing character appearances, along with possible ambitions for the game that the demo that I played seemed nowhere close to supporting. </p><p>Ultimately, whether <em>Godbreakers</em> can turn a bullet point list of decent but familiar gameplay ideas into a fun co-op arcade roguelike experience will come down to how the loot, upgrades, and RNG-fueled progression of each run feels. That’s one of the more difficult things to get a sense of from a short demo, and it’s also the one quality that’s often make-or-break for roguelikes without a strong visual style or other distinctive qualities. In other words, my time with the demo gave me a sense of a version of <em>Godbreakers </em>that could be worth making time for, but I’m not sure that’s a version that can launch in the next few months. </p><p>The game is being made by To The Sky, a recently formed team led by an ex-EA development director named Jugo Mirkovic, and which Thunderful, publisher of the <em>SteamWorld</em> series and other games, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-acquires-to-the-sky-games-studio&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-acquires-to-the-sky-games-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased back in 2021</a></span>. “We shopped around with this game quite a bit,” he told <em>Kotaku </em>during a recent developer presentation. “The premise of the game is still kind of similar to what we pitched, but we found the fluidity and the gameplay a bit after we pitched the game. We wanted to pitch a combat kind of action, melee, roguelike. That’s what we pitched. But we ended up with something a lot more fluid, and that surprised even us.”</p><p>The studio stresses that <em>Godbreakers</em> is very much gameplay-first, which certainly comes across in the demo. But these days, games that aren’t firing on all cylinders—story, art, unique mechanics—can be hard to make time for when there are dozens of new games coming out every week. Thunderful also published<em> Reignbreaker</em> earlier this year, a neat-looking punk take on <em>Hades</em> that struggled to connect with enough players. The studio behind it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shut down before it even released</a></span>.<em> Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>, a roguelike spin-off of the whimsical gothic adventure from 2021, faced a similar uphill battle. One negative review praised the look and gameplay but said the progression during each new run felt too shallow to stick with. </p><p>Thunderful blamed weak sales of <em>The Eternal Die</em> for its latest round of layoffs announced on Tuesday. “It is unfortunate to have to implement further operational measures that affect some of our colleagues,” Thunderful chairman Patrick Svensk told investors. “At the same time, I am convinced that this is the right path for Thunderful to create an efficient organization within the publishing business where our announced release pipeline remains intact.<em>” </em></p><p>Amid rising debt, Atari (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-life-death-death-death-death?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-life-death-death-death-death?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back from the dead again, this time maybe for good</a></span>) announced today that it has taken a controlling stake in Thunderful for just  $5 million. That bargain bin price comes after years of great games—<em>Viewfinder</em>, <em>Planet of Lana, SteamWorld Heist 2</em>—that didn’t do well enough to make up for all of the other missed bets. Hopefully, <em>Godbreakers</em> can end up bucking that trend instead of becoming the latest casualty of it. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/godbreakers-roguelike-trailer-demo-atari-thunderful-1851787237]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2><strong>When is the Battlefield 6 open beta?</strong></h2><p>There is no release date yet for the Battlefield 6 open beta, but online speculation suggests it will begin in early August.</p><h2><strong>How to get into the Battlefield 6 open beta</strong></h2><p>Given it's an open beta, presumably anyone will be able to access the Battlefield 6 test. If it works like other open betas, players will be able to find the download from their store of choice and go from there.</p><h2><strong>What's in the Battlefield 6 open beta?</strong></h2><p>The contents of the Battlefield 6 open beta have not been announced, but it's expected the beta will allow players to try out some of the maps and modes. Battlefield Studios also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-confirmed-will-include-this-key-change/1100-6533303/" data-ref-id="1100-6533303">already confirmed</a> that the beta will allow players to choose either an "open" or "closed" weapon setup.</p><p>"Why not both?" the developer said. In the open beta, players can choose playlists that have signature weapons locked to a specific class, or not. "More to come," the developer said.</p><p>Older titles, like the much-loved Battlefield 4, had class-locked weapons, but Battlefield 2042 introduced the ability for players in any class to choose whatever weapon they wanted. Some portion of the audience didn't enjoy this, while others embraced this expanded freedom. It appears DICE is trying to appease both audiences by giving them the option in Battlefield 6.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540239-bf6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540239" data-ratio="0.55546875" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540239-bf6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540239"></a><figcaption>Battlefield 6's open beta is on the way.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540239-bf6.jpg"></figure><p>Battlefield 6 has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-campaign-is-inspired-by-this-movie-and-tv-show/1100-6531514/" data-ref-id="1100-6531514">campaign mode</a>, too, along with the rumored return of the Portal mode and a potential battle royale mode. The open beta, however, is only expected to offer up a multiplayer trial.</p><h2><strong>Does progress from the beta carry forward?</strong></h2><p>EA has not officially announced the specifics of the Battlefield 6 open beta, but history suggests that progress from the beta will not carry forward to the full game when it releases. This is how things normally work, and it's expected that will continue with Battlefield 6's open beta.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is the first new Battlefield game since 2021's tepidly received Battlefield 2042. A release date hasn't been announced, but speculation suggests it's launching on October 10. That's about a month before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s rumored November 14 release date.</p>

                <p>Despite the ongoing problems and constant shuttering of live service games, it's looking like Warner Bros still wants a piece of that questionable pie. A job listing at Warner Bros Games Montreal for an <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/" rel="nofollow ">executive producer role</a> went live recently (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/following-suicide-squads-flop-warner-bros-is-hiring-for-another-live-service-game/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), which explicitly makes mention of live service titles. The role would "oversee post-launch content and live service strategy," for one, and it also notes that having a "deep understanding of the full game development lifecycle, including live services," would be beneficial experience.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a couple of mentions of overseeing live operation processes, so it certainly seems like whatever WB Games Montreal is working on will have some kind of live service element. That obviously might raise some eyebrows for a couple of reasons.</p>

                <p>Get ready to draw, doodle, animate, and compose as Mario Paint has returned for the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 via the Nintendo Classics Online library. Originally released in 1992 for the Super NES, Mario Paint turned your console into a full-on art studio, complete with a mouse and a whole world of creative tools. Now, a new generation can jump in and create colorful masterpieces, goofy animations, and original tunes--all with a modern twist.</p><p>On Nintendo Switch 2, you can use the Joy-Con 2’s new mouse-style controls to sketch, paint, and animate. Prefer a traditional setup? Plug in a compatible USB mouse--sold separately--on either Switch model and go old-school. And yes, the iconic music maker is back too, so get ready to compose your next virtual jam with chirping cats and bobbing mushrooms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8hd9D6ImM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ok8hd9D6ImM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Coloring Book is back with fresh designs and your favorite Nintendo characters to fill in, freestyle, or remix however you want. If you're feeling competitive, Gnat Attack is back to perfect your mouse skills.</p><p>If you're a Nintendo Switch Online member, you can save your creations and share them online. On Switch 2, GameChat2 lets you connect with voice, video, or screen share, so you can sketch, animate, or just hang out and watch your friends draw a very questionable Yoshi. Let the creative chaos begin.</p>

            <p>Battlefield 6 was officially unveiled earlier this month, and it looks like so far the community is keen for the upcoming release, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042s-opening-weekend-has-been-a-disaster">somewhat lacklustre initial reception to its predecessor Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7355565272528826369-FoP1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8">a LinkedIn post</a> shared by Alinea Analytics CEO Rickard Linder, following the debut of Battlefield 6's reveal trailer last week, the game racked up nearly 500,000 Steam wishlists over the weekend (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wishlist-on-steam-half-million/">Insider Gaming</a>). Linder added roughly 60 percent of those who added Battlefield 6 to their wishlist had played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't too shabby when you consider that former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-review-dices-magic-fps-formula-gets-spread-too-thin">Eurogamer editor in chief Martin Robinson called Battlefield 2042 "the weakest Battlefield in some time"</a> when it first released in 2021. To be fair, the team did work on improving Battlefield 2042, and in 2023 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-with-humility-and-hustle-dice-might-yet-win-the-war">Eurogamer noted DICE had "course-corrected in dramatic fashion"</a>, though the developer would likely "have to wait for the next iteration to see its efforts rewarded". Given those wishlist numbers, it seems this may indeed be the case.</p>

<p>Like I said, we got our first look at Battlefield 6 last week, courtesy of a new trailer. While a firm release date was not provided as part of this reveal, the disclaimer URL featured in the video takes you to a page that says: "This promotional offer expires October 10, 2025. Code expires October 10, 2027." <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-revealed-with-a-dedicated-multiplayer-reveal-coming-next-week">This indicates that pre-sell offers end on October 10, and that a release date for Battlefield 6 may be October 11, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>A separate multiplayer reveal is scheduled for later this week, on 31st July.</p>
<p>Aside from what has been officially announced, we already know a fair amount about the next Battlefield entry. Leaks from the Battlefield Labs tests revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">Rush will be coming back to Battlefield 6</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">single player details have spilled out into the internet</a>, and a variety of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">weapons that'll be usable in the full release have made their way online, too</a>. Then, just this weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leaks-keep-on-coming-this-time-its-the-battle-royale-map">Battlefield 6's Battle Royale map popped up online</a>.</p>

<p>Also recently shared via the world that is social media are images from the Battlefield 6 alpha showing that the 'Battlefield stretch neck' - which is exactly as it sounds, with players having overly stretched necks - is back (see image above).</p>
<p>"It is an absolute classic that dates all the way back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a> beta," <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1949885360613323210">reads a post on X</a>. "It is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>"Battlefield is so back."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-lukewarm-reception-to-battlefield-2042-fans-seem-to-be-getting-behind-battlefield-6-as-steam-wishlist-numbers-soar]]></content:encoded>

And ahead of the game's launch, publisher Dotemu has some potentially disappointing news for Switch owners.</p>
<p>The Switch 1 version "will average a 30 FPS experience at launch", the publisher <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dotemu.bsky.social/post/3lv4656qehq2z">announced</a>, while other platforms will hit a solid 60fps. Not the <em>best</em> news, but it's par-the-course for many games on the older hybrid.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The game, however, will be playable to Switch 2 and will, in Dotemu's words, "benefit from the console's specs". A little vague if you ask us — does that mean it'll be a solid 30fps? Will it aim for 60? Time will tell.</p>

<p>In more good news, Dotemu confirmed that it would be sharing details of post-launch updates ASAP. That may mean performance boosts for the newer console, stability fixes, or just new content.</p>
<p>Many people on social media have questions around what all of this means for those playing the game on Switch 2. We've reached out to Dotemu for clarification, and we'll update this story if we get a response.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-pre-orders-go-live-gamescom-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-pre-orders-will-reportedly-kick-off-at-gamescom-2025.1256049/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Xbox confirmed its lineup</a> for what it will feature during Gamescom 2025, with over 20 games on the list, and that its recently announced upcoming handheld, the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, will be available for players at the show to go hands-on with. Today, notable and reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-vous-devoile-la-date-douverture-des-ventes-60300">Billbil-kun from Dealabs</a> reports that pre-orders for both handhelds will go live the same day that Gamescom 2025 kicks-off, on August 20, 2025.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun also corroborated previous reports around the pricing for both handhelds, saying that the previous report of the ROG Xbox Ally being €599 and the ROG Xbox Ally X being €899 are correct, though Billbil-kun is not able to confirm the official pricing for the US and other regions around the world.</p>



<p>We know that Xbox will be featuring the Xbox Ally during its two days of broadcasts on Wednesday, August 20, and Thursday, August 21, so it could be that the official regional pricing and pre-orders will go live during that broadcast. Though it's also just as likely that the official prices will be revealed during <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl">Gamescom 2025 ONL</a> the night before, on August 19, to get players ready for the pre-orders to go live on August 20.</p>



<p>And if the official pricing is revealed on the 19th with pre-orders live on the 20th, then it's fairly safe to assume we'll know the official release date of the handheld on the 19th.</p>



<p>Regardless of when pre-orders go live or when the Xbox Ally launches, some players are using Dealabs' report to claim that August 20 is also when we'll know the release date for Hollow Knight Silksong. When the ROG Xbox Ally was revealed, it featured Silksong playing on the device, and when Xbox revealed its Gamescom 2025 lineup yesterday, it highlighted that there will be a playable demo of Silksong at its booth, which players can try out on the Xbox Ally.</p>



<p>The logic then seems to be that Xbox plans to have its new handheld out after Silksong has finally released, so it can be playable on the Xbox Ally on day one. Gamescom ONL is also the last major show of announcements before The Game Awards at the end of the year, and by then, it's expected that Silksong will have launched.</p>



<p>We'll see what surprises Gamescom 2025 has in store.</p>

Originally released back in 1992, <em>Mario Paint</em> was a unique SNES title, because although it included a handful of mini games, it was first and foremost a creative tool letting players draw, paint, animate, and even compose music using the 16-bit console.</p><p>What also set <em>Mario Paint</em> apart from other SNES games was that it didn’t rely on the console’s standard gamepad. It came bundled with a two-button mouse and a plastic mouse pad that made drawing and navigating the game’s on-screen menus and drag-and-drop interface much easier.</p><div><p>In 1992, creative apps like Photoshop were still in their relative infancy —- Photoshop didn’t even have its useful layers feature yet — and for many kids, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-miss-mario-paint-when-nintendo-gamified-art-class-1847664087"><em>Mario Paint</em> was their first exposure to using a digital creative tool</a> (and perhaps even a mouse).</p></div><p>Alongside <em>Mario Paint</em> being added to the Switch’s SNES catalog, Nintendo has enabled mouse support for the Switch’s SNES app, which is compatible with games like <em>Mario’s Super Picross</em> and <em>Nobunaga’s Ambition. </em>On the original Switch, players can connect a compatible USB mouse to play <em>Mario Paint</em>, while on the Switch 2 the Joy-Con 2 controller’s mouse functionality can be used.</p><p>The company also recently added 19 tracks from <em>Mario Paint</em> to the Nintendo Music mobile app, including the three sample compositions available in the game’s music sequencer.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/715104/nintendo-mario-paint-super-nintendo-switch-2-online-mouse-mode]]></content:encoded>

First released in 1992 for the Super Nintendo, the beloved art creation game allows players to create digital artworks, compose music, create custom animations, and more.</p><p>The game combines multiple creative applications, such as its titular digital painting application that lets you create custom artworks using a variety of tools or fill in coloring book images. Outside of painting, Mario Paint features minigames, a music composition tool (which players have used to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/09/04/get-lucky-recreated-in-mario-paint-isnt-daft-punk.aspx">recreate countless real-life songs</a>), a stamp designer for creating custom game sprites, and even animation software.

		<p>Nintendo has finally added Mario Paint to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, the SNES painting game considered a true classic by connoisseurs, and in a pleasant surprise, it arrives with full Joy-Con 2 mouse mode support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and USB mouse support in general!</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Paint - Super NES – Nintendo Classics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ok8hd9D6ImM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a bunch of different modes in Mario Paint that engage different styles of early digital artistry. For beginners, the colouring book mode lets you select from a palette of colours and fill in the line art of whatever scene is before you, but there’s further fun quirks like filling with pixel art sheets. Drawing Board is then more like a full on MS Paint with different brush types to bring your digital paining into reality – it’s where the iconic Undo Dog comes from to… undo stuff.</p>
<p>Stamp Designer lets you create 16×16 pixel art, saving a small handful of these tiles that you can then combine and animate across scenes with up to nine frames that repeat and follow a path you draw.&nbsp;Then there’s Music Composition creating songs from 15 distinctive sounds, including dog, cat, pig, goose and baby!</p>
<p>All of these can be combined to create and play scenes of your own devising. The original cartridge and game seriously limits how much you can save, but with four save slots available to suspend the game in Switch Online, you can quadruple the possibilities.</p>

<p>Rounding things out is Gnat Attack, a mode where you break out a fly swatter and slap flies that are buzzing around.</p>
<p>All of this was played best with a mouse on SNES, and will be here as well. On Switch 2, you can just detach a Joy-Con 2, hold it on its side to a surface and use mouse mode, but there is also support for USB mice on both Switch 2 and the original Switch, plugging them into the dock.</p>
<p>In a nice little extra, all the music from Mario Paint is also now available in the Nintendo Music app, which Switch Online subscribers all have access to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 29/07/2025:</strong> It appears to have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mcaanu/possible_footage_of_bmwukong_dlc/">confirmed</a> that this video is not a real leak of Black Myth: Wukong DLC and is indeed just some impressive work from a fan. </p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>A video from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th2bp9e0QUQ">DonPablo Gaming</a> claims to be footage from an unannounced DLC for Black Myth: Wukong, featuring a new underwater region and a quick-time-event fight between the game's protagonist, The Destined One, fighting what looks like a hydra on the back of a dragon. The video's description also claims that more details, like when this DLC will be available, will be announced on August 20, 2025, the day that Gamescom 2025 kicks off and the day <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-launch-scheduled-for-exactly-one-year-after-pc-ps5/">Black Myth: Wukong comes to Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p>



<p>Last year, rumors circulated that Black Myth: Wukong was set to receive <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/">two DLC expansions</a> ahead of a sequel, with the first of those DLCs planned for 2025. After the game surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-18-million-copies-expansion/">18 million copies sold</a> (and would later <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/">surpass 20 million</a>), Daniel Wu from Hero Games, the largest external shareholder for the game's developer, Game Science, confirmed that an expansion was in development. </p>



<p>But beyond that, we've not had any other official or even close to official word on any DLC.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Myth Wukong Upcoming DLC Under Water" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/th2bp9e0QUQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Which is why it's still worth taking this video with a grain of salt, even though, through all its pixelated features, it does appear like it has a chance of being real. Especially since the video does capture the kind of grandiose encounters the original game is known for. The uploader also claims in the comments of the video that the footage is pulled from a beta test version of the DLC. </p>



<p>Is there a chance that this video is real? Sure there is. Is there a chance that someone is showing off their talents at faking this kind of footage? Always. We'll know one way or another by August 20th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Sues Tencent Over Horizon-esque Light of Motiram]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-tencent-light-of-motiram-lawsuit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-esque-light-of-motiram.1256004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has filed a lawsuit against Chinese gaming giant Tencent over the latter's open-world survival game&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, which Sony alleges is a "slavish clone" of its own&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series of games.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/" rel="nofollow">Reuters</a>, the lawsuit was filed in California federal court and accuses Tencent of copyright and trademark infringement over&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, which it says contains several elements from the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>According to Sony, it declined to work with Tencent on a&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>spinoff game last year, and the announcement for&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, which looks suspiciously similar to&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>, followed soon afterwards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/light-of-motiram-sony-tencent-lawsuit.jpg?itok=ff21AEIv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/light-of-motiram-sony-tencent-lawsuit.jpg?itok=gEzoLXQY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pop quiz: is this shot from&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>? (It's the latter.)</figcaption></figure><p>As part of its lawsuit, Sony is asking for damages (although the amount is undisclosed), as well as an order to block Tencent from violating its IP rights, according to Reuters. Presumably, that means development on&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>would either immediately cease or swerve direction swiftly.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" rel="nofollow">announced back in November last year</a>. When I reported on its announcement, I said it had "strong 'we have&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>at home' energy", and I stand by that; the trailer is...well, brazen feels like too mild a word, honestly.</p>

<p>Let's just say that&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>'s aesthetics, robot wildlife, and tribal outfits are extremely strongly reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>, so I can understand the grounds on which Sony is pursuing this lawsuit.</p>

<p>You can check out the original announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>below if you want to remind yourself of what, exactly, it's being accused of stealing.</p>




<p>Tencent's proposed&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>collab isn't the only external partnership in the franchise that Sony has backed away from in recent months; back in January, it was reported that an unannounced&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO, developed in conjunction with&nbsp;<em>Guild Wars&nbsp;</em>studio NCSoft, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">had been canceled</a>.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether this lawsuit will materially affect&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>'s development, but in the meantime, you can still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist Tencent's game on Steam</a> if you want.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Gray Lady has not been having a great time lately. From its<a href="https://glaad.org/nyt-podcast-trans-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> hurtful coverage of trans people</a> to its<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/media/new-york-times-trump-coverage-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> toothless reporting on the 2024 election</a> to its<a href="https://newyorkwarcrimes.com/dossier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> feckless approach to the ongoing genocide in Palestine</a>, the once-storied newspaper of record has faced increasing criticism as to what, exactly, it thinks it's doing for a world (and readership) that's rapidly shifting on its axis.</p><p>It seems silly to hold the paper's AI coverage and longstanding disinterest in video games up to the same scrutiny as those life-and-death matters, but this is a video game website, and a recent story on AI and the games industry published in the Times is <em>so </em>bad that I think it warrants a mention, even if it’s just a footnote below the paper’s bigger problems.</p><p>Called<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/arts/video-games-artificial-intelligence.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> “The Unnerving Future of A.I.-Fueled Video Games</a>,” it's a piece from Zachary Small, a writer who’s been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/16/insider/leveling-up-on-the-video-game-beat.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of the NYT’s renewed video game coverage</a> since 2023. One paragraph in particular stands out, in which Small seems to conflate the "AI" found in video games with the same "AI" that is currently boiling lakes and threatening the <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decimation of entire creative industries</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Most experts acknowledge that a takeover by artificial intelligence is coming for the video game industry within the next five years, and executives have already started preparing to restructure their companies in anticipation. After all, it was one of the first sectors to deploy A.I. programming in the 1980s, with the four ghosts who chase Pac-Man each responding differently to the player’s real-time movements.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The NYT is notorious in games media circles for its apparent neglect for video game coverage; <a href="https://game.substack.com/p/why-the-new-york-times-returned-to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it has never hired a dedicated staff or spun off a video game-specific vertical, instead relying on freelancers, syndication, individuals and adjacent writers like Small</a>. And once again here it shows; this excerpt <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bryantfrancis.me/post/3lv2zp4bfvc2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is understandably getting dunked to hell and back on social media</a>. But as silly as that paragraph is, I take wider issue with the positioning of the story itself. Like so much other reporting on AI from mainstream outlets, it's got an almost breathless tone to it, a story built on the premise that an AI revolution is inevitable, that any obstacles standing in the way of that will be taken care of in just a few years, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>Small, <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/optimistic-cowardice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like so many other dupes in tech reporting</a>, repeatedly takes AI grifters–like “tech founder Kylan Gibbs”, who despite the vague descriptor used in the NYT piece <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylangibbs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can more accurately be described as CEO of what was originally a games-related AI company</a>, which pushes stuff like AI-generated voice actors--at their word, despite their word holding as little proven value as <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the AI bubble itself</a>. Small mentions “impressive tech demos at the [Game Developers] conference in late March”, referring to a succession of AI smoke-and-mirrors shows that sounded…<a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-npcs-nvidia-unity-ubisoft-convai-inworld" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well, impressive is not the word I’d use</a>. And when raising ethical concerns about the tech, he<a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> doesn't speak to an affected artist or developer</a>, or anyone<a href="https://sustainablegamesalliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who knows about games and their environmental impact</a>, but speaks to an academic with the title "director of responsible A.I. practice", as though there were such a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Every time I see shit like this I think about <a href="https://defector.com/toward-a-theory-of-kevin-roose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector’s “Toward A Theory Of Kevin Roose”</a>, where Albert Burneko sums up one of the biggest rubes on the beat, Kevin Roose (also of the New York Times), with:</p><blockquote><p>I was thinking about Kevin Roose, serially and with apparent enthusiasm donning each next pair of gigantic clown shoes handed to him by this or that Silicon Valley titan, and dancing in them long past the point when everybody else figured out it was all on behalf of a grift.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>And I think about how after Big Tech’s successive scams of the past decade–blockchain, NFTs, the Metaverse, all of which were supposed to be just as life-changing as AI is supposed to be, all of whose mainstream hype cratered when nobody had any actual use for them–should have ruined this kind of thinking, this kind of reporting. It should have taken what little credibility Silicon Valley had left and set fire to it, and made writers and reporters anywhere near the tech industry sit up and take notice.</p><p>But it hasn’t. We kept getting fed the same bullshit, and it’s being laundered in the same kind of stories. This newspaper sucks, man. It doesn’t suck because it posted something dumb that betrays the paper’s poor commitment to video gaming’s wider place in our culture and artistic landscape. It sucks because it’s doing to games, and AI, what it seems to be doing to every other important beat of the 2020s: taking the worst people at face value.</p><p>Anyone interested in tech, video games, AI and the points they all collide deserve better than this kind of coverage.
