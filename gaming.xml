<figure data-uuid="352fea995ebc8"><a title="Metroid Prime Art Book 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/352fea995ebc8/metroid-prime-art-book-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It often feels like <strong>Metroid</strong> fans are starved for new goodies these days; doubly so for fans of Retro Studios’ Prime series. Yet just over a month before the highly anticipated fourth mainline entry for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2</a>, you can get your hands on an absolutely <em>stunning</em> hardback art book from Piggyback covering the first three Metroid Prime games – plus a little extra for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Prime Remastered</a>.</p>
<p>Ripping the shrink wrap off the book, it’s immediately clear just how premium <strong>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</strong> really is. Clocking in at 212 pages, the minimal black fabric cover displays little more than an outline of Samus on the front, the main Metroid logo on the back, and the book’s title on the spine. These elements shine red when angled in the light and it looks very elegant in person.</p><div><figure data-videoid="FsuAt4uVyTk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4022bdxqojnr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>My only concern with the cover is that it does pick up minor marks and smudges when handled for longer periods. They rub away easily enough, but it’s something to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Diving into the book itself, it starts off with a relatively short foreword from series producer Kensuke Tanabe going over his introduction to Retro Studios and how the team leveraged its talent to create such incredible games. Every title is then covered in release order with an introductory write-up from Retro Studios for each (though which specific individual, exactly, is undisclosed).</p>
<p>Peppered throughout are further remarks from Tanabe; short anecdotes on how he and Retro Studios worked together on specific mechanics and designs. A lot of it is pretty well-known, but there are definitely a few little tidbits that came as a surprise. Did you know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/metroid-prime-remastered-almost-had-completely-new-cutscenes">Prime Remastered almost had completely brand new cutscenes</a>, for example? Well, now you do.</p>
<p>In addition to Tanabe’s writing, other breakout boxes essentially replicate text from the in-game Scan Visor logs, and as someone who knows the Prime games inside out, I felt somewhat disappointed that Nintendo and Piggyback went in this direction. These kinds of write-ups work fine in the game itself, but I don’t need to read about how Sheegoth has a vulnerable underbelly (wink-wink, use the Morph Ball Bomb) in an art book. Tell me about the design process!</p>

<p>This is a pretty glaring issue throughout the entire book. While I certainly appreciated Tanabe’s insights, I feel a lot more could have been provided by Retro Studios itself. What was the initial approach in creating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Prime 2</a>'s Luminoth? Why go with <em>this</em> design instead of <em>that</em> one? What kind of challenges were overcome?</p>
<p>As I gazed in wonder at the incredible concept art, multiple questions arose in my mind about the development process involved; unfortunately, most simply went unanswered. It’s important to acknowledge that many devs who worked on the trilogy — including art director Todd Keller — are no longer at Retro, so I can understand why they weren’t directly involved.</p>
<p>As for the artwork itself, well, it's outstanding. This is an extensive dive into the Metroid Prime Trilogy and showcases almost every major aspect of the games, including Samus’ suits, her ship, enemies, bosses, environments, and more.</p>
<p>It’s a <em>lot</em>, and it’s a real treat for fans of the series. I particularly enjoyed looking at some of the alternative designs for the Space Pirate enemies, which seemingly took on a more emaciated appearance compared to the final in-game models.</p>

<p>Naturally, without <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/metroid_prime_hunters">Metroid Prime: Hunters</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/metroid_prime_pinball">Pinball</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a>, you could argue that this isn't quite as 'complete' as some would like. Indeed, one of the most obvious omissions is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/metroid-prime-4-beyond-who-is-sylux">Sylux</a>, the shadowy antagonist who really only appears properly in Hunters and Federation Force. Their ship, however, <em>does</em> crop up at the end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>, but even this isn't present here. It's an odd choice given the character's prominent presence in the marketing for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</p>
<p>Speaking of Beyond, I had hoped that there might be a small nod to the upcoming sequel in the book, and while there are hints toward it in Tanabe's notes (<em>"Retro and our team at Nintendo will keep working together to the best of our ability to bring new stories for fans to enjoy!"</em>), there are no visual references. This was perhaps a bit optimistic on my part, and my hope is that there might be another book in the future dedicated to the long, storied development of Prime 4.</p>
<p>Despite my concerns and disappointments, Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective is a lovely book that Prime fans will absolutely devour – I sure did. It's the kind of visual feast you'll want to just dive into again and again at a moment's notice, so you can bet it will take pride a place on my coffee table for the foreseeable future.</p>

        <p>"We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made."</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> CEO Dan Clancy has admitted the company "failed" by both allowing streamer Emiru to be physically assaulted at TwitchCon last weekend, and "in our response following".</p>
<p>Last weekend, streamer<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/streamer-assaulted-at-twitchcon-slams-event-security-i-think-other-creators-should-seriously-consider-not-attending-in-the-future"> Emiru was assaulted at a TwitchCon Meet and Greet after a man crossed multiple barriers to grab her face and try to kiss her</a>. A viral video that caught the incident suggests TwitchCon's own staff did not prevent the incident from occurring, nor "came to ask what happened or if I was okay" in the immediate aftermath.</p>
<p>In Twitch's initial response, it said "the safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority", and called the behaviour of the man who pushed past the queue to grab Emiru and kiss her "completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting". It then revealed it had "blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>hello everyone, I am okay and thank you for all of the kind messages, sorry I cannot respond to them all 🩷</p><p>Yesterday, the man who assaulted me was allowed to cross multiple barriers at twitchcon and even in front of another creators meet and greet to grab me and my face and try…</p></div>— emi ⭐️ (@emiru) <a href="https://twitter.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Emiru disputed this version of events, however, saying, "Twitch's statement they said that the guy was immediately caught and detained [was] a blatant lie".</p>
<p>"He was allowed to walk away from my Meet and Greet, and I didn't hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me, and it felt like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it, not because TwitchCon staff present thought it was a big deal," she added, later confirming she was pressing charges.</p>
<p>In the days following the incident, Clancy was criticised for a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-responds-to-emiru-twitchcon-assault-says-its-a-challenge-in-todays-society-and-not-limited-to-twitc">video interview</a> in which he said, "the challenge we face is a challenge in today’s society. It’s not limited to Twitch, it extends throughout our society.</p>
<p>"Now, what happened yesterday, obviously, was something that we care deeply about securing this environment. We're looking very closely at everything that happened there, and I care deeply about Emi," he added. "She's a friend of mine, and so I want to see how we can support her. This is just something we have to keep working on. I think everyone identifies our tools in terms of trust and safety as the leaders in the industry about helping creators, but that means there's always more work to be done, because that's the world we live in now."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">First, I want to be upfront and take accountability for the security incident that occurred during Emiru’s Meet and Greet.

</p></div>
<p>Now, in a fresh statement, Clancy said he "want[s] to be upfront and take accountability for the security incident that occurred during Emiru's Meet and Greet", saying, "it shouldn't have happened and we take that very seriously".</p>
<p>"We failed, both in allowing it to occur, and in our response following. We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made. I apologise to Emiru for all that took place."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Twitch is now investigating "everything" about how they run Meet and Greets, "from sign-ups to the layout to increased security controls". This includes a review of its teams, production and venue staff, so it is "better equipped" for future events".</p><p>"We're also doing a comprehensive review of overall event safety and security, and will be making updates for future TwitchCons," he added. "While we won't be sharing all security updates for privacy and safety reasons, we will keep our community informed about changes that directly impact attendees.</p>
<p>"You put a lot of trust in us by attending TwitchCon, and we take our responsibility to keep you safe seriously," the statement concludes. "We know that TwitchCon means a lot to a lot of people, and it means a lot to us. Be on the lookout for more updates, and thanks for being a part of Twitch."</p>
<p>Clancy said the company has also "hard concerns about IRL" streaming, and though he didn't expand on what those concerns were, added that the IRL category was now "a part of Twitch" and "TwitchCon [should ensure it] meets the needs of a variety of participants". More will be revealed "soon".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It took me a while to get into <em>Ball x Pit</em>. The new roguelike blends elements from games like <em>Breakout</em>, <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and even city builders, creating a complex mix of ideas. But as is the case with many roguelikes, once I figured everything out well enough to get a taste of my first win, delving back into the pit for another round was all I could think about.</p><p><em>Ball x Pit</em> barely has a story — it’s more like a setup. The initial moments of the game show a multi-tiered Gondor-like city called “Ballbylon” being struck by a giant, glowing rock (ball?), and all that remains is a giant pit that “treasure seekers” aim to explore. Then, you’re dropped into the action. Initially, as a knight-like character called “The Warrior,” you move around a narrow playing field, shooting balls up toward steadily advancing hordes of enemies. Your character fires automatically and you have infinite ammo, letting you focus on aiming your shots for optimal bounces and picking up gems and other goodies dropped by defeated bad guys.</p><p>Like in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, when you pick up enough gems, you’ll gain a level, which improves your stats and gives you the chance to choose some kind of upgrade, like special balls that can poison enemies or activate lasers. Occasionally, enemies will drop little rainbow spirals that can level up a bunch of your upgrades at once, let you fuse balls together to combine their powers, or evolve two balls into a special new one. With the right combination of upgrades, you can get extremely powerful, with balls and effects flying around the screen as you wipe out the enemies and bosses. When you finish a run, win or lose, your character gets experience that carries over so they’re more powerful in future runs.</p><p>After a run, you can choose to visit “New Ballbylon” for the <em>other</em> part of <em>Ball x Pit</em>, which involves base-building. During this phase, you can set up things like plots of wheat and forests for resources or buildings that open up new characters and permanent stat boosts. To harvest resources or build things, you’ll have to send out your characters to bounce against the plots and structures by aiming them like you do in the main part of the game. You can also upgrade structures so they offer better perks, and you’ll eventually be able to make buildings that will auto-harvest resources for you.</p><p>Initially, I didn’t like the base-building; I just wanted to keep doing the main runs. But once I had a good engine for resources and understood how upgrading buildings worked, I was spending a lot longer than I expected optimizing my base, which had the added benefit of making things easier when I jumped back into a level.</p><p>Some buildings unlock new characters, and they’re nearly always worth the effort: the characters have wildly varying playstyles that keep things fresh. One character gets 5 percent more damage for each bounce, so I’d try to shoot balls into tight corners where they’d ping wildly and potentially rack up serious damage. One character makes the game turn-based. Another character automatically picks their own upgrades, and one of the last characters that you can unlock plays the game <em>entirely on their own</em>, which I found very useful while trying to grind some late-game levels and upgrades.</p><p>By the end of my time with <em>Ball x Pit</em>, I will admit that I started to feel a bit of the emptiness I do when I play <em>Vampire Survivors</em> now. Once winning became more routine, I started to focus on maximizing things in a way that felt more obsessive rather than fun. I’m even ashamed to say that I let the auto-play character handle a bunch of runs on the last level while I went and did other things.</p><p>But when you’re in the zone on a good run, the game is a delightful, colorful, and chaotic experience that feels like a hyper-extreme version of the classic <em>Breakout</em>. With so many characters to play and ways to improve your base, <em>Ball x Pit</em> goes deep.</p><p><sup>Ball x Pit<em> is out now on Nintendo Switch, PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S, and is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://x.com/devolverdigital/status/1981737834819014867">on October 28th.</a></em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/805022/ball-x-pit-review-pc-nintendo-switch-ps5-xbox-series-x-s]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Mega Man Legends 2 is celebrating its 25-year anniversary today, October 25, 2025. Below, we look back at how its unresolved cliffhanger ending still overshadows its memory.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Mega Man Legends 2 is an unfinished promise. The anime-inspired adventure series was beloved by fans of the blue bomber for its inventive, Zelda-like spin on the classic formula. It was filled with lovable characters who have endured long past the series itself, like Tron Bonne, the Servbots, and the hero, Mega Man Volnutt. But like a serialized cartoon series, the second game in the series ended with a whopper of a cliffhanger--and then never returned to it. The legacy of Legends for the last 25 years has been fans waiting for a resolution that never came.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers for the Mega Man Legends series follow</strong></p><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar with the Mega Man Legends series, it's unusually story-rich for a Mega Man game. Set in the distant future, in a world almost completely covered with water, Mega Man Volnutt and his adoptive family, Barrel and Roll Caskett, dig for treasure in ruins guarded by ancient technology called Reaverbots. All the while, they're alternatively pursued and occasionally aided by sky pirates called the Bonnes: Teisel, Tron, and big baby Bon Bonne. Each of the main characters in the colorful world is fully voiced, aiding in the presentation as a Saturday-morning cartoon come to life.</p><p dir="ltr">The first game explores Mega Man investigating ruins to avert a prophesized disaster, but inadvertently awakening it in the process. Another being, called Mega Man Juno, reveals to Volnutt that his original name is Mega Man Trigger. Trigger was designed as a "Purifier Unit" whose purpose was to eliminate the Carbons--aka the artificial humans who live in this world. Needless to say, he does the right thing and protects humanity instead.</p><p dir="ltr">The second game treads familiar ground but expands upon it with multiple new characters and a larger scope. This time a unit called Sera tasks Mega Man to find four keys that will unlock the Mother Lode, a rich energy source that would usher in utopia and end the constant scrapping for resources. But Sera's counterpart, Yuna, later informs Mega Man that the keys would not save humanity but rather doom it, by eliminating the Carbons and replacing them with the ancient, non-artificial humans. In the end, the three come to an understanding and stop the Master Program from initializing the wipe, but in the process, the three are left stranded on the moon of Elysium, separated from their home on the planet Terra. To make matters worse, Yuna explains that the shutdown of the Master system will trigger a failsafe by reactivating an even older Elder system, activating machines across the ruins of Terra. Mega Man Legends 2 ends with Roll attempting to build a rocket to save her stranded sibling, but we never see if it's successful.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcNbjdMCvY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_VcNbjdMCvY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This is the canonical, chronological end of the Mega Man series. Several of the individual Mega Man series--from the classic 8-bit platformers, through Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero, and Mega Man ZX, and finally Mega Man Legends--form one continuous (though loosely connected and often ret-conned) story. Legends is the last, which means that its unresolved ending is the last thing we see happening in a story that has been changing and evolving since the 1980s. The last in a long line of heroes called Mega Man is stranded, with a clock ticking toward the destruction of all society. It's unsatisfying enough on its own, but even more so as the bookend for an entire franchise that spans dozens of games.</p><p dir="ltr">Making matters worse is the unfulfilled promise of Mega Man Legends 3. The anticipated sequel was teased by Capcom in 2010, closely coinciding with the departure of series co-creator Keiji Inafune. Capcom's plans for Legends 3 included an ambitious idea to invite fans into the development process, soliciting feedback from the community. The company announced it would release a "Prototype Version" on the 3DS eShop, to act as a prologue. This was remarkable for the time, as early access was not yet an industry standard.</p><p dir="ltr">But as the months went on and no Prototype Version released, fans began to suspect that the project had been canceled. Capcom confirmed this in July 2011, announcing that there would be no Mega Man Legends 3 or even Prototype Version released at all, despite <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/adapt-japanese-game-english-voiceovers/" rel="nofollow ">later reports</a> that the demo was nearly completed. And in a PR misstep that would live in infamy for Mega Man fans, Capcom's UK Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/CapcomEurope/status/93558391309471744" rel="nofollow ">appeared to blame the cancellation</a> on a lack of fan involvement. A later tweet <a href="https://x.com/CapcomEurope/status/93940828984193024" rel="nofollow ">clarified</a> that it meant to refer to a lack of interaction in the online "Development Rooms" Capcom had made, not fan support more broadly. Inafune, for his part, <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/keiji-inafune-still-like-make-mega-man-legends-3/" rel="nofollow ">expressed interest in making the game</a>, as an outside contractor with his own studio, as late as 2014.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Mega Man Legends exists now mostly in memory. Capcom has gladly capitalized in its history of Mega Man games with compilations of almost every series. The Legacy Collections have now compiled the classic, Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX, and Mega Man Battle Network series, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-star-force-legacy-collection-coming-in-2026/1100-6534729/">Mega Man Star Force collection</a> coming in 2026. Once that releases, every Mega Man series will be readily accessible on modern platforms--except Mega Man Legends. Those games, first released on PlayStation, have remained stuck in that generation, aside from a PSP port.</p><p dir="ltr">And so Mega Man Legends has become a symbol of unfulfilled potential. The series charted a new path forward for the classic character, reinventing him as an anime-styled adventurer with deep lore and a wide cast of lovable, memorable characters. But for all of its promise, it's also the Mega Man series that has received the least games: two in the main series and the quirky minigame spin-off The Misadventures of Tron Bonne. It's become a sore spot for Mega Man fans, even as the series has received new entries like the well-received Mega Man 11. For fans of Mega Man Legends, we're all up there with Volnutt, Yuna, and Sera: waiting for a rescue, and a resolution, that will never come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over recent weeks, we've seen new releases for a whole host of <em>Warhammer 40K</em>&nbsp;Space Marine chapters, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-white-scars-combat-patrol-review-ride-wind" rel="nofollow">White Scars</a> with their new Combat Patrol and First Company Captain miniature, and my personal chapter, the Raven Guard, who got the same treatment. But now, it's time for the <em>40K</em> poster boys to upgrade, and we see a whole host of new miniatures for the Ultramarines, and a brand new Terminator boxed set.</p>

<p>We've been covering <i>Warhammer 40K</i> for a while on the site, and you can check out our full <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-40k-guide" rel="nofollow">Warhammer 40K Guide</a>, or our preview for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-leviathan-first-look" rel="nofollow">Leviathan box</a> that launched the latest edition of the rules.</p>




<h2>All The Terminators, All The Time</h2>

<p>Before we get into the Ultramarines releases, hitting shelves at the same time is the new Crux Terminatus Battleforce. This boxed set is made up entirely of Space Marine Terminators. These Space Marines wear Tactical Dreadnought Armor and are even more durable than normal Space Marines. Most chapters (those that conform to the Codex Astartes, more on that later) only let their 1st company wear Terminator armor, and that company is made up entirely of veterans who've proved their worth in combat.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Crux Terminatus Battleforce contains 18 Space Marine Terminator miniatures, and 11 are brand new to this boxed set and will be available separately at a later date.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-2.jpg?itok=GmGjJ611 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-2.jpg?itok=j53ih8uO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The box set contains:</p>

<ul><li>1x Captain in Terminator Armour&nbsp;</li>
	<li>1x Chaplain in Terminator Armour</li>
	<li>1x Ancient in Terminator Armour (brand new in this set)</li>
	<li>10x Assault Terminators (brand new in this set)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;5x&nbsp;Regular Terminators</li>
</ul><p>The new Assault Terminators can be armed with either thunder hammer and storm shields, which have low attacks, high strength, and high damage, plus an additional wound for the storm shield, or twin lightning claws, which have more attacks, a better to hit roll, but lower strength and damage than the thunder hammer option. Your choice will depend on what targets your force is going up against, but with 10 in the Battleforce, you can build a squad armed with 5 of each, or the whole 10 armed with the same loadout.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-3.jpg?itok=FHg2xLe_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-3.jpg?itok=GQs00ZWL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each of the 3 Terminator units the Crux Battleforce contains (if you build 3 squads of 5) can have one of the included characters lead it, giving it a benefit like the Captain, allowing them to reroll charge rolls, the Chaplain adding 1 to wound rolls the unit makes, and the Ancient boosting the objective control of the unit.</p>

<p>These Terminators are also available for any chapter, they just happen to be releasing alongside a swathe of other Ultramarines releases, and although the box art features an Ultramarines color-scheme, the included transfer sheet has decals for the&nbsp;Ultramarines, Salamanders, Imperial Fists, White Scars, and Raven Guard.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-4.jpg?itok=IAFvTOa2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-4.jpg?itok=jYpWGc1S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Are You Codex Compliant?</h2>

<p>The Ultramarines are the largest and considered the most organised of the Space Marine chapters. As a legion of the founding Space Marines, their Primarch wrote the book on Space Marine organisation and methods of war, the Codex Astartes. They strictly adhere to this doctrine, where some other chapters might see it as guidance.</p>

<p>To bring war to the enemies of the Emperor, the Chapter Master of the Ultramarines gets a brand new miniature, along with his personal guard, the Victrix Honour Guard. You might have seen Marneus Calgar and his Honour Guard from that moment in <em>Space Marine 2</em> where he drops from the ramp of a Thunderhawk Gunship to save Titus in a cinematically epic scene.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-6.jpg?itok=QU3o60PL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-6.jpg?itok=KdK3JCLx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This version of Marneus comes wearing the&nbsp;Armour of Antilochus and carries the Gauntlets of Ultramar, which can be used at range or in close combat. He can also be attached to a terminator unit and deep strike onto the battlefield, and then allow that unit to shoot and charge in a turn in which they advance or fall back to keep the pressure on your opponent. This version also doesn't replace the Gravis armored version that comes with 2 Victrix Honour guard, and both are still valid for use.</p>

<p>We're also getting a new Victrix Honour Guard unit, which Marneus, or any other captain, can lead. These come in units of 3 or 6 and come armed with&nbsp;master-crafted bolt carbines and power axes. They also include options to build a Chapter Champion wielding twin-linked blades of honour and a Chapter Ancient (who carries an absolutely insane banner in true ostentatious Victrix Honour Guard style).</p>

<p>Accompanying the new Victrix release, they have a new Company Champion in&nbsp;Cato Sicarius. This already famous Space Marine hero now leads the Vixtrix Honour Guard, guarding the chapter's highest-ranking officers. Wielding the Talassarian Tempest Blade, which has three attack types (strike, sweep, and coup de grace). Cato deals with threats as they close, rather than waiting to defend his charges, and can join a unit of Victrix Honour Guard with Marnesu Calgar as well.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-5.jpg?itok=aheStdZN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-5.jpg?itok=mMr7NyQM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>And if your Ultramarines units need more pomp, the new Ultramarines Upgrades &amp; Transfers set includes 69 shoulder pads, helmets, and accessories. The shoulder pads come for a variety of different armor types, including Phobos, Tacticus, Gravis, Bladeguard Veterans, Aggressors, and Terminators. The included transfer sheet has 255 Ultramarine decals for a lot of unique variety (as long as it adheres to the Codex).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-7.jpg?itok=HNHrRAo0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-7.jpg?itok=TLJdolti 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Crux Terminatus Battleforce and Ultramarine Units Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>The new miniatures, especially those for the Ultramarines, look fantastic. Cato and the Victrix especially look like you would expect those who have excelled even beyond the 1st Company of veteran marines. It's also great to see the Assault Terminators, who've had rules and no new miniatures for a while. I'll be building mine all with lightnight claws in true Raven Guard style.</p>

<p>The new Marneus, Cato, and Victrix Honour Guard combine for a pretty devastating unit, which then makes it incredibly difficult to shift Marneus from. But attaching Marnus to a deep striking terminator unit, like those in the Crux Terminatus Battleforce, means he can deep strike far up the battlefield, and bring the pain right to the enemy.</p>

Well, I had some thoughts about the revisionist storytelling of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/20/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-lets-you-rewrite-the-worst-90s-star-trek/"><strong>Star Trek: Voyage – Across The Unknown</strong></a>, which lets you take different paths through the 90s Trek series story, and Amazon might have one of the first good uses for LLMs in video games, to create more interactive characters, starting with <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/amazon-luna-wants-to-take-over-family-gamenight-with-snoop-dogg-presiding-over-courtroom-chaos/">Courtroom Chaos starring Snoop Dogg</a></strong>. Yup, he’s basically Judge Judy for the relaunching Amazon Luna.</p>

<p>Rounding out the week, <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/what-we-played-jurassic-world-evolutions-3-pokemon-z-a-battlefield-6/">What We Played</a></strong> featured Jurassic World Evolutions 3, Pokémon Z-A &amp; Battlefield 6.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww </strong>has finally finished the story of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, switching down to story mode to get past the button mashing of combat and the more enjoyable environmental riddles. He also made a start on Cocoon and the Silent Hill 2 remake, the latter of which had monster much too early for his tastes. He just wanted to walk round in the fog.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up. Enjoy the weekend, and we’ll catch you for more gaming shenanigans next week!</p>

<p>Before we dive into what we're playing, let's quickly recap this week. First up, Masahiro Sakurai presented another hour-long Direct for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, and it was a doozy. We've <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-2-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">compiled all the major announcements in one place</a>, so be sure to check it out if you missed it.</p>
<p>Several big games have also been confirmed for Switch 2, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/system-shock">System Shock</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. But if your heart lies with Nintendo games, then you'll be pleased to know that the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-next-week-with-a-spooky-classic">heading to Nintendo Switch Online next week</a> - hooray!</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer<br></h2>
<p>It's still all about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">Ball x Pit</a> at the moment, and I'm thrilled that we're getting a Switch 2 version next week with a free upgrade for current owners. It's just such an addictive game, and I say this as someone who never got along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>. I can't put it down!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend, I will mostly be playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a>. However, since my friends keep telling me how bad the ending is, and the upcoming patch promises to fix that, I might have to slow down slightly so that I don't get to the bad ending before it gets fixed.</p>
<p>I will also be playing some games for awards judging that I'm doing! And maybe some Ball X Pit, because my friend who worked on it sent me a code, and maybe some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/regency_solitaire">Regency Solitaire</a>, because my friend who thinks I should play it sent me a code, and maybe some <strong>Sims 4</strong>, because I'm using it to map out a floor plan for something I'm working on. Also, it's my birthday, so... cake???</p>

<h2>Felix Sanchez, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This weekend I'm gonna be playing 1, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>: I've gotten into it again, and there's just so so much – one of the most impressive games of all time. 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/storyteller">Storyteller</a>: a game I only briefly tried out a month ago, but really want to jump back into, since the game's premise seemed really cool! And finally maaaaybe 3, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>: I bought it because of all the buzz, and might have a friend who's gonna do the same, so 2-player online roguelike beat 'em up might be on the menu!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It's time to dive into Ball X Pit and spend all weekend... probably playing Ball X Pit. If my addictive personality kicks in, then it's all over for other activities.</p>
<p>Though since I'm done with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> for the most part (until the DLC), it's back to finishing up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> too. Hopefully. Have a good one!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This weekend I'm hoping to spend some more time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+</a>. It's a beautifully odd thing from what I've seen so far, but I wonder how much it would appeal to people outside a very specific age bracket.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I still need to kick the final boss' behind in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> (I'm hoping upgrading my Elephant Bananza will make the final fight breezier), I want to get back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and I've played about 25 minutes of Final Fantasy Tactics. Lots to be getting on with! Have a good one, folks.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Finished up Star Wars Outlaws main campaign last Wednesday, so the weekend will be spent taking care of the extra “Pirate's Fortune” DLC mission. I must confess to very poor Hades 2 progression on the Olympus front, will continue to try hard(er). Some new physical Switch arrivals this week with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">Earthion</a> and Absolum getting some priority treatment.</p>
<p>UFO 50 report: 40 of 50 games played. The four games this week are all a treat, with Valbrace a particular highlight since it fixes my only issues with dungeon crawlers by providing action oriented combat. But Rakshasa’s death gamble, Star Waspyr’s power-up mechanic and the wild west meets Final Fantasy Grimstone are all on my favourites list.</p>
<p>Game of the week is <strong>Alentejo: The Tinto and The Ugly</strong>. It’s not often we get a Game Boy developed game made in Portugal, let alone a sequel! By the time you’re reading this I will be covering the game’s lunch party. Wish me luck, pardner’.</p>

<p>Yes, like many other games nowadays, this patch will apparently be adding some of the "things" discussed during the latest broadcast. We don't know the exact specifics, but when Nintendo shares the official patch notes, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>So, if you are picking up a physical copy, expect a download on release:<strong><br></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Masahiro Sakurai:</strong> "Some of the things I covered today will be implemented via a day one update, so be sure to download the update if you're planning to buy the physical version."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Previous Nintendo releases, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, have sometimes released day one updates to enable access to online play and activate certain features. It seems like this could be a <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000103774">similar update for Kirby Air Riders</a>, based on a translated message on its Japanese store page listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notice from the manufacturer</strong> "Update data is required to play via internet or local communication."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you missed the latest broadcast, be sure to check out our guide here on Nintendo Life. Some of the news included new modes, online play, gameplay details, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/kirby-air-riders-global-test-ride-demo-kicks-off-next-month">a global test ride demo</a>, and there were even some new amiibo revealed.</p>

<p>While there have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-insider-claims-that-halo-master-chief-collection-will-come-to-switch-2">rumours for some time now</a> about this iconic series being brought across to other console platforms, it's now official. And sure enough, the announcement has spawned all sorts of emotions and reactions across the gaming landscape.</p>
<p>On the Nintendo front, some fans online are already calling for the popular first-person shooter series to come to the Switch 2.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067utsqnx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>While there's no word from Xbox about this, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has issued a reminder about how Xbox is very much open to supporting the Switch 2 going forward, and how Microsoft's gaming division has already received "excellent support" from Nintendo.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say about this during a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776">recent chat with Famitsu</a>, according to a rough translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are making efforts to lower the barrier to entry for people to play our games through services like Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Game Pass. However, if there are people who want to play our games on the PlayStation 5 or the Nintendo Switch 2, we would love for them to play our games on those platforms. In that regard, we have received excellent support from both Sony Interactive Entertainment and Nintendo."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spencer has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/xbox-is-really-looking-forward-to-supporting-switch-2">previously mentioned this year</a> how the Xbox team is "really looking forward" to supporting the Switch 2, so now that Nintendo's new hybrid system has been released (and more developers are finally getting their hands on dev kits), maybe there will be more announcements going forward.</p>
<p>Xbox has also stated over the past year how it wants to bring more games to "more platforms", and even did a deal in 2023 to revive the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a> series on Nintendo devices. Last year, it also released titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pentiment">Pentiment</a> on the Switch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-nightmare-inspirations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast%E2%80%99s-nightmare-difficulty-is-inspired-by-alien-isolation-and-resident-evil-3.1334752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a blog post on Dying Light’s Pilgrim Outpost, Tymon Smektala, the franchise director at Techland, has expanded on everything coming to Dying Light: The Beast. The Techland veteran explained about the Call of the Beast challenge path, the New Game+ mechanics coming soon, and the new ‘Nightmare Mode’ that’s being added in the future.</p>



<p>In Tymon’s words, some elements of Nightmare Difficulty have been inspired by other games, namely Alien: Isolation and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-is-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving">Dying Light: The Beast is the Gift That Keeps on Giving</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a phenomenal open-world zombie game with plenty of meat on the bones, despite being born as a DLC for Dying Light 2: Stay Human. In a post on the Pilgrim Outpost, Tymon Smektala explained about everything else that’s in store for The Beast.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dev-blog-11-week-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the post</a> references Legend Levels, the Ray Tracing update for PC, and the collaboration with PUBG Mobile, one of the juiciest tidbits came from the discussion about Nightmare Mode.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re currently looking into each of our bosses to see how we can adjust their behaviors to make them more unpredictable. On top of that we’re also considering some neat tweaks to our Volatile enemies – these are just intentions, so I don’t want to promise too much, but we’re looking at games like Alien: Isolation or Resident Evil 3: Nemesis for inspiration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Nightmare Mode loop will be introduced <strong>after </strong>New Game+ and the Legend Levels update, and it’ll be more of an intelligent update than just making enemies stronger. That’s what Tymon has promised, anyway.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yes, enemies will do more damage and the game more demanding, but that isn’t the point on its own. We’d like to try a more realistic survival loop – so expect some new mechanics in that regard.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast players can participate in an ongoing challenge path that will run into 2026. Through this, users can unlock exclusive rewards for taking part in community challenges, the first of which required the player base to rack up 60 million sliced off limbs.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-responds-to-emiru-assault-%E2%80%98we-failed%E2%80%99.1334749/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, clips surfaced on social media showing Emiru, a popular streamer and cosplayer, being forcefully assaulted by a man at TwitchCon in San Diego. The content creator was approached by a man who grabbed her in an embrace and seemed to try to kiss her. In the clips that emerged, we saw a woeful response from event security, and in the days that followed, Twitch failed to address the incident.</p>



<p>Now, in a lengthy post, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has written about the incident involving Emiru and has stressed what is being done to improve things moving forward.</p>



<h2 id="h-it-means-a-lot-to-us">‘It Means a Lot to Us’</h2>



<p>Dan Clancy’s <a href="https://x.com/Twitch/status/1981825064904667169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response</a> to the Emiru assault situation was lengthy, but fans and other creators have already batted the statement down and attempted to kick back the ‘apology’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>First, I want to be upfront and take accountability for the security incident that occurred during Emiru’s Meet and Greet. It shouldn’t have happened and we take that very seriously. We failed, both in allowing it to occur, and in our response following. We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made. I apologize to Emiru for all that took place. </p>



<p>What are we doing moving forward? For Meet and Greets, we’ve begun a complete analysis of the incident that took place, as well as other issues that came to our attention after TwitchCon concluded. We’re examining everything, from how we do sign ups, to the layout, to increased security controls. </p>



<p>We’re also doing a comprehensive review of overall event safety and security, and will be making updates for future TwitchCons. While we won’t be sharing all security updates for privacy and safety reasons, we will keep our community informed about changes that directly impact attendees. </p>



<p>We have heard concerns about IRL streaming at TwitchCon. Twitch has evolved over the years, and IRL streaming is a part of Twitch. But, we need to ensure that TwitchCon meets the needs of a variety of participants. We will be reviewing how we handle IRL streaming at TwitchCon, and will have more to share soon. </p>



<p>Finally, we got clear feedback on accessibility across the event. We’re reviewing with our teams, including our production and venue staff, so that we’re better equipped for future events. </p>



<p>You put a lot of trust in us by attending TwitchCon, and we take our responsibility to keep you safe seriously. We know that TwitchCon means a lot to a lot of people, and it means a lot to us. Be on the lookout for more updates, and thanks for being a part of Twitch. </p>



<p>– Dan Clancy</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Users were quick to jump on Dan Clancy’s comments under the post on X (formerly Twitter), with some pointing out how much of a holistic failure TwitchCon was (and will likely continue to be).</p>



<p>One streamer wrote, ‘I must pathetically claim that I am EMBARRASSED to be a Twitch streamer.’ Another was quick to point out similar failings from Twitch: ‘And you’re only saying this because Emi’s a big streamer and there are a lot of eyes on this. How many smaller streamers have dealt with similar or worse but have had their complaints swept under the rug?’</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the run-up to the release of Black Ops 7, a point of contention for the community is around the innovation (or lack of) tied to Call of Duty: Warzone. The battle royale platform that was released in March 2020 has started to stagnate yet again, and fans are dropping off for alternate experiences, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6 ‘RedSec’ battle royale release.</p>



<p>In a recent blog and <a href="https://x.com/RavenSoftware/status/1981852213581381882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a>, Raven Software acknowledged that Warzone’s Resurgence experience is becoming stale and recognized that the Rebirth Island map is in dire need of a revitalization.</p>



<h2 id="h-too-little-too-late">Too Little, Too Late</h2>



<p>Many Warzone creators and diehard fans have stressed that Raven Software is making changes far too late, especially as the first season of Black Ops 7 will bring a new small-form Warzone map – <strong>Haven’s Hollow</strong>.</p>



<p>In any case, the team at Raven is desperate to refresh the Rebirth experience by tidying up the map:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve heard you loud and clear – Rebirth Island and the broader Resurgence experience have started to feel a bit stale.</p>



<p>So, to start, we’re delivering a full refresh to Rebirth Island in Season 02, which includes new POI updates, a cosmetic pass, and several other upgrades that improve flow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the launch of Haven’s Hollow, Raven Software will reintroduce a map rotation system, switching between Haven’s Hollow and Rebirth Island to keep things ‘fresh’.</p>



<p>It was promised that, in the coming weeks, a ‘deep dive on how (they) intend to deliver a higher frequency of updates’ will take place. It was confirmed that Warzone will receive balancing changes to alter the meta <strong>twice per season</strong>, and that from season two onwards, the competitive community will receive updated Ranked and Private Match mechanics.</p>



<p>All this will come before or during the launch of Avalon, the new Blackout-themed Warzone map landing during season two, several weeks after the launch of Black Ops 7 on November 14.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-playstation-exec-slams-live-service-games-repetitive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-playstation-exec-slams-live-service-games-%E2%80%98it%E2%80%99s-a-repetitive-action-engagement-device%E2%80%99.1334740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden went in against the company’s pivot to focusing on live-service games, which has yet to pay off. For several years, PlayStation’s studios have tried to produce a solid live-service game, but have mostly failed in their quest to do so.</p>



<p>Layden, who departed PlayStation in 2019 due to the creative direction the company was taking, recently criticized the live-service market, explaining how, in his eyes, live-service titles <strong>aren’t real games</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-again-and-again-and-again">Again and Again and Again</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/10/24/video-games/sony-playstation-online-multiplayer-live-service-struggles-concord-marathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Ringer</a>, a variety of indutstry names gave their two cents to answer the question, ‘Why can’t Sony make more multiplayer hits?’</p>



<p>One such name was Shawn Layden, a former PlayStation executive who was at the company for just short of a decade, who has fired shots at the live-service mission on PlayStation’s slate.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A live-service game to me isn’t really a game. It’s a repetitive action engagement device.</p>



<p>For me, a game—because of where I come from—means I need three things. I need a story, I need a character, and I need a world. And&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>,&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>&nbsp;have all three of those things. </p>



<p>If you’re doing a live-service game, you just need a repetitive action that most people can get their head around, an ability to communicate in that world with other like-minded people, and the player’s desire to do it again and again and again.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Layden went on to stress that every developer successful in the live-service space found the winning formula ‘five, six years ago’. There was a boom of sorts that saw games like Fortnite skyrocket in popularity, and since then, everyone with a multiplayer offering seems to have jumped on the seasonal operating model.</p>



<p>These days, it’s very rare to succeed with a new live-service game, Layden insists:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s like a mirage on the top of a sand dune. You pursue it. You can’t quite get there. Or if you do get there, what you brought to the party no one wants to play anyway.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think live-service games should be abandoned by developers in favor of an alternate operating model? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During the Halo World Championship event, the future of the Halo series was uncovered, including the imminent arrival of Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5. This marks a milestone moment, as it’s the first time in history that a Halo title has wound up on a PlayStation platform.</p>



<p>Those who have potentially never played a Halo game because of their platform of choice are now preparing to dive into the sci-fi shooter series. That’s all well and good, but when is Halo: Campaign Evolved coming to PS5?</p>



<p>Let’s find out about the release window.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-out">When is Halo: Campaign Evolved Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Halo is a legendary series that has been the face of Xbox for more than two decades. The franchise has been expanded over the years with a live-action television series, books, animated projects, and, of course, a hulking stack of major and minor games.</p>



<p>Next year, Halo will come to PlayStation for the first time. This was addressed by the PS team in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent blog post</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For nearly 25 years, Halo has offered players an epic sci-fi universe to explore, unforgettable characters to meet, and exhilarating gameplay to experience together. From large-scale battles to friendships formed over late-night co-op sessions, Halo has always been more than just a game – it’s about the players who’ve made it part of their lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the beginning, we wanted to build a world with stories and experiences that bring people together. And now, for the first time, PS5 players will get to be part of that journey too.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, there isn’t a release date for Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5, Xbox, or PC</strong>. It can be wishlisted on all these platforms, but aside from a window of ‘2026’, there are no further indications as to when Halo: Campaign Evolved will be released.</p>

                <p>Retro Games Limited just launched a new version of its miniature Commodore 64 home computer. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The C64 Mini - Black Edition</a> is a limited release that celebrates the talented developers who create modern Commodore games. The Black Edition comes preloaded with The C64 Mini's original 64-game lineup <em>and </em>25 modern titles, including all-time C64 greats like Sam's Journey and A Pig Quest.</p><p>The C64 Mini - Black Edition retails for $120 and is exclusive to Amazon in the United States. Amazon is "temporarily out of stock" on launch day (October 24), but you can still place an order. The original C64 Mini launched in 2018 with a $70 MSRP--you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/C64-Mini-not-machine-specific/dp/B07GMV1X1K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">grab one today from Amazon for only $51</a>. The substantial price hike is probably partially tied to economic changes and tariffs, but the inclusion of the modern games likely played a much larger role.</p><p>The vast majority of the new games--19 to be exact--are sold on itch.io by big Commodore 64 publishers, including <a href="https://psytronik.itch.io/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Psytronik</a> and <a href="https://www.protovision.games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Protovision</a>. Psytronik's games are usually five bucks or less, but titles published by Protovision tend to carry higher price tags. There are four preloaded Protovision games that would normally cost around $55 combined: <a href="https://protovision.itch.io/sams-journey" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sam's Journey</a> ($24), <a href="https://piggy18.itch.io/a-pig-quest" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Pig Quest</a> ($11.61), <a href="https://protovision.itch.io/mw-ultra" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MW Ultra</a> ($11), and <a href="https://protovision.itch.io/yeti-mountain" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yeti Mountain</a> ($9). These are among the most ambitious C64 games around. For instance, developer Knights of Bytes created over 2,000 screens for Sam's Journey's 30 extremely long levels. It's one of the best retro platformers I've ever played (it's also <a href="https://knightsofbytes.itch.io/samsjourney-nes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available on NES</a>). In short: The $50 price increase seems more than reasonable.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4799" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="Commodore 64 Mini (C64 Black Edition)" data-collection="" title="Commodore 64 Mini (C64 Black Edition)">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific\/dp\/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20">The C64 Mini - Black Edition (89 Games)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific\/dp\/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$120 | Available Now</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Black Edition comes with the same items as the original: The C64 Mini computer, a classic USB joystick, USB power cable, HDMI cable, and instruction manual. Like numerous other mini consoles, it doesn't come with an AC adapter, but basically any USB brick will work. Or you can just power it through one of the USB ports on your TV.</p><p>The C64 Mini is approximately half the size of the original Commodore 64 computer. The "keyboard" is decorative--none of the mini home computers have functioning keyboards. But if you want to use the BASIC interpreter to write your own programs and/or boot games you add to The C64 Mini via USB stick, you can plug just about any keyboard into the second USB port. You can also connect a second joystick for multiplayer. A solid, budget-friendly option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Trooper-Controller-not-machine-specific/dp/B07M5HYTZL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hyperkin Trooper</a> for around $18.</p><p>The C64 Mini displays games in 720p resolution in pixel perfect or original 4:3 aspect ratios. You can add scanlines (CRT filter) if you want to replicate the classic look. All preloaded games have four save slots, and you can save your progress at any point.</p><p>Here's the full list of modern Commodore 64 games included on The C64 Mini - Black Edition out of the box.

<p>With this in mind, the construction and management title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/factorio">Factorio</a> will be getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. This title was originally released on the Switch in 2022, and the Switch 2 version will be a free upgrade for existing owners.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The price for this upgrade will be... free. We don't believe paying for a technical upgrade is reasonable."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't already own the game, there'll be a paid bundle which includes the game and the Switch 2 Edition upgrade. Here are the features you can expect from this upgraded edition for Switch 2:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067utsqnx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Better resolution. The game will run on the screen's native 1080p resolution instead of 720p. When docked, it supports all resolutions, including 2160p (4K).</em></li>
<li><em>Variable refresh rate support for the console's screen.</em></li>

<p>Along with this, it's also been confirmed <strong><a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Space_Age">Factorio: Space Age</a></strong> is on its way to the Switch 2, as DLC for $35 (or the regional equivalent).

            <title><![CDATA[Full Metal Schoolgirl Review]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">First impressions matter, right? Full Metal Schoolgirl throws you into its third-person shooter action shortly after a blazing fast anime-inspired opening to the tune of a J-rock banger. It immediately establishes its irreverent attitude and goofy anti-capitalist satire in a futuristic world where robots are exploited and referred to as "the working dead" – and with the goal of taking down a CEO villain, I thought to myself, "Hell yeah." But about halfway through a second run of this roguelike, it dawned on me that there just wasn't much to Full Metal Schoolgirl; it’s a dull and repetitive shooter whose gameplay foundations aren't quite good enough to save it from the largely tedious, unrewarding grind up its 100-floor tower.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Full Metal Schoolgirl - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the intro sequence where you break into the evil Maternal Jobz Corporation, you choose to play as Ryoko or Akemi, two cyborg anime girls who are functionally and aesthetically human – the one you pick winds up being the lead character and the other gets captured and plays into the story as you progress. They're seeking revenge on the company and its CEO for working their dad to death, and the story's initial disdain for corporate bullshit is sharp in a way that reminded me of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review"><u>Hi-Fi Rush</u></a>. However, that's as far as it goes before things devolve into annoying quips and no real intrigue to motivate each run; like most parts of Full Metal Schoolgirl, it doesn't build on its good ideas and its shallow execution on them wears thin rather quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have a high tolerance for anime tropes, and here, it teeters between charming and eyerolling, and more frequently leans toward the latter. It's not just for its crass innuendos, but also in its incessant yapping that doesn't exude any memorable personality into its interesting premise. I'm not here to handwave the attention drawn to upskirts or the creepy actions of the doctor who upgrades your skills, either – it's just unnecessary. The moments its tropes really do work are at the very beginning and the very end, and it's as if everything in between was overlooked in the process, which is where you'll spend most of your time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Once you've given Full Metal Schoolgirl a couple runs, you've pretty much seen it all.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each floor is made up of a series of narrow hallways filled with enemy fodder alongside environmental hazards, as well as square office building rooms that function as small combat arenas. The latter throws optional challenges at you like clearing the room within a time limit or without using heals for extra money for upgrades. But this overall formula does not fundamentally change across its 100 procedurally generated floors. The scenery may change slightly for each block of floors, yet the structure stays the same. While they may throw different enemy types at you like drones, bomb-strapped robots, turrets, and mechanized dogs, no amount of mixing and matching them can make up for mediocre implementation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to see how the procedural generation clashes with itself when certain doors lead to a completely empty room or the combat challenge prompts just don't align with the way encounters are set up. This haphazard level design feels very basic at best and frustratingly messy at worst, and it persists through the large majority of the 14 hours I put into finishing the campaign. Boss fights act as endcaps to blocks of floors, and while they're relatively refreshing after blasting through the same areas over and over again, their attack patterns are quite telegraphed and simple to overcome. Still, I'll take dodging area-of-effect explosions and dumping my ultimates (or Punishment attacks, as it's called) into a spongy boss over thoughtlessly repeating identical floors of enemies, so I do wish these kinds of battles weren't so few and far between.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Defeating a boss grants you a key to start a subsequent run at their floor, which is a godsend to cut through the needless repetition – but, they're one-time-use. If a run goes sideways after using the key and you don't defeat the next boss 20-something floors up for the next key, get ready to start at a much lower level, buddy. While this raises the stakes, as any roguelike worth its salt should do, the disappointment of having to trudge through the most boring parts to make it back to where you left off doesn’t feel worth it. Even though it gets easier on account of upgrading your stats and abilities from the materials and money you earn from each run, ascending chunks of floors still takes a lot of time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was excited that this is an anime-style shooter at least, which is something I've been seeking since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/freedom-wars-remastered-hands-on-preserving-the-vita-classic-as-you-remember-it">Freedom Wars</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/03/sword-art-online-fatal-bullet-review">Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet</a> (which didn't quite capitalize on the premise). More often than not, playing through Full Metal Schoolgirl felt like a chore, but I can appreciate the mindless fun its mechanics sometimes offer. With a handful of specific guns and melee weapons I vibed with, I was able to get into a groove, turn my brain off, and just mow down mobs of enemies. Although most guns are pretty counterintuitive for the way encounters are designed, a high-level electric chaingun or chunky plasma ball launcher carry the right kind of weight and feedback you want from a shooter. That said, movement itself is a little too sticky for this style of game, especially when there are annoying platforming sections. And melee attacks and jumps are a tad unresponsive, even if cutting through a crowd with a katana's dash attack or the Labrys axe's aftershocks can be satisfying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's moments like these that started to shine though more frequently in the final chunk of floors. The rate at which genuinely challenging encounters presented themselves, and the confluence of weapons that were fun to use showed up, let Full Metal Schoolgirl finish on a higher note than the absolute slog it took to get there. It didn't exactly flip the script or break away from the conventions established at the start, but it began to make the most of its basic pieces by throwing almost everything at you at a brisk pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I progressed, I naturally figured out which types of guns worked for me – slow shotguns and rifles never made sense to use, but a strong SMG that'd overheat quickly became a favorite. Learning to manage my energy meter for big axe combos, dodging, and hoverdashing became more important in the late game. And weaving in your auto-attack drone (which you summon on a cooldown) was key to salvaging a few runs. Being smart with the scarce battery supply (which is your healing item) factored into how I approached combat as well. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's 10 Favorite Roguelike/lite Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rarity of gear you're rewarded with from challenge rooms is random, which leads to moments of pointlessness where I'd clear a challenge room only to be met with common level rarity items that pale in comparison to rare and legendary gear from much earlier floors. At least this makes the modifiers meaningful as they can affect how your health, energy, movement, and damage output works, especially when the shields you equip have a sizable impact on your survivability.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Once you've given Full Metal Schoolgirl a couple runs, you've pretty much seen it all. There are decent ideas with potential that meld the shooter genre and roguelike framework well – it's unfortunate that they get squandered by foundational shortcomings. Whether it be a misunderstanding of what makes the genre work or an intentionally derivative take on roguelike games, the loop it creates is woefully repetitive with boring level design. Although I found some mindless fun since its fundamental gameplay is decent and shines a bit brighter towards the very end, it's certainly not good enough to redeem this monotonous shooter. The anime-inspired charm wears thin as its tropes quickly become annoying, even if its premise shows promise. I got into a groove in its final hour as I ascended the last floors with gear and upgrades that were fun to use, but the climb to get there wasn't exactly worth the slog.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/full-metal-schoolgirl-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-pro-with-anc-are-going-for-pennies-now-3x-cheaper-than-the-airpods-max-2000638986</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/airpods-pro-with-anc-are-going-for-pennies-now-3x-cheaper-than-the-airpods-max.1334653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The AirPods Pro 2 are still Apple’s flagship earbuds and they sit just one generation behind the recently released Pro 3. Here’s the thing though: the improvements between these two generations are incremental at best and definitely don’t justify paying 30 percent more for the newer model. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">you can grab the AirPods Pro 2 for just $169, down from their usual $249 price tag</a>. That’s<strong> an all-time low on Amazon</strong> and makes these earbuds three times cheaper than Apple’s over-ear AirPods Max headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The first reason listeners are drawn to AirPods Pro 2 is that they fix the problem with listening to audio in noisy settings in the first place. <strong>Noise cancellation in these AirPods is made possible with Apple’s own H2 chip</strong>&nbsp;where it picks up background noise using external microphones and generates anti-noise that effectively cancels it out before it hits your eardrums. The end result is incredibly quiet background noise so that listeners can enjoy their audio with the volume turned down to safe levels rather than competing with background noise.</p>



<h2>Advanced Audio Technology for a Fraction of the Price</h2>
<p>The custom-built driver in each earbud produces<strong> high-fidelity sound with rich bass response</strong>, clear treble, and balanced midrange frequencies that bring out the details in your music. Apple’s Adaptive EQ continuously adjusts the sound profile based on how the earbuds fit in your specific ear shape, which means you get consistent audio quality even if the buds shift slightly during movement. This real-time tuning happens automatically in the background, so you never have to fiddle with manual EQ settings or worry about suboptimal sound. The <strong>personalized spatial audio feature creates an immersive three-dimensional soundstage</strong> that makes audio feel like it’s coming from all around you rather than just two points inside your ears.</p>



<p>The <strong>transparency mode</strong> is one such feature that totally unites the manner in which you use your wireless earbuds in your daily life. You no longer need to physically take out your earbuds every time someone is talking to you or if it is an announcement that you need to pay attention to; rather, with the transparency mode, all you need to do is press the stem, in which case you can immediately understand what is happening around you without having to stop the musical playback in the background, thanks to the external microphones that allow background sounds to seep in while keeping the volume low so that it doesn’t completely pause the playback.</p>
<p>The<strong> hearing aid function is a true innovation</strong> that is more than just an ordinary consumer audio device feature. Following a basic hearing test done by using the app in partnership with the AirPods Pro 2, it is possible to amplify certain frequencies according to your own hearing needs, thus serving as an authentic hearing aid for mild to moderate hearing loss using a clinical-grade level device for the true benefit derived from its usage.</p>
<p>Listening time with the battery is almost six hours with active noise cancellation on, and then<strong> the charging case gives multiple charges for a total playback time of almost 30 hours combined</strong>. The use of USB-C is also a big improvement since it is compatible with charging any other Apple device such as the new iPhone 15 series, iPad, MacBook, and also AirPods with just one cord, thus eliminating cords on your desk or in your backpack. Also, the <strong>charging case is compatible with any Qi-certified charging pad</strong>, plus it is also compatible with the new MagSafe charging devices.</p>
<p>At $169, AirPods Pro 2 provides the essential high-end benefits one would want in a daily listening experience at an affordable price.</p>

                <p>For years, Netflix has told investors that it's serious about investing in the video game industry. But the streamer's ambitions may need to be re-calibrated again. Boss Fight--the studio behind Netflix's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/squid-game-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-652368">Squid Game: Unleashed</a> mobile game--has been shut down.</p><p>David Rippy, the CEO and co-founder of Boss Fight, shared the news on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7387225251513827328/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his LinkedIn page</a>, and shared his gratitude for the experience:</p><p>"Thanks, everyone who reached out today," wrote Rippy. "Rough news, for sure, but I'm very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I'm very proud of, including Squid Game Unleashed, which hit #1 in 26 countries. You'll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles--they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me--we're going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there's anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise."</p><p>Last summer, Netflix co-CEO, president, and director Greg Peter indicated that the streamer was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-to-ramp-up-investment-in-gaming-as-company-addresses-further-monetization-possibilities/1100-6533263/" data-ref-id="1100-6533263">going to "ramp up" its investment in gaming</a> in part to explore new monetization options.

However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">that game and the studio behind it were closed</a> in 2024. Netflix gaming executive Alain Tascan later told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">Bloomberg</a> why the streamer pulled the plug on that project.</p><p>"I don't want this move to be seen as, 'We're not going to do big ambitious games,'" said Tascan. "It was just the genre of the game... I don't think was matching the platform. This team was really good at what they were doing, but we wouldn't have been the best partner for them to express their skills and their expertise."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-2tb-laptop-is-75-off-on-amazon-dell-quietly-drops-2700-from-the-original-price-2000638980</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-2tb-laptop-is-75-off-on-amazon-dell-quietly-drops-2-700-from-the-original-price.1334641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell laptops typically sit in the premium tier where you’re paying extra for build quality and brand reputation. But every once in a while, the pricing gods smile upon us and something wild happens. Right now, you can grab a fully loaded <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5000/">Dell Inspiron with Windows 11 Pro, a massive 2TB SSD, and 64GB of RAM for just $959, down from its usual $3,699 price tag</a>. That’s a $2,740 discount which makes this the<strong> steepest markdown on any Windows 11 Pro laptop currently available on Amazon</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5000/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The configuration here is impressive for anyone who needs serious computing power without compromise: That 64GB of RAM is overkill for casual browsing, sure, but if you’re running virtual machines, editing 4K video footage, juggling dozens of browser tabs while running Adobe Creative Suite, or compiling code, this amount of memory transforms your workflow. You can <strong>keep everything open simultaneously without that dreaded slowdown</strong> when your system starts swapping to disk. The 2TB solid-state drive gives you enough room to store your entire photo library and still have breathing room left over.</p>
<h2>Professional Power That Doesn’t Break the Budget</h2>
<p>The Ryzen 7 7730U processor found in this laptop is an <strong>AMD Zen 3 processor with a boost speed of 4.5 GHz</strong> if the need arises for more power. With eight cores and sixteen threads, it is a multitasking beast with enough power for content generation and even some gaming in between tasks if the need arises. The Ryzen 7 7730U is optimized for performance with power savings in mind, so if your need for it is something that doesn’t require it to be plugged in for extended periods, then it is possible to use it for an extended period without checking the percentage meter like it is a ticking time bomb.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch touchscreen display has Full HD capabilities with 1920×1080 pixels</strong>, and provides sharp text rendering and picture quality minus the power consumption associated with high-resolution screens. The <em>Wide Viewing Angle</em> feature ensures that the displayed color remains accurate even if the screen is being viewed from an angle, particularly useful during presentation setups where multiple viewers congregate around the screen, making it easier for others to view what is being showcased on the screen. Having an <strong>anti-glare screen</strong> is indeed a welcome feature if your work environment is near a window or under bright office lighting, where it becomes possible to view the screen without the botheration posed by overwhelming reflections.</p>



<p>Windows 11 Pro is an improvement over the last edition in terms of the benefits it offers for professional usage. You enjoy <em>BitLocker</em>-protected storage for secure storage of your files, the ability to connect to other computers using Remote Desktop, allowing access from any location, and joining a domain if you’re connecting from your company’s network. With the “Pro” version Off Windows 11, you have more flexibility with Windows Update so you can delay feature updates so that it doesn’t restart in the middle of a critical operation.</p>
<p>Dell also bundles a comprehensive accessory package with its laptop which actually provides value addition rather than mere inflation in the box. You can expect to get a <strong>stylus pen for operating the touchscreen display, a camera privacy cover for those concerned with security, a 128GB USB storage drive for transferring files quickly, dust plugs for protecting the ports, a laptop sleeve, and even a microfiber cloth</strong> for cleaning the system.</p>
<p>At $959, it’s an historic low for a laptop with such specs coupled with the Windows 11 Pro license.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Obsidian Entertainment's latest role-playing game, The Outer Worlds 2, is here, and there's a lot to do in this new space-faring adventure. The planets you visit have bigger maps to run through, there are more weapons to use and modify, people to meet and talk to, and plenty more.</p>



<p>But there are five things that you should absolutely do first, right when you get off your ship, the Incognito, and touch down on the planet Eden and on Paradise Island. They'll make your playthrough run a lot smoother, and start you off on the right foot.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-guide-do-these-five-things-first">The Outer Worlds 2 Guide - Do These Five Things First</h2>



<h3 id="h-get-the-double-jump">Get the Double Jump</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Exploration is a key gameplay element in The Outer Worlds 2, and it becomes a lot easier once you unlock the ability to double jump, which you can do almost immediately when landing on Paradise Island. </p>



<p>It starts by finding Heull Chaundry, a down-on-his-luck Auntie's Choice businessman who was kicked out of the saloon in Fairfield for not being able to pay his tab. Speak to him, and start his sidequest. That'll put you on the path to discovering the P.A.L.E. Boots, which let you double jump.</p>



<p>If you don't speak to Heull or investigate where Ida Rutledge is hiding as you continue through the first major quest of getting into the Vox Relay, then you won't head to Spire Grove, where you can find the boots. Otherwise, you'll run through the whole game without being able to reach certain additional areas, and miss out on extra resources, weapons, armour pickups, etc.</p>



<h3 id="h-get-a-plasma-shock-biomass-weapon">Get a Plasma/Shock/Biomass Weapon</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Elemental damage is huge in The Outer Worlds 2. It's far more important to pay attention to weapons that have elemental damage than just their overall damage output. That's why you want to have one in your arsenal as soon as possible. </p>



<p>Whether you choose Shock, Plasma, or Biomass (though personally I'd recommend Shock or Plasma to start), your elemental damaging weapon will be the best weapon in your loadout and help you tear through combat encounters without issue, even when you're just starting out.</p>



<h3 id="h-grab-the-commando-perk-add-an-extra-holster">Grab the Commando Perk/Add an Extra Holster</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You can only choose so many perks on your way to level 30, which is as high as the levelling system goes in The Outer Worlds 2. You don't get to pick a new Perk with every level, so you have to really think carefully about which ones you choose.</p>



<p>Obviously, this is an RPG, and there's technically no wrong answer, but one of the first perks you should pick up, if not the first one, is Commando. It'll unlock a third holster in your loadout, letting you carry three weapons at a time instead of two.</p>



<p>If you don't want to pick Commando, you can still unlock that third weapon holster with the 'Extra Holster' helmet mod that's available at the first vendor you'll find in Fairfield. If you pick Commando and equip a helmet with the Extra Holster mod, you'll be able to carry four weapons at a time.</p>



<p>Whichever way you do it, you'll be far better off with at least three weapons on hand instead of two, since it leaves enough room for weapons with different ammo and damage types, giving you options in combat without having to dig through the menu to switch weapons mid-fight.</p>



<h3 id="h-buy-ammo-crafting-recipes">Buy Ammo Crafting Recipes</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You'll always be able to buy whatever ammo you need at vending machines and vendors in towns, but you might not always have a vending machine nearby when you need it. There might be a workbench, or you might have Niles in your party who is essentially a workbench on the go, but nowhere to buy ammo.</p>



<p>That's why you need to buy crafting recipes for different ammo types as soon as you see them. They should be the first things you buy, even before a new weapon or a new piece of armour. Crafting ammo is only possible if you have the recipe in the first place, so buy all the ammo crafting recipes for the starting ammo types once you make it to Fairfield. Also, as new ammo types appear the deeper into the game you get, make sure to grab those recipes as they become available.</p>



<h3 id="h-get-toxicity-draining-armour">Get Toxicity Draining Armour</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your Inhaler is the only method of healing you have while in the middle of a fight, even if you have swaths of food resources that can heal you. You can't eat mid-combat, so those resources can't help you. You have to use your Inhaler, but using it increases your toxicity levels.</p>



<p>Those levels decrease over time as the toxicity drains, but the time you wait can be the difference between surviving a fight or not, depending on if you're able to get to cover quickly.</p>



<p>Your toxicity can drain faster than the standard rate, and the easiest way to do that without putting points into skills and perks that'll help with your toxicity drain is by wearing armour that increases your toxicity drain. This is a feature you'll be able to find with certain helmets, and it's worth wearing them for this exact reason.</p>



<p>Also, it's worth it to get better armour in general. Your starting armour isn't very protective, and whether you buy it from the vendor in Fairfield or take it off a corpse, you'll want to grab new armour as soon as you can to help you survive.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Halo: Campaign Evolved Announced for 2026, Coming to Xbox Series, PC, and PlaySation 5]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5.1334605/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is keen to revive the Halo series for the current generation with an all-new take on the classic <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> for Xbox Series X|S, PC, Steam, and PlayStation 5 for the first time. The announcement of <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> marks a faithful and modernized remake of the original story rebuilt on a modern engine with high-definition visuals, updated cinematics and controls, and three brand-new prequel missions starring Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson. This new version of the game will also include a broader cache of weapons, vehicles, enemies, and gameplay-modifying Skulls - operational mods that can alter combat in challenging ways and increase replayability.</p>

<p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is exactly what its title suggests - focused on the original Halo campaign.
