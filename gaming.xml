But he doesn’t want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [49,687 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> team would respect his wishes.”</p><p>The original&nbsp;<em>Demon’s Souls</em> was also developed by FromSoftware. Miyazaki, speaking to Edge magazine in 2022 (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/miyazaki-says-elden-rings-graphics-team-felt-extra-pressure-due-to-demons-souls-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGC</a>), said that while he had not played the remake by Bluepoint Games, he was happy to see it renewed for a new generation—supporting Yoshida’s theory that <em>Bloodborne</em> may be a special case.</p><p>“As you say, I was not directly involved in it, and I haven’t actually played the <em>Demon’s</em> remake,” Miyazaki said at the time. “But this is because I just don’t enjoy playing the games that I’ve made in the past. It brings up a lot of old emotions, a lot of old memories, and this gets a little bit overwhelming, and it doesn’t feel like playing any more. So I have not played the <em>Demon’s</em> remake, but I am very glad to see it get this fresh look, these brand-new current-gen graphics.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“It was an old game, so to see it get remade in this way and have new players playing it was obviously something that made me very happy.</p><p>“It was a rough game back in the day, with a relatively rough development, so I was anxious that new players would not enjoy it in that same way. That was a cause of concern for me when it was re-released but, you know, in the end, I’m just happy to see the reaction and happy to see people enjoying it.</p><p>“One thing that was really fun was seeing [Bluepoint Games] come up with things we didn’t consider and to approach certain elements of the game its visuals and its mechanics in a way that we either couldn’t or didn’t back in the day. So to see them researching and applying these new thought processes and new techniques, this was something that was really exciting and interesting for me.”</p><p>Unrelated to Bluepoint Games, Brandon Sheffield, director at <em><a title="Games > Demonschool [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/demonschool">Demonschool</a></em> developer <a title="Companies > Necrosoft Games [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/necrosoft-games">Necrosoft Games</a>, said his studio also pitched a <em>Bloodborne</em>-related project to Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p><p>“I could find you 10 companies that have pitched a <em>Bloodborne</em> sequel, spinoff, or remake, including my own,” Sheffield said on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/post/3mfumxivzgc2t" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>. “It’s just not going to happen unless [FromSoftware] decides they want to do it.”</p><p><strong>Bluepoint’s Closure</strong></p><p>The <em>Bloodborne</em> pitch is a small part in a larger report surrounding Bluepoint Games’ closure. According to Bloomberg, following its acquisition by Sony Interactive Entertainment, Bluepoint Games continued its work assisting <a title="Companies > Santa Monica Studio [191 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/santa-monica-studio">Santa Monica Studio</a> on <em><a title="Games > God of War Ragnarok [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a></em>.</p><p>After 2022, the studio began work on a live-service game set in the <em><a title="Games > God of War (2018) [176 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-2018">God of War</a></em> universe, in which the character Atreus falls into Hades. A loose idea was for players to control different versions or aspects of Atreus as they battled through Greek hell, and to include some form of <a title="Genres > Co-Op [379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative game</a>play and ongoing support, but much of the game’s design was still in flux.</p><p>Bluepoint Games struggled to develop a live-service game, being a small team mostly skilled in art and engineering rather than design. Some Bluepoint Games staff wanted to work on a traditional <a title="Genres > Action [3,445 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> rather than a live-service project.</p><p>After several years of struggling development, even with help from Santa Monica Studio, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/sony-interactive-entertainment-cancels-live-service-games-from-bluepoint-games-and-bend-studio">canceled</a> the <em>God of War</em> live-service project in January 2025.</p><p>It was around then that, in searching for its next project, Bluepoint Games pitched a remake of <em>Bloodborne</em>. After that was turned down, it spent some time pitching an updated version of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, the <a title="Platforms > PS2 [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps2">PlayStation 2</a> game it had previously remade in 2018, but that was also turned down. It also pitched other studios under the Sony Interactive Entertainment umbrella about developing new projects in other franchises, such as a spin-off of <em><a title="Games > Ghost of Tsushima [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a></em>, but nothing was greenlit.</p><p>By February 2026, Bluepoint Games had gone more than a year without securing a new project. After Sony announced plans on February 12 to remake the original <em>God of War</em> trilogy without Bluepoint Games’ involvement, some employees at the studio grew uneasy. One week later, it was announced that the studio was shutting down.</p><p>According to people familiar with Sony Interactive Entertainment’s thinking, the company no longer believed Bluepoint Games was equipped to make its own game and was unable to find a partnership that made sense.</p><p>Recently, as Bluepoint Games’ former staff look for jobs—including opportunities to apply for positions at other studios within Sony Interactive Entertainment— other companies were making phone calls to see if there might be a way to salvage the studio, according to people familiar with the situation, as unlikely as the prospect may be.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/bloomberg-bluepoint-games-pitched-a-bloodborne-remake-but-was-turned-down]]></content:encoded>

<p>Well, Nintendo kindly sent one over to Nintendo Life Towers and we can confirm that it is indeed a Switch 2 Pro Controller — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">a pad we absolutely love</a> — now with some pleasantly subtle RE-detailing. What's not to like?</p>
<p>Back in the day, sure, we were <em>all about</em> the gorily OTT RE chainsaw controller for GameCube, but two decades on? We're a little more sophisticated than we used to be, perhaps. We don't <em>need</em> blood splatter over every prong of our pad, and this new one could sit on the side quite comfortably without alarming pets or family members.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at those little details, courtesy of our lovely video chap Alex, shall we? First, some close-ups, then a handful of moody shots that may well have been snapped in a Raccoon City warehouse! Or possibly Alex's garage:</p>


<p>Tasty, no? Itchy, right?...</p>
<p>If you're interested in seeing how it compares to the regular Pro Controller colour-wise (it <em>is</em> a little different), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hjhZXoQ8OhI">check out Alex's short below</a>, and our review of the non-Evil version.</p>
<p><em>Let us know below if you've picked up one of these pads.</em></p>

Clint, however…</span></p> <p><span>Clint is Pelican Town’s blacksmith, which means players (unfortunately) interact with him quite a bit. He has become quite a hated figure in the </span><i><span>Stardew</span></i><span> community over the years due to his creepy obsession with Emily, a different marriage candidate.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon is set to venture into a new generation following the reveal of Gen 10, Pokémon Winds and Waves, and, naturally, questions are emerging on whether players with a Nintendo Switch 1 will be able to play.</p>



<p>Revealed as part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Day, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the franchise, Pokémon Winds and Waves is the landmark tenth generation of the beloved franchise, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/game-freak/" id="95185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Freak</a> once again handling development.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for details on whether Winds and Waves will be available on the original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pokemon-winds-amp-waves-be-available-on-nintendo-switch-1">Will Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Be Available On Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New Gen. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Pokémon</strong> <strong>Winds and Waves will not be available on the original Nintendo Switch console, with confirmation already available that it won’t be on the old-gen console.</strong></p>



<p>This should not come as a surprise, as Pokémon Pokopia is also not available on the original Nintendo Switch, although it can be played online with a friend who has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> via the GameShare feature.</p>

</ul>



<p>By the time Pokémon Winds and Waves releases in 2027, Nintendo will be several years deep into the next generation of console, and the original Switch will be slowly eased out of releases. </p>



<p>As the year progresses, you should expect to see more and more games not available on the original Switch, as Nintendo jumps into the next era.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-will-pokemon-winds-amp-waves-be-available-on">What Platforms Will Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Be Available On?</h2>



<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>Company has announced that Pokémon</strong> <strong>Winds and Waves will be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, developed by Game Freak.</strong></p>



<p>Pokémon titles have largely always been exclusive to Nintendo platforms, with a few exceptions for mobile releases. As such, it’s not surprising to see Winds and Waves limited to Switch 2.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/free-pokemon-legends-z-a-update-reveals-mega-garchomp-z-at-pokemon-presents-2026/" id="180871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Finally Adds Mega Garchomp Z</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Further details on Pokémon Winds and Waves exclusivity status on Switch 2 are expected in the months ahead, with it expected that the system requirements of the game will be much more powerful than the original console could handle.</p>



<p>Pokémon had a shaky release with Scarlet and Violet, which did not perform well on the original Switch console at launch, and from what’s been shown from Winds and Waves so far, the performance demands are significantly higher.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bloodborne was just one of a number of projects Bluepoint had rejected before it was shuttered earlier this month.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bluepoint, the studio behind the successful Shadow of the Colossus and Demon's Souls remakes, reportedly pitched a Bloodborne remake last year that was rejected not by Sony, as many have thought, but by FromSoftware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Bloomberg report</a> discussing the reasons Bluepoint was shut down by Sony earlier this month. As Bloomberg shares, Bluepoint was working on a live-service God of War game following its acquisition by Sony and support work on God of War Ragnarok. The God of War game would have involved Atreus falling into Hades, and different "versions" of him battling through it with some kind of cooperative element.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea didn't really coalesce and Bluepoint, famous for more traditional action games, was a poor fit for the project, so it was canceled in January of 2025. The studio was encouraged to pitch other ideas, and the one that made the most sense was a remake of 2015's amazing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">IGN 9.1/10</a>, Bloodborne.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-bloodborne-state-of-play-no-show-leaves-fans-questioning-if-ps5-port-will-ever-happen">Fans have begged for a Bloodborne remake or sequel for years</a>, with all sorts of rumors cropping up that one might be in the works at any given time. Popular belief has been that Sony, as the IP owner, is what stands in the way of FromSoftware actually making one. But according to Bloomberg, that may not be the case. According to those working at the studio, they were told that while Sony was interested in a Bloodborne remake, FromSoftware was not, and the idea was scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne's status has long been in limbo with various individuals with ties to the project sharing conflicting thoughts on what can be made of it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">Back in 2024</a>, FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki said it was "not in my place" to talk about a Bloodborne remake because FromSoftware does not own the IP. He also told Eurogamer at the time that the game would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benefit from a release on modern hardware</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, the following year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory">PlayStation's Shuhei Yoshida offered a theory on KindaFunny</a> as to what was going on with Bloodborne that may match up with what happened to Bluepoint's pitch:</p><blockquote>Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing. And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</blockquote><blockquote>I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The question of why no one seems to want to hit such an obvious home run, or let someone like Bluepoint hit it for them, remains. FromSoftware is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-is-making-a-new-vampire-game-for-nintendo-switch-2-but-its-not-bloodborne-2">currently hard at work on The Duskbloods</a>, a similarly vampire-themed game exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2. As for Bluepoint, it reportedly went on to pitch other ideas, such as an updated Shadow of the Colossus and a spinoff of Ghost of Tsushima, before it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-games">tragically shut down by Sony</a>, with leaders believing the studio was not equipped to make its own game and was unable to find a sensible partnership. Per Bloomberg, some companies are currently in talks to see if they can save the studio and take it off Sony's hands, but no word yet as to how successful that might be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">You may have clicked into this review thinking, “A review of Under Night In-Birth 2 Sys:Celes? In the year of our Lord 2026?!” And you know what, that’s fair. This fighting game came out at the beginning of 2024, and it’s one that builds off a foundation laid by the 2012 original, which we also never reviewed<em>.</em> Well, I’ve decided better late than never, because Under Night In-Birth 2 is quite simply one of the best 2D fighters on the market right now – especially for fighting game fans that pine for the days of fast-paced anime fighters but with all the modern conveniences we’ve come to expect. It’s full of gorgeous pixel art and completely outlandish character designs alongside things like exceptional netcode and the ability to take control of a character during a replay, making its satisfyingly steep learning curve a joy to try and overcome, and its online play a staple of my fighting game rotation well past its initial launch.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Fighting Games</h3></p><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/Mitchell-IGN/lists/mitchells-favorite-fighting-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">For those completely unfamiliar, Under Night In-Birth (or just UNI for short) is the first wholly original series from Japanese developer French Bread, which was previously known mostly for Melty Blood, a 2D fighter based on the world and characters of the visual novel Tsukihime. The UNI games are four-button fighters with light, medium, and heavy attack buttons, as well as the Exs Action button, which has a number of uses ranging from short hops, to defensive shields, to meter management, etc. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s really cool about this fighting system at a basic level is that while most fighting games have a linear sort of logic to their combo system, allowing you to chain lights into mediums into heavies, UNI kind of just says “screw it, do what you want, it’ll work.” You can chain heavies into lights and lights into heavies, or convert big combos off of little pokes. Anytime you land any sort of touch in UNI, you can get big damage off of it, which is a very liberating feeling.</p><p>You can get big damage off any touch, which is a very liberating feeling.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also makes jumping into the shallow end of a new character very intuitive, even though they’re all <em>so </em>different from each other. I wouldn’t dare take a brand new character into online play and try to get by  using simple combos alone, but if all you’re going to do is play through Arcade mode or mash some buttons against a similarly skilled friend, UNI’s flexible fighting system makes it very easy to do so on a casual level without relying solely on auto-combos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t let any of that fool you into thinking UNI is easy, though. The game speed is lightning fast, its zoning can feel utterly oppressive if you don't know how to deal with it, and the mixups certain characters can do will make you feel like you just got utterly blended. You really need to make use of its many different mechanics to be able to fight on an even playing field, and learning those is going to take some time – and for the more casual fighting game fan, it may even feel a bit like homework.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the heart of UNI is the GRD system, and there’s really nothing else quite like it in the expansive world of 2D fighters. Basically, imagine it as a tug-of-war-style minigame that runs parallel to the actual fighting, with the winner being granted a pretty massive advantage for a limited amount of time. At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see a meter comprised of six diamonds on either side. You fill your side of the meter by moving forward, landing attacks, blocking, using the riskier (but more rewarding) shield block, and by holding down the Exs Action button to sit still and charge it up like you’re a Dragon Ball Z character raising your power level. You can also lose meter by moving backwards, getting hit, or having your own attacks blocked by the opponent’s shield block. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this push and pull is happening, a timer will continue to circle around the middle of the meter, and once it’s up, the person with more of that meter filled wins the minigame and will enter the Vorpal State. While in the Vorpal State, you deal 10% more damage and gain the ability to use a technique called Chain Shift, which allows you to cancel the recovery of any move – much like a Roman Cancel in the Guilty Gear series – and also convert some of your diamonds from the GRD meter into your EXS meter, which governs your ability to use super moves and EX special moves. </p><p>GRD is unusual, it's complicated, but it's also kind of brilliant. <span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unusual, it’s complicated, but it’s also kind of brilliant. It encourages aggressive play while equally rewarding skillful defense; it’s largely negligible at lower levels of play, so newcomers don’t even have to worry about it, while more skilled fighters must split their focus between attacking the opponent in front of them and consider how their actions affect the GRD meter. It also further encourages careful meter and resource management, which is something every great modern fighting game benefits from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love the way fighting games look these days; Arc System Works, in particular, does an incredible job of blending 3D characters in 2D environments and reaping the benefits of both dimensions. But  I’m also just a huge sucker for incredible 2D sprite art, and UNI’s characters rank up there among the best. Whether it’s the wild flowing hair and flailing limbs of Minerva, the lightning-fast speed and rapid slashes of Seth, or the hilariously gargantuan arms of Waldstein, the 24 characters (plus three more as paid DLC) of UNI2 absolutely brim with personality and flair. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/2026-02-27-10-00-44-3-1772215670346.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a big fan of rushdown characters, so Linne was the first one I gravitated towards, and I was initially taken aback by just how “rushdown” she actually was. Her run speed is incredibly fast, allowing her to close the distance from full screen in basically the blink of an eye. Even without learning her big damage combos, it’s a ton of fun to look for that slight opening to get in and then utterly blitzing my opponent with a fairly basic strike/throw gameplan. I’m at the point now where I definitely need to dig a little deeper into her moveset and find better ways to open people up, and fortunately, the teaching tools that UNI2 provides are stellar as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a mission mode that gives you a basic overview of how to play each character, along with a wide variety of combos that cover just about every situation you could imagine sorted by difficulty. You’ve got quick, low-hitting combos you can use from point-blank range, overhead combos, combos that come out of your farthest reaching poke, anti-air combos, corner combos, and better versions of previous combos that build upon what you’ve already learned to squeeze out just a bit more damage. Once you get all the way down to the bottom, that’s where you’ll learn the big damage combos that incorporate Chain Shifts, super moves, and other high level techniques. It’s pretty much everything you need to build a full game plan with a character, all packed within the actual game itself, which should be the standard for any modern fighting game. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The unfortunate thing for anyone looking to learn about these characters by playing through their story mode, however, is that you’re going to feel buried under a mountain of jargon and names that won’t mean anything to you if you didn’t play the previous games in the series. The world and lore of Under Night is extensive, and there’s no effort made in this version to catch new players up on what “The Hollow Night” is, what the heck “EXS” is, or even what an “In-Birth” means. You are getting dropped into the supposed final chapter of a story, after all. Still, some sort of index or compendium would have gone a long way toward making these otherwise fairly dry arcade mode stories a bit easier to follow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In general, UNI2 is lacking in content outside of its central modes. If you’re not a serious fighting game player who wants to grind online play and make use of its fantastic teaching tools to get better, there’s not going to be a ton here to hold your interest. Fortunately, if you <em>are </em>one of those people, UNI2 does have a feature that many AAA fighting games still don’t: Replay Takeover. While watching a replay, you’re able to take control of one of the characters at any point. This allows you to repeat something that gave you trouble in a match and try to find a way to learn from it. Like, for example, an offensive sequence that you got hit with that seemed air tight when you were in the moment – when you run it back, you might be able to find a spot where you could use an invincible reversal attack, or maybe your shield to push the opponent back far enough that their next attack wouldn’t have landed. Just like in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, and the scant few other fighting games that have this feature, it’s an absolute godsend when it comes to improving your matchup knowledge. </p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Under Night In-Birth 2 Sys:Celes is a 2D fighter for people who love 2D Fighters, myself included. It’s incredibly deep, has a rich and well-rounded roster with some of the coolest looking characters around, features excellent teaching tools to give you everything you need to improve, and even comes with replay takeover for the truly hardcore that intend to watch their matches back and learn from their mistakes. A lot of those excellent features (as well as its great rollback netcode) may go completely unnoticed for the more casual audience, and the lack of context in story mode will no doubt make newcomers feel lost without a flashlight when it comes to navigating it’s dense lore. But as far as the most important aspects of a 2D fighter go, Under Night In-Birth 2 ranks up there with the best of them.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/under-night-in-birth-2-sysceles-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is a new Bungie game upon us, and if its previously released Halo and Destiny games are any indication, it’d be quite silly to outright ignore it. I mention that because, unlike Halo and Destiny, understanding what Marathon is attempting to do in the shooter genre is tougher to parse (and easy to ignore as a result). It’s an extraction live-service shooter, a niche variant in a genre that a lot of people turn their noses up to by default. That’s all well and good (and understandable if you already know this isn’t for you), but if you’re interested in seeing what one of the industry’s best shooter-makers is doing in the extraction genre, which itself is on the rise thanks to games like Arc Raiders, I recommend checking out Marathon – for free! – via this weekend’s Server Slam.</p><p>Download the Marathon Server Slam Client and hop in. That’s what I did last night, and I’ll be honest, I really struggled to parse through its UI, menus, and in-game action, but the visual-audio experience of Marathon is worth checking out alone. It is a gorgeously mixed soundscape of alien sci-fi rumbles, instruments, and tech-based beeps and boops that sounds great in a headset. And visually, it’s one of the most distinct games I’ve played in some time. As for the gameplay itself, you drop into a map, collect as much valuable loot as possible, and exfil from the map to secure said loot and reap the rewards for doing so. Moment to moment, that means you’re going to be searching around cyberpunk-esque environments for things to scavenge while avoiding (or seeking out) enemy AI and other players for firefights that play out via Bungie’s best-in-class first-person shooting.</p><p>I’m not so sure that Marathon is shaping up to be Bungie’s next Halo or Destiny, but it is, at the very least, something unique, and I’m excited to see if this extraction shooter clicks into place as I play more over the weekend. If it doesn’t, well, at least the Server Slam is free.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/27/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-27]]></content:encoded>

That would hint at possible plans for Nintendo to bring more classic Pokémon games from the series’ GBA days to the Switch and Switch 2 libraries.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">According to a dataminer, the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen releases from today internally also have compatibility for Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald, meaning those could be coming in the future. <a href="https://t.co/MvdB0sJS7N">pic.twitter.com/MvdB0sJS7N</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2027442636810838416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/luigiblood.bsky.social/post/3mfu5wabxac2t">In a post on Bluesky</a>, LuigiBlood stated that they’d uncovered a few interesting tidbits about the new GBA Switch ports, including that the emulator in question is Sloop, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-advance-emulator-leak-p-1848809116">the same emulator Nintendo uses for the Game Boy Advance games</a> featured in the Nintendo Classics library, and that the ROMs have been “heavily modified and rebuilt.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Of course, that’s small potatoes compared to their biggest reported discovery. “The only other information I will put out is that the emulator explicitly recognizes ROMs of<em> Ruby</em>,<em> Sapphire</em> and <em>Emerald</em> alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-version-exclusives-switch-2-2000674027"><em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em></a>. I found this alongside the initialization code that is related to enabling emulator hacks for specific games.”</span></p>

 <p><span>If this is indeed correct, does this mean that ports of the third-gen </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games might be coming to the Nintendo Switch eShop in the near future? In a follow-up reply, LuigiBlood was quick to state that we shouldn’t be getting ahead of ourselves on that front. “What we see is a snapshot of current code at the moment it was built. It’s not an oracle. Maybe it means RSE is next, maybe it’s never actually happening. It just means they had intentions at one point and nothing else.”</span></p>

<p>WWE 2K26 features a stacked roster of top names from professional wrestling history. The Superstar overalls reflect that, as there are more than a dozen names who are rated over 90.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/gaming/story/_/id/48046034/wwe-2k26-ratings-reveal-rhea-ripley-stone-cold-steve-austin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">There was a ratings reveal on ESPN2</a> as part of the hype for the upcoming WWE Elimination Chamber event, and now we know the top 10 men and women in the game, all of whom exceed a rating of 90.</p>







<h2>WWE 2K26’s Top 10 Rated Men</h2>



<p>The men’s side of the top-ranked wrestlers in WWE 2K26 is interesting. Many of the names are just different variants of top wrestlers. There are plenty of wrestlers who take up multiple roster slots in modern WWE games, as each slot represents a different era of their career.</p>



<p>The top 10-rated men’s WWE Superstars feature 3 with a rating of 97, and they’re three of the top names in WWE history: Steve Austin, Roman Reigns ’22, and John Cena. Check out the full top 10 below:</p>

<p>The modern-day women’s roster in WWE is as stacked as it’s ever been. Names like Becky Lynch, Rhea Ripley, IYO SKY, Liv Morgan, and Charlotte Flair continue to redefine women’s wrestling.</p>



<p>Their respective ratings in this year’s video game reflect that, and Ripley is one of the only names who would make a top 10 overall list. Check out the full top 10 below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Rhea Ripley: 96</li>



<li>Becky Lynch: 94</li>



<li>Bianca Belair: 94</li>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-review</link>
            <guid>1449133</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Darkness falls.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">At the very outset of World of Warcraft’s Midnight expansion, we are summoned by an actual prayer to aid in repelling recurring big bad Xal'atath's invasion of the elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas. And while I'm all for starting out in medias res, this feels like a particularly hamfisted and contextless way to begin a story. It's almost disorienting at first, and I imagine even more so if you haven't watched the five or six pre-expansion cinematics Blizzard has released at this point. Thankfully, from that point onward, the 10 hours or so I've spent with Midnight so far have otherwise been delightful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riding into the reimagined elven capital of Silvermoon is one of those WoW moments I'm not going to forget for a long time. Its gleaming ivory spires towered above me as an excellent new musical theme that references multiple previous ones filled me with awe. The layout does feel a bit alienating sometimes while on the ground since it's clearly built for flying mounts, and I think there's a bit too much open space. But the level of detail is maybe the highest we've ever seen for an in-game city in WoW ever, with evocative interiors that interconnect in unexpected ways and invite exploration. My framerate has been less than stellar, though.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Expanding legacy areas like Murder Row into extensive subzones with a lot going on helps the city come alive. And I spent more than half my playtime so far without ever venturing outside the walls, excitedly completing every side quest. It's no secret that I'm a big "Thalassaboo," having been a fan of the elves of Quel'Thalas since Warcraft 2. And even the smaller, optional adventures in Silvermoon excellently immerse you in the decadence, pridefulness, and political maneuvering that characterize the city. As an Alliance player, I was also impressed with how much of it we get to explore – only about a quarter of it is off-limits to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the shining capital, Eversong Woods has also been reimagined gorgeously. It was already one of my favorite zones in the entire history of WoW, and to see it get such a glow-up, finally healed from the scars of Arthas' invasion all those years ago, is fantastic. The brewing story about the dangers of fanaticism hasn't completely gripped me yet. But Xal'atath's Voidstorm being held back by essentially a giant drain plug that won't last forever adds an ominous urgency to all of it. And I feel like I have a little bit more context now for who Xal is as a villain, thematically, though most of that comes from those out-of-game cutscenes I mentioned.</p><p>Eversong Woods has also been reimagined gorgeously.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played several different classes to level 80 in the pre-patch event, which included most of the class changes for Midnight, focusing on my trusty Marksmanship Hunter main and the new Devourer Demon Hunter that unlocks with the expansion. I'm not ready to pass judgement on any spec until I see how they play at max level in difficult content. But as far as Marksmanship goes, I mostly agree with the changes so far thematically. Aimed Shot should be a big nuke that takes a long time to cast. But with the removal of talents like Streamline, the damage needs to feel a lot chunkier than it currently does to earn that fantasy. Our final apex talent, which will give it a 100% critical chance at level 90, could be the answer. We'll see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as Devourer, I'm not sold on it quite yet. I like the other Demon Hunter specs quite a bit, but the flavor of Devourer is a bit more caster-coded than the melee monsters Demon Hunters have always been in the lore. Baseline abilities like Consume don't feel kinetic enough to me. They don't feel… Demon Hunter-y, if that makes sense. And it could just be an animation thing. I kind of wish Reap was our main button instead. But the mobility is there, and the mid-range DPS playstyle is interesting. Again, I'll report back on how it feels at max level.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft Early Access Housing Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since player housing, probably the biggest new feature of Midnight, launched way back in December, I've put well over 100 hours into it already. And while the decor I've seen after 10 hours with the expansion proper makes me think Blizzard was <em>really</em> holding out on us with the initial offerings, it's already become one of my main motivations to log in. The tools are very powerful when you learn how to use them, and I'm astounded and inspired to see what some people have done with them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, housing definitely shows that it's a first try in some places. The hotkeys to switch between editing your house and normal gameplay are kind of clunky and add too many steps to certain tasks. There are some common sense features missing, like being able to copy and paste a decoration or furniture item if I have another one in my storage. And it's neat that dyes can be made by other players, but currently I get frustrated previewing different colors on a piece, then having to make a shopping list and go all the way back to town to visit the auction house and buy the paints I want. I'd like for that process to be faster and have fewer steps.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Len Ranks All the WoW Expansions</h3><p>Every WoW expansion ranked best to worst. Dragonflight is not included since we won't really know for a couple years where it falls.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/LeanaVanadis/lists/len-ranks-all-the-wow-expansions" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Early Access period for Midnight is well underway as I'm writing this, Blizzard is also withholding quite a lot of key features for the start of the first proper season this time around. Not just raids and Mythic+, but even Heroic dungeons and Bountiful Delves are going to be gated off until March 17. That's a long time! It gives us plenty of space to level and see the pre-raid 12.0 story at our own pace, but if gear progression is your main thing and you're not currently subscribed, you could definitely hold off a couple more weeks because you're not going to have much to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'll be updating this review as I make my way through the story and try out a few different specs at max level, with a final score to come some time after Season 1 launches so I can get an idea for how the endgame feels this time around.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-review]]></content:encoded>

Amongst general sadness at the news amongst players, there was also a feeling that the studio would have been the one to (finally) do something with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, ideally a remake, considering Bluepoint's pedigree.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, according to a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>&nbsp;report, it turns out Bluepoint&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;pitch a Bloodborne remake in early 2025, but it was rejected by PlayStation due to FromSoftware's desires.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Crk_GpxGQE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Crk_GpxGQE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>says its sources told it that Bluepoint "was told that the numbers made sense [to remake Bloodborne] but FromSoftware didn't want it to happen." As the report notes, former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida theorized during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?si=kIez-r304hGEmfes"><em>Kinda Funny</em> interview last year</a> that FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki, who directed Bloodborne, was interested in remaking the 2015 action game himself but was too busy to do so; Yoshida said he "doesn't want anyone else to touch it" and that if that's true, he believes PlayStation would respect Miyazaki's wishes, even though PlayStation owns the Bloodborne IP.&nbsp;</p><p>As previously reported, Bluepoint was working on a live-service spinoff of Santa Monica Studios' <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/god-of-war">God of War</a> series (which recently got the side-scroller treatment in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta/fighting-in-the-shade-of-greater-games">God of War Sons of Sparta</a>). <em>Bloomberg </em>reports that Bluepoint's spinoff was a game in which Kratos' son, Atreus, one of the main protagonists of&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok/next-to-godliness" target="_blank">God of War Ragnarök</a>, fell into Hades (hell). "A loose idea was for players to control different versions or aspects of Atreus as they battled through Greek hell, and to have some sort of cooperative gameplay and ongoing support," the report reads. However, PlayStation canceled this project in January of 2025. Tasked with figuring out its next project, something PlayStation helped with, Bluepoint eventually pitched the aforementioned (rejected) Bloodborne remake.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>PlayStation</strong> fans and the rest of the video game industry are still reeling from the fact that <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong>, a long-running and beloved studio, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/">was <strong>shut down</strong> by <strong>Sony</strong> just last week</a>. It's another closure that is difficult to wrap your head around, but a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> has just shined a bit more light on how things broke down, and also revealed that Bluepoint had indeed pitched the game that everyone wanted them to make: a <strong>Bloodborne Remake</strong>. Only for it to get shut down by <strong>FromSoftware</strong>.</p>



<p>You're likely wondering how that even works, because while FromSoftware created and developed Bloodborne, <strong>Sony</strong> and PlayStation own the IP. They can, theoretically, do what they want with it, with or without FromSoftware's involvement. </p>



<p>Of course, the extra layers to this include the fact that no one would take any kind of Bloodborne project that didn't involve FromSoftware seriously, whether it was a remake, remaster, or a Bloodborne sequel, but if Sony wanted to try and tell players to kick rocks and make something Bloodborne related anyone, they could do it, on paper.</p>



<p>The other layer is something that Bloomberg's report notes that we heard from PlayStation veteran and video games industry icon, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/">Shuhei Yoshida</a></strong>. When his retirement went into effect at the beginning in 2025, the day after he was officially retired, he did an interview with Kinda Funny Games, during which he was asked about why nothing has ever been done about Bloodborne, despite it being one of the most beloved titles within PlayStation's portfolio.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/">Yoshida's theory</a> is that FromSoftware, and specifically its president, <strong>Hidetaka Miyazaki</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-port-miyazaki-not-opposed/">would not be against</a> bringing Bloodborne into the modern age with a native <strong>PS5</strong> port or a new <strong>PC</strong> version, but Miyazaki wants to be the one leading the project. He doesn't want another team to do it, he wants it to be a project that FromSoftware takes on.</p>



<p>"<em>I remember Miyazaki really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created," </em>Yoshida said<em>. "I think he is interested, but he's so successful and so busy that he cannot do it himself, but he doesn't want anyone else to touch it. That's my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish. That's my guess.</em>"</p>



<p>Today's report from Bloomberg seems to corroborate Yoshida's theory. After Bluepoint got the <strong>Demon's Souls Remake</strong> out the door and worked on <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> as a support studio, we know the team moved on to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/"><strong>God of War live service game</strong>,</a> one that the report adds some previously unknown info on.</p>



<p>It was reportedly going to feature <strong>Atreus</strong> falling into <strong>Hades</strong>, not as in Atreus would land in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/"><strong>Supergiant's</strong> beloved indie game,</a> as in it would bring Atreus out of the Norse setting and into the series' original Greek setting, featuring Atreus fighting his way through Hell. The game was supposed to have some kind of cooperative elements to it, but Bluepoint ultimately struggled to land on a game design and gameplay loop that could keep players engaged in the long-term way that is required in live service titles. It was then cancelled at the start of 2025.</p>



<p>It's at this point, according to Schreier's report, that Bluepoint pitched a Bloodborne Remake. Sony was reportedly on board with the idea, and it also wasn't the first time that Bluepoint had brought it up, which is arguably why we've been <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-remaster-sequel/">hearing rumours for years</a> that a Bloodborne Remaster/Remake project was on the way.</p>



<p>Once again though, the pitch was unsuccessful, as the report adds, "<em>the studio was told that the numbers made sense but <strong>FromSoftware didn't want it to happen, according to people familiar with the process</strong></em>."</p>



<p>So it seems like there's some weight to Yoshida's theory, or at least to the theory that either Miyazaki himself or FromSoftware as company will be the ones to make the call as to when a Bloodborne remaster/remake/sequel happens, if it happens at all.</p>



<p>The report adds that after the Bloodborne Remake was shut down once again, it tried to go back to the hits and pitched another version of <strong>Shadow of the Colossus</strong> that got rejected by Sony. Bluepoint tried pitching games in other Sony franchises as a way to still try and make something original, like a spin-off <strong>Ghost of Tsushima</strong> game, but ultimately nothing got through.</p>



<p>Then, when the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/">God of War Remake Trilogy</a></strong> was revealed, and Bluepoint knew it wouldn't be working on it, that seemed to signal to them that it was over. A week after that reveal, we learned that Bluepoint was getting shuttered. An upsetting end to an altogether upsetting story.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/" id="177979">Bluepoint Studio</a> was recently shut down by Sony. A new report sheds some light on the studio’s closure, including the desire to remake Bloodborne and why that didn’t come to fruition.</p>



<p>The new report comes from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier of Bloomberg.</a> It was noted that following the cancellation of the live-service God of War game in January 2025, Sony was working closely with the studio to determine their next project. Also in early 2025, there was a pitch to remake Bloodborne. However, while they were told the numbers made sense, people familiar with the situation stated that FromSoftware didn’t want it to happen.</p>

<p>The report also notes that Bluepoint pitched other PlayStation studios on developing new projects. One idea was a Ghost of Tsushima spinoff, but it was not approved. Other studios were said to be wary of allocating substantial resources to another team’s project, according to sources familiar with the situation.</p>



<p>It was also noted that when the God of War remake trilogy was announced without Bluepoint involved, some within the studio grew uneasy. One week later, it was announced that the studio was being shut down.</p>

              <p>For years, PlayStation fans have begged for a remake of<em> Bloodborne</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">Bluepoint Games</a>, the PlayStation studio behind the excellently received <em>Demon’s Souls</em> remake, seemed like the obvious candidate. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA">According to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the first-party team actually did pitch a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake not too long ago, but FromSoftware rejected the idea.</p> <p>In fact, many at Bluepoint had assumed for a long time <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-remake-bluepoint-demons-souls-ps5-sony-playstation-2000671988">that a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake was inevitable</a>. Then in 2025, after its <em>God of War</em> multiplayer project was cancelled, Bloomberg reports that the idea of the studio fielding such a remake was formally pitched within Sony. Unfortunately, FromSoftware wasn’t onboard. While Bluepoint scrambled to come up with other ideas, including a potential <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> spin-off, Sony never greenlit any of the other pitches.</p>

 <p><em>Bloomberg</em> doesn’t report exactly why FromSoftware rejected the pitch. The only real theory for why is one offered by former PlayStation Worldwide Studios executive Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-2-remake-remaster-miyazaki-sequel-1851741356">in an interview last year</a>. “I have only my personal theory to that situation,” he said in 2025. “I left first-party Sony so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is— because I remember Miyazaki really, really loved<em>&nbsp;Bloodborne</em>, what he created—and so I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy so he cannot do it himself, but he doesn’t want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish.”</p> <p>All of this suggests that a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake by FromSoftware itself could still happen at some point in the future, but that possibility is little consolation for fans who don’t want to see one of the last console generation’s best games locked away exclusively on PS4. It’s also of no use to the folks at Bluepoint who might have had their studio saved if their remake pitch had actually come together.</p>

 <p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, the ultimate reason for the studio’s closure was a loss of faith among the higher-ups at Sony that Bluepoint could still deliver a high-quality original game as it has once been tasked with. <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">The <em>God of War</em> live-service project</a> it had previously been working on would have reportedly featured Atreus navigating the underworld, but shift to co-op gameplay that never came together. Sony has moved forward with a remake of the original single-player trilogy, just without its best remake studio at the helm.</p>
