			<p>Developer FuturLab has released the final free content update for PowerWash Simulator as the team shifts all its focus to PowerWash Simulator 2.</p>
<p>PowerWash Simulator was released in early access in 2021, and shortly after leaving early access, it reached more than <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/powerwash-simulator-has-topped-3-million-players">3 million players</a>. Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/thank-you-for-17-million-powerwash-simulator-players">studio announced</a> that the game had reached more than 17 million players through game sales and its inclusion on services like PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>The game has featured multiple free and paid updates in the last four years, collaborating with major series like Shrek, Spongebob Squarepants, Wallace &amp; Gromit, and more. The last free update for the game, titled 'The Muckingham Files 6', is now available on all platforms, and adds two more jobs and locations for players to clean up.</p>

<p>"<em><span>Whether you’ve been busting the grime with us from early access, or hopped aboard the PowerWash hype train somewhere down the line, we’d love to say a huge thank you for enjoying this adventure with</span></em><span> us,</span>" FuturLab <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">writes in a blog post.</a></p>
<p>"<em><span>PowerWash Simulator has truly transformed FuturLab - it's helped us grow our team, evolve as a studio, and take on exciting new challenges. We’re endlessly grateful to every single player who’s supported our satisfying, sudsy adventure. You’ve made all of this possible. </span></em><span><em>And we’re not done yet! PowerWash Simulator 2 is bubbling away and will release later in 2025. With a bunch of brilliant new gnomes joining the FuturLab family, we’ve been able to level up the experience with fresh new and improved ways to play and spray in the sequel. We can’t wait to show you what’s next!</em>" </span></p>
<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and potentially Nintendo Switch 2, when it launches sometime later this year.</p>

            <p>A modder is asking for help resurrecting Borderlands Online, an MMO version of Gearbox's comedy gun-runner that only ever saw daylight in China. It was announced in 2014 and shut down in 2015 alongside development studio 2K China, but footage of the abandoned project appeared online earlier this year. Now, intrepid digital archaeologist EpicNNG is trying to overcome "thousands of errors" and restore the MMO to a playable state.</p><!--more-->
<p>You can hear about these mighty ventures in the latest update video, below. The build EpicNNG is working with "has been publicly available for the past 10 years", but was only recently discovered by another modder, Lewis, with the cautionary note that "a lot of the downloads were riddled with viruses". They've now confirmed that "we have got the full game" and "can get in eventually, it is just a matter of when".</p>

<p>That's providing, however, other people pitch in, and EpicNNG is concerned that Take-Two Interactive, 2K Games or Gearbox might block the project ahead of the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>. "God forbid that happens here, and this gets shut down, and I receive a cease and desist because we're taking away from the marketing of Borderlands 4," the video frets. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, we covered a Stop Killing Games survey which held that around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-of-games-with-online-requirements-are-doomed-according-to-stop-killing-games-survey">70% of games with online requirements are doomed</a>. Here's hoping this one returns from the abyss. It's the first I've heard of the Borderlands MMO, and while I've fallen off the series, I'm curious to see how the developers at 2K China reworked the fittings.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-an-earlier-release-date-as-accidentally-revealed-by-randy-pitchford">launches on 12th September</a>. Gearbox frontman Randy Pitchford has recently been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">saying daft things about it</a>. He does so love doing that.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-twitch-emote-artists-are-tackling-the-rise-of-ai-art.1201767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-emote-artists-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitch emotes are, essentially, the language of the Amazon-owned streaming platform. It’s become customary for streamers to provide unique emotes for their communities to use in chat, so much so that a secondary economy has been built up around Twitch. For years, Twitch emotes (and other stream art) has been a space for artists to make money from their work. Emote artists were in high demand during the pandemic, when more people took to Twitch; demand has slowed since then, but there’s something else threatening artists: the proliferation of AI art.</p><p>Generative AI art tools scrape publicly available art — be it illustrations or photos — to create images. That’s art theft, <a href="https://www.zhangjingna.com/blog/class-action-lawsuit-artists-v-stability-deviantart-midjourney-runway-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a group of artists suing AI companies like Stability AI, Midjourney, and others</a>. (Don’t forget <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the catastrophic environmental impact of AI, </a>too.) Twitch has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1h8me3p/twitchs_new_holiday_global_emote_is_ai_generated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused recently</a> of introducing AI-made global emote and category banners. While the emote hasn’t been confirmed as AI, some of the category banners are: You can find the images used on Adobe’s stock image page, where at least one, of a Corgi on a treadmill, <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/search?filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aphoto%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aillustration%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Azip_vector%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Avideo%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Atemplate%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3A3d%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aimage%5D=1&amp;k=corgi+on+treadmill&amp;order=relevance&amp;search_page=1&amp;search_type=usertyped&amp;acp=&amp;aco=corgi+on+treadmill&amp;get_facets=0&amp;asset_id=926933857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is most definitely AI</a>. Twitch has not responded to Aftermath’s request for comment.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Really glad the Fitness and Health category image was changed to an AI generated dog running on a backwards treadmill from Adobe Stock photos. Incredible move from Twitch. Very impressed. <a href="https://t.co/NR0WfQZy1J">pic.twitter.com/NR0WfQZy1J</a></p>— Pirate Software (@PirateSoftware) <a href="https://twitter.com/PirateSoftware/status/1924921642398220661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>The impact of AI on Twitch emote artists varies: some emote artists Aftermath spoke to said their communities value art, and that they haven’t seen a major impact. Others, <a href="https://x.com/Laghardra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like French artist Laghardra</a>, say their business is struggling. Laghardra said they have created more than 2,000 emotes for hundreds of different streamers, but that AI-generated art has slowed their business. “Unfortunately, over the past year, AI-generated emotes have flooded Twitch and sales platforms like Etsy and Ko-Fi,” they said. “You can now find packs of 50 emotes for less than €10, whereas the average price per emote from an artist is typically €15–18.”</p><p>Laghardra continued, “The offer is very appealing, and we simply can't compete. That's why, after six years in this profession, I can no longer make a living from it. My revenue has dropped significantly, and some of my former clients are now creating their own AI-generated emotes — even using mine as inspiration.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://x.com/PlurpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plurp</a>, another emote and YouTube thumbnail artist, said there has been a decrease in demand for emotes, but attributes it to the post-pandemic decrease of streaming in general, as well as an increase of bots on Twitter offering art and pushing out actual artists. Twitter has been a space for artists to connect with potential buyers, but Jay, <a href="https://x.com/jootics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an emote artist</a>, told Aftermath that AI has likely made these bot-based scammers' job much easier. "[Bots] are what make [an] artist's life hell," Jay said.</p><p>Several emote artists, <a href="https://vgen.co/NanaFromHell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including Nana Jiei</a>, said the VTubing community is propping up their businesses. “VTubers mainly do not support AI-generated images and I am very happy and thankful about that,” Jiei said. “My client-base is very keen when it comes to full customization of their emotes and would want them specifically tailor-made for them and their brands.” Still, Jiei is worried about Twitch emotes and art outside the VTubing community; people want “cheaper and fast mass-produced emotes done via the use of AI.”</p><p>Taya, an artist who works largely with VTubers, agreed: "The people that are using AI art were never my customers to begin with," she said. Taya said it's not even really about the money — her rates are so low that she's "undervaluing her time" to ensure people can have art. "These people have never had the care to support small artist[s] and give jobs to real people for their art because they don’t have the same level of passion as the people who do art and pay for art," Taya said.</p><p>Artists — and people committed to human artwork — are turning to marketplaces like <a href="https://vgen.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGen</a>, an art marketplace tailored specifically toward VTubers and streamers looking to commission art. The platform is specifically for human-made art; no generative AI is allowed on the platform. Artists are able to promote their work to people who value human-made art, and streamers can ensure they’re not getting something generated by AI — a little piece of art that can set a stream apart.</p><p>And if people are still turning elsewhere after being educated on AI use, some artists said a little shaming doesn't hurt. "I’d say that if you use AI emotes, the [artist] community will degrade you which will, in turn, push you to commission a real artist," <a href="https://x.com/artdragonz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an emote artist named Kat said</a>. Other artists emphasized this point, too, especially in the VTuber space.</p><p>“Emotes have real power and reach,” Lagharda said. “Tomorrow, you could gain 10 more viewers just because someone used a cool emote in another person’s chat. It’s amazing that such a small, complex piece of artwork can create that kind of effect.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs"><h3>Another Day, Another Round Of Layoffs At EA</h3></a><p>Black Panther is canceled, and workers (once again) suffer the consequences</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ushimitsu-gao-beastars"><h3>Ushimitsu Gao Is A Ghost Cuckold Romance Manga For Folks Who Defend Beastars (Me)</h3></a><p>Paru Itagaki let her freak flag fly with Beastars.

            <p>
Day one patches are the curse that comes with the modern age of video games because development doesn't end at the point of printing the discs we play them on any more. It sucks, it's bad for preservation, but we're stuck with them. However, it's also a bit funny that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, due out tomorrow, May 30th, sort of has a <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?">day minus one patch that's already available</a>. Of course, unless you're a journalist, YouTuber, or very friendly with your local video game store clerk who hooked you up with an early copy of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a>, this won't concern you for a good few hours yet.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The patch notes are also just incredibly useless. Here's the full list of them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved handling of playable characters</li>
<li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li>
<li>Text adjustments</li>
<li>Balance adjustments</li>
<li>Added character scenarios</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>
To be fair, the only one that might be of any interest to you or I are those new character scenarios, and the fun part about a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> game is discovering those sorts of things for yourself. Or, you know, watching a YouTube video explaining the lore to you because you're an adult with a soul crushing job and you don't have time to play and think about the games you're playing.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there's something more important that's related to Nightreign I want to draw your attention to: a trailer that genuinely, no word of a life, features Evanescence's Bring Me to Life. There is not a single part of my soul that understands how this could have come about, I'm just going to thank the universe that we're moving past considering the 2000s a time solely full of cringe.

If you've been wondering whether Elden Ring Nightreign is any good, well, that does depend on who you ask, but our own Nic had some slightly complicated feelings about it in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">review</a>.

I will have some in on Monday.”</p><p>Then the guy pinged Volkov back 10 minutes later. He actually had a guy with an extra Switch 2 on a flight that would be arriving much sooner. Would Volkov be interested? They settled on a price: roughly $800. Volkov conferred with his podcast mates before accepting. “I couldn’t believe I [was] really going to get the Switch 2 nine days before release, first in the world, that we’ll unpack it, unbox it,” he said. “Until I saw the box, until I touched it with my hands, I couldn’t believe that it’s real.”</p><p> Volkov immediately <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-menu-settings-firmware-day-one-patch-1851782656&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-menu-settings-firmware-day-one-patch-1851782656">started making videos</a></span>, which quickly disseminated throughout <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1kxeux6/nintendo_switch_2_leaked_first_boot/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1kxeux6/nintendo_switch_2_leaked_first_boot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a ravenous Nintendo fandom</a></span> on social media. He showed the setup sequence and its bespoke musical theme, as well as the system settings, including the existence of only two menu themes at launch: black and white. He also confirmed that no existing Switch 1 games could run on the new machine just yet. Due to a required day-one patch, and without access to <em>Mario Kart World</em> or another Switch 2 launch game cartridge to test, there’s not actually a whole lot you can do with the console right now. </p><p>After a flurry of bombshell leaks all but confirmed what the Switch 2 would look like ahead of its official reveal, Nintendo has been trying to keep the rest of the console’s launch on lockdown, to the point where reportedly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-day-one-patch-delay-nintendo-mario-kart-1851780793&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-day-one-patch-delay-nintendo-mario-kart-1851780793">not even most media and content creators will have access to the machine</a></span> to review it before it’s out.

Podcast cohosts Malykhin and Kolomiets point to the use of Indian and Turkish PSN accounts, prepaid cards from overseas, and even bank accounts set up in neighboring Kazakhstan as ways to bypass the various restrictions. HBO Max isn’t available in Russia, but they’re caught up on <em>The Last of Us</em> thanks to VPNs (season 1 was great but season 2 has had more ups and downs, they say).</p><p>Unlike some leakers, Volkov hasn’t tried to anonymize his identity. In fact, his face is the first thing that appears in the group’s initial pre-release Switch 2 unboxing, the YouTube comments for which were littered with people joking about “Nintendo Ninjas” being dispatched to disappear Volkov and the channel. “I thought about it first, like, ‘Whoa, what if they’re gonna, like, ban my Switch account?’” he said. He’s not planning on logging into the console with his existing account until June 5.</p><p> I mentioned the new provision that lets Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-brick-threat-homebrew-1851779895&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-brick-threat-homebrew-1851779895">brick anyone’s Switch 2 if they violate the company’s terms of service</a></span>. He didn’t seem worried. “I didn’t sign any NDAs. I bought this with my money. I bought, it I didn’t steal it or something like that. Also, Nintendo is from Japan, you know, and they don’t have any official shops in Russia anymore. They don’t have a jurisdiction in Russia.”</p><p>That’s no doubt part of why he ended up purchasing one for almost twice the sticker price from a guy on Telegram instead of at a store like he did with his original Nintendo Switch. The other, of course, was internet clout in a gaming culture that prizes being first more than most things, though Volkov, Malykhin, and Kolomiets claim the goal wasn’t to troll anyone. “It’s not like we want to show that, ‘Oh, we got a Switch 2, you didn’t get a Switch 2,” Volkov said. “No, we just want to show you, like, some content and show that even in Russia, we have a lot of sanctions, you know, a lot of big companies banned us, yeah, yeah, but we want to show all the world that Russia also has, like, just some guys that just want to play video games.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Real, lived experiences are some of the strongest influences in art.</p><p dir="ltr">It's AAPI Heritage Month--an annual reminder that Asian and Pacific Islander influences are worth celebrating. AAPI doesn't just include East Asian cultures like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, but a wide range of racial and ethnic groups including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-games-are-lagging-behind-in-south-asian-representation/1100-6503195/">South Asian</a> and Native Hawaiian. As a Filipino-American, I also fall under the AAPI umbrella.</p><p dir="ltr">While the term helps rally support and advocacy behind a large chunk of racial and ethnic groups, it can be difficult to define because of that broadness. Those who identify as AAPI often have the perspective of growing up abroad and either coming from a different country or being born to immigrant parents. That opens the door to a unique experience full of its own pros and cons, not quite fitting in with the people from your ethnic group but also not quite fitting in with the foreign culture your family is trying to assimilate into.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an experience that isn't easy to explain in just a few words, though some games manage to get the message across in impactful, meaningful ways. In the past few years, we've enjoyed games from AAPI developers such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/venba-review-tourist-to-your-own-culture/1900-6418096/">Venba</a>, 1000xResist, and Butterfly Soup--and those are just the start. Some of these games have AAPI developers directly at the helm and even sometimes feature stories about first- and second-generation AAPI characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of that, games like A Space From The Unbound from Indonesia and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-until-then-showcases-the-beauty-of-filipino-culture/1100-6523531/">Until Then</a> from the Philippines are helping to round out East Asian-heavy representation of the cultures underneath the AAPI umbrella, even if they aren't created by Asians overseas. Both types of games give us powerful narratives to relate to and prove how even those who can't personally relate to AAPI heritage can appreciate other cultures and the depth they bring to a story.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate AAPI month, GameSpot gathered thoughts from AAPI developers and professionals in the gaming industry about what AAPI month means to them and how their identity has shaped their work:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503389-1000-resist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503389" data-ratio="0.56217162872154" data-width="1713" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503389-1000-resist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503389"></a><figcaption>1000xResist</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503389-1000-resist.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Our whole mission with 1000xRESIST was to see ourselves, and Asian diasporic stories, in-game and on screen, portrayed with dignity. To realize our desire for these stories to be told in ambitious and experimental ways, that held space for dreaming, yearning, and searching. Our identity and lived experiences are such a huge part of the work we make, and we try to lean into the specific as much as possible. This month really reminds me of the kinds of sacrifices the previous generation made, under hostility and discrimination. I don't want to take that for granted, and I want to fight to continue to tell these stories, especially with and for other AAPI creators." -- <strong>Remy Sin, Creative Director of 1000xResist</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"AAPI Month has, in the past, left me feeling a bit complicated as someone who is half Korean and--especially growing up--was unsure how I fit into the celebrations as someone 'in-between.' The ways that games have typically interpreted and portrayed 'Asians' as a monolith honestly didn't help much either. What has helped is media--by AAPI developers--that's highlighted the variations, range, and richness of the Asian-American experience. As cheesy as it sounds, games (like <a href="https://emmkid.itch.io/half" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Half</a>, 1000xRESIST, Venba, Butterfly Soup 2) have helped me explore my bi-racial, second-generation identity, and I hope we continue to see more." -- <strong>Jenny Windom, Communications Director, Ivy Road; Co-Owner, Soft Not Weak; Organizer/Host, Wholesome Games</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Truth be told, AAPI month always felt like a tricky one. You see, most of my life, it always felt like being of Indian descent didn't qualify as 'Asian.' Which is utterly ridiculous because the country is literally in Asia! But even more importantly: 'Asian' celebrations and media usually didn't include people of darker skin tones. I was different but not the 'right kind' of different. The stereotypes and racist remarks that my community was subject to were of violence and filth. On a positive note, though, I do think that diversity culture is slowly changing. I am seeing more people who look like me, with actual personalities, being portrayed on screen. Hey, I even got to write my thoughts for AAPI month on GameSpot, ha!" -- <strong>Neha Patel, Composer/Sound Designer</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"There is so much to AAPI heritage, but at the end of the day I'm grateful for the sense of camaraderie and joy we can find in each other. Everything I do now is influenced by the support I was surrounded by in my culture. And as we continue to tell our stories, I hope we see more variety in AAPI developers, aesthetics, and themes." -- <strong>Victoria Tran, Communications Director at Innersloth</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503393-butterfly-soup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503393" data-ratio="0.56222547584187" data-width="1366" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503393-butterfly-soup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503393"></a><figcaption>Butterfly Soup</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503393-butterfly-soup.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Every project I've worked on contains a small reflection of my Filipino-American identity in hopes that those who interact with it may see a piece of themselves in it, too. Representation is endlessly impactful, especially in an immersive medium like video games. It welcomes more people to feel a sense of belonging, allowing our imagined worlds to reflect the diverse one we live in today. AAPI Heritage Month is always a lovely reminder of how much pride we all have in our unique cultures and how important it is to celebrate and embrace it within our industry!" -- <strong>Belinda Garcia-Maguid, Game Writer and Narrative Designer at Crystal Dynamics</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Three years ago, I met an Asian-American narrative designer for the first time and realized I could also become one. Meeting her broke an imaginary boundary I didn't know I drew between my creative and professional identities, and I remember asking her what it was like being the only AAPI writer on her team. She just shrugged, and said when I joined the industry, there'd be at least two of us. Now, as an early career developer, I'm reminded how representation demonstrates to aspiring AAPI developers that they have a place in games to exist and thrive. Even as the industry struggles, I'm still excited for the day when I can say: 'Well, there's at least three of us.'" -- <strong>Anne Zhang-Huang, Associate Narrative Designer at Zenimax Online Studios</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"My game is set in Ontario in 1914, and I knew that I would be including a Japanese-Canadian character to honour my family heritage. The first wave of Japanese immigrants to Canada started around 1877. My grandmother on my father's side was born in Vancouver in 1912. Representation in our media is so important because historically this representation hasn't been common--d – Despite the fact that diverse populations were and are the reality, more often than not." -- <strong>Julia Minamata, Solo Indie Game Developer of The Crimson Diamond</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"The rising tide of AAPI representation lately fills me with so much pride. In Everything Everywhere All At Once, I saw my mother: from her sensible shoes and puffer vest to her toiling in a mom-and-pop laundromat. In the rise of K-pop, I see people who look like me held up as aspirational figures, influencing generations worldwide in the way they look and dress. I didn't have this growing up, though being born and raised in Los Angeles meant that I never felt like a minority (even though I was, in a numerical sense). In my own work, I'm proud to express my diverse viewpoints with my love of character and emotional conflicts; things that don't scream 'the Asian experience' at the forefront, and yet are made up of references from how I grew up and the traits I value. I love AAPI Heritage Month as a beautiful celebration to highlight all the different voices that make our worlds, both real and fictional, all the more interesting." -- <strong>Karrie Shao, Lead Narrative Designer &amp; Lead Writer of Pacific Drive</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503394-pacific-drive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503394" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503394-pacific-drive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503394"></a><figcaption>Pacific Drive</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503394-pacific-drive.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I've lived in the US as a US citizen for 85% of my life and I'm still wondering how long I have to live here to be accepted as an American. As a kid, I assumed things would get better as time went on and never did I think back then attitudes would start going backwards. It's true, if we look back at where racial acceptance was 50 or a 100 years ago, things have gotten better but in my life and where we are, it certainly doesn't feel that way. I see some changes and want a bright future for my teen sons as they navigate their way to adulthood but at the same time I worry. That worry might be just how every parent is with generational divides and the idea of loss and the idea that we won't be around to see our kids' story play out fully into their lives.</p><p dir="ltr">"What I like for them to remember is that their differences in their mixed Asian heritage is what makes them unique and instead of shying away from it like I did as a new immigrant kid learning English for the first time., I want them to own it and be proud of it. It's easier said than done but I have hope. The reason we still (for now) recognize AAPI and other non-dominant cultures is because it's important to understand that the US is a land of diversity and a land of immigrants. People in power tend to forget that this country was not theirs but it was taken by bloody conflict and by force. Dominant culture likes to simplify and establish a very narrow set of rules of what it means to be an American but we know it's more nuanced than that. It's why stories and sharing experiences are important and why we and our studio focuses on games about underrepresented cultures and themes. I'm hopeful, cautiously hopeful and I know I've got to do my part in creating interesting experiences to keep pushing the idea of the variety of people that make up this country." -- <strong>Chandana Ekanayake, Creative Director at Outerloop Games</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"We've made a lot of strides in representation when it comes to video games. Institutions may not be there yet, but I do believe players are! The love and support our game has gotten stands as testament to that. However, video games are a truly global medium. Too often, discussion of representation is limited to works from the diaspora in the West. I would like to see the industry as a whole make more of an effort to pay attention to and support works from underrepresented regions, too. There is a growing game development scene in South Asia that I'm personally very excited about, and I would love all inclusion efforts to reach farther than the Western-centric approach we default to." -- <strong>Abhi, Creative Director and Founder of Visai Games</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503391-venba.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503391" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503391-venba.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503391"></a><figcaption>Venba</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503391-venba.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month is a time of reflection of our immigrant histories, arts, and the unevenly experienced socioeconomic and civic participation. Although there have been brilliant titles in recent years that highlight the unique challenges faced by the Asian diaspora, we devs have more work ahead of us to highlight that Asian experiences aren't interchangeable and monolithic to both the industry and the public. Just as the census has increased ethnic origin specificity (such as including Hong Kong in the 2021 Canadian census), games deserve representation that reflects the complexity of our cultural and civic preoccupations." -- <strong>Tanya Kan, Executive Producer and Director at Vivid Foundry</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"There was a time I provided cultural consultation on a past title. I remember being shown concept art for the villain who was supposed to be an older man. In one of the iterations, he was wearing a taqiyah, which is a prayer cap worn by men in many different countries around the world who follow Islam. I expressed concern over that specific choice because it belongs to a group of minorities who are rarely represented to begin with. I felt having a practicing Muslim man portrayed as the 'bad guy' could send the wrong message and be seen as disrespectful to those who follow Islam. The artist thanked me for the insight and went in a different direction as a result. While there is a wealth of knowledge that we can find online, there is nothing that beats lived experience when it comes to cultural nuances and making sure all minorities are represented correctly and respectfully." -- <strong>Neha Nair, Campaign Marketing Manager at The New Blank</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Games inspire. They inspire players to face challenges creatively; to explore endlessly; to see themselves in unexpected reflections. They inspire gamemakers to design for different minds; to imagine bigger, bolder worlds; to respect the audience's most valuable resource of time. For players and developers both, diversity makes the material for inspiration richer. It widens the pool of perspectives to draw from in making games, and broadens the invitation of play to people across all markers of identity.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's the big philosophy, and in practice, my identity has affected my work in treasured ways. It's connected me to fellow devs and players, with precious moments of Pinoy and LGBT pride. It's empowered me to be unafraid in drawing from my own background in what I create. But most importantly, it's made me a stronger, more empathetic, more open-minded observer and listener, who readily welcomes inspiration from others and hopefully inspires others in turn. Happy AAPI Heritage Month and Pride Month! Isang Bagsak!" -- <strong>Isa Mari De Leon, Narrative Writer at Riot Games</strong></p>

            <p>
The end is nigh for developer FuturLab's endlessly hypnotic original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>, but before the studio packs away its nozzles in anticipation of an upcoming sequel, there's one last free update featuring a couple more spaces in which to unleash your hose.
</p>
<p>
"The time has come to reach our final destination for PowerWash Simulator," FuturLab <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">wrote in an update on its website,</a> "and what a journey it has been!... Whether you've been with us busting the grime from early access, or hopped aboard the PowerWash hype train somewhere down the line, we'd love to say a huge thank you for enjoying this adventure with us."
</p>
<p>
And as a final farewell to the original game, FuturLab has released Muckingham Files 6, which features two more locations in desperate need of a clean. The first will be immediately familiar to old hands, taking players down into the Muckingham subway station for one last spray. However, rather than demanding a repeat of the harrowing tunnel clean-up job featured in the base game, this time you'll be aiming your nozzle at an extremely grubby train that's pulled into the station, washing away the grime from its outers and innards.
</p>

<p>
After that, there's one last stop in the form of Sculpture Park, where players will be working at the behest of Darcy d'Arcy to restore the area's collection of "fine" art - including a large Monolith and The Man of A Thousand Faces - to its former glory. And, of course, there's a giant gnome, because what sort of send off would it be without one?
</p>
<p>
"We hope you enjoy this final PowerWash Simulator update as much as we have enjoyed creating it," FuturLab concluded in its update. "The team have poured their hearts and souls into creating a world for you all to escape to and clean, somewhere for you to relax and solo clean, or a place to gather with friends and catch up over a satisfying wash." 
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator's free Muckingham Files 6 update - which follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/have-another-peek-at-powerwash-simulator-2-then-hose-down-an-ice-cream-parlour-in-the-original">April's inclusion of Muckingham's Dessert Parlour</a> for a cleaning - is available now on all platforms, and FutureLab has taken the opportunity to squeeze in a couple more bug fixes, as detailed in its <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Next up, of course, is PowerWash Simulator 2, which is currently expected to launch for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-2-announced-and-its-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">possibly Switch 2</a> later this year. It promises new jobs, new dirt to blast, and a new hub-like HQ. And if you're a fan of PowerWash Simulator's ridiculous narrative, don't fret - FuturLab has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-powerwash-simulator-2-is-bringing-back-the-ludicrous-brilliant-lore">also confirmed plenty more Muckingham lore</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-developer-warns-users-using-latest-graphics-cards-may-experience-frame-rate-drops/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign may not run well at launch on the "latest GPUs", forcing users to reduce graphics settings or resolution to avoid experiencing frame rate drops.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, Bandai Namco and FromSoftware shared the patch notes for the day one update, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-NIGHTREIGN-Patch101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update 1.01</a>, which improves the handling of playable characters, adjusts the soundtrack, text and balance, adds character scenarios and addresses some unspecified bugs. Accompanying the official patch notes is a warning for PC users that PC configurations using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops. This issue is under investigation, but anyone experiencing a significant drop is advised to turn down graphics settings from the default High to Medium or Low, or lower the game's resolution.</p>
<p>While it is not specified which new graphics cards currently have trouble running the game properly, it's very likely the Elden Ring Nightreign developer was talking about the NVIDIA RTX 50 series cards, as during my over 30 hours with Elden Ring Nightreign, I did not experience any significant performance issue on an RTX 4080. As such, if you own one of these new GPUs, it may be a good idea to hold off getting the game until the issues have been fixed.</p>
<p>Performance issues on new GPUs and some glaring oversights, such as the lack of cross-platform play, Elden Ring Nightreign is an incredibly engaging experience that masterfully twists the typical Souls series formula to provide a fast-paced co-op experience that is hard to put down. You can learn more about this engaging experience with my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review.</a></p>

            <p>
I was 20 minutes into the demo before I realised that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/becoming-saint">Becoming Saint</a> is that most terrible of things, <em>another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a></em>, but that's OK, because by then I'd been burned at the stake for heresy after failing to convert the homely town of Spoleto. The presiding Inquisitor very kindly let me off 100 years of purgatory because I'd mostly rebelled against the Emperor, not the Pope. But then he slapped on 68 years for "minor sins". 
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure which sins. Possibly my being a bit parsimonious with the bread rations on the road to Spoleto? Possibly my favouring the company of a majestic wolf, "strong as he is beautiful"? Regardless, the happy ending here is that after 968 years in purgatory, I was eventually canonised as a Saint in the year 2317. Today, 29th May, is in fact Saint Edwina's day. If you would like Saint Edwina's blessing, know that she accepts all major credit cards and is also happy to be paid in vouchers for Cafe Neros.

<p>
Becoming Saint, then: possibly not the most reverent game you can play. Possibly not a game you will relish if you are a committed Catholic. But quite jolly all the same. The setup here, as I probably should have mentioned about 200 words ago, is that you're a budding preacher in 14th century Italy. Your goal is to Become a Saint within your own lifetime, rather than getting yourself martyred before you can enjoy any of the perks. To do this you will need believers, gathered from 16 social classes.
</p>
<p>
Which believers you attract is based on your own evolving political compass and doctrine, which begins with the three narrative choices you make at the outset. For example, choice of familiar. I picked a wolf as my animal emblem and promised the faithful all the florins they could eat, which got me branded a Capitalist, but your alignment can shift as you give speeches at towns over the course of the run. This may cause some believers to peel away and others to latch on. The presentation is eye-grabbing: pop-up cardboard towns, menus written on parchment scrolls, choose-your-own adventure beats with Kate Beaton-esque illustrations. A little like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>, in places, but simpler and bolder.
</p>
<p>
You can anoint up to five types of believer as followers, which allows you to field them in "confrontations" with opposing zealots while trying to convert towns. These confrontations take the form of grid-based real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> battles with a tactical pause function. Units have three stats and some Rosary, Paper, Censer-style strengths and weaknesses. Book-wielding Monks are great at perplexing Peasants, for example. Other followers excel at begging, which is important because your holy cause is powered by bread as much as charisma.
</p>
<p>
It's all the antic and disarming work of Open Lab Games, developers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roller-drama">Roller Drama</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-drama">Football Drama</a>. You can find that demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643010/Becoming_Saint/">Steam</a>, along with the release date: 15th July 2025.

                <p>Gearbox Software boss Randy Pitchford continues to speak out regarding the price point of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a>, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/" data-ref-id="1100-6531437">remains a mystery</a>. Posting on social media, Pitchford said that first and foremost he does not want people to pay "any more than they should or are comfortable with." He's saying this after he controversially said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-fans-will-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen-if-borderlands-4-costs-80-says-randy-pitchford/1100-6531677/" data-ref-id="1100-6531677">"real fans"</a> will find a way to find $80 to buy Borderlands 4 if it costs that much.</p><p>"I always work with the intent and hope that a customer always feels they got the better end of the deal no matter what they pay," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1927802548326650365" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said</a>.</p><p>With his "real fans" comment, Pitchford said he was responding to a person who suggested Borderlands 4 would "fail" at $80.</p><p>"What I was trying to do was explain that it wasn't my call but that if a $10 price increase does happen (since that's obviously where the industry is going), it will be okay and that Borderlands 4 will be okay because it's a great game and there are a lot of fans who will see the value and want it," he said.</p><p>He said he "triggered some people" by using the phrase "real fans," going on to push back against the idea that he was trying to make "some big statement."</p><p>"I could see that it was being pressed into the idea that I was taking the audience for granted (which is a super shitty look, but it was not at all my intent and does not reflect at all how I feel)," he said.</p><p>Pitchford went on to say that, as an artist, he doesn't want to see price increases because that might limit how many people could play it. At the same time, Pitchford is a businessman and he said he understands that "business is a thing and that the market and economy are driving prices up."</p><p>"Sooner or later we're going to have to all adapt to that so that the creative engine can make at least as much as it spends to provide us with amazing content," he said.</p><p>Speaking at PAX, Pitchford said it's a "gnarly" time in the video game industry when it comes to economics.</p><p>"On one level, we've got a competitive marketplace where people who make [pricing] choices want to sell as many units as possible and they want to be careful about people that are price-sensitive," he said. "So there are some folks who don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are. There are other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing and there are tariffs for the retail packaging."</p><p>Borderlands 4 has "more than twice" the development budget of Borderlands 3, Pitchford said, adding that he hopes the game sells as many copies as possible so Gearbox can reinvest those funds into future products.</p><p>2K, the publisher of Borderlands 4, will set the price of Borderlands 4. Exactly what that price will be remains a mystery and may not be confirmed until preorders open.</p><p>Nintendo is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">charging $80 for Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Microsoft is raising prices to $80 as well</a> for some games later this year. Another 2K game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, is going to sell for $50 as part of an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-isnt-open-world-and-doesnt-require-a-massive-time-commitment/1100-6531408/" data-ref-id="1100-6531408">intentional bid to appeal to players who don't have a lot of free time.</a></p><p>Borderlands 4 releases on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

Reviewer Jessica Cogswell called the RPG "transcendent" and "greater than the sum of its parts," even when those parts are each "masterfully crafted."</p><p dir="ltr">Set in the fantasy world of Euchronia, players set out on a secret mission to assassinate a tyrannical would-be ruler, only for the entire kingdom to be thrown into political upheaval. Soon players are thrust into a competition to become the kingdom's next monarch, and along the way are joined by a ragtag group of heroes representing Euchronia's various fantasy races as they all seek to make the world a better place.</p><p dir="ltr">Metaphor: ReFantazio is every bit as stylish as Atlus' previous Persona work, with some of the most impressive menus and animations ever seen in a turn-based RPG. Persona fans will feel right at home with Metaphor's combat, too, which sees characters transform into different Archetypes to use unique powers. It also sports a standout soundtrack that feels unique to its fantasy universe yet still familiar to composer Shoji Meguro's previous Atlus work.</p><p dir="ltr">Other big <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/more-new-game-pass-titles-for-may-2025-include-2024s-best-and-day-one-releases/2900-6599/" data-ref-id="2900-6599">Game Pass additions in May</a> have included the newly released Xbox first-party title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and indie sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-train-2/" data-ref-id="5000-663832">Monster Train 2</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-2-joins-game-pass-today-as-battle-for-brooklyn-expansion-and-year-7-launches/1100-6531831/" data-ref-id="1100-6531831">The Division 2 (alongside the new Battle for Brooklyn expansion)</a> and the new game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/katamari-damacy-creators-new-game-to-a-t-launches-in-may/1100-6529669/" data-ref-id="1100-6529669">To a T</a> from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/katamari-damacy/" data-ref-id="5000-19797">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi.</p>

Each character boasts a unique skillset to challenge players to master different gameplay styles. Battle the hordes of the underworld on an assortment of playable maps drawing from various locales from the mythological story of Achilles such as Troy and Tartarus. Level up your character during each run to elevate them from hero to god of destruction as you gain stronger power-ups and abilities. Increase overall team stats between runs to increase your odds of winning the fight against Hades’ minions as you confront more lethal monsters and bosses.</p><p>Following the Trojan War, Hades, the god of the underworld, resurrected Achilles to use him in a conflict against the other gods. Once Achilles had served his purpose, Hades betrayed him, casting him into the depths of Tartarus and condemning him to eternal torment. Refusing to accept this fate, Achilles broke free from the underworld, rescuing many lost souls, including several who had fallen to his own sword. Angered by this defiance, Hades unleashed his dark minions to hunt down Achilles and all the souls he freed. Take on the mantle of Achilles or one of the many others rescued from Tartarus and prepare for a fight that will take you beyond the land of the living in the hopes of thwarting Hades and his army of the damned.</p><!-- AD: content -->

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, developer Unknown Worlds' exquisite deep sea survival game, is making its way to iOS and Android devices this July, meaning you'll finally be able to play it <em>actually underwater</em> (as long as your phone is waterproof, so please do check that first).
</p>
<p>
Subnautica, for some context, originally lauched in 2018 after a couple of years in early access, taking players on a mostly combat-free adventure far, far beneath the waves after crash landing on the ocean planet 4546B. It managed to combine its various strands of exploration, narrative, crafting, base building, and thalassophobia-inducing horror into a deeply satisfying whole, and ended up being a critical and commercial hit. So much so that a standalone expansion - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-below-zero">Subnautica: Below Zero</a> - followed, and a sequel's on the way.
</p>
<p>
But back to Subnautica's iOS and Android release. It's being created in collaboration with mobile developer Playdigious and promises the full-fat Subnautica experience - the one Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-review">called</a> "oppressively beautiful" and "well-wrought" back in 2018 - albeit with some mobile-specific tweaks. It's got an updated UI, for instance, alongside touch controls and support for MFi controllers if you'd rather play with proper buttons. That's in addition to iPhone 15 optimisation, GameCenter achievements on iOS, and cloud save support enabling progress to be share between iOS or Android devices.

<figcaption>Here's a quick look at Subnautica's mobile release.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL6HobdRpVQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
If all that appeals, Subnatica comes to iOS and Android on 8th July (via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subnautica/id6478639011">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unknownworlds.subnautica">Google Play</a> respectively) for the entirely reasonable price of $9.99 USD. In fact, it'll be even cheaper for a limited time, given the 10 percent launch discount that'll bring it down to $8.99.
</p>
<p>
As for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, that's currently set to launch into early access later this year. Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">shared a tiny bit of first gameplay back in April</a>, showing off a handful of new environments, some new aquatic creatures, and even a bit of base-building and co-operative swimming. Co-op is, of course, the sequel's big new feature, and it'll support up to four players. Subnautica 2 will initially be available for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and GamePass, and is expected to stay in early access for "about two to three years."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/atomfalls-wicked-isle-story-dlc-launches-on-june-3rd/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rebellion has announced that it’s British post apocalyptic survival game Atomfall will be getting bigger with the launch of its Wicked Isle story expansion DLC, which will be available from June 3rd. Those who purchased the Atomfall Deluxe Edition will get instant access to the new story content, as will those who buy the Deluxe upgrade pack which is available for £14.99, €19.99, or $19.99. The launch trailer for Atomfall Wicked Isle can be watched now.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Wicked Isle DLC Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5HdforNUuuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Atomfall’s Wicked Isle story takes place on Midsummer Island, which is close to the site of Windscale Atom Plant. As a result those who reside on the island and the environment have been subject to higher infection levels compared to those in Wyndham Village and the surrounding areas. The new content adds new enemies including pirates and druids, as well as more weapons to add to your arsenal including the Blunderbuss shotgun. New skills will also be available for your character to use. Wicked Isle is not a standalone story, but weaves into the main story beats of the main game. So much so, that new endings have been added to take into account the events that take place on Midsummer Island.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Atomfall review, Gareth said,<em> “Atomfall is an interesting game. It might not be wholly unique in anything it does, but it combines its core ideas in a way that feels fresh. A big part of that comes through the drip feed of the underlying story, whilst another is the glorious British countryside that makes up its maps. It likely isn’t going to blow your mind, but it’s an enjoyable journey and you would still be missing out if you didn’t give Atomfall a go.”</em></p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/674523/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-live-service</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/animal-crossing-new-horizons-was-a-glimpse-at-nintendo%E2%80%99s-online-future.1201617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/674523/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-live-service<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Tiger Borgia, a content creator focused on cozy games, has been pulling weeds in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> for over five years. </p><p>Given the current landscape in which game developers constantly release new updates to vie for the attention of audiences, Borgia’s dedication to <em>New Horizons</em> can come across as admirable. Nintendo has not released a major update to <em>New Horizons </em>since the <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> DLC in 2021. (Just this week <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/49112/~/how-to-update-animal-crossing%3A-new-horizons">the game was patched</a> in advance of the Switch 2.) The version of <em>New Horizons</em> Borgia plays today — the one where she pulls weeds and fishes each day — is more or less the same game that the company released in the spring of 2020. </p><p>At a time when seemingly every publisher is trying to capture a piece of the lucrative live-service boom, <em>New Horizons</em> showed Nintendo slowly inching its way into the space with more than a year’s worth of regular updates after launch. And that expansion into live service is something that could become an even larger part of Nintendo’s future with the Switch 2.</p><p>Speaking to <em>The Verge</em>, Borgia explains that two years ago she would have said yes to having more content in <em>New Horizons</em>, but her opinion has since changed. “Now I feel like the game should be left as is,” Borgia says via email. “<em>New Horizons</em> already had its moment. I would be open to the next Animal Crossing title being a live-service game, but I would be skeptical about paywalls and subscription fees.”</p><p>Since the release of <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> PUBG: Battlegrounds </em>in 2017, live-service games have become a core pillar of modern gaming. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-09-29/why-playstation-fans-are-cheering-ceo-jim-ryan-s-departure">Live-service games</a> — or what some call “games as a service” — don’t have a clear start and end. Instead, developers release a base game and continue to put out updates that add new characters, game modes, and other content to try and get people to play as much as possible.</p><p>The model has become a massively popular way to monetize games. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lj27nkyes22r">Industry analyst Mat Piscatella</a> published data saying more than 40 percent of all time spent playing on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles in the US in the month of January was spent playing the top 10 live-service games. And the trend has hit the developer side too: a <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">2025 survey from the Game Developers Conference</a> found that roughly 30 percent of all “AAA” developers are working on a live-service game. </p><p>Despite all the big numbers, Nintendo has been selective with the live-service games it develops. Creating a live-service game isn’t as easy as flipping a switch, and even major companies like Sony have struggled to enter the space; it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">recently shut down development on two such projects</a>. However, some fans are wondering if that could change with the Switch 2. </p><p>Previous titles like <em>Splatoon 3 </em>have already gotten live-esque service with regular <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23683377/splatoon-3-splatfest-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom">updates and events</a> — even if the earlier entries in the series were ultimately shut down. And <em>New Horizons</em> received a steady stream of updates initially. New features, like the Switch 2’s Discord-like social tool GameChat, could benefit live-service games that rely on online communication and logging in with friends regularly to play. Additionally, leaks from an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">October playtest</a> suggested that Nintendo could be working on some sort of MMO for the Switch 2, which could also fall under the umbrella of a live-service game. </p><p>But here is the most compelling argument that a shift could be on the horizon: Nintendo has already been investing in live-service games for years. If you look at Nintendo’s mobile games, entries like <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> already used a free-to-play model with in-game transactions at launch.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Some Animal Crossing fans welcome the possibility of adapting the mainline games to a live-service model. <em>New Horizons</em> is really good for people who like to get creative and design an island, but the game can run out of new content after players complete certain tasks and storylines.</p><p>Tom, an artist who played the game for more than two years, tells <em>The Verge</em> a live-service version of the game could have kept him playing even longer. “More updates would have made it <em>way</em> more likely that I’d have kept going, especially because it would keep friends coming back too,” he says<em>.</em></p><p>Additionally, the gameplay and structure of <em>New Horizons </em>could be the perfect fit for a live-service game, since it has seasonal events depending on the time of year and the region you play in. However, some of the fans I spoke to expressed skepticism. </p><p>“I was never expecting to get infinite content from Animal Crossing honestly,” Christi Kerr, a player who spent more than 700 hours playing <em>New Horizons</em>, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “I was used to old AC games where all the content came out at once, and you play it until you feel like you’ve done all you want. I thought the updates to <em>New Horizons</em> were fun, but also kind of frustrating as a <em>New Leaf</em> player.”</p><p>That’s not to say that players <em>The Verge</em> spoke to are completely closed off to the live-service model with the next mainline Animal Crossing game; it just needs to be done in a way that feels respectful to players’ time, money, and attention. Today, even beloved live-service games are regularly criticized by fans for requiring too much time to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteXPMaps/comments/1h45vb0/leveling_up_this_season_so_far_doesnt_seem_so_easy/">level up a battle pass</a> or for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/wa1348/patch_28_has_the_worst_puzzle_designs_in_genshin/">poorly designed events</a>. </p><p>“If Animal Crossing were to consider a live-service approach, I really hope that they would focus on seasonal events and quality-of-life updates,” Borgia says. “I would be nervous to say I hope for continuous new content like furniture and clothing, because that can easily turn into a microtransaction nightmare. I’d love to have more seasonal celebrations, challenges, and temporary NPC visitors.”</p><p>So far, Nintendo has shown a measured approach to live-service games. In the case of <em>Pocket Camp</em>, Nintendo ended up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312047/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-review-microtransactions">rereleasing it as a standalone game</a> free of microtransactions. Now, people who missed the boat on playing <em>Pocket Camp</em> initially and don’t like in-app purchases can still play the same game. </p><p>For the fans we spoke to, this is good enough. Animal Crossing doesn’t need to be some sort of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23583539/back-4-blood-content-updates-expansion-packs-good">never-ending forever game</a> that trudges on like a zombie throughout the years. As Kerr put it, it’s totally fine to have a game start and end, and then get a new one down the line. </p><p>“I would’ve been delighted to see updates like a live service game. [...] But like I said, I’m not bothered if the next Animal Crossing game sustains my interest for a while and then I’m done.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-games-series-tier-list<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Which Nintendo franchise do you think is the greatest?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As I’m sure you’re aware, the Nintendo Switch 2 is upon us. So, with a brand new console on the horizon, what better time to look back at some of the legendary publisher’s greatest games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For decades, Nintendo has given us some of the most famous and best-selling game series ever made, but here, I’ve picked out 18 of the most well-known ones to sort through. Yes, this list could stretch into the 100s, but we don’t want to be here all day, do we? From Super Mario to Zelda, we all have our favourites, and some (sorry Kirby) that we’ve just never quite clicked with. I’ve had a go at ranking them via one of our IGN Tier Lists, purely taking into account <strong>my personal enjoyment</strong> of each series over the years. Take a look at my tier list here:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/29/screenshot-2025-05-29-at-13-38-28-1748522322130.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Simon Cardy's Nintendo Series Tier List</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m sure it’s no surprise to see both Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda in my S-tier category. Two of the most influential and, crucially, very fun video game series to ever do it, it’s a no-brainer really. On the other end of the scale… I’m sure a few eyebrows will be raised at my placing of Super Smash Bros. in the C tier. Please let me explain myself before battering me in the comments, please. Smash Bros. has just never been my thing, I’m afraid. Not only am I not a fighting game fan, but in a time when lots of people grew up playing it with friends, I was simply enjoying other multiplayer and party games, whether those be TimeSplitters, Guitar Hero, or Call of Duty. I just don’t have the connection to Smash Bros. that so many do, and for that, I can only ask for your complete forgiveness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think that Pikmin is better than Pokémon? Well, why not have a go at ranking some of Nintendo’s biggest series yourself in a tier list below, where you can compare your own S, A, B, C, and D tiers with the whole of the IGN community. </p><div id="nintendo-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Series Tier List</h3><h3>Nintendo Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s your favourite Nintendo series that hasn’t made it onto this list? Let us know in the comments, as well as why you’ve ranked the games in the order you’ve chosen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

<p>All 136 FBS schools are represented in CFB 26, while more than 300 real-world coaches have lent their likenesses to the game, which launches on July 10 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>CFB 26 also has expanded player types and abilities, including 84 total abilities and 10 new archetypes to help players customize their roster to their liking. Additionally, EA added a new "wear and tear" system that requires players to manage player fatigue and injuries.</p><p>The game also sports better AI, improved blocking and coverages, and a new "Dynamic Substitutions" system to help "show your opponent what your program is made of."</p><p dir="ltr">The Stadium Pulse system from CFB 25 has been "revamped" for CFB 26 to add new crowd-based challenges and things like "clock distortion" and "extreme screen shake" to help ramp up the intensity in pressure-packed moments. There are also 160 new school-specific chants in CFB 26, along with 10 new PA tracks--including "Enter Sandman" by Metallica.</p><p dir="ltr">The broadcast and commentary team from CFB 25 returns for the new game, including Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit, Rece Davis, Jesse Palmer, Desmond Howard, and David Pollack.</p><p dir="ltr">EA also said fans can look forward to improved Dynasty and Road to Glory modes, while the Road to the College Football Playoff mode has a new online progression format.</p><p dir="ltr">CFB 26 launches July 10, but people who buy the game's deluxe edition or the EA Sports MVP Bundle--which includes CFB 26 and Madden NFL 26--can start playing on July 7. There will also be a free 10-hour trial for EA Play members, which means Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have access, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The Standard Edition of EA Sports College Football 26 features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-cover-features-two-top-wide-receivers/1100-6531832/" data-ref-id="1100-6531832">Alabama's Ryan Williams and Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith</a>, two of the top-ranked wide receivers in the country.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-preorders-up-for-grabs-for-ps5-and-xbox/1100-6531106/" data-ref-id="1100-6531106">CFB 26 preorder guide.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Sales numbers for CFB 25 were never announced, but EA said recently that the game drove <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL1.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than $1 billion in "net bookings,"</a> which means revenue.

                <p>The word phasmophobia describes a fear of ghosts, but perhaps it's the spirits who should be afraid after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-coming-to-haunt-consoles-just-in-time-for-halloween/1100-6527227/" data-ref-id="1100-6527227">Phasmophobia</a>'s next update. Kinetic Games has announced that the new Phasmophobia update, Chronicle, will arrive next month, and it will give players some upgraded tools for their ghosthunting endeavors.</p><p>Chronicle is adding the ability to record and collect sound evidence of ghosts with an upgradable sound recorder that can detect hidden layers of audio from ghostly events that might otherwise go unnoticed. The update is also overhauling the game's evidence presentation, which will be reorganized into a media tab with three subsections--photos, videos, and sound recordings. Players will be able to log in the different pieces of evidence they collect to complete their investigations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4503478-phasmophobiachronicle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503478" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4503478-phasmophobiachronicle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503478"></a><figcaption>One of the locations from Phasmophobia.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4503478-phasmophobiachronicle.jpg"></figure><p>In addition to the revamped evidence collection, Chronicle will add a new reward system. The first time players collect evidence of any kind will be given extra cash and XP rewards following the conclusion of each contact. Any duplicate evidence collected by players will get smaller rewards, while bonuses will be tied to the equipment used to capture them.</p><p>Phasmophobia's latest update is also introducing a more refined leveling and progression system, a new main menu, and eliminating some bugs from the game. Kinetic Games notes that an overhaul of Phasmophobia's Grafton Farmhouse will be added later this year. The new Grafton Farmhouse will feature redesigned layouts, enhanced visuals, re-themed rooms, and a "haunting new attic."</p><p>Kinetic Games will release Phasmophobia's Chronicle update on June 24.</p>
