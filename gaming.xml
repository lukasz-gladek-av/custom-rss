"As massive fans, we're beyond grateful for the generous gift of Oblivion Remastered game keys for our entire modding team! This means so much to us. Thank you for everything, Bethesda!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://skyblivion.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skyblivion</a> is an upcoming fan remake of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion made by the TESRenewal volunteer modding group. It uses Bethesda's Creation Engine to recreate Oblivion in the game's sequel, Skyrim. The project has technically been in the works for over a decade, beginning as a simple direct port and later expanding to a full remake with a number of improved features and even new content. We interviewed one of the developers behind it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyblivion-oblivion-skyrim-mod-elder-scrolls">way back in 2021</a>. Skyblivion is expected to release this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Historically, Bethesda and the Skyblivion team have reportedly been on "<a href="https://www.vg247.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-remake-mod-lead-interview-c3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very good terms</a>," but as rumors of an official Oblivion remaster grew, some fans questioned if Bethesda wasn't trying to head off Skyblivion with its own version due to the suspiciously close release timing. A few days ago, anticipating today's showcase, the Skyblivion team <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k285wg/official_statement_from_the_skyblivion_team/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement</a> addressing these concerns. In it, the team said that Bethesda has "always been supportive of community projects like ours" and that "there is no need for comparisons or a sense of competition" between the two games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Oblivision Remastered <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does not have official mod support</a>, though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-mods-have-already-been-published-online">fans have already been cooking up an array of unofficial mods for the game within hours of its release</a>. Additionally, both versions of Oblivion have unique aspects: Skyblivion, for instance, isn't available on console at all. Oblivision Remastered, on the other hand, does not include the new and refurbished content that Skyblivion has promised, but does have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-once-again-offering-paid-horse-armor-dlc">horse armor DLC</a> at launch for Deluxe Edition buyers. Both versions have different looks and feels, with different interpretations on how much Skyrim-ness should be incorporated into a retread of Oblivion.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ending<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks back<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-valhalla-origins-odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote some very positive things about <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, and so it should be of little surprise given the series’ contentious, recent past that I have since found that I am an idiot, and now have to write some less positive things as well.</p><p>Why am I an idiot? Because I should have seen this coming. Here’s a quote from <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-odyssey-really-blew-its-ending-1830170997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article I wrote complaining about <em>AC Odyssey</em>’s ending all the way back in November 2018</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>As </em>Odyssey<em> dragged itself towards its final few story missions, though, I noticed the pacing was off. Having spent dozens of hours spinning its wheels, everything seems to ramp up out of nowhere, then end abruptly with much of the story and its mysteries—especially the fate of the Cult—left unresolved. I was very disappointed.</em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Here’s me, again, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-too-damn-long-1846138833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking about how <em>Valhalla</em>’s ending sucked in January 2021</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Ultimately, </em>Valhalla<em>’s length added a little despair to my final thoughts on the game. The bloat created grind, which diluted the whole experience, and often felt like it was keeping my attention solely through brute force and checklists. It left me parting with a game I LOVED on less than lovely terms, which was a damn shame.</em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>And here’s me remembering all of that <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-valhalla-origins-odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>earlier this month</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Their problems aren't that they suck, but that they were just too big. Too long. </em>Odyssey<em> and </em>Valhalla<em> especially vastly overstayed their welcome with drawn-out (sometimes multiple) storylines and DLC, meaning a lot of people parted with those games on poor terms. Those negative views have perhaps coloured both game's legacy in ways unfair to their core experience.</em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Despite that mountain of evidence I had naively thought, having as much fun as I’d been having with <em>Shadows </em>up to that point, that it surely wouldn’t repeat the same mistakes its predecessors had made. That Ubisoft, with nearly a decade of experience and feedback that its open-world games were too damn long, would have taken steps to do something, anything, to address that.</p><p>Nope! <em>Shadows </em>absolutely botches its landing, and just like its predecessors. It botches it so badly that it’s soured my feelings on the entire game.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what happens as you approach the end of <em>Shadows</em>, which is much the same as happened in <em>Valhalla </em>and <em>Odyssey </em>before it: Over the course of <em>dozens </em>of hours of fantastic video game, a few different storylines begin to emerge. In <em>Shadows’ </em>case, there’s the main saga, which involves a shadowy cabal of mask-wearing villains and their evil deeds, but there are also branching, more intimate tales, telling the personal stories of our two heroes, Naoe and Yasuke.</p><p>You would think, given the way each supporting story elegantly branches off and is intertwined with the main one, that <em>Shadows</em> would also find a way to tie them all back together again at the end. They do not. What happens in <em>Shadows</em> is that you finish the main story with a limp cutscene, and are then returned to the game to tie up your loose ends. Which, with the main storyline now done, also lack any kind of real impact or satisfaction. Indeed all three storylines don’t just end poorly, they don’t feel like they end at <em>all</em>, the credits somehow managing to roll 2-3 missions before you’d think they would have and, thanks to the game’s incessant grind for levels and repetitive tasks, 10-20 hours later than they should have.</p><p>After 70-80 hours of gameplay, during which emotional stories are told and you’re drawn deep into your character’s journey, to have it all end so abruptly is a HUGE disappointment. I wanted to see these guys get revenge–indeed, how each of them deals with the concept is a <em>huge </em>part of the narrative and your choices–and while Yasuke gets a little, Naoe’s backstory has barely begun before it’s abruptly shuttered.</p><p>What’s maddening here is that this clearly isn’t a strictly narrative decision. The way each storyline pulls up short is a good reminder that this game isn’t done, and that, like <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla</em>, there is more to come <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/shadows/expansion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via at least one expansion</a>. Argh! You can't end the main game with teasers of what's to come, that's bullshit. The decision to cliffhang an 80-hour game has left me in the same position I was left in after the last few games: soured, my good times relegated to the rearview mirror as I file away <em>Shadows</em> on the shitty terms I parted with, not the glee which took up the bulk of my time with it.&nbsp;</p><p>My <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> piece earlier this month was mostly about how, for all Ubisoft’s talk and publicity, <em>Shadows</em> was a lot more similar to the last few games in the series than we’d maybe been expecting. Which was fine for the good stuff, but it’s a real shame to see those similarities extend right through to <em>Shadows</em>’ ending, and it’s something Ubisoft are going to need to address going forwards if they want people to stop parting with these games on such depressing terms.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kowloon-generic-romance"><h3>Kowloon Generic Romance Is The Closest Anime Has Come To A Wong Kar Wai Film</h3></a><p>Longing, nostalgia, and an unconventional sci-fi tale make for a not-so-generic anime romance

                <p>Lately, the world feels pretty bleak.</p><p dir="ltr">I spend a lot of energy these days just telling myself that, in many ways, this is the best the collective human race has ever had it. I try my hardest to muster up some semblance of gratitude, for self-preservation if nothing else. People who are far wiser and more well-adjusted than myself will tell you that being buried in overwhelming dread is exactly what the powers that be want; that maintaining a sense of joy is vital during times like these. In my experience, they're absolutely right. As such, I've tried my hardest to remain uncompromising when it comes to living a life still sprinkled with joy--after all, who would be inclined to live and fight for misery?</p><p dir="ltr">I try to spend as much time as possible around loved ones and touch plenty of grass, but admittedly, an element in my attempts to enjoy life and process all of <em>this</em> has been video games. This probably isn't a surprising or novel claim. If you're reading this, there's a good chance you're a gamer and are very familiar with the healing power and delightful escapism associated with games. Recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cozy-games-may-help-improve-players-mental-health-researchers-say/1100-6529075/">Reuters</a> published a study regarding the positive impact that cozy games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" data-ref-id="5000-487113">Animal Crossing</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> can have on mental health. According to the study, there is essentially "no statistically significant difference between playing a video game and engaging in meditation." I love this fact, mostly because it makes me feel a bit less guilty when my husband catches me playing Fields of Mistria at 11 o'clock at night.</p><p dir="ltr">But while I have found myself gravitating towards games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fields-of-mistria/" data-ref-id="5000-575786">Fields of Mistria</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hello-kitty-island-adventure/" data-ref-id="5000-592240">Hello Kitty Island Adventure</a> in my spare time--both of which are incredibly fun, free of oligarchs, and <em>adorable</em>--these sweet adventures offering a detour from reality aren't always what I turn to. And though they're certainly relaxing, they're also not the games making the largest positive impact on my mental health, either.</p><p dir="ltr">What I long for more than anything these days are tales of resistance; stories in which scrappy underdogs take on forces far larger than themselves. They're seldom fearless--no sensible person is, video game character or not--but that fear doesn't hinder them from doing the ethical thing. To invoke a Mr. Rogers quote I've always found charming, I suppose that even when it comes to video games, I'm "looking for the helpers."</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't a new phenomenon for me. When conversations turn to what "radicalized" me, to use the beloved meme template, I can vaguely pinpoint the moment many of my core beliefs and values began to form--it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-205">Final Fantasy VII</a> during the moment when Barrett Wallace began shooting at the heap of metal and concrete Shinra buried his home, friends, and, presumably, his young daughter Marlene beneath. "What's it all for?" he screams, his body heaving from both grief and the recoil of his bullets. Lately, I find myself asking the same question, over and over and over again. "What's it all for?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480849-qas%2810%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480849" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480849-qas%2810%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480849"></a><figcaption>Barrett from Final Fantasy VII calls out Shinra.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480849-qas%2810%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Barrett's cry is more than relatable, though--it's cathartic. Through the entirety of Final Fantasy VII, he serves as a beacon of love, bravery, and self-sacrifice. Barrett would lay down his life if doing so would better the lives of perfect strangers; he would fight ceaselessly, and savor the struggle, if it meant his daughter would never have to. He's the type of person I desperately want to believe exists, not just as a singular being, but as an inherent part of all of us. Barrett Wallace is a "helper."</p><p dir="ltr">I suspect this is in part why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metaphor-refantazio/" data-ref-id="5000-590950">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> resonated so deeply with me last year, too. Throughout its entirety, as it delves headlong into topics such as prejudice, poverty, cycles of violence, anxiety, and religion, Metaphor repeatedly emphasizes the importance of caring for those around you and striving to be a just and empathetic person--a "helper," if you will. Its metanarrative then takes this one step further by boldly proclaiming that works like Metaphor--works that are earnest, honest, and above all else, hopeful--are far more than entertainment; they're vast wells of inspiration that exist in part to create even more helpers.</p><p dir="ltr">Stories, whether constructed by one person or a whole studio of people, contain our hopes, fears, dreams, experiences, and beliefs. They are the closest we can come to making the intangible, tangible--to sharing our internal worlds with one another in hopes of establishing resonance. And though not all works are intended to inspire, all works <em>can</em>, and thus the act of creating is one that can be immensely powerful. In Metaphor, I found a game that believes all of this as strongly as I do. Long after finishing the game, its hopefulness and reassurance continues to cloak me. And part of the reason it does is because I firmly believe it must cloak other people, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course some of Atlus' other titles, namely the Persona series, also encourage perseverance, kindness, and rising against oppression and cruelty. I'd be remiss not to mention how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5/" data-ref-id="5000-115534">Persona 5</a> is a game all about taking on those who abuse power, even when that means standing up to dangerous people, the status quo, government institutions, and forces that make you feel small.</p><p dir="ltr">I also think about the time I spent playing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect-trilogy/" data-ref-id="5000-154262">Mass Effect trilogy</a>, and how Shepherd's willingness to help divided communities reconcile, right past wrongs, and lay down their life repeatedly inspires resistance, bravery, and compassion. Sure, you don't <em>have </em>to play Shepherd that way, and there are some aspects of all of this the game doesn't quite get right, if we're being honest. But at its core, Mass Effect offers a power fantasy in which a large part of said fantasy is you having the power to change the entire <em>galaxy</em> for the better. Getting to make out with number one video game boyfriend Garrus is just a nice perk--though I'd argue it <em>does </em>reinforce the importance of holding on to those you have and finding joy even in dire circumstances.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480850-3799285-8283070286-latest.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480850" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480850-3799285-8283070286-latest.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480850"></a><figcaption>Garrus from Mass Effect holding his signature sniper rifle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480850-3799285-8283070286-latest.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But while RPGs tend to fit the bill more--after all, I'd bet most of us could easily list dozens in which a band of unlikely heroes come together to take on an oppressive regime or stop a Big Bad--there are a few other genres I've gravitated to that ignite me in a similar way.</p><p dir="ltr">Frankly, you can't talk about games centered around resistance and helping others without mentioning <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dishonored/" data-ref-id="5000-110259">Dishonored</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wolfenstein/" data-ref-id="5000-25503">Wolfenstein</a>. Throughout both of these action-adventure series, you play as characters who are part of small resistance groups hellbent on taking down an oppressive regime. Be it through stealth or overwhelming firepower, your mission ultimately boils down to fighting oppressors and helping to restore power to the citizenry they've abused. They also pose an interesting question: Which is truly more violent, the violence exerted through resistance, or the systemic, sanctioned violence that commands us to remain complicit?</p><p dir="ltr">The one and only "strand game," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding/" data-ref-id="5000-451575">Death Stranding</a>, is also well worth mentioning here, as the entire game revolves around helping others and establishing connections. In a world flooded with fear and in which people are largely isolated from one another, Sam Porter Bridges serves as a bridge himself, helping people regain a sense of humanity and companionship. Sam's--and the player's--alturistic nature is further highlighted by another one of the game's key features, the Social Strand System. Although you will never meet all your fellow Death Stranding players, you are able (and encouraged!) to construct things that will improve not only your in-game world, but others as well. Naturally, this means you will reap the benefits of others' constructions, too, making this a game that highlights the importance of mutual aid.</p><p dir="ltr">In metroidvanias, the general conceit tends to be that once-powerful characters are rendered "weak," they still choose to embark on dangerous and surreal journeys, some of which help protect those around them. Gaining their powers back, and progression in general, does not come easily; there is a lot of trial involved and, oftentimes, the way forward requires going back, growing stronger, smarter, or better-equipped, and trying again later. In this way, these games emulate life.</p><p dir="ltr">And though it might sound a bit obtuse, soulslikes in particular have grown particularly comforting to me over the years. Most of the time, the stories and worlds they contain don't feel happy, safe, or gentle. But honestly, I prefer that they aren't. You can't overcome something if there's nothing to overcome; you can't feel assured in your strength or perseverance if they've never been tested; you can't appreciate light and beauty without fumbling through the dark and dire; and you can't appreciate being alive without acknowledging the finality of death.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480851-3759229-shrineofstorms.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480851" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480851-3759229-shrineofstorms.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480851"></a><figcaption>The Slayer of Demons trudges up a hill in Demon Souls.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4480851-3759229-shrineofstorms.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Though sometimes dismissed as brutal or grimdark, I've found inspiration and catharsis in games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demons-souls/" data-ref-id="5000-513796">Demon Souls</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bloodborne/" data-ref-id="5000-285291">Bloodborne</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/" data-ref-id="5000-483352">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>. Behind each grotesque creation, cutthroat swordmaster, hellish landscape, and violent end lies temporary refuge, spectacular sights, and the satisfaction of knowing you earned the right to these things. Sure, there will always be <em>something </em>lying just ahead, but just like in real life, these moments of peace are ones I cherish and savor. They offer a reminder that, despite everything, you are here now, trying your hardest to live and do good even when up against the dark and unfathomable. What an incredible feat that is.</p><p dir="ltr">I suppose all this is to say, as much as the world needs games that make us feel secure and cozy, I believe we need games that encourage and empower us, too; games that remind us that life is hard and dark but that we have the power to live, hope, and help. And though some might shy away from the idea of games being political--and the ones I've mentioned above are <em>maybe </em>not as overt as the likes of Disco Elysium, Papers, Please, Fallout: New Vegas, or countless other titles that explore capitalism and morality, or critique apathy and centrism--to me it's undeniable that all of these works of art are constructed out of experiences and core beliefs, which are perhaps the two biggest factors that guide our political ideologies. I find it beautiful to think that these creators believe in, and long to foster, goodness and progression.</p><p dir="ltr">And I get that not everyone wants to dig this deep. I get that not everyone will take away the same message or walk away transfixed and transformed. But I also have to believe that these stories do hold that power and there are plenty out there that, like me, are comforted, rejuvenated, and inspired by them. Lately, the world feels pretty bleak. But history, people, stories, and art remind me that nothing is insurmountable, and that a better world--and perhaps a cozy, lit bonfire--lie just ahead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-11/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> has more than 100 notes across all 14 chapters, and it's worth your time to find them all to get the additional story context they provide.</p>
<p>The storytelling in South of Midnight is one of the game's strongest aspects, the notes included. This guide will show you where to find all the notes in Chapter 11.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 11</h2>
<p>Chapter 11 is one of the lighter chapters, with only eight notes to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>An Anguished Cry</strong> - Early on in the chapter as you follow the path, you'll jump to a dock with exploding mushrooms covering the front end of it. Jump over the mushrooms and look to your left to find this note in the form of blue art on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Stowaway's Tin Box</strong> - You can find this note in a room on the second floor of the wrecked ship, after dealing with the Stigma knot with Crouton. Walk into the room where the Stigma knot was, and turn right to find a Floof knot and this note.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Bill of Fare - </strong>This note can be found on the third floor of the ship, on a table on the left side of the room, where you enter, as Hazel says she remembers the story of the boat disappearing.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Old Pain, New Life</strong> - After viewing the second memory for Ayotunde, you'll find this note as another blue painting on the tree on the left side of the combat arena.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Bittersweet Reunion</strong> - After seeing the third memory of Ayotunde's past, this note will appear as blue art on rocks on the left side of the main path as you move to continue the rest of the level.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>False Knowledge</strong> - After avoiding the mud thrown by Altamaha-ha, and Honey helping you back onto the boat, you'll re-enter the boat by blowing through some pieces of wood blocking the path. This note will be on the left side of the room you enter, in the form of blue paint on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Captain's Log</strong> - You'll find this note on the right side of the room you enter after using the elevator, on a desk to the right of the boat's wheel, with a Floof knot in front of the wheel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Final Message</strong> - This last note can be found after the cutscene where Honey and Altamaha-ha meet, once again as a blue painting. It'll be on a large tree on the left side of the main path.</p>
<p>That's where to find all eight notes in Chapter 11. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, then you'll have found 82 out of 103 notes. The search is almost over, with only 21 notes left to find.</p>

NexusMods has a handful of creations, including one that<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/36" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> restores the color shading from Oblivion's original release</a>, one to turn the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/15" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">desktop icon</a> into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-adoring-fan-explained/1100-6531032/" data-ref-id="1100-6531032">Adoring Fan</a>, and one that makes a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/31" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">longsword deal 10,000 damage</a>, because why not. Early downloaders have also reported no issues getting these mods to work, and that may be due to how Bethesda and Virtuous made Oblivion Remastered. It's a hybrid of sorts, one that's built in Unreal Engine 5, but that still runs on the original Oblivion engine.</p><p dir="ltr">As of the time of publication, modders are uncertain about the ease of porting old Oblivion mods to the remaster, and whether it's even possible, as questions persist regarding how these changes might interact with Unreal Engine 5. However, they have discovered that it's possible to open Oblivion Remastered's files in the Oblivion Construction Set, a mod creation and management tool that lets creators modify the original game's files. Some modders said that, even while they wait to figure out how to create new assets and enable mods, they should still be able to work with existing assets--for example, tweaking existing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-classes-in-oblivion-remastered-all-elder-scrolls-4-classes/1100-6531030/" data-ref-id="1100-6531030">Oblivion classes</a> instead of making brand-new ones.</p><p dir="ltr">Once there's a greater consensus about how Oblivion Remastered mods work, we'll update with detailed steps for how to install them and a roundup of the best ones worth downloading.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, if you're just getting started in Oblivion for the first time or need a refresh, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Oblivion Remastered walkthrough</a> for everything from tips on combat skills to how to navigate factions.</p>

			<p>The Onimusha series may not be as popular as other CAPCOM franchises, but it remains to this day one of the most unique series ever released by the Japanese publisher. Starting out as a different take on the formula made popular by the Resident Evil series, the franchise evolved considerably until the launch of Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, the latest entry in the series, which plays slightly differently from its predecessor, doing away with the signature fixed camera angles that make the series so different from the vast majority of action-adventure games of the time.</p>
<p>With a new entry in the series called <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gameplay/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> on the way, CAPCOM has decided to bring the second entry in the series, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny, to modern gaming platforms with a remaster that aims to faithfully recreate the original game with improved visuals and some small additions which have little impact on the experience. This is, in my opinion, not a bad thing at all, as the game has aged incredibly well.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250403123231_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny remaster is so faithful to the original, which I have gone through countless times back in the PlayStation 2 days but never revisited in over 20 years, that it felt instantly familiar. So much so that I could remember how much of the stiff but incredibly charming English language script was delivered by the voice actors, awkward pauses included. I also had no trouble getting used again to some of the game's unique mechanics, which, as mentioned above, have aged so well that I have no doubt even newcomers will have no trouble getting into the game and enjoying it.</p>
<p>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny, much like its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/onimusha-warlords-feudal-japan-evil/">predecessor</a>, is a rather unique action-adventure game that strikes a happy medium between the survival horror experience of the first three entries in the Resident Evil series and the more action-oriented approach of the original Devil May Cry, whose development started back in the day, as a new entry in the Resident Evil series. Employing the same fixed camera angles and pre-rendered backgrounds of the older entries in the popular CAPCOM survival horror series, which have been touched up and upscaled like the 3D character models in the remaster, players control Jubei Yagyu as he embarks on a journey to gather the five orbs created to protect humans from demons and defeat Nobunaga Oda, the famous daimyo and one of the three great unifiers of Japan, who has become the lord of the demons following the death of Fortinbras by the hands of Samanosuke Akechi in the original Onimusha. During the course of his journey, Jubei will encounter multiple companions who will help him, depending on his actions, and involve him in their personal stories that will evolve as he continues his war against the demon lord.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250404005042_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The epic journey depicted in Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is extremely enjoyable right from the start. In the first few hours, the game immediately shows its best cards, featuring a combination of simple puzzle solving in the vein of the Resident Evil series and fast and engaging combat against all sorts of enemies, ranging from regular humans to powerful demons, which is made extremely enjoyable by Jubei's mobility and the many techniques he can employ using the currently equipped weapon, which include the thunder katana Buraitou and the ice spear Hyoujin-yari. Unlike the original Devil May Cry, which requires good knowledge of every ability at Dante's disposal, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is a little less hardcore, meaning that even newcomers will instantly have fun unleashing elemental magical attacks and avoiding enemy techniques while they get to learn the intricacies of the combat system, which features plenty of advanced techniques, including a satisfying Issen critical attack with a strict timing that can kill enemies in a single blow. The fixed camera angles, sometimes, don't provide the best view in combat, especially against the powerful but incredibly memorable boss encounters, but even this flaw is part of the charm of the experience. Combat in the remaster is greatly enhanced by a new feature that allows Jubei to switch between different weapons on the fly, removing some of the downtime of the original, as weapons could only be swapped via the menu in the PlayStation 2 release.</p>
<p>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny couldn't be releasing at a better time. With the next entry in the series still a ways off, this remaster will be an excellent way for veterans to get re-acquainted with the unique quirks of the franchise as well as for newcomers to understand why the series is so beloved. Jubei Yagyu's war against Nobunaga Oda will return on May 23rd on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

        <p>You shouldn't actually panic, though</p>

            <p>
What is a video game NPC, if not a scared creature that needs a bit of help? That's exactly what the just announced PANIK cuts right to the core of, and I've been charmed by it quite quickly. In PANIK, there are Panikers, which are a type of scared creature that are just so unbelievably anxious they cannot move from where they stand. This is where you come in, a, uh, well they didn't name the player character so I'll just keep saying you.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You, both the real you and this video game you, have to find different ways to get the Panikers to move. As the trailer quite deftly demonstrates, that might be as simple as moving right up to them on its simply designed but pleasing to look at isometric, square layout, calming them down instantly.
</p>

<p>This can even have a chain effect, as long as they all stand roughly adjacent to each other. Once they're calm enough to move themselves, you can guide them to specific chequered squares, which there might be more than one of. Fill them all up, and you've completed a level!
</p>
<p>
According to a press release, every Paniker you meet brings about a new mechanic, so you'll have to come up with new solutions every level. There's more than 100 of those, by the way, so it sounds like there's lots to dig your teeth into. Honestly PANIK is really giving me the vibe of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game you find and get sucked into during an IT lesson because who needs to learn about Excel again.
</p>
<p>
PANIK doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2749610/PANIK/">Steam</a> here. Or, alternatively, if you fancy just a taste of it, you can try out an earlier version of it on <a href="https://chumasgames.itch.io/panik">itch.io</a>, which is quite good even if it's short!

It’s a lengthy explanation for what Bethesda itself defines as a remaster and why it chose to take the path that it has. As the developer thanked those who are playing Oblivion for the first time or revisiting it, it outright said it “never wanted to remake it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We never wanted to remake it – but remaster it – where the original game was there as you remember playing it, but seen through today’s technology,” Bethesda explained.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio’s clarification arrives as fans not only (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-images-leak-from-developer-website">officially</a>) see Oblivion Remastered for the first time but also go hands-on, too. It’s out now, bringing visual changes across the board alongside a few fundamental gameplay tweaks.

The last decade has indeed been polluted by video game remasters that mostly focus on minor visual improvements, but Bethesda is still hesitant to call its Oblivion re-release, which it started working on in 2021, a full-on remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We looked at every part and carefully upgraded it,” Bethesda continued. “But most of all, we never wanted to change the core. It’s still a game from a previous era and should feel like one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know many of our longtime fans will be thrilled to revisit Oblivion and the land of Cyrodiil.

And The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion generated plenty of those memories for a lot of Xbox 360 owners. I’m one of them. I worked at Official Xbox Magazine at the time, and for whatever reason, the hugely successful port of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind to Xbox never quite hooked me. But right from the jump, Oblivion – which was initially planned to be a day-one launch title for the second Xbox – did. We did multiple cover stories on Oblivion leading up to launch – the screenshots alone blew everyone away – and I eagerly volunteered for each trip out to Bethesda in sleepy Rockville, Maryland. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, when it finally came time to review Oblivion – and this is back in the days when exclusive reviews were a common, accepted thing – I again eagerly jumped at the chance. I returned to Rockville one more time and holed up in a conference room in Bethesda’s basement for four days. I spent four consecutive – and glorious – 11-hour days almost literally living in Cyrodiil, spending almost every waking moment inside this stunning, wide-open, next-gen medieval fantasy world. Before I boarded my return flight home, I’d clocked 44 hours prior to penning OXM’s 9.5 out of 10 review of Oblivion, which I wholeheartedly stand by to this day. It was an incredible game, filled with gripping quests (Dark Brotherhood, anyone?), off-the-beaten-path surprises (if you know about the unicorn, you know), and so much more. Because I was playing a submission build at Bethesda – meaning, a mostly finished version of the game on an Xbox 360 debug kit rather than a regular retail console – I had to start over when I got my final boxed disc copy of the game I’d already put about two full real-life days into.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I dropped another 130 hours or so into The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion without hesitation,so it’s probably no surprise to hear that I’m absolutely thrilled it’s been remastered and re-released on modern platforms. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For the younger generation of gamers who grew up on Skyrim, the just-released The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered will be their first “new” mainline Elder Scrolls game since Skyrim first released.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, I’m envious of the whole generation of younger gamers who grew up with Skyrim and thus, that is The Elder Scrolls for them. Because for them, the just-released The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered will be their first “new” mainline Elder Scrolls game since Skyrim released (for the first of many, many times) over 13 years ago – while franchise fans of all ages continue to wait for The Elder Scrolls VI, which is likely another 4-5 years away.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although if I’m being honest, I doubt Oblivion will hit the same way for them as it did for me in March of 2006, because, for starters, it’s a two-decade-old game (side note: shout-out to Bethesda for delivering this week instead of waiting an extra year when Oblivion will hit its far-more-elegant-sounding 20th anniversary instead of just having passed its 19th). Other games have built upon what Oblivion did, including several by Bethesda itself: Fallout 3, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Starfield. And second, it just doesn’t pack the same visual punch that it did in 2006, when I’d argue it was the first true <em>next-gen </em>game of the HD Era ushered in by the Xbox 360. Obviously the remaster looks better than the original release – that’s the point, of course – but it doesn’t stand head and shoulders above nearly every other game as something that you’ve never seen before. By definition – or at least in practice – remasters aim to make an older game look modern on current platforms. It’s a sharp contrast to a proper remake a la Resident Evil, which carries the expectation of starting from scratch and, in turn, looking as good or better than anything else on the market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was the right game at the right time. By taking full advantage of HD televisions and expanding the scope and scale of what gamers could expect from an open-world game, it was a punch in the face to console gamers who, up to that point, had spent their entire gaming lives seeing their interactive worlds through an interlaced 640x480 television. (Although speaking of punches in the face, prior to Oblivion’s March release, in February 2006, EA released Fight Night Round 3, which was jaw-droppingly gorgeous itself.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My memories of Oblivion are plenty, as it was a world with so much to discover and so much to do. For first-time Oblivion players, let me give you a recommendation: either blast through the main quest as quickly as possible, or save it until you’ve exhausted every last sidequest or open-world activity. Why? Well, the Oblivion gates will start randomly spawning and pestering you once you start down that main questline’s path, so for my money it’s best to seal them off straight away. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, the technological leap made from Morrowind to Oblivion might not ever happen again – though I suppose if we wait long enough for The Elder Scrolls 6, maybe it will. But at the very least, playing Oblivion Remastered won’t present such a staunch difference from any release of Skyrim, and for that I suppose those same younger gamers who grew up with Skyrim won’t get what I had. But no matter if you’re playing Oblivion for the first time or you’ve clocked hundreds of hours with it, its fully realized medieval fantasy world and the surprises and adventures contained within it have always made it my favorite Elder Scrolls game. And I’m thrilled it’s back, even if its surprise release was spoiled many times over before it finally showed up again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

Its goal is to remake the 2006 RPG The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion entirely within The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's game engine. It's an impressive effort that has been in the works for several years. In February, TESRenewal suggested that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-the-fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrims-engine-will-launch-in-2025/1100-6529672/" data-ref-id="1100-6529672">could be released this year</a>. Shortly thereafter, rumors of an official Oblivion remaster and remake began to swirl.</p><p>As it became clear that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was real and launching soon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">Skyblivion Project Lead Rebelzize said</a>, "for the community it's a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year," of the situation. Earlier today, Bethesda and Virtuos officially announced and released The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Rather than issuing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/four-years-later-60fps-bloodborne-patch-gets-taken-down-by-sony/1100-6529174/" data-ref-id="1100-6529174">cease and desist</a> for Skyblivion, Bethesda acknowledged the team's work and provided the members of TESRenewal with free codes for the remaster.</p><p>Skyblivion is expected to be released sometime in 2025 and will be available on PC to owners of Skyrim: Special Edition, the original Oblivion, and its DLCs. The Elder Scrolls IV: Remastered is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-bethesda-microsoft-bds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a move equal parts surprising and totally expected (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23880264/bethesda-oblivion-dishonored-3-fallout-3-leaked-documents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for literal years</a>), Microsoft shadow-dropped its not-so-secret <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster today. Cool, great. Also, it does not need to exist, and you do not need to buy it.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft, Bethesda, and Virtuos’ remaster of <em>Oblivion </em>is perhaps one of the least necessary in history considering the 19-year-old RPG’s still-active modding scene, a hallmark of Bethesda’s lineage that will always put its games at odds with the idea of a remaster. The most visible effort sprouting from this verdant, bloom-lit landscape is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skyblivion.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Skyblivion</em></a>, a fan remake of <em>Oblivion </em>inside <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>. After over a decade in development, <em>Skyblivion </em>is set to release… later this year. In a show of grace, the <em>Skyblivion </em>team <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skyblivion.com/post/3ln3xolvwg22j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a statement</a> a few days before the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster’s official reveal:</p><blockquote><p>We want to emphasize that there is no need for comparisons or a sense of competition between <em>Skyblivion </em>and a potential official remaster. Both projects can exist and thrive together, offering unique experiences for players. <em>Skyblivion </em>is a labor of love, built by a dedicated community for the community, offering a distinct way to revisit <em>Oblivion </em>within the familiar framework of the Creation Engine. Similarly, an official remaster would undoubtedly bring its own set of advancements with the full funding of a development studio. We see this not as a conflict, but as a fantastic opportunity for <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fans to have even more ways to enjoy the classic world of Cyrodiil.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This still raises the question of why Microsoft and Bethesda deemed the remaster necessary, the answer to which is obviously money. And regardless – or precisely because – of how it impacts the companies’ almighty balance sheet, there’s simply not a good reason to buy a shiny, $50 version of this specific game that you probably already own. As we’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written about previously</a>, Microsoft now finds itself in the crosshairs of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement for its glaringly apparent complicity in Israel’s ongoing ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, especially where its Azure cloud services are concerned.&nbsp;</p><p>"To pressure Microsoft, boycott Microsoft’s consumer products whenever possible (including Microsoft gaming services), demand your institutions divest from Microsoft, and exclude the company from contracts," <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft#why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reads the movement’s page</a> on Microsoft, which it has declared a "priority target."</p><p>As a reporter, I recognize the inevitable complexities that arise when choosing whether to engage with works produced by systems and companies that are exploitative or, in this case, worse. I imagine that I, personally, will be forced to spend more time and energy agonizing over exactly how to cover future Microsoft releases – and I will feel grateful, on those occasions, that I’m working for a publication with the support necessary to stand by its convictions and write about games critically rather than as simple products.</p><p>But beyond that, purely from a consumer’s perspective, this one’s easy! <em>Oblivion </em>is almost two decades old. And in addition to the modding scene I mentioned above, which essentially allows the original game to self-revitalize on a regular basis, this remaster is coming out during a new-release avalanche. In the past month or so alone, we’ve gotten: <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/assassins-creed-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/schedule-1-game-early-access-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Schedule 1</em></a>, <em>Runescape: Dragonwilds</em>, <em>Promise Mascot Agency</em>, <em>Lost Records: Bloom And Rage</em>,<em> Split Fiction</em>, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/wanderstop-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wanderstop</em></a>, <em>Atomfall</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/two-point-museum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Two Point Museum</em></a>, and so many others that it’s nearly impossible to keep track.</p><p>None of those scratch the <em>Oblivion </em>itch? Pick up one of the dozens of interesting indies inspired by old-school Bethesda games, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574240/Dread_Delusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dread Delusion</em></a>, whose gleefully alien worldbuilding puts recent Bethesda fare to shame. It only has a few thousand Steam reviews. You probably missed it when it came out last year. You probably missed hundreds of good games when they came out last year – and the year before, and the year before.</p><p>Everybody is posting about the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster today, and over 100,000 people are playing it on Steam. But in a couple days – probably when the review embargo lifts on the next big game that’s about to come out, realistic France simulator <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> – they’ll stop. That’s one of the few upsides of living through this era of Peak Media: Whatever your reasons, be they budget or boycott, you can always just skip the thing everybody is talking about. Give it a day or two, and there will inevitably be something else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kowloon-generic-romance"><h3>Kowloon Generic Romance Is The Closest Anime Has Come To A Wong Kar Wai Film</h3></a><p>Longing, nostalgia, and an unconventional sci-fi tale make for a not-so-generic anime romance

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-10/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There are more than 100 notes to find in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, and it's worth your time to seek out all of them beyond just doing it to get the achievement.</p>
<p>Arguably, the storytelling in South of Midnight is its strongest aspect, and each note adds strong context to the storytelling that would otherwise be missed. Of course, you can still have a great time with the story if you didn't find all of them, but the experience is so much more enhanced if you do.</p>
<p>This guide will show you where to find all of the notes hidden in Chapter 10.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 10</h2>
<p>Thankfully, it's easy to clear all the notes in Chapter 10 as there are only five to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Hope's Crossing Homecoming</strong> - Soon after the first combat encounter of the level, you'll reach a point where you'll see a hole for Crouton to enter to your right. Go left instead, and you'll find this note and a Floof knot waiting for you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sleep and Smoke</strong> - After Crouton grabs your first Spindle, grapple across the gap and stick to the right past some exploding mushrooms. This note will be on the wall as blue art in the broken house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Close Call</strong> - After interacting with the first firefly tree, follow the strands left and see a set of echo stairs to enter an old house. Enter the house and you'll find this note on the wall to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Grand Wedding</strong> - From the first firefly tree, go right and turn right again when you reach a bushel of exploding bramble. Directly ahead, you should see a grapple point leading to a broken-down house, where you'll find this note on the wall on the left.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Flower Child</strong> - Once you're inside Honey's home, you'll find this final note on the back wall of his cave.</p>
<p>That's where all five notes are found in Chapter 10. What's especially helpful here is that most of these notes are on the main path anyway; you just have to pay attention to the walls around you as they're all notes in the form of the blue art that's seen throughout South of Midnight.</p>
<p>If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, then you'll have found 74 notes out of 103. Only 29 more to go.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-updates-magic-gathering-commander-ban-list-and-game-changer-brackets</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizards-of-the-coast-updates-magic-the-gathering-commander-ban-list-and-game-changer-brackets.1170807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-updates-magic-gathering-commander-ban-list-and-game-changer-brackets<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Changes are coming to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Commander ban list. Wizards of the Coast's new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-takes-over-commander-format-following-abuse-to-rules-committee" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">format panel</a> has announced changes to the most popular way to play the acclaimed card game. In addition, changes are coming to its Game Changers brackets.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/commander-bans-and-restrictions-april-22-2025" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast's Gavein Verhey updated the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander ban list. Like all prior ban list updates, these changes are in response to changes in the competitive meta of the game and are done to facilitate engaging, ongoing matchups.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-sway-of-the-stars-card-artwork.jpg?itok=fwdBUvKU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-sway-of-the-stars-card-artwork.jpg?itok=iuvD08x0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To that end, five cards are being removed from the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander ban list. Yes, these five cards are Commander-legal again. They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Gifts Ungiven</em></li>
	<li><em>Sway of the Stars</em></li>
	<li><em>Braids, Cabal Minion</em></li>
	<li><em>Coalition Victory</em></li>
	<li><em>Panoptic Mirror</em></li>
</ul><p>The post continues, explaining the reason for these unbannings. <em>Sway of the Stars</em>, while a potent reset option, has too high of a mana cost compared to other more impactful effects. Similarly, <em>Coalition Victory</em> takes too much time to set up. It is an auto-win if you have one of every color, but simply removing one of those lands from the field means eight mana spent for nothing.</p>

<p>These <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander ban list changes occurred alongside changes to the Game Changers bracket system. In <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/commander-brackets-beta-update-april-22-2025" rel="nofollow">another blog post</a>, Verhey explained the connections between the ban list and these updated brackets.</p>

<p>Generally, the Game Changers bracket is a list of cards that have a huge impact on play. These cards are broken up into five brackets, each one denoting different levels of competitive play. Bracket one, Exhibition, is casual play. Bracket five, CEDH, is highly competitive and built with the current meta in mind. The system is currently in beta and still receiving player feedback.</p>

<p>It is thanks to the (mostly positive) feedback that Wizards of the Coast is making some slight adjustments to what cards are in what brackets. Two cards are being removed from the list: <em>Trouble in Pairs</em> and Trinisphere. Alternatively, eighteen cards are being added to Game Changers. Those cards are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Teferi's Protection</em></li>
	<li><em>Humility</em></li>
	<li><em>Narset, Parter of Veils</em></li>
	<li><em>Intuition</em></li>
	<li><em>Consecrated Sphinx</em></li>
	<li><em>Necropotence</em></li>
	<li><em>Orcish Bowmasters</em></li>
	<li><em>Notion Thief</em></li>
	<li><em>Deflecting Swat</em></li>
	<li><em>Gamble</em></li>
	<li><em>Worldly Tutor</em></li>
	<li><em>Crop Rotation</em></li>
	<li><em>Seedborn Muse</em></li>
	<li><em>Natural Order</em></li>
	<li><em>Food Chain</em></li>
	<li><em>Aura Shards</em></li>
	<li><em>Field of the Dead</em></li>
	<li><em>Mishra's Workshop</em></li>
</ul><p>These Game Changers brackets are not official ban lists for any format of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. They are intended to give players a rough estimation of how competitive their built deck is. If you want to play more casually, brackets 1-3 are just fine. If you expect to enter any major tournaments however, brackets 4-5 is your floor.</p>

In a free world, all <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> heroes would be playable no matter how annoying they might be to face off against because sometimes them's the breaks. We don't live in a free world though, not anymore at least, as <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24178102/a-new-mode-new-hero-and-new-rules-in-season-16/">Overwatch 2 season 16 starts today</a>. Most notably it's introducing its new mode Stadium, but also something that'll change up the competitive aspect of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> quite a bit: hero bans.

This isn't like something in your local fighting game tournament where one TO just really has it out for Marth or whatever and has decided no one can play as them, it's a built in feature. Before you jump into a match of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, either side will be able to vote to ban up to four heroes from play. Both sides get to vote for two, and no more than two per role can be banned. 
</p>
<p>
An official blog post says this is to "add an extra layer of mind games before the real fighting begins", though your mileage may vary depending on who you play with. It does seem like a good way to mix up the meta at least, but as with all new features I'm sure it'll see some tweaks further down the line.

Of course, as mentioned, season 16 also introduces Stadium, a new third-person mode where you're locked into one hero, vying to win the best of seven rounds. Game director Aaron Keller recently described the mode as Overwatch's third pillar in an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/overwatch/559233/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-blizzard-interview">Polygon</a>, so expect this one to be heavily promoted for a while.
</p>
<p>
There's also a new DPS hero, Freja, who has a fancy cross bow and can move around real fast like. Skins wise, Juno is getting a Dokiwatch-themed mythic skin, Overwatch's take on the magical girl genre, and there's some heavy-metal themed skins for characters like Ashe and Lifeweaver. You know, the usual Overwatch seasonal stuff!
