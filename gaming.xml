            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-the-lake-house-dlc-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Remote Control.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Under any other circumstance, The Lake House would sound like a nice spot for a serene summer getaway. In this case, though, it’s the setting for the second and final installment of Alan Wake II DLC, so it is naturally anything but. There’s no rest and relaxation to be found here, only another double-fisted dose of flashlights and firepower in this tightly paced two-hour tour inside the cold, concrete walls of a remote Federal Bureau of Control facility. In raw gameplay terms, The Lake House is not as eccentric a departure as Night Springs was a few months’ back, but as far as closing the book on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II’s</a> story and providing a bridge to the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> goes, it’s yet another meta-storytelling slam dunk for the team at Remedy Entertainment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Alan Wake II: The Lake House Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You might remember The Lake House from the main <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II</a> campaign, or at the very least the exterior of its grounds since it’s found behind a locked gate in Cauldron Lake near where the murder victim is found at the start of Saga Anderson’s story. This FBC research facility was strictly off-limits to Saga, but in this new chapter we’re able to fully explore it as returning FBC Agent Kiran Estevez. I liked Estevez in the main campaign and was happy to spend some time in her shoes, but the real show-stealing performances here come from the husband and wife scientist team of Jules and Diana Marmont. Initially I was laughing out loud at the petty bickering between them that occurs in the facility’s welcome video, but their relationship evidently took a much darker turn as evidenced by the many memos and emails I pored over as I continued my engrossing investigation inside the sinister shapeshifting structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The facility itself is only five floors, but thanks to its proximity to the Altered World Event in Cauldron Lake and the disturbing research experiments conducted by the Marmonts, The Lake House is as consistently unsettling a space as anything from the main <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II</a> campaign. One floor finds Estevez caught in a disorientating loop, another has shifting canvases splashed in abstract Jackson Pollock-style sprays, while another still is just a near-never-ending room of ominously clattering typewriters, like a manifestation of the infinite monkey theorem minus the tiny simian scribes. It’s a superbly constructed bit of otherworldly office space that I delighted in exploring, whether I was thumbing through the chilling pages of another Alan Wake manuscript or having conversations with a possessed painting so angry it made Vigo the Carpathian from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/ghostbusters-2-1989">Ghostbusters II</a> seem like a portrait of a puppy dog.     </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Lake House is as consistently unsettling a space as anything from the main Alan Wake II campaign.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lake House is absolutely blanketed in an unnerving atmosphere, but it’s perhaps a little lacking as far as puzzles go. Aside from carrying battery cubes to electrical sockets, which stimulates the eye with its orange glow but isn’t particularly taxing on the brain, there are otherwise only a handful of computer passwords to figure out using calendar dates mentioned in memos and the like. These hackneyed hacking jobs are pretty easy to deduce, and it was a little disappointing that there was nothing new here to match the mind-bending magic tricks provided by Alan’s world-altering Angel Lamp in the main campaign.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Shadow Complex</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat against the shadow-cloaked staff of The Lake House is equally as straightforward for the most part, but it’s still extremely tense thanks to its typically claustrophobic close-quarters encounters. Estevez might be an FBC agent, but sadly she doesn’t possess the shapeshifting gun or superpowers that Jesse Faden wielded in 2019’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control">Control</a>. Instead, a pistol, shotgun, and a combination of flashlight, flares, and flashbangs are at her disposal, and I burned through every last round and spare battery as I desperately tried to illuminate and exterminate each sickle-slinging flanker and sledgehammer-swinging heavy that ambushed me along the way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of its main boss fight, there’s only one new enemy type to be found in The Lake House, but it’s a doozy. The long-limbed freaks that slither out of painted canvases seem like Remedy’s towering, tie-dyed take on the Slender Man, and since they seem immune to Estevez’s attacks I was going hard on the dodge button early on to frantically try and evade their outstretched clutches. Eventually Estevez gets her hands on a grenade launcher powerful enough to turn the tables on these paint-streaked Stretch Armstrongs, but that didn’t mean that dealing with them ever became too easy – grenade ammo is scarce, the painted shadows are slim enough that they’re somewhat easy to miss, and the fact you need to charge up each shot before you fire puts some added pressure into the timing of each takedown. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lake House’s challenge jumped up even further in its final boss fight – whose identity was a fun surprise from a story perspective – and it brought my brief return trip to the world of Alan Wake II to a dazzling and demanding denouement. My short stay in The Lake House was brutalist in its architecture and brutalising in its action, and although it’s bittersweet that my time with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II</a> has officially come to an end, the tantalising story teases of what comes next in the Remedy Connected Universe has me locked and loaded for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>.  </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The Lake House DLC is another spectacular and spooky slice of Alan Wake II action. It introduces some fantastic new supporting characters to the Remedy Connected Universe, as well as a terrifying new enemy type to overcome and some wonderfully eerie environments to explore. The challenge of its puzzles may be light, but its combat is still chillingly dark even despite the fact it’s not hugely different from that of the main game, and scouring for the many notes, videos, and audio recordings littered throughout its fear-inducing facility made for a genuinely gripping investigation. Funny, frightening, and full of surprises, The Lake House DLC is a tightly paced slice of psychological horror that serves as an absorbing addendum to Alan Wake II. </p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Alan Wake II: The Lake House DLC Review</h3><div data-cy="review-content"><p>great</p><p>The Lake House DLC is a tightly paced slice of psychological horror that serves as an absorbing addendum to Alan Wake II.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a world of first-person shooters, Rainbow Six Siege reigns as one of the greatest. The popular multiplayer extraction shooter has been popular since its release back in 2015, continuing to keep a steady player base and competitive fanbase. The game’s Ranked system has gotten increasingly popular with players, too.</p>



<p>Here are all the ranks in Rainbow Six Siege.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-ranks-in-rainbow-six-siege">All Ranks in Rainbow Six Siege</h2>



<p>Like many other games, Rainbow Six Siege’s Ranked system follows an element system, with Bronze, Copper and so on. Here is a list of all the ranks in Rainbow Six Siege and the Matchmaking Rating (MMR) needed to progress forward:</p>



<ul>
<li>Copper: 0 – 1,599 MMR</li>



<li>Bronze: 1,600 – 2,099 MMR</li>



<li>Silver: 2,100 – 2,599 MMR</li>



<li>Gold: 2,600 – 3,100 MMR</li>



<li>Platinum: 3,200 – 4,099 MMR</li>



<li>Diamond: 4,100 – 4,999 MMR.</li>



<li>Champions: 5,000 MMR.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>From Copper to Champions, ranking up in Rainbow Six Siege is no easy feat. Many players tend to give up early on, so pat yourself on the back if you have made it to Champions.</p>



<p>So, what is MMR?</p>







<h2 id="h-explaining-matchmaking-ratings-mmr">Explaining Matchmaking Ratings (MMR)</h2>



<p>Like all other games, Rainbow Six Siege has its own competitive rank points. Just like Fortnite used to have Arena points, Rainbow Six utilizes MMR. </p>



<p>MMR is a system of numerical points that begin at 0 and allow players to hit Champions rank when they reach 5,000 MMR. The points do not stop there, however, and continue to rise if a player does well in Ranked.</p>



<p>The game has two MMR scores, though. Your MMR is tracked separately in Unranked modes while also tracked in Ranked modes. This system is quite different than a lot of other competitive games, as many only track points in Ranked modes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-are-so-back.1017930/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/harpoon-97-micrporose-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I know this might be hard to believe from the comfort of 2024, but there used to be a big, competitive market for hardcore naval strategy games on the PC. <em>Harpoon </em>was the most popular of these games, and–I swear I am not making this up–back in the 90s it used to have prominent features in mainstream games mags, and even posters in video game stores.</p><p><em>Harpoon</em> was also a game that looked like this:</p><figure></figure><p>A series that has continued through the 2000s to look pretty much like this, <em>Harpoon </em>is a strategy franchise in the most traditional grognardy sense, forgoing any visual flair for the raw, weighty pleasures of math and authenticity. If other video games use graphics as a means of representing code and numbers, <em>Harpoon</em>--like other classics like <em>Gary Grigsby's War in the East</em>--only really cares about the numbers. If you have ever complained about a Paradox game being cold and unwieldy, you don't know shit. You are a small baby, a sweet child of summer.</p><p><em>Harpoon</em>, with its accounting software-like interface and myriad of systems it is trying to simulate, was a very tough nut to crack, but once a certain type of person willing to put in the work could crack it, it was by all accounts <em>great</em> (I tried, repeatedly, but was never that person.). Like I said, people still play the series today! So it's maybe not too surprising to hear that Microprose, exactly the kind of publisher who you would expect to bring <em>Harpoon</em> back in 2024, is bringing <em>Harpoon </em>back.</p><p>The publisher this week announced a re-release of a re-release of a re-release of the original 1989 <em>Harpoon</em>, which was remade in 1994 as <em>Harpoon Classic</em> then <em>again</em> in 1997 as this game, the one that's coming to Steam next month, <em>Harpoon 97</em>. The promo material says it features "new displays, updated scenarios, and a more intuitive interface", but I'm not sure if those are just the republished selling points from the 1997 press release, because take a look at <em>Harpoon 97's</em> trailer:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Harpoon Classic '97 - Publishing Announcement" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmop246H2kk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I must stress here that this is fine! Actually it's more than fine, it's expected: this is what this series and this genre looks like, whether you like it or not, and it would be really weird to play a <em>Harpoon </em>game and suddenly find yourself confronted with "graphics". Like 2023's <em>Rule The Waves 3</em> (see below), there's a certain throwback charm to this, and the people who will actually be spending money on this game wouldn't have it any other way.</p><div><figure><p>https://twitter.com/LukePlunkett/status/1659139438809870336</p></figure></div><p>(Besides, anyone who <em>does</em> want to play a modern naval combat game with graphics can just buy one of Microprose's <em>other </em>upcoming releases,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286220/Sea_Power__Naval_Combat_in_the_Missile_Age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Sea Power</em></a>.)</p><p>I'm excited for this! At least I am, conceptually! I'm sure I will once again try to play this game and once again fail to understand or enjoy it, but for me, that's beside the point. The point here is that Microprose is about to release something that people under the age of 25 wouldn't even think qualifies as a video game, where modern ideas like "art style" and "user experience" are nowhere to be found, and loads of people will enjoy it regardless. I think that fucking rules.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Roblox Corporation has announced changes to its child-safety policies that'll impact the way pre-teen users can interact with its popular gaming platform. The move follows persitent accusations the company routinely fails to protect its predominantly young player base, and, more recently, a damning report calling Roblox an "X-rated paedophile hellscape" that exposes children to "grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech".
</p>
<p>
Back in July, Bloomberg revealed Roblox had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation last year</a>, and that more than two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in-game. That was followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">report in August from short-selling firm Hindenberg Research</a> that, as well as accusing Roblox of deliberately inflating player numbers to investors, shared numerous examples of Roblox's apparent failure to keep children safe.
</p>
<p>
In both cases, Roblox hit back at the accusations, calling the Hindenberg Research report "simply misleading" and insisting the Bloomberg article contained "glaring mischaracterisations". But despite Roblox's constant protestations, the company has now announced numerous changes to its child-safety policies.

<p>
As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">reported by The Verge</a>, Roblox sent out an email to parents this week announcing that children under the age of 13 will soon need parental permission to access "chat features" by default, while children under nine will additionally need permission to play experiences with a content maturity rating of "moderate", which can include "moderate violence or crude humour". Roblox says these restrictions will be automatically lifted as users reach certain age milestones, assuming parents and users haven't already made changes manually.
</p><p>
Addtionally, Roblox is introducing a new type of account for parents next month that, when linked to their child's account, will let them update parental controllers from their own device, and get insights into their child's online activity and friends. The company calls these changes - which follow updated guidelines introduced in July requiring creators to label in-game experiences based on content types rather than age - part of its "commitment to making the platform one of the safest online environments for our users, particularly the youngest users".
</p>
<p>
Roblox has long been a controversial presence in gaming, as exemplified by People Make Games' accusation in 2021 that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-exploiting-young-game-developers-new-investigation-reports">Roblox is "exploiting" young developers</a> on the platform, with many of those developers under the age of 18. And Roblox CEO Stefano Corazza raised eyebrows earlier this year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-studio-boss-children-making-money-on-the-platform-isnt-exploitation-its-a-gift">telling Eurogamer</a> the company had "hired some teenagers that had millions of players", following up with the suggestion children making money on the platform isn't exploitation, it's a "gift". A Roblox spokesperson later contacted Eurogamer to stress the company does not hire minors, despite Corazza's assertions.

Turkey blocked access to Roblox in August, saying it was a necessary measure <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216300/turkey-blocks-roblox-instagram">to protect its children</a>. (Roblox said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/roblox-plans-open-office-turkey-if-access-platform-restored-2024-10-22/">this week</a> that it would open an office in the country if access was restored.) Earlier this month, a popular financial newsletter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262033/roblox-the-bear-cave-child-abuse">accused Roblox of enabling child abuse</a> and the investment firm Hindenburg Research <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report">alleged that</a> its “in-game research revealed an X-rated pedophile hellscape.”</p><p>As part of the changes, which <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-23/roblox-enacts-child-safety-changes-giving-parents-more-control?srnd=undefined">initially reported</a> on, users younger than 13 will have to get parent permission to access “certain chat features” while users that are younger than 9 will need their parents’ permission to play experiences that have a “moderate” content label. (That label means the experience may contain things like moderate violence or crude humor.) The company had already announced that it will be switching from <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8862768451604-Experience-Guidelines-and-Age-Recommendations">“experience guidelines,”</a> which rates experiences for specific ages, over to the new content label system <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/upcoming-changes-to-experience-guidelines/3070343">this fall</a>.</p><p>Roblox is also adding a new type of account that will let parents manage their kids on the platform. With the new parent accounts, parents can link their account to their child’s so they can update parental controls and access insights about their child’s Roblox usage, such as daily screen time and their Roblox friends. However, alongside these changes, Roblox won’t let parents set a PIN to <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000239523-Parent-PIN-General-Information">make changes to an account</a>, or use <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000375686-Account-Restrictions">account restrictions</a> to block a kid’s account from sending in-game chats or limit a kid’s account to only accessing experiences designed “for all ages.”</p><p>“The updates that were shared via email are part of Roblox’s commitment to making the platform one of the safest online environments for our users, particularly the youngest users,” Roblox’s Juliet Chaitin-Lefcourt tells <em>The Verge</em>. “We’re excited to share more information next month.”</p><div><blockquote><p><strong>New parental controls and insights are coming soon</strong></p><p>Dear parent,</p><p>We’ve been working on a series of important changes that we’ll be making to your child’s account, ____________, next month.</p><p><strong>About Roblox accounts with parent privileges</strong></p><p>Next month, we’re changing the way parents manage their child’s experience on Roblox by introducing Roblox accounts with parent privileges. After linking your account to your child’s, parents can view and update parental controls for their child all from their own device. Parents also get access to insights about their child’s Roblox usage, such as their daily screen time and on-platform friends.</p><p>Given these changes, starting next month, parents will no longer be able to set a parent PIN, use Account Restrictions, or receive account-related notifications to their parental email. Instead, you will need to use an account with parent privileges. Existing verified parental emails on child accounts will continue to be used for account recovery. Any settings previously set using a parent PIN will not change, but you will need an account with parent privileges to make updates going forward. </p><p>As always, if users are interested in an added layer of security on their account, you can set up <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/212459863-Add-2-Step-Verification-to-Your-Account">2-factor authentication</a>.</p><p><strong>Updated content maturity settings</strong></p><p>As we shared with the community in July, to help provide parents and users more clarity into the types of content available on Roblox, we’ll soon begin labeling experiences based on the type of content users can expect in an experience, rather than by age. Experience Guidelines will be renamed Content Labels, and you’ll be able to set limits on the type of content accessible to your child through the content maturity setting in parental controls.</p><p><strong>New default settings for users under the age of 13</strong></p><p>As part of Roblox’s commitment to safety, we are also updating certain default settings for our youngest users. Starting next month, users under the age of 13 will need parent permission to access certain chat features. Users under the age of 9 will also need parent permission to access experiences with content maturity “Moderate,” which may contain things like moderate violence or moderate crude humor.</p><p>Your child’s settings will be updated when they reach certain ages, if you and your child haven’t previously made changes to them. You and your child will be notified of these updates in advance.</p><p>We will share more information on these setting updates when the changes go into effect next month.</p><p><strong>Next steps</strong></p><p>To continue receiving notifications about your child’s account related to spending or other important activity, you’ll need to set up a Roblox account with parent privileges and link to your child’s account. When these changes take effect, your child will receive a notification inviting them to add a linked parent account, and we’ll send you an email with instructions.</p><p>Since day one, Roblox has been committed to building safety features and tools into the design of our products. We will always continue to explore different ways to update our parental controls to make them even more useful for parents.</p><p>Roblox</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-boss-talks-about-why-he-thinks-the-japan-studio-closure-wasnt-necessarily-a-surprise<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has been away from the company for five years now, but he's still got plenty to say about how things are going in Sony's gaming division. And in a recent interview at Gamescom Asia conducted by <a href="https://jp.ign.com/" data-cy="styled-link">IGN Japan</a>, he reflected on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reportedly-downscales-sony-japan-studio">2021 reorganization</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-japan-studio-restructure-mass-exodus-playstation">subsequent mass exodus of talent from Sony Japan Studio</a>, giving a bit of context as to why he thinks the dissolution happened in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remnants of Japan Studio were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-asobi-official-playstation-studios-dev-new-logo">recentered around Astrobot developer Team Asobi</a>, which later that year was moved into PlayStation Studios. Though Layden was not involved in any of the aforementioned decisions, having departed Sony in 2019, he still had thoughts on why the studio was effectively disbanded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That was sad," he said. "It wasn't necessarily a surprise. I love Allan [Becker, former head of Japan Studio], and he worked really hard, but there was so much legacy malaise. It's tough when a studio hasn't had a hit for a while, then they forget how that feels. You know, if you have a hit once it's it's like a drug, man, you're chasing the next one, right? And then if you don't have that for a while, you forget what it felt like, and then you start to forget how to get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There were probably two roads. One was the road they took. The other road was a real tough-love program. And maybe that's what the Team Asobi thing is. It's like pruning a bonsai, right? You get it back down to its nub and see if you can grow back out again."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden is referring to Japan Studio's struggles to produce a hit in the years leading up to its dissolution. Though Astro Bot Rescue Mission was considered a success (and likely factored into the decision to retain Team Asobi), Japan Studio had otherwise largely been relegated to support work after 2017's Knack 2 release. Layden doesn't think this problem was exclusive to Japan Studio, though:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And sadly, I think you can see that problem across the Japanese market," he continued. "Writ large, there's a lot of legacy, historically super talented teams that haven't tasted success for a while and are still struggling to get back to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But, you know, Capcom is prosecuting that problem fairly directly. I think Sega finds itself in a pretty good place. Bandai Namco has got some refactoring to do. Koei Tecmo has its market, owns that market, and they seem happy with that...How many different versions of FF7 have been made?! Square Enix. I think when they abandoned their overseas developer/publisher ambitions and brought it back to home truths, that was a good move for them, but it'll still take a while for them to get out of the woods."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trouble with Japanese development, said Layden, can be traced back to the PlayStation 3 generation. While Japanese teams like Square Enix, Namco, Konami, and Capcom owned the PlayStation 1 and 2 eras, the technical shift around the PS3 caused some legacy studios to struggle.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Writ large, there's a lot of legacy, historically super talented teams that haven't tasted success for a while and are still struggling to get back to it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the PlayStation 1 era, Takara Tomi was making money back then," he said. "They basically took their experience in the arcade business and translated it to the home, right? That was the selling point. PlayStation 1, Ridge Racer in your house, Tekken in your house. But the way you develop an arcade experience is completely different from how you develop a console experience. Now, PlayStation 1, they just translated it, and that seemed to be enough, because it was novel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[But] that skill set and expertise didn't really translate into the console experience. And then when you got to PS3, and you had the Cell processor, and how do you code for that? And it was no longer an upgraded arcade experience, it was a high-end PC experience you're offering at home. And I think that's where the disconnect came for a lot of Japanese developers. And Japanese developers have been struggling ever since to try to get back to the top of the top of Olympus."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The dissolution of Japan Studio was a sad affair. Its remnants, Team Asobi, have since been merged into PlayStation Studios and just last month released Astro Bot, which we gave a 9/10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end," our reviewer wrote. "A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-confirms-astro-bot-post-launch-speedrun-levels-and-special-bots-release-schedule">since confirmed</a> it will get post-launch speedrun levels and additional Special Bots, which have already begun rolling out and will continue on a weekly basis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a Senior Reporter at IGN. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Daniel Robson is Chief Editor of IGN Japan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/bernie-sanders-sykkuno-pokimane-valkyrae-austinshow-vtuber<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday evening, in a play that’s becoming increasingly common among both major American political parties, the Democrats once again leveraged the power of influencers in an attempt to reach young voters. This time, Bernie Sanders, the party’s favorite liaison for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these things</a>, to whom they refuse to listen where actual policy is concerned, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2282811318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined an all-star cast of left-leaning streamers</a>: Pokimane, Valkyrae, AustinShow, and Sykkuno, the latter of whom was using a vtuber avatar at the time. Senator Sanders, who is 83 years old, was not familiar with the concept.&nbsp;</p><p>Moments after Sanders joined the stream, Sykkuno decided to address the catboy-shaped elephant in the room.</p><p>"Normally I have a regular camera,” he said. “I have a skin condition, so I'm using this avatar."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Hah, OK," Sanders replied, clearly not having any idea what to do with this information.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sykkuno Represents The Vtubers During Call with Bernie Sanders, Mark Hamill, Hank Green &amp; Mark Cuban" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LkMeMOpXFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>"Do you know what a vtuber is? Have you heard of a vtuber before?" Sykkuno asked.</p><p>"Nope," said Sanders.</p><p>"I'm the first one [Sanders has encountered]!” Sykkuno proclaimed triumphantly. “Thank you so much for supporting vtubers."</p><p>The streamers went on to try to translate the concept of a vtuber for somebody who is old enough to at least hazily remember the end of World War 2.</p><p>"It's when they have this animated profile," said Pokimane, cosplaying as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/23/bernie-sanders-inauguration-meme-heres-the-story-behind-the-photo.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that one meme of Bernie Sanders sitting in a chair</a>.</p><p>AustinShow proceeded to stammer out an attempt at an apology, but Sanders found it within himself to play along.</p><p>"Well, there you are,” he said after a moment. “You're looking good. You're looking very good."</p><p>The rest of the appearance was more or less a standard Bernie stump speech. He talked about the threat Trump poses to democracy and took a harder-line stance on Israel than Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and others who are directly facilitating weapon sales to the genocidal rogue state, calling Biden “dead wrong” when it comes to Israel. He added, however, that Trump will almost certainly be worse on the issue. He also got to rant about healthcare, as is his way. It was a good showing from Bernie, albeit nothing remarkably new.&nbsp;</p><p>On YouTube, Valkyrae’s stream of the conversation pulled in over 10,000 concurrent viewers. On Twitch, AustinShow’s peaked at just under 7,000. It wasn’t much compared to <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adin Ross’ 580,000-viewer stream with Donald Trump</a> earlier this year, likely because Ross is an edgelord with a penchant for stunts like gifting Trump a Cybertruck emblazoned with a scene from his own attempted assassination while yesterday’s Sanders stream was about as safe as it gets. The Harris campaign has also <a href="https://aftermath.site/kamala-harris-twitch-stream-dnc-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched its own Twitch channel</a> and, perplexingly, aired a Tim Walz speech alongside <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/10/10/kamala-harris-twitch-tim-walz-world-of-warcraft-preheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>World of Warcraft</em> gameplay from a basically-unheard-of streamer</a>, to mixed results. Outside of more traditional media appearances, Harris herself has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5144874/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper-howard-stern-60-minutes-colbert-the-view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largely stuck to podcasts</a> like <em>Call Her Daddy</em> and <em>All The Smoke</em>. The Democrats’ best showing in this arena arguably came when Sanders sat down for an interview with popular comedian and influencer Theo Von in August, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video</a> that pulled in nearly 3 million views. But even that is dwarfed by Trump’s own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">variation on the theme</a>, which sits at 14 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Toward the middle of yesterday’s stream, another celebrity guest, Mark Hamill – aka Luke Skywalker – showed up. Sykkuno reprised his bit from earlier in the broadcast, asking Hamill if he knew what a vtuber was, and Pokimane once again explained the basics.</p><p>“Like Sykkuno, who looks like a cat,” said Hamill after Pokimane finished her explanation.</p><p>Sykkuno later asked the same question to Mark Cuban, an old rich person who somehow already knew what a vtuber is. Cuban then tried to take credit for the creation of Twitch, at which point I decided I’d had enough and went to go do something else.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Digital consoles now comprise 18% of total life-to-date unit sales of PS5 hardware.”</p><p>Sony’s last reported sales figures for the PS5 as of August indicated 61.7 million total units sold. That means roughly 50.6 million of those were disc-capable models and only 11.1 were all-digital. Microsoft doesn’t release official numbers for Xbox sales, but data firm <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuZtbsSrdwo&amp;t=90s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuZtbsSrdwo&amp;t=90s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aldora Intelligence told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a></span> last month that it estimated about 28.3 million Xbox Series X and S consoles had sold so far, which is in line with other reports of the PS5 outselling them roughly two to one. Using Circana’s percentages, that comes out to roughly 13.9 million all-digital Series S consoles and 14.4 million of the Series X. By a narrow margin, both are still more prevalent than the disc-less PS5.</p><p>Why is that exactly? One reason could be that unlike the Series S, which is normally only $300 and frequently on sale for much less, the digital-only PS5 started at $400 and actually got a price <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803">hike to $450</a></span> when the new slim model replaced the launch edition. The console is even more expensive in Japan, where Sony recently raised the price even more. Sold separately, the optical drive is $80, making it more expensive than the $500 PS5 with a disc drive already installed for anyone who decides to upgrade later. </p><p>Another reason could be that even though most players are buying games digitally, many of them still own older games from the PS4 generation physically, or want to have the option of using their PS5 to watch Blu-rays. Even if they never actually pop a disc into their console, the habit of doing so in the past might be driving players to opt for consoles with disc drives, at least for now. It’s also worth noting that certain games, especially first-party Sony blockbusters like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842?_gl=1*6k2bly*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTcwNTkxOC4xNy4xLjE3Mjk3MTI0ODAuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842?_gl=1*6k2bly*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTcwNTkxOC4xNy4xLjE3Mjk3MTI0ODAuNjAuMC4w"><em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, sold more copies physically</a></span> than digitally. </p><p>Maybe this proves that even if players continue opting for the convenience of digital downloads, they’ll still keep the dream of physical games alive by continuing to opt for consoles with disc drives. Based on the numbers above, all-digital PS5s and Series S combined only make up 27 percent of the current high-end console install base, and we’re already approaching the end of the four-year mark of this generation. Then again, maybe the data is just a lagging indicator demonstrating a last gasp of old gaming habits rather than enduring preferences. That’s certainly the story the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-physical-game-low-sales-digital-1851218453&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-physical-game-low-sales-digital-1851218453">gaming section at your local big box store would tell you</a></span>. </p><p>There’s already fear that both Sony and Microsoft could move to all-digital consoles being the <em>only</em> option at some point in the future. Some analysts have predicted that Microsoft will make that jump with its next console, while Sony waits one more generation to do so. In the meantime, physical games make up an ever shrinking part of the market, but they still sell tens of millions of copies every year. As long as there are at least <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ask-kotaku-do-you-still-prefer-physical-games-1844822211&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ask-kotaku-do-you-still-prefer-physical-games-1844822211">some diehard fans</a></span> out there buying them, maybe console manufacturers will have an incentive to keep including disc-drive options. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>RLCS (Rocket League Championship Series) has officially announced its 2025 schedule, after a successful Championship event in Dallas last month. Here is everything we know now about the RLCS 2025 competitive schedule.</p>



<h2 id="h-official-2025-rlcs-schedule">Official 2025 RLCS Schedule</h2>



<p>Ready for another year of competitive Rocket League? Luckily, the 2025 RLCS season is just around the corner, and fans are already calling their picks for teams and players they foresee winning it all.</p>



<p>But what will the actual schedule look like?</p>



<h4 id="h-2025-rlcs-in-person-tournament-schedule">2025 RLCS In-Person Tournament Schedule:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>RLCS Major 1:</strong> Birmingham, United Kingdom from March 27-30</li>



<li><strong>RLCS Major 2:</strong> TBA from June 26-29</li>



<li><strong>Rocket League World Championship:</strong> TBA from September 16-21</li>
</ul>



<p>The 2024 Rocket League World Championship was held in Fort Worth, Texas just a week after the Fortnite Global Championship, which was held in the same arena. It will be interesting to see whether or not they host next year’s Championship in America or decide to host it overseas.</p>



<p>Those looking to attend the RLCS Major 1 will be able to purchase tickets as early as October 30, 2024, at <a href="https://www.theticketfactory.com/">theticketfactory.com.</a></p>







<h2 id="h-2025-rlcs-prize-pool">2025 RLCS Prize Pool</h2>



<p>While we do not know just what the official prize pool for the championship event will be, we do know that the entirety of the RLCS season will have $5,000,000 in prizing. How that prizing will be split up, however, is unknown.</p>



<p>The series will be made up of more than just the three in-person events, though. There will be plenty of online events for players to compete in, so get prepared.</p>



<p>Will you be watching or competing in the 2025 RLCS season? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has confirmed to Eurogamer a new Rayman project is currently in the "exploration phase" at its Montpelier and Milan studios, following recent online reports that work has begun on an unannounced Rayman remake.
</p>
<p>
Word that a Rayman remake is in development first surfaced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rayman-remake-team-prince-of-persia/">via Insider Gaming</a>, which claimed the game - reportedly codenamed Project Steambot - was "being pieced together" by a team that included around a dozen members of Ubisoft's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> team.
</p>
<p>
More controversially, the site reported Rayman creator Michel Ancel is also working the project as a consultant. Ancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-quits-video-games-industry-to-work-on-wildlife-sanctuary">left Ubisoft in 2020</a> after 30 years with the company, allegedly following an investigation into employee complaints accusing him of toxic leadership - with his behaviour said to have been so bad additional managers were called in to act as intermidiaries between Ancel and his team. Ancel publicly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-says-michel-ancel-left-ubisoft-amid-investigation-into-his-toxic-behaviour">dismissed the report</a> as "fake news", but Insider Gaming claims his recent involvement as a consultant on the new Rayman project has "cast a less-than-popular light" on its development and "raised some concerns among team members".

<p>
Eurogamer contacted Ubisoft for clarity on the situation and received the following response from a company spokesperson: "We are pleased to confirm Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan have recently started an exploration phase on the Rayman brand. The project is still in its early stages, and we will share more details later. As creator of the Rayman brand, Michel Ancel is being consulted to ensure consistency within the universe."
</p><p>
Regardless of the reason for Ancel's involvement, it's unsurprising Ubisoft's hiring decision has reportedly unnerved employees given his exit in 2020 came amid a dramatic reckoning for the company - one that followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-addresses-allegations-against-multiple-staff-investigating-further">wave of serious allegations from staff</a> regarding toxic work conditions, and that lead to the departure of multiple members of senior management.
</p>
<p>
Word of a new Rayman project at Ubisoft follows confirmation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-development-team-disbanded">the team behind this year's acclaimed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has been disbanded</a>. And while some of its members are now said to be working on Rayman, Insider Gaming claims others have been moved to Ubisoft's long-in-the-works Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 and the next Ghost Recon.

In fact, it’s one of the most popular games in the world right now. <em>Seriously</em>.

That would make it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the third-most popular game on Steam</a></span>. And based on some recent messages from folks who work on <em>DTI</em>, it seems a lot of those people were using the hotdog costume to make penises. </p><p>On October 22, <em>Dress To Impress</em> community manager Beaplays <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BeaPlaysRBLX/status/1848839932141240717&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BeaPlaysRBLX/status/1848839932141240717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed on Twitter</a></span> that the hotdog costume had been “temporarily” removed from the game due to “inappropriate usage.” It seems some folks were changing the hotdog to a flesh color and popping a pink or brown hat on top to create an outfit that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Numerou14390151/status/1847822578359972259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Numerou14390151/status/1847822578359972259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looked a lot like a penis</a></span>. </p><p>“Just an update in case you haven’t already seen. The hotdog costume will be temporarily removed from DTI due to inappropriate usage. We plan to bring it back later with limitations on how you can color it/couple it with other items to reduce this,” posted the community manager. </p><p>They also confirmed a new cupcake costume has now been added to <em>Dress To Impress</em>. The hotdog is planned to return with more restrictions in November and when it returns the devs will try to make it so people can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@jakeysdti/video/7428241202614406432?_r=1&amp;_t=8qnBsUOLwHG&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jakeysdti/video/7428241202614406432?_r=1&amp;_t=8qnBsUOLwHG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still create the Duolingo Owl mascot. </a></span></p><h2 id="h38694"><a id=""></a>Not the first time <em>Dress To Impress </em>players were warned</h2><p>Funnily enough, the community was warned about this already. On October 21, the day before the digital wiener was removed, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/studiozacc/status/1848497268703313958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/studiozacc/status/1848497268703313958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>DTI’s</em> development manager said</a></span> that the devs had noticed people using the hotdog costume to create naughty outfits. So they removed the option for people to change its color and said that if the hotdog continued to be “misused” it would be removed. </p><p>“We want to create a safe and friendly environment for our players and it was not intended to be used this way,” said the manager. <br></p><p>“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/studiozacc/status/1848532044394958879&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/studiozacc/status/1848532044394958879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creativity is the point of the game</a></span>, and we see a lot of tweets that prove that. But, we just can’t give other outlets to something this serious. We love all of your creativity with it (besides the reasons we are removing it..) but it’s better for us and for the community just to end it ASAP” </p><p>But this is the internet and if you give people the ability to create digital dicks, they’ll do it and keep doing it until either you stop them or they get bored. We shall see how long the hotdog will stick around when it returns. I’m going to say about two days. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review">Wingspan review</a>, Matt Thrower writes "As you might have gathered, Wingspan is a moderately complex game, certainly more so than most of its peers who’ve made the jump into wider popularity. But it’s clear from the success of the game that its delightful components and appealing theme are more than enough to get many players to take the plunge. And, once there, they’re won over by the absorbing and addictive strategies on offer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wingspan is a very accessible game for both casuals and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">enthusiasts</a>. Its design is gorgeous, featuring over 170 detailed bird illustations by Elizabeth Hargrave, charming game board backdrops, and cute little tokens and egg minatures. The rules are easy to follow, and each game lasts about an hour, so you won't need to carve out a huge chunk of time to play it. </p></div><p id="splendor"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Splendor">Splendor</h2></p><div catalogid="7081af7a-201a-46cb-8bbd-72bebe48deeb" id="209599"><div id="209599" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Splendor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another excellent game worth mentioning in this sale is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QODo1n?object_uuid=91c2fde0-d70b-4814-8082-9cf022b634c9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Splendor</a>, which is down to $17.99 after the 25% off coupon is applied.

            <p>I'd rather command a small troop of ruthless husks to fight my battles than do the dirty work myself - and in the game [<em>Weyyyyyy! -RPS staff</em>]. That's reason number one as to why I'm interested in Skull Horde, an "auto battler dungeon crawler" which casts you as a necromancer in a tiny pixel art world.
</p>
<p>Reason number two is that it's coming from the developers of the explosively moreish Bore Blasters. Find a teaser trailer below.

<p>Skull Horde's fights take place in real-time, with your minions fighting for you autonomously. Your job is to choose where and when to explore and to make sensible decisions when upgrading your squad. You can purchase new units to build a troop of synergistic types, or buy multiples of the same unit to merge them into stronger versions, which eventually leads to unlocking special abilities. There's also obviously loot to be found in the dungeon via chests and shrines, which can further enhance or adapt your minions.
</p>
<p>The necromancer you play as, by the way, is a flying skull. I like that.
</p>
<p>I don't feel I have space in my life for an action-RPG anymore, at least not one of the Diablo or Path Of Exile variety. An auto battler with a more immediately rewarding dopamine drip, however, is compelling.
</p>
<p>I'm encouraged after having spent last week playing Bore Blasters, (the appropriately named) 8BitSkull's previous game. It casts you as a dwarven ship captain drilling deeper underground in search of gems and upgrades and its power curve is a swiftly traversed straight line. It's theoretically a run-based roguelite, with progress carrying over between runs, but it has at least as much in common with incremental games, particularly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/to-the-core-contains-interplanetary-mining-with-the-spectacle-of-vampire-survivors">To The Core</a>. Alice B <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bore-blasters-review">liked it too</a>.
</p>
<p>Skull Horde is aiming for release in 2025 and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199360/Skull_Horde/">there are more dark screenshots over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

During the event players can claim a total of four cosmetic items from the shop, and they can experience a special kind of Shrine thanks to Meat or Treat.</p><p dir="ltr">Announced in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24150148/join-a-macabre-celebration-in-sanctuary" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a>, the event runs from October 29 to November 5, with a new free item getting added to the shop each day from October 29 to November 1. On each of those days at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET a new item will be released, including a new mount, mount armor, and two mount trophies that can be claimed. All of these items will be available to be claimed until the end of the event.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4389645-d4items.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389645" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4389645-d4items.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389645"></a><figcaption>Four items will be added to the shop for free over the course of the event, which can be claimed until the event ends on November 5.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4389645-d4items.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to the free cosmetics, there is also a small in-game event called Meat or Treat, which affects Shrines found in dungeons in Diablo 4. While the blog post doesn't specify exactly what happens, Shrines in Dungeons can have an extra effect, including one that promises "unexpected riches" and another that is heavily implied to involve The Butcher, a tough boss enemy that occasionally spawns in dungeons. Based on the description, it sounds like the bad outcome will spawn The Butcher, which could result in a swift death.</p><p dir="ltr">Diabo 4's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, launched earlier this month alongside Season 6.

The tabletop designer spoke out against bad faith, culture war-motivated review bombing of the licensed tabletop game. This caused an additional wave of harassment leading him to delete certain social media posts.</p>

<p>Eric Lang made a social media post on Bluesky on the launch and critical reception of the <em>Mass Effect</em> board game. The post stated that he was proud of the property and was "so endlessly tired" of manbabies review-bombing the game over the inclusion of pronouns on squadmates' character sheets.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mass-effect-board-game-eric-lang-bluesky-post.jpg?itok=Vmu_tH2K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mass-effect-board-game-eric-lang-bluesky-post.jpg?itok=vKufcuHQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These posts included a ratings breakdown of the reviews on BoardGameGeek. It had a healthy mix of positive reviews, a few middling, and a large number of 1/10 reviews bringing down the review average.</p>
<p>Shortly after, co-designer Calvin Wong Tze Loon posted an updated ratings list with the negative reviews gone. In a post thread, Lang asked if BoardGameGeek removed the "waaahh pronouns" reviews from the site. Loon responded, "idk, none of the 1s have comments." Lang replied, "I feel perfectly safe in assuming the motivations."</p>
<p>Within minutes,a new wave of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/416266/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz/ratings?rated=1&amp;comment=1">negative reviews</a> went live. As of right now, the <em>Mass Effect</em> board game is sitting at a 5.0 out of 10.</p>
<p>The majority of these reviews are clearly motivated by bad-faith actors, acting out of spite toward Lang's comments. Review comments include phrases such as "This game sucks. The developer called customers names," "not a game for man babies such as myself" and most tellingly, "I do not have time to spell this out again. Curious was my previous review was removed."</p>
<p>Eventually, Lang deleted these social media posts. As for why this was done, a more <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericlang.bsky.social/post/3l76uvi54vw2r" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent post</a> may provide context. Lang states that death threats are reported to authorities and he will show any violent and aggressive DMs publicly without hiding poster names.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it is clear that Lang deleting his posts wasn't him reconsidering insults towards a fanbase, but a result of targeted harrassment by an anonymous mob motivated by culture war talking points regarding the normalization of gender identity.</p>
<p>As for our official review of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mass-effect-board-game-review-back-to-reaper-war" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em></a> board game, we enjoyed it. The game is compact, blends skirmish combat with branching narrative paths, and captures the spirit of the game, even if the story it tells "feels like a cut mission<em>."</em></p>

Black Ops 6 simplifies the grind to remove the leveling requirement previously needed to start unlocking the base Military camos.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Step_one__Military_camos">Step one: Military camos</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389589-militarycamoref.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389589" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389589-militarycamoref.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389589"></a><figcaption>Military camo challenge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389589-militarycamoref.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each weapon features nine Military camos unlocked sequentially by reaching progressive milestones in each mode. For most weapons, these are progressed by earning:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> Headshots</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Zombies:</strong> Critical Kills</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Warzone: </strong>Eliminations</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Military Camos <strong>must be unlocked individually for each weapon</strong>. For example, if you've unlocked the first multiplayer Military camo (Granite) for the AMES 85, it can be equipped to the AMES 85 across all modes, but it can't be equipped to any other weapon until you've separately unlocked the Granite camo with that weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">To get started and view the camo challenges, you'll want to choose a weapon, select the Gunsmith, and tab over to the Customize section. This is where you can view camos, stickers, and weapon charms for customizing your weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you have completed all of the Military camos for a specific weapon, you can then move on to step two, which is unlocking its Special camos.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Step_two__Special_camos">Step two: Special camos</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389592-specialcamo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389592" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389592-specialcamo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389592"></a><figcaption>Special camo challenge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389592-specialcamo.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Complete all nine Military camo challenges for a weapon in your mode (MP, Zombies, Warzone) of choice to unlock the Special camo challenges. Each weapon has two unique "Special camo Swatches" per mode that can only be earned with that weapon. Special camos can be unlocked in any order once you've gained access to them, and each has a different unlock criteria, usually related to the strengths or playstyle of the weapon you're progressing.</p><p dir="ltr">Once unlocked, Special camos are universal and can be equipped to any weapon, as long as that new weapon has completed the Military camos and unlocked access to the Special category in at least one mode. It can then be fitted with any Special camo you like and used in any game mode you like.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Step_three__Mastery_camos">Step three: Mastery camos</h3><p dir="ltr">With all Military camos and both Special camos unlocked for a specific weapon, your weapon Camo grind can finally begin with the Mastery camo challenges. Each mode (MP, Zombies, Warzone) has four unique Mastery camos to unlock. Just like Military camos, Mastery camos must be unlocked individually for each weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">You don't have to complete them for all modes either. This is <strong>three separate Mastery camo grinds</strong>, so you can pick and choose which modes you want to focus on.</p><p dir="ltr">We highlight all the Mastery camos and specific requirements below.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6___Multiplayer_Mastery_camos">Black Ops 6 - Multiplayer Mastery camos</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Gold_camo">Gold camo</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389594-gold.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389594" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389594-gold.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389594"></a><figcaption>Gold camo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389594-gold.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Gold is the first mastery challenge you unlock once you complete the Military and Special challenges for a weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">The Gold camo unlock requires you to complete an individual challenge tailored to each specific weapon, so these objectives will vary from weapon to weapon.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Diamond">Diamond</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389595-diamond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389595" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389595-diamond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389595"></a><figcaption>Diamond camo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389595-diamond.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To unlock the Diamond mastery challenge, you need to first complete all of the Gold camo challenges for all the weapons in the same weapon class.</p><p dir="ltr">So, for example, you'll need to complete all the Gold challenges for the assault rifle class in order to unlock the Diamond challenge for assault rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">This gives you an individual Diamond challenge tailored to each specific weapon, so these objectives will vary from weapon to weapon.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Dark_Spine">Dark Spine</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389632-darkspine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389632" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389632-darkspine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389632"></a><figcaption>Dark Spine camo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389632-darkspine.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Dark Spine is an animated camo.

			<p>Today, Bethesda Game Studios shared some very exciting news for Fallout 76 players as part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEIjbxhnHps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Fallout Day Broadcast</a>. The game will receive its first proper MMO style endgame raid, Gleaming Depths, with the December update. It was described as a mysterious underground research laboratory located in the Ash Heap where the Enclave once studied radioactive Ultracite.</p>
<p>Players who dare to venture into the Gleaming Depths will find out why the laboratory has been abandoned and face off against the beasts and bots that remain in the radiation-ridden lab in five challenging encounters. The Gleaming Depths will require a squad of four well-equipped Fallout 76 players to be completed. The final encounter, the Ultracite Terror, was described as the biggest boss in the game and possibly in the entire franchise.&nbsp;The game will also be updated to allow the crafting of four-star Legendary gear, which is certainly going to help in the raid.</p>
<p>That's not all, as more MMO-style features are being added. Player Titles are made up of two parts that are earned separately and can be combined in countless ways to make your title unique. Moreover, as requested by the community, C.A.M.P. Pets are being introduced with the Gleaming Depths update. As a start, Bethesda is adding the most two beloved human pets: a dog and a cat. These loyal pets will hang out in your C.A.M.P. and can interact with special pet furniture, such as a pile of bones for the dog. Players may, of course, pet them and customize accessories such as their collars.</p>
<p>Finally, Bethesda reminded everyone that Ghoul player characters are still coming in early 2025. Ghouls will be immune to radiation damage; actually, radiation will heal them and even unlock some unique abilities. They won't have a hunger or thirst meter. Instead, Ghouls must keep an eye on a new feral meter, though turning feral for a little while may prove beneficial.&nbsp;Ghouls are also getting some specific perk cards. But there are drawbacks: some factions do not take kindly to Ghouls, although there may be ways to fool them.</p>

<p>Fallout 76 is also enjoying a free-to-play week on all platforms through October 29, and there are discounts for Atoms (the in-game currency) and all Fallout games on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation stores.</p>

Despite years of stalled production punctuated by high-profile departures and tragedy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-lives-and-its-a-prequel-1796032984?_gl=1*1dmrw0u*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTcxMDMxMy4yMDYuMS4xNzI5NzEyODE5LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-lives-and-its-a-prequel-1796032984?_gl=1*1dmrw0u*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTcxMDMxMy4yMDYuMS4xNzI5NzEyODE5LjYwLjAuMA..">the ambitious open world sequel</a></span> remains in development and continues its slow march forward under new leadership. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196918" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="196918,196572,195326" data-current="196918"><div><p>Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22475.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The co-op, space pirate follow-up to the cult-hit sci-fi 2003 game made its big debut at E3 2017 with hands-off demos the following year. Those presentations made lots of promises about its procedurally generated planetary cities, third-person action combat, and seamless transition to outer space, and were led by <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> creator Michel Ancel and senior producer Guillaume Brunier, neither of whom are still with the project.</p><p>Ancel left Ubisoft in 2020 amid reports of toxic leadership and chaotic direction (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rayman-legends-remake-ubisoft-prince-persia-lost-crown-1851679621&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rayman-legends-remake-ubisoft-prince-persia-lost-crown-1851679621">although he’s now back consulting on a new <em>Rayman project</em></a></span>). Brunier was removed from <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> earlier this year, sources told <em>Kotaku</em> at the time, following years of gridlock and indecision about scope, features, and design trade-offs. Taking his place was Francis Coldeboeuf, a nearly 30-year veteran of Ubisoft who had already been working on the game as a producer. </p><p>“Guillaume Brunier will transition to another project within Ubisoft,” a spokesperson for Ubisoft told <em>Kotaku </em>back in July. “We’d like to thank Guillaume for his leadership in developing the game over the years. His contributions and dedication have been truly admirable. <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> development will continue under the leadership of Francis Coldeboeuf, a seasoned Producer who was already part of the core team. We will have more to share when the time is right.”<br></p><p><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> was also still recovering from the loss of its creative director last year. Emile Morel, who had previously been the lead game designer on <em>Rayman Legends</em>, tragically passed away at the age of 40 in July 2023. It was a shock to everyone, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/beyond-good-evil-2-creative-director-emile-morel-dies-at-40&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/beyond-good-evil-2-creative-director-emile-morel-dies-at-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with testimonials from colleagues pouring out at the time</a></span> to celebrate his leadership, creativity, and kindness. In addition to the emotional pain, the loss added to the cloud hanging over the project for some. </p><p>Now, Fawzi Mesmar, who had already been involved in overseeing the project as VP of Global Creative at Ubisoft, has also taken over Morel’s role as creative director. “With more than 20 years as an award-winning game designer and creative director, he’s been instrumental in the successful launch of over 20 video games,” a spokesperson for Ubisoft confirmed to <em>Kotaku </em>today. “Mesmar previously collaborated with the<em> Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> team as VP of Editorial. In his new role, he’s focused on continuing to build upon the vision set forth by our late friend and colleague, Emile Morel.”</p><p><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> has now been in development for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-has-broken-duke-nukem-forevers-record-for-longest-game-development-time/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-has-broken-duke-nukem-forevers-record-for-longest-game-development-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even longer than the notorious <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em></a></span>. Many publishers would have canceled the troubled money pit long ago, and some developers within Ubisoft still see it as a drain amid belt-tightening that has forced the cancelation of plenty of other projects. The company hasn’t cut its losses yet though, and it’s possible that seven years since it was first shown at E3, it could still climb out of development hell. <br></p><p>The game recently successfully passed an internal milestone with positive feedback from company leadership, according to two sources familiar with production. While there’s still a lot of work ahead, at least some developers on the project feel like it may have finally found its footing and a clearer direction after years of tech issues and internal power struggles. Some of those issues culminated in mass burnout at the studio leading the game’s development, Ubisoft Montpellier, which ultimately resulted in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-ubisoft-montpellier-assassins-creed-1850164420&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-ubisoft-montpellier-assassins-creed-1850164420">a government investigation and the managing director leaving</a></span>. </p><p>While turnover on the project has been immense over the years, <em>Insider Gaming</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported today</a></span> that some of the former staff on <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> have moved over to <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em>. There’s still no solid timeline for the game’s release but what is clear is that the game is far from dead. That’s hopeful news for fans of the original game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-beyond-good-and-evil-2-remaster-tweet-leak-june-1851551287&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-beyond-good-and-evil-2-remaster-tweet-leak-june-1851551287">which recently received a 20th anniversary remaster</a></span>, though it’s impossible to say whether the sequel itself will have been worth the wait if and until it finally comes out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/first-ever-fallout-day-broadcast-reveals-fallout-76-ghoul-gameplay-camp-pets-and-teases-fishing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has held its first ever Fallout Day broadcast, using it to reveal more of what’s coming to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Day is today, October 23, because in Fallout lore the Great War started and ended on October 23, 2077 when nuclear weapons devastated the world. But there were no explosive announcements around new Fallout games or megaton reveals for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a>, which Bethesda has said is in the works, potentially after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. Instead, Bethesda developers talked about new features for MMO Fallout 76.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda began its broadcast by saying it’s seen more players in Fallout this year than ever before, setting record numbers across almost every title in the franchise. Fallout 76, now approaching its sixth anniversary, has passed 20 million players, a figure achieved earlier this year off the back of the explosive popularity of Prime Video’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout TV show</a>. To coincide with Fallout Day, Bethesda said you can play Fallout 76 for free until October 29 as part of a free play week.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/screenshot-2024-10-23-163748-1729697882518.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>You will be able to play Fallout 76 for free until October. Image source: Bethesda.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Onto the new features, and Fallout 76 is finally getting camp pets later this year. The feature kicks off with two pets: a cat and a dog. As you’d expect, you can pet them. But beyond interacting with your camp pets, you can dress them and place furniture such as scratching posts or a bone-filled dirt pile for them to enjoy. Bethesda teased the addition of new pets later on, “and maybe some that are not so furry.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also coming in December are player titles. These include a prefix and a suffix you can combine to create your nickname. Player titles are earned as rewards.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/screenshot-2024-10-23-163901-1729697950243.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Endgame players will get access to the upcoming Gleaming Depths raid. Image source: Bethesda.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For endgame players, there’s the upcoming Gleaming Depths raid, a traditional MMO-style dungeon set to challenge the hardcore. You’ll need to be level 300-ish plus, and you’ll need an organized, well-equipped squad of up to four players to have any chance of making progress, Bethesda added. This raid is set in an abandoned Enclave research lab, and includes the Ultracite Terror, a final boss that’s basically a giant irradiated snake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, 4-star legendaries are coming to Fallout 76, offering the highest tier weapons and armor in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bethesda has announced, coming early 2025 for the first time in Fallout history, you’ll be able to transform into a ghoul. During the Fallout Day broadcast, Bethesda showed off ghoul gameplay and revealed how it works.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/screenshot-2024-10-23-164050-1729698064026.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>After the Ghoulificaiton quest you will no longer have to worry about radiation damage. Image source: Bethesda.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you hit level 50 and complete the Ghoulification quest, you’ll no longer have to worry about radiation because you’ll be immune to radiation damage. In fact, rads heal you and unlock unique abilities. This also means you don’t have to worry about needing to eat to live, but instead of hunger and thirst you’ll have a new feral meter to keep an eye on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Going feral has a few perks of its own, such as turning into a crazed berserker, a hand-to-hand combatant who can “rip the face off a Deathclaw.” Ghoul-specific perk cards include Battle-Genes (while in combat, gain 1HP per second). Bethesda said the ghoul will hopefully open up dozens of new playstyles, given how differently it works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are unique narrative options, too, that revolve around the various factions’ hatred of ghouls. The Brotherhood of Steel hate Ghouls, for example, so expect a tough time from them. For Ghoul players who still want to complete story quests with factions that normally wouldn’t ally with a Ghoul, “there may be a way to fool them,” Bethesda teased. If you don’t get on with being a ghoul, you can revert back to a human. Bethesda said it’s hoping to see ghoul parades and ghoul camps when ghouls go live in Fallout 76.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/screenshot-2024-10-23-164221-1729698170145.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>If you don't get on with being a ghoul, you can always revert to being a human. Image source: Bethesda.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, Bethesda teased fishing in Fallout 76 — a feature players have asked to be added to the game for years now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fallout Day broadcast ended with Bethesda development chief Todd Howard thanking fans for their support and saying the studio is looking forward to more Fallout even after 20 years working on the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
