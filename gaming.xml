            <p>So, an ambitious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> multiplayer mod called CyberMP has been in development for a little while now, and the folks behind it have just concluded its "most stable and successful" closed beta test yet. Tweaks to key elements like vehicle and player synchronisation, as well as a new interface and custom lobbies went down well with testers, while technical gremlins were minimal.</p>
<p>If this is your first time hearing about CyberMP, it's a project that's currently being worked on by a team of 10, having first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod-gains-traction-following-successful-playtest">come to prominence</a> last summer. Its goal is to offer multi-person deathmatches and races to Cyberpunkers, rather than full GTA Online-style co-op missioning or gigging.</p>

<p>That brings us to now and the mod's latest closed beta test, which the modders had <a href="https://discord.com/channels/868154037332226058/924208769309761567/1404067462986731571">previously teased</a> would be a "pivotal stage in the project's evolution". As shown off in the video above, the CyberMP team invited a group to give some races and shootouts a go, as well as cruise around Night City.</p><p>According to the modders' <a href="https://discord.com/channels/868154037332226058/924208769309761567/1444762474581590148">latest Discord post</a>, the key goals included making sure progress had been made on getting players and vehicles to sync up seamlessly, with the CyberMP folks having reworked both systems. Thankfully, that work's paid off, with characters and cars reportedly translating more smoothly across players' screens, while moving about on foot feels "more responsive".</p>
<p>Also under the microscope were a new interface overlay, which provides everything from chat functions to the ability to teleport around the world, and the option to create custom lobbies for the mod's races and battles. Finally, testing out a new JavaScript module and how CyberMP runs on Linux were on the to-do list. The modders say all went well, adding in terms of those last two technical bits: "several minor bugs that were found have already been fixed, and we will continue working on optimisation".</p>
<p>"In summary, we can confidently say this was the most stable and successful test in the project’s history," the CyberMP team wrote. "Over the few days, only a handful of game client crashes were recorded, some of which were not directly related to the CyberMP client. All discovered gameplay bugs have either already been fixed or are being fixed now. We feel we’re reaching a new level and are preparing for even more extensive changes."</p>
<p>As of writing, the mod's still without a release date, but its creators did tease here that more updates on on the way soon. So, I guess all we can do is keep out weird robo-eyes peeled for news of when multi-merc meetups might open up to everyone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Gulag became a popular meme when Warzone first released, and Fortnite could be set to bring its own version of the infamous battle arena to the colorful world.</p>



<p>‘1v1 me in the Gulag’ is a line (and meme) associated with the Covid era. Many took shelter from the pandemic in their homes and sank hundreds and thousands of hours into CoD Warzone as a means of escape. Warzone’s Gulag became the new Rust, and whenever you died in Warzone, the Gulag was your main entry point back into the game.</p>



<p>Now, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-bus-wheels-pump-n-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> Gulag could finally be following suit.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-gulag-takes-inspiration-from-call-of-duty-warzone">Fortnite Gulag Takes Inspiration From Call of Duty: Warzone</h2>

<p>It’s fair to say that Fortnite doesn’t need to copy anyone’s homework. Epic’s shooter is still ridiculously popular nearly 10 years later, and keeps finding ways to freshen up the gameplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 7 Season 1</a> brought <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-leaks-reveal-driveable-reboot-vans-bots-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">driveable reboot vans, a Bots Mode</a>, along with a wingsuit, and many other ideas. According to renowned leakers Shiina and <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX"></a>HYPEX (through <a href="https://x.com/l3stei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@l3stei</a>), a Fortnite Gulag is on the way.</p>







<p>It will reportedly be called ‘Restarter Island’ and will have players compete in a series of mini-games to determine the winner. The traditional Gulag is basically a quick 1v1 gunfight where it’s the first player to eliminate the other.</p>



<p>In Fortnite, you will allegedly battle in Rock, Paper, Scissors, some kind of Shockwave Grenades mini-game, and more.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>FORTNITE GULAG SYSTEM COMING SOON</p><p>– Called "Restarter Island"<br>– Includes Rock, Paper, Scissors<br>– Classic rules, best of 3<br>– Shockwave Grenades granted over time, used to knock opponents off their platforms</p><p>(via <a href="https://twitter.com/l3stei?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@l3stei</a>) <a href="https://t.co/1oEgYmWwVp">pic.twitter.com/1oEgYmWwVp</a></p></div>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1994896784154661265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>

<figure></figure>



<p>Fortnite does feel like an amalgamation of every top battle royale idea at this point, and why not? Millions of players still hop in every day. As long as it’s implemented right and in a fun way that doesn’t detract from Fortnite, is a new Gulag a good idea?

As an encore, Team Cherry has confirmed that there will be DLC released for Silksong. Just don't expect it too soon.</p><p>"I don't really know what else people would necessarily want to hear other than what we're already saying," Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "Yes, we're continuing to work on the game, we're pursuing the things that excite us ... I think what people might want to hear is: There will be new stuff coming in a reasonable timeframe and not seven years from now."</p><p>Gibson went on to explain that he and Team Cherry co-founder William Pellen "might have some vague ideas" for the DLC, but added that he didn't want to "overpromise" and underdeliver to the game's fans. He also teased the return of Steel Assassin Sharpe, an enemy character from the first game.</p><p>"[Sharpe is] just waiting in the wings," said Gibson. "Waiting to arrive is probably the best way to say it. One of those enemies, a little suite of Sharpe and their companions, they got tucked away for a while because the game had so much in it. And all of these pieces need polish, and polish takes time. We're excited to reintroduce Sharpe. We just have to get to them."</p><p>In the meantime, Team Cherry has continued to support Silksong with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">PC patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>, and an update that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-new-patch-finally-nerfs-the-muckmaggots/1100-6536098/" data-ref-id="1100-6536098">nerfed the Muckmaggots</a> and replaced the game's unpopular Chinese translation with a fan-made translation that has been much better received than its predecessor.

Team Cherry also explained that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-is-harder-than-hollow-knight-and-its-hornets-fault/1100-6534856/" data-ref-id="1100-6534856">the reason Silksong is so difficult</a> is because they made the leading character, Hornet, so powerful.</p>

But these NPCs aren't necessarily smarter because they're AI. In fact, players have discovered some easy-to-exploit loopholes in the chat model that convinces NPCs to hand over their side-quest loot or money even when you haven't done anything at all.</p><p>Players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1p13j9w/at_first_i_tried_to_speak_normally_to_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> noticed that the AI-powered chatbot NPCs often put their emotional responses and actions in parentheses. That led to the discovery that telling an NPC that you did something to fulfill their quest inside of a parentheses will cause the NPC to believe you've already done it. And the game rewards players for that deception by having the NPC hand over whatever item they promised the player for their help.</p><blockquote><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1p13j9w/at_first_i_tried_to_speak_normally_to_the/" rel="nofollow ">At first, I tried to speak normally to the chatbots, but then I realized you have the power of (divine truth)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Proximis/" rel="nofollow ">u/Proximis</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/" rel="nofollow ">WhereWindsMeet</a></blockquote><p>While Everstone may eventually fix that workaround, it's not the only way to mislead the NPCs. Another user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1p5aqyk/the_metal_gear_method_unironically_works/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> found that repeating the NPC's last statement as a question can eventually wear it down until it hands over the item. The user called it, "the Metal Gear method."</p><p>While the AI chatbots may be technically superior to standard NPC behavior, traditional NPCs wouldn't fall for the same tricks due to their programing. They simply don't have the option to do or say anything outside of their scripted dialogue and actions. The NPCs of Where Winds Fall currently lack those limitations that would have protected them from this exploit.</p><p>Where Winds Meet had its official launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile earlier this month.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/</link>
            <guid>1368952</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Q3 earnings call for CD Projekt Red revealed a ton of fun details. One of the most eye-catching statements mentioned The Witcher 4, letting us know it’s not releasing in 2026, but giving us a full launch window for the three new The Witcher games.</p>



<p>It feels like a millennium has passed since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 3</a> launched. The RPG of a lifetime will go down as an all-time great, and after the development of Cyberpunk 2077, its release, and the vast clean-up operation following its debut, we’re all ready for The Witcher 4 and beyond.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-trilogy-releasing-over-6-years">The Witcher Trilogy Releasing Over 6 Years</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It looks great already. Credit to CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-hits-new-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 has hit a new sales milestone</a>, showing the incredible turnaround of the game’s fortunes following its horrific 2020 release. Phantom Liberty was another hit, but it’s high time CD Projekt Red turns its full focus back ot The Witcher franchise.</p>







<p>During the company’s <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 earnings call</a>, speaker Michał Nowakowski (Joint CEO at CDPR) was asked: “Can you share more detail about where you are in The Witcher 4 development process? What are the key technical/design risks that could shift the release window?”</p>



<p>Nowakowski respodned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re not disclosing any details regarding the target release date, so there’s not a point in time I could refer to when answering such a question. The only think we’re commenting is that we’re not launching in 2026, and we’re also not typically getting into any specifics regarding technical or design matters. There’s nothing out of the ordinary, I’d say, in that area happening with TW4 – it’s just full scale production proceeding at its pace, as per our internal plans. I think that’s as much as we can say.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was probably to be expected, as you’d imagine CDPR doesn’t want to repeat the mistakes of Cyberpunk 2077. On the other hand, it was quite surprising to learn that CDPR intends to stick with its trilogy release plans:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time – as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between TW4 and TW5, between TW5 and TW6 and so on.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Again, The Witcher 4 in 2026 would be great, but the year is going to be stacked enough with games. As for the remaining games in the trilogy, as long as they’re well-made and exude that typical CDPR premium quality, three full-scale The Witcher games in six years would be special. Let us know if you think this is unrealistic, and you can do so through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/01/duskpunk-review/</link>
            <guid>1368943</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Duskpunk is a dice-based RPG putting you in a world where misery roams the streets of the city of Dredgeport, thanks to a combination of a seemingly never-ending war, criminal gangs, and the sway of the most powerful including the Emperor. You are a nobody who somehow escaped the butchery of the Front, but need to find your footing in a city where luck is thin and where relationships can turn sour quickly.</p>
<p><iframe title="Duskpunk release trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EcXl0rwyjWo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You have a choice of four classes in Duskpunk – Veteran, Writer, Criminal and Engineer – each of which has different starting stats. The veteran is a solid pick if you want to fight your way out of situations, with the disadvantage of not having the charisma or intuitiveness to find other solutions. The criminal class is for those who want to sneak around and use intuition. Engineers can construct workarounds for problems but are useless in a fight, while writers use their words to win arguments and bring people round. As you progress through Duskpunk you will earn ability points by completing tasks to up each skill, so can raise all of the stats to deal with most situations, as well as earning additional abilities.</p>


<p>Duskpunk’s gameplay is similar to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/04/citizen-sleeper-episode-purge-review/">Citizen Sleeper</a>, but with different issues to keep track of and worry about. &nbsp;Groat, the game currency that you use, is a big one as it will determine if you can buy food, shelter, and drugs to deal with stress. Groats go as quickly as they come, so you won’t ever feel financially comfortable. Stress can be raised by pushing beyond your character’s limits and through nightmares. As the stress meter builds, dice faces break, meaning your rolls as less likely to give you good outcomes. Initially, the only way to reduce stress is to take a drug which is expensive and hard to acquire, but as you explore more of Dredgeport different ways to reduce stress open up including meditation and talking to others. A wanted level can also appear depending on your actions, so you have to figure out ways to evade the authorities before they catch you. Health is another attribute to watch and if reaches zero then a skill becomes broken. These skills can be fixed by recuperating, but that costs time and Duskpunk is a game where time matters a lot.</p>


<p>You will find yourself mixing with different factions through Dredgeport, each with their own goals, from controlling the drug business, unionising, all the way too toppling the government. As you become familiar with these groups you will be given aims, aka missions, to undertake which can vary wildly from handing out pamphlets to digging up corpses. A majority of the aims are time sensitive and it doesn’t seem possible to complete them all, so you need to decide which factions appeal to your character more.</p>
<p>The representatives of each of these factions, such as Zai of the Machinists and Dresden of the Lich Dealers, are decently written but, for me, did not quite have the depth to pull me in to build a real connection with them. There are some powerful groups in Duskpunk, but the decisions you make are what really impacts the wider world, even through inaction or not completing an aim. While there are a number of choices to make, there are only a few real that your actions can lead to. It offers some replayability, but also shows that some actions you take will not have an overbearing impact on the final outcome, though they can impact the fate of individual characters.</p>

<p>A bit more of the world treating you as a just one person where events happen without your involvement would have been good too, making Dredgeport feel more like a real city that moves around you and not because of you. The story is pretty engaging and does explore a number of themes including workers rights, the balance of power in society, isolation, segregation, and survival. Again it is not the most in-depth look at these themes, but Duskpunk does provide an accessible way to learn about these issues and tie them to our own experiences.</p>

<p>For much of Duskpunk, you will either be looking at a map of Dredgeport to pick locations to visit, or reading the conversations you have with the different characters to advance the game. I like the user interface of Duskpunk, finding it easy to navigate and understand. You have the map, the aim journal, and an inventory to show what you are carrying. Aside from groats, you can also trade rumours, tip-offs, and rare goods for money or influence. The characters are nicely drawn too with each one having a really distinctive look, while the map has small details like birds flying around, the flow of the river, and smoke rising from the factories. A lot of work has gone into making the world seem alive, even if it is a map.</p>

            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have announced that an extraordinarily low number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> games were ruined by cheaters in a recent blog post.</p>
<p>The post, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251">shared on the Battlefield Comms Twitter account</a>, broke down the performance of EA's Javelin kernel-level anti-cheat. Roughly 98 percent of online matches in the first week post-launch were cheater free in Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>Part of the anti-cheat's success has been attributed to the "invaluable" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">Battlefield 6 open beta</a>. EA states that over 1.2m cheat attempts were blocked. In addition, users' adoption of Secure Boot leaped from 62.5 percent to 92.5 percent, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bios-shock-getting-past-battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-error-was-the-faffiest-thing-a-pc-game-has-ever-required-of-me">a feature that proved frustrating for many</a> but nonetheless is core to Battlefield 6's anti-cheat system.</p>

</figure>
<p>EA stated the anti-cheat efforts continue, with the total block figure now up to 2.39m (each block meaning an individual attempt to use cheating software). Sadly, there are still 1.5 percent of impacted players unable to activate Secure Boot on their PCs, meaning they can't actually launch and play Battlefield 6 even after troubleshooting efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, EA is aware of 190 cheat-related programs, hardware, vendors, and resellers. The post states: "183 of them (96.3 percent) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely."</p>
<p>The post concluded by laying out a variety of steps the EA team will take to improve the anti-cheat moving forward, the war between cheaters and anti-cheat software being an endless struggle. Still, as it stands today, these are impressive statistics that show Battlefield 6 should be a largely fair and enjoyable game to play online. Here's hoping EA can keep this momentum through to the foreseeable future.</p><p>

Battlefield 6 remains very popular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-dominates-steam-charts-ahead-of-worldwide-release-as-analyst-estimates-over-100m-in-pre-launch-sales">even as the staggering launch drifts into the past</a>. If you've not tried it out yet, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Eurogamer's Battlefield 6</a> review to get an idea of what EA's latest AAA shooter is like.

            <p>Over the weekend, The Game Awards organiser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> set social media tongues wagging with three words: regal.inspiring.thickness.</p>
<p>No, despite what I first thought, these are not the three words he used to describe himself on his Tinder profile. Rather, they link to a location via a What3Words address. And, that location leads to a spot near Joshua Tree, California.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As you can see in the image I took this morning from the What3Words app, regal.inspiring.thickness is a rather barren looking area in California.</p>
<p>Well, at least, it may have once been, but others have since ventured forth to the spot, and discovered a large and rather imposing statue now standing proudly in a field in the Mojave Desert, on the corner of 29 Palms Highway and Yucca Mesa Road.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The statue itself shows a group of demonic creatures all surrounding a hellish-looking portal type design. This portal area lights up at night, as you can see via the second image below, with a fiery and quite ominous glow.</p>
<p>Many have surmised that this is all part of a tease for The Game Awards 2025, which is set to kick off later this month, on 11th December. But, what is it teasing exactly? The current most popular theory out there is an expansion or something similar for Blizzard's Diablo series. The statue's hellish iconography certainly would fit the bill.</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Via X</cite></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Others have speculated the statue could be related to God of War, with earlier rumours suggesting the series would be heading to Egypt. Housemarque's next game Saros has also been mentioned in various replies and social media posts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many wishful thinkers have suggested it could be a statue leading up to a big Elder Scrolls 6 reveal, or perhaps a new Doom installment. I have also seen others mention Half Life 3.</p>

<p>Whatever it may all end up being, there is not too much longer to find out. The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Leading the nominations at this year's event is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">which is up for 12 awards</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-control-trademark-sparks-speculation-remedy-will-be-making-a-the-game-awards-announcement">trademark for something known as Control: Resonant was registered in Europe</a>, leading many to speculate developer Remedy has something up its sleeve for The Game Awards.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Players Are Finding Black Division and RUAF Fighters on Random Maps]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-black-division-ruaf-roaming/</link>
            <guid>1368922</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update is settling in nicely, but players are finding that things are unfolding a little haphazardly. Ahead of the launch of 1.0, the world of Tarkov was introduced to Black Division, a new and high-tier faction that was reportedly set to patrol Terminal, the new ‘endgame’ map.</p>



<p>However, in recent hours, players have started encountering Black Division and RUAF, another new faction, on multiple maps, <strong>including Factory</strong>. Presently, it seems that they’re only roaming in PvE, which has led many to believe that Battlestate Games is using the PvE platform as a testing base before releasing into PvP.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-division-is-roaming-in-tarkov">Black Division is Roaming in Tarkov</h2>



<p>In a series of shots shared by VeryBadSCAV on social media, we see clear evidence that Black Division fighters are being spotted on maps <strong>outside </strong>Terminal, the mysterious environment yet to be revealed by any Escape from Tarkov player.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Black Division fighters were found in a Factory raid on the PvE platform, which has many thinking that Battlestate is using the mode to prepare for PvP drops of the newest factions, Black Division and RUAF. Users have also reported spotting RUAF fighters roaming on various maps in large packs.</p>







<p>VeryBadSCAV continued in later posts, suggesting that Battlestate Games is ‘sneaking in’ Terminal and the recently teased Winter Update that will blanket Tarkov in snow, just as it has the last few years.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First image is the patchnote, which is too small for 6 hr downtime.<br>I call this Red herring, just like Labyrinth update was a surprise.<br>Since Black division &amp; RUAF members suddenly started to spawn in multiple maps right before the update (SS &amp; multiple reports).<br>Its very likely… <a href="https://t.co/eMDY8uluDu">pic.twitter.com/eMDY8uluDu</a></p>— VeryBadSCAV (@VeryBadSCAVR) <a href="https://twitter.com/VeryBadSCAVR/status/1995363538408477037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Some players are sceptical about the imminent arrival of Terminal, and many are confused about the ‘soft lock’ situation. No Escape from Tarkov player has managed to make it to Terminal, with many having completed the game’s new story and sitting on a ‘wait objective’ that instructs them to hold fire until an escape path is outlined.</p>



<p>Until then, Tarkov players will need to be satisfied with Black Division and RUAF gunning for them at random across other maps.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that Call of Duty is getting a crossover that wasn’t on many prediction slates for 2025. On December 11, a <strong>Street Fighter collaboration </strong>is landing in Call of Duty Mobile, bringing four legendary characters from the fighting franchise into the first-person shooter world.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty x Street Fighter crossover will yield new Operators, a host of themed weapons linked to the Street Fighter universe, and more exclusive rewards for those participating in the event through December.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-street-fighter-come-to-call-of-duty">When Does Street Fighter Come to Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>Call of Duty Mobile fans can take advantage of the Street Fighter crossover starting December 11, when the Hero’s Collection Operator Series Armory opens up, officially introducing the Street Fighter characters to COD Mobile.</p>



<p>The lineup includes some of the most recognizable characters from the fighting game’s roster:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ryu</li>



<li>Chun-Li</li>



<li>Akuma</li>



<li>Cammy</li>
</ul>



<p>On December 13, the crossover will be expanded via the Champion’s Collection Weapon Series Armory, which introduces the unique weapon skins to bolster the collaboration.</p>



<p>It’s a bold crossover that nobody really anticipated, but it’s a welcome one nonetheless. Call of Duty Mobile is, without a doubt, the most expansive and popular COD title ever made, and it’s doing the live-service model perfectly compared to the annual releases of the core multiplayer shooters.</p>



<p>This collaboration heralds the game’s sixth anniversary, and it’s the latest in a <strong>very </strong>long line of crossover events. In recent history, we’ve seen the likes of Gundam, Nier, Rambo, and even sporting icons like Lionel Messi make their way into the Call of Duty Mobile universe.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gentle-mates-beat-optic-texas-kaysan-tournament/</link>
            <guid>1368904</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The all-new Gentle Mates CDL roster has stepped up and shocked the scene to secure a win in Kaysan’s $50,000 Black Ops 7 tournament. The Kaysan Showdown VIII was the perfect opener for the Black Ops 7 season, pulling together four teams with unparalleled prospects for the upcoming year of competitive play.</p>



<p>It was FaZe Vegas, LA Thieves, OpTic Texas, and Gentle Mates that took to the stage, but when the dust settled, it was a surprise for many to see Gentle Mates standing with the trophy (virtually, of course).</p>







<h2 id="h-an-unpredictable-season">An Unpredictable Season</h2>



<p>On paper, nobody would have thought that Gentle Mates would beat the other three teams. You’ve got the back-to-back-to-back world champions in OpTic Texas, the cash-backed ‘super team’ in LA Thieves, and FaZe Vegas, a new, rebranded roster with serious potential.</p>



<p>Gentle Mates <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gentlemates-cdl-roster-revealed-2026-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled its new roster</a> just days ago, revealing the squad that will carry the hopes of the French organization through the 2026 CDL season. If Kaysan’s tournament is anything to go by, those hopes are <strong>high</strong>.</p>



<p>The clips emerging from the tournament, which was an online event, were white-hot, showcasing a blistering Gentle Mates side that leaned heavily into the fast-flowing nature of Black Ops 7, which launched last month to a mixed reception at best.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gentle Mates is going all in with this Call of Duty League roster through the 2026 season. Last year was a poor showing for the organization, which only just surfaced in the COD space after acquiring the LAG spot and rebranding for the impending season.</p>



<p>The new roster signing, a jersey refresh, and promoting some new sponsorships, like a clean Scuf controller variety, are all indications of Gentle Mates’ investment in Call of Duty.</p>

<p>The <strong>VALORANT Game Changers Championship</strong>, a massive $500,000 tournament, has wrapped in South Korea, leaving Team Liquid Brazil the victor over all comers. Ten of the best women’s and marginalized-gender teams came together in Seoul to fight for a considerable prize, and in the closing moments of the tournament, it all came down to two rival teams.</p>



<p>The Grand Final was a dramatic showdown between Team Liquid Brazil and Shopify Rebellion Gold, two of the most capable squads in the Game Changers scene. What unravelled was one hell of a VALORANT series.</p>



<h2 id="h-team-liquid-secures-180-000-in-seoul">Team Liquid Secures $180,000 in Seoul</h2>



<p>Shopify Rebellion Gold broke into the Grand Final after a defiant lower-bracket run, meeting Team Liquid, the tournament’s dominant upper-bracket organisation sitting on a white-hot streak. The best-of-five final lived up to the expectations set by fans, with both sides trading maps as the series unravelled.</p>



<p>Shopify led the charge with an easy win on Haven, but the series was set to go the distance, and it went down to the wire on the final map.</p>



<p>Team Liquid’s win denied Shopify a third consecutive Game Changers Championship win, and it was a redemption of sorts for the former team, having collapsed against Shopify during the 2023 Championship Final.</p>



<p>Beyond the Grand Final, the Game Changers tournament in Seoul represented the power of the Americas in the VALORANT space. MIBR GC and KRU Blaze brought up the rear, securing a third- and fourth-place finish, respectively, both of which hail from South America.</p>



<p>Team Liquid walks away from Seoul with the trophy and $180,000 in earnings, which is a nice payday after a hard-fought tournament.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/turok-origins-release-in-2026-dev-claims/</link>
            <guid>1368892</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Turok Origins was given a short but sweet reveal trailer by Saber Interactive almost a year ago, and since then, things have run quiet. We’ve got a few details about the game, and fans of the title have busied themselves pulling every shred of information out of that trailer, but until now, Saber has remained mostly silent on the topic.</p>



<p>Recently, one developer’s profile was uncovered on LinkedIn, bearing a clear indication that Turok Origins, which doesn’t have a release window at present, will launch in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-turok-origins-coming-out">When is Turok Origins Coming Out?</h2>



<p>If you head over to the Turok Origins website, you’ll see that it can be wishlisted on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series XS, and Steam, but there’s no indication of a release window – <strong>not even a year</strong>.</p>



<p>It has been a fair while since Turok Origins was revealed, and fans are wondering when this all-new dinosaur-slaying epic could drop.</p>



<p>It was recently discovered on a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/javi-bermejo-969b1a181/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developer’s LinkedIn profile</a> that Turok Origins is ‘forthcoming’ in 2026:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The developer, a sound designer, also worked on Saber’s Radikal Fighters and is supporting the development of an ‘unannounced project’ at the studio.</p>



<p>Turok Origins is said to take players across various worlds as they explore a multitude of biomes throughout an immersive, ‘epic story’ that can be experienced either alone or with friends. The game has a diverse array of weapons and abilities to uncover, and it can reportedly be digested from both a first- and third-person perspective.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-full-liquidation-on-fitbit-charge-6-now-at-record-low-for-cyber-monday-2000648957</link>
            <guid>1368814</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon blew away Black Friday price expectations by lowering the price of the <strong>Fitbit Charge 6 to an all-time low</strong>, and this made high-end fitness tracking suddenly affordable for everyone. The big store decided to match that big discount for Cyber Monday and shows that it really wants to take over the fitness tracker market this holiday season.</p>
<p>The Charge 6 is a slim wristband that doesn’t look like a fitness tracker like bigger smartwatches and it has accurate heart rate monitoring, built-in GPS, Google app integration, and full health tracking. Right now, Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/"> has this fitness powerhouse on sale for $99, down from its usual price of $159</a> (which is a new record low).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heart Rate Monitoring</h2>
<p>The Charge 6 has the <strong>best heart rate monitoring of any Fitbit ever made</strong>, and it has better optical sensors and smarter algorithms that get rid of motion artifacts. That level of accuracy is important because the tracker can now send your heart rate directly to gym equipment that works with it via Bluetooth. This means you don’t have to wear chest straps like many cardio machines do for heart rate training programs. The <strong>built-in GPS keeps track of your outdoor runs, walks, and bike rides</strong> with the same level of accuracy as dedicated running watches.</p>
<p>The <strong>Fitbit Charge 6’s touchscreen</strong> interface lets you control YouTube Music, navigate Google Maps and make payments with Google Wallet right from your wrist. That ecosystem connection makes the tracker a useful everyday device instead of just a workout buddy. You can switch songs while you run, get turn-by-turn directions to new places, or pay for coffee without taking out your wallet.</p>



<p>Comprehensive health tracking goes beyond just counting steps as it also keeps an eye on heart rate variability, blood oxygen levels while you sleep, changes in skin temperature, and stress management through guided breathing exercises. <em>Zone of Activity Minutes</em> count how long you spend in high heart rate zones during workouts, so you get credit for intensity as well as duration.</p>
<p>With normal use, <strong>like 24/7 heart rate monitoring, daily GPS workouts, and notification sync</strong>, the battery lasts about seven days. This means you don’t have to charge it every night like most smartwatches do. You can track your sleep every night without worrying about the battery dying because it lasts for a week. You only need to remember to charge it once a week. The slim design fits comfortably under shirt cuffs and doesn’t get caught on clothes or make pressure points when worn all day.</p>



<p>Smart notifications keep you connected by <strong>showing calls, texts, and app alerts on the color touchscreen</strong> of the tracker. However, the only way to respond on Android devices is with quick replies. In addition to fitness features, calendar alerts, weather updates, and timer functions make the device useful every day. The Fitbit app lets you sync the <strong>device wirelessly with both iOS and Android phones</strong> and it also has detailed analytics, trend tracking, and social features that let you compete with friends through challenges.</p>
<p>When you think about how much similar fitness trackers cost (between $150 and $200 without Google integration or heart rate broadcasting from gym equipment) getting the Fitbit Charge 6 for $99 is a great deal. For less than $100, you can get a tracker that will help you train smarter, learn more about your body, and stay in touch all day long.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Short In-Development Video of GTA 6 Has Surfaced Online]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-video-in-development-grand-theft-auto-rockstar/</link>
            <guid>1368811</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A small yet highly credible video clip of GTA 6 has surfaced online. While it is from an in-development build, it does give fans an interesting insight as to how the game will look, gameplay-wise.</p>



<p>As one of 2026’s biggest upcoming games, Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto 6 has a lot riding on it. Through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countless delays</a>, fans have been eagerly anticipating driving and robbing the state of Leonida for almost 10 years. Unfortunately, the trailers have seemingly only shown cutscenes, with raw gameplay yet to be put on display. That is, however, until now, as a former Rockstar employee’s demo reel has surfaced featuring a small video snippet of potential gameplay from GTA 6.</p>







<h2 id="h-former-rockstar-employee-s-video-portfolio-includes-gta-6-gameplay">Former Rockstar Employee’s Video Portfolio Includes GTA 6 Gameplay</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>An ACTUAL GTA 6 leak has surfaced:</p><p>A former Rockstar employee has included GTA 6 development footage in their demo reel, this shows off a few animations for exiting bicycles and Monster Trucks.</p><p>Ocean Drive is clearly visible in the second clip</p><p> <a href="https://t.co/tZNhtByYrC">pic.twitter.com/tZNhtByYrC</a></p></div>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1995220816527835469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1995220816527835469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SynthPotato</a> found the clip from a former Rockstar employee’s demo reel portfolio. The name of the employee was, of course, not disclosed. Still, the reel has several animations from other Rockstar games like Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2, furthering its validity. From the looks of it, it seems the employee worked on a bit of GTA 6 prior to leaving.</p>



<p>As for what the clip is, it’s not a lot. The video, <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1995220816527835469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available above</a>, simply shows a character (unsure if NPC or player) dismounting from vehicles. While the first half shows a bike, the second has a render of Vice City, alongside what appears to be Lucia, one of GTA 6’s playable characters. It looks like it showcases how many ways the player character can dismount from a car, which is a rather neat detail.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the video is all fans have to go off of for GTA 6’s gameplay. With the recent November 19th, 2026, delay, it may be some time before more is shown. However, if the level of detail for even the simplest of vehicle dismounts is any indication, it might be the most realistic entry yet.</p>

Likewise, Epic has added a few new types of items that have no real precedent in Fortnite, and some of them are exceptionally powerful.</p><p>But for this story, the biggest new addition is the boss kits, which drop when you defeat an NPC boss. These kits are locked in your inventory until you win the round or die, make you look like the boss the kit came from, and give you increased health and stamina, and an ability unique to that boss that you have to activate manually by using the item.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-airpods-pro-3-for-cyber-monday-liquidates-black-friday-leftovers-at-record-low-price-2000648949</link>
            <guid>1368796</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just came out with the AirPods Pro 3 a few months ago, and as usual, the company won’t directly discount its newest high-end earbuds. Amazon really stepped up on Black Friday with a big price drop on these great wireless earbuds and the good news is that the store decided to keep the discount going and even make it bigger for Cyber Monday. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">Amazon has them marked down to $219 right now, reduced from Apple’s standard $249 price</a>, creating the best deal we’ve seen on these earbuds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Double Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>The <strong>AirPods Pro 3 block out twice as much unwanted noise as the already great AirPods Pro 2</strong>, and they create isolation that is as good as that of over-ear headphones, but in a small in-ear package. That better noise cancellation works by using microphones that pick up sounds from the outside world and computer-generated audio that creates exact anti-noise in real time.</p>
<p>When<strong> you turn on transparency mode</strong>, the earbuds let outside sounds in so you can hear conversations and environmental cues without taking them off. Apple improved this mode by adding active hearing protection that automatically lowers loud sounds from the environment like construction noise or subway screeches, while still letting normal sounds through.</p>



<p>The new acoustic architecture changes the sound quality by <strong>giving the bass more depth, making the voices sound</strong> incredibly clear across the frequency range, and making the vocals sound incredibly present. <strong>Dynamic head tracking and spatial audio</strong> make three-dimensional soundscapes that put sound sources around you in space. This makes movies and supported music feel more immersive than traditional stereo can.</p>
<p>Heart rate sensing is a real game-changer for earbuds because they have built-in sensors that track your pulse while you work out without needing chest straps or wrist-based monitors. The earbuds keep track of heart rate and calories burned <strong>during more than 50 different types of workouts</strong>, and they then automatically sync this data to Apple Health for full fitness tracking. When you connect your iPhone, you can use the activity rings, step counting, and the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence that gives you personalized training suggestions.</p>



<p><strong>Apple Intelligence’s live translation</strong> feature makes it possible to talk to people who speak different languages by providing real-time translation. The feature works by processing speech on your iPhone and translating between supported languages, and the translation plays through your earbuds while the other person hears their native language through your phone’s speaker. This conversational translation works well enough for travel, business meetings, or casual conversations where language differences would normally make it hard to communicate.</p>
<p>When you turn on active noise cancellation, the battery lasts for eight hours. When you use transparency mode with the hearing aid feature on, the battery lasts for up to ten hours. That runtime lasts through full workdays, long flights, or long listening sessions without needing to charge the case. The USB-C charging case lets you charge your device multiple times, <strong>and gives you more than 30 hours of total listening time</strong> before you need to plug it in. <strong>Five different ear tip sizes</strong> make sure that everyone can find a secure, comfortable fit that creates the right acoustic seal for the best noise cancellation and bass response.</p>
<p>When you think about how these just came out a few months ago and Apple never directly discounts new products, getting the AirPods Pro 3 for $219 is a good deal. These earbuds are on sale for Cyber Monday for $30 less than their regular price, and they have features that other products won’t have for years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock Q7 Max+ With 9 Weeks Self-Empty Crashes to Record Low, Cyber Monday Goes Zero Profit for Final Clearance]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q7-max-with-9-weeks-self-empty-crashes-to-record-low-cyber-monday-goes-zero-profit-for-final-clearance-2000648933</link>
            <guid>1368784</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock makes a lot more than just the high-end flagship $1000+ models that get a lot of attention in tech reviews and forums for fans. The brand makes cheaper models that still have important features like self-emptying docks and these are some of the best value options on the robot vacuum market.</p>
<p>For instance, the Q7 M5+ has 10,000Pa of suction, two brushes that don’t tangle, LiDAR navigation and a base that empties itself and holds up to seven weeks of debris – and it costs a lot less than some flagship models. The good news is that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/">has just cut the price of this combo to $219 for Cyber Monday, down from its usual price of $359</a> and this is the lowest price ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to empty yourself without the high price tag</h2>
<p>The<strong> RockDock Plus base station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin</strong> into a sealed bag <strong>that holds about seven to nine weeks’ worth of dirt, pet hair</strong>&nbsp;and other debris, depending on how big your home is and how messy it is. Because of that extra space, you can basically forget about taking care of your vacuum for almost two months.</p>
<p>Instead of emptying dustbins after every cleaning session, you can just check in every so often to change bags. The sealed bag system keeps allergens and fine dust particles from getting into the air when you empty it by hand and it makes it perfect for homes with allergies or sensitivities. When the bag is full, you can quickly lift it up and put it back down again without making dust clouds or having to touch the dirt that has built up.</p>
<p>The<strong> 10,000Pa HyperForce suction picks up everything from fine dust on hardwood floors to pet hair</strong> that has been stuck in carpets without needing to go over the same area more than once: That level of suction is comparable to models that cost twice as much, and it works well on all types of floors. Roborock made the dual anti-tangle system with JawScrapers’ main brush technology which stops hair from getting stuck in the roller and it also has a side brush that won’t get tangled even when cleaning up long human hair or shedding from double-coated dogs.</p>



<p>PreciSense LiDAR navigation makes precise floor plans of your home and shows where rooms and furniture are so that you can clean them more quickly. Unlike older models,<strong> this vacuum doesn’t bump around your space at random</strong> and instead, it follows planned paths that make sure it covers everything without going over the same area more than once. You can also use the Roborock app to set no-go zones so that the vacuum doesn’t go near pet food bowls, delicate rugs, or places with cables. Virtual walls make boundaries without needing to put up physical barriers.</p>
<p>This <strong>combination vacuum and mop can pick up both dry and sticky messes</strong> in one pass: It automatically switches between modes based on the type of floor and your preferences. With three adjustable water flow settings, you can choose how much water to use when mopping. For example, you can use light moisture on sealed hardwood or heavier flow on tile and laminate that can handle more water.</p>



<p>The vacuum works just as well on carpets as it does on hard floors because it automatically adjusts the suction power when it detects rugs or carpets and lowers it on hard surfaces to save battery life. The edge cleaning works well because the side brush can get into corners and along baseboards where dirt builds up. The <strong>design is small enough to fit under furniture and around chair legs</strong>&nbsp;which lets it get to places that upright vacuums can’t.</p>
<p>For $219, you can get the Roborock Q7 M5+ with its self-emptying dock and it is a great deal because similar systems from iRobot or Shark usually cost between $400 and $600. Here you can get a robot vacuum system that makes it easy to keep your floors clean every day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbooks-survived-black-friday-and-apple-went-even-lower-new-record-low-for-cyber-monday-2000648940</link>

              <p>Apple avoids running direct promotions on its products but Amazon has taken matters into its own hands with aggressive discounting throughout this shopping season. The online giant crushed MacBook Air M4 sales during Black Friday after slashing prices significantly, but Cyber Monday brings an even deeper cut that pushes the deal into record territory.</p>
<p>Right now, the 2025 MacBook Air with the M4 chip, 16GB unified memory, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">256GB storage is going for $738, down from Apple’s standard $999 price</a> and undercuts even the Black Friday deal by roughly $10<strong> to hit an all-time low for Cyber Monday</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Performance</h2>
<p>The M4 chip has desktop-level performance that can handle tough tasks like editing 4K video, doing complicated spreadsheet calculations, or running multiple virtual machines without breaking a sweat. Apple’s second-generation 3-nanometer architecture packs more transistors into less space while using less power which means that it can process data faster and use less power than the already impressive M3 generation.</p>
<p>The 16GB of unified memory is a big step up from the 8GB base model that Apple used to ship and makes it easy to multitask across dozens of browser tabs, creative apps, and background processes. That <strong>memory architecture lets the CPU and GPU share resources</strong> without the slowdowns that happen on regular laptops when the graphics and processor have to fight for separate memory pools.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts about 18 hours of normal</strong> use so you can get through a whole day of meetings, document editing, and web browsing without having to look for outlets. That level of performance stays the same whether you’re running on battery or plugged in, which is a problem with many Windows laptops when they’re unplugged. The MacBook Air is completely silent when it’s running because it doesn’t have a fan.</p>



<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display can show one billion colors and is 500 nits bright</strong> so photos and videos look great with bright colors and deep contrast. Text looks sharp at the native resolution, which is easier on the eyes than lower-resolution displays when reading or coding for long periods of time. That screen space gives you enough room to work on multiple things at once while keeping the laptop small enough to fit in most bags without taking up too much space.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration adds AI features</strong> directly to macOS without needing cloud processing or paying for basic features. The system helps with writing, making content, and productivity workflows, and it does all of this on the device to protect your privacy. Your data never leaves your machine because it is processed locally. This solves privacy issues that come up with cloud-based AI services. Two Thunderbolt 4 ports let you transfer data at lightning speed and drive up to two external displays at the same time.</p>



<p>The <strong>MacBook Air runs macOS without any problems</strong> and all of your important apps, like Microsoft 365 Copilot, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Google Workspace, work perfectly thanks to Apple Silicon optimization. iPhone integration works great with features like iPhone Mirroring, which lets you control your phone from your Mac, Universal Clipboard, which lets you copy content between devices, and Continuity Camera, which turns your iPhone into a wireless webcam.</p>
<p>When you think about how much Apple charges for this exact configuration directly, $999, getting the MacBook Air M4 for $738 is a great deal. This Cyber Monday price is $261 less than retail and gets you professional-level performance and a high-quality build. It’s the perfect time to upgrade from old Intel MacBooks or cheap Windows laptops.</p>

From the outside, the System Case looks like a thicker version of the average Switch 2 travel case.</p><p>RDS designed the System Case with the Switch 2 in mind, but it can be used with the original Switch and Switch OLED thanks to the cushions on each side that double as brackets to hold the smaller consoles in place. Molded ridges protect the Joy-Con 2 triggers and provide an extra layer of protection beyond the ballistic nylon exterior. A padded, fold-out insert with slots for 16 game cards fully protects the screen.</p><p>The bottom side of the case has two compartments separated by a padded divider. The larger one has room for the Switch 1/2 Dock, a Pro Controller, or Joy-Con Grip. The smaller compartment is for a removable mesh bag with space for the official AC Adapter, an HDMI cable, and other small accessories. Elastic straps hold the accessories in both compartments in place.</p><p>The System Case also comes with two game card-size plastic cases for microSD Express and a cleaning cloth. The System Case has a padded handle and a rubberized zipper pull with the red Switch 2 logo.</p><p>If you want enough storage space for the Dock Set <em>and </em>a controller as well as other accessories, the Game Traveler Deluxe System Case is also available in a larger-size version similar to Nintendo's All-In-One Carrying Case.

              <p>AI tools aren’t exactly the demons most people make them out to be; if you know how to use them right.

If you want to compare them all in one place and choose what works best for you, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>ChatPlayground AI is a platform that lets you explore and compare outputs from 25+ top AI tools side by side, in a single place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/">A one-month subscription usually costs $29, but Stacksocial is offering<strong> lifetime access</strong> to the platform for just $80, after a whopping 87% discount.</a> It’s a leftover Black Friday deal, but it’s selling out fast.

<p>There’s a built-in web search feature for up-to-date responses, and you can even refer back to previous conversations you had with the AI tools whenever you want. The Chrome extension integrates the platform into your everyday life, making it easy to get the help you want within seconds, without even launching the program manually. Those struggling to get efficient responses can head over to the prompt library that includes a wide range of ready-to-use prompts for optimal results. Best of all, the models can understand and respond in over 100 languages, so you can use what you’re most comfortable with.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/">On a normal day, you’d pay around $619 to enjoy lifetime access to all these features, but this deal takes a massive $539 off that not-so-friendly price tag</a>. But as you’d expect, it expires soon, so it’s best to grab it while it’s still live. If you want to explore more, other plans are also discounted. For instance, a lifetime subscription to the Pro plan is going for $50 after an 85% discount, while the Basic plan can be yours for $35, down from $204. That said, there are plenty of other lingering Black Friday deals on Stacksocial that are still going strong, even after the main event has wrapped up. It’s a great time to treat yourself to a service that feels slightly out of reach the rest of the year, and even gift it to a loved one!</p>

              <p>If you’ve been waiting for Cyber Monday to get a cheap Samsung tablet, your wait is over – and we’re not talking about the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra which costs almost $1,000 with premium specs. Instead, we’re talking about a budget-friendly Galaxy Tab A9+ model that can handle everyday tasks without breaking the bank. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">has cut the price of this 64GB/WiFi version from $219 to $139</a>, which makes it a great deal for an 11-inch tablet that can do a lot of things.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>11-Inch Screen</h2>
<p>The <strong>Tab A9+ has an 11-inch TFT LCD panel with a resolution of 1920×1200</strong> which makes text sharp enough to read and colors bright enough to stream video. The <strong>90Hz refresh rate</strong> makes scrolling through social media and web pages feel much smoother than standard 60Hz displays, and it adds a little bit of fluidity that makes the whole experience better.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Atmos processing powers</strong> the quad speakers on all four edges which give surprisingly strong sound and it <strong>creates spatial sound</strong> that makes movies, games, and music sound better than most tablets in this price range. The speakers make dialogue clear without muddiness and are loud enough to fill a small room. This audio setup turns the tablet into a portable entertainment device that doesn’t need external speakers or headphones to enjoy content fully.</p>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset and 4GB of RAM <strong>work together to handle everyday tasks</strong> like web browsing, email, social media, and streaming services without any annoying lag or stuttering. The 64GB of internal storage fills up quickly with apps, photos, and content that can be accessed offline. The good news is that there’s also a <strong>microSD card slot can hold cards up to 1TB</strong> which is a cheap way to add more storage.</p>



<p>With multi-window display, <strong>you can run more than one app on the same screen</strong> at the same time. For example, you can split the screen between a web browser and a note-taking app or watch YouTube while checking your email. This feature turns the tablet from a simple device for consuming content into a modest productivity tool that can handle basic work tasks or multitasking situations. <strong>Samsung’s One UI interface makes Android 13</strong> work better on larger screens by using gestures that are easy to understand and tablet-specific layouts that make better use of the space than phones that are blown up to tablet size.</p>
<p>With<em> Quick Share</em>, you can <strong>move files between Samsung devices and even iOS devices with just a few taps</strong>. This means you don’t have to email attachments or upload files to the cloud when you want to share photos or documents. You can charge the tablet with a USB-C cable and it usually lasts 8 to 10 hours of mixed use, like streaming, browsing, and light gaming, before you need to plug it in.</p>
<p>You can save $80 on a tablet that has really useful features at a low price by getting the Galaxy Tab A9+ for $139 instead of $219. For less than what many 8-inch tablets with worse specs cost, you get an 11-inch 90Hz display, quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, decent performance for everyday tasks, and Samsung’s polished software experience.</p>

              <p>You don’t have to grab an entirely new screen for a better streaming experience. If you’re after convenience and unlimited streaming options, a tiny streaming stick is all that you need. Most of these retail for around $25-$30, which is already quite affordable but thanks to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you can grab a solid option for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4493/">Amazon has slashed the price of the latest HD Roku Streaming Stick by 50%, currently offering it for just $15.</a> That’s basically pocket change for what you’re getting. The deal is available to both Prime and non-Prime members, but it’s selling out like crazy already. There’s not a lot of time left to save, so if you’ve been wanting to pick one up, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4493/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Streaming Platforms In One Place</h2>
<p>This tiny stick isn’t just convenient to carry around; it’s easy to install, doesn’t block neighboring HDMI ports when plugged in, and stays out of sight. It doesn’t require a wall outlet or extra cords, either. Just plug it into your TV’s USB port, select an input, and pair the included remote with it. Then, follow the on-screen instructions to get started.</p>
<p>The streaming stick brings all your favorite streaming apps in one place, from Netflix to Prime Video, Hulu, Disney, HBO Max, Peacock, Apple TV, and more. There is also going to be something for everyone, so kids can watch cartoons, teens can catch up on the latest releases, and adults can go with their all-time favorite classics. Binge the latest series of Stranger Things on Netflix, and end the night with a comedy show on Prime. Or maybe watch Harry Potter during the holiday on HBO Max, and then a Christmas movie later on; the choices are endless!</p>
<p>These platforms require subscriptions, though. Not a fan of those? No problem. The stick also gets you access to over 500 free TV channels with live news and weather, sports coverage, and more. You can start your day by checking in on what’s happening around the world, see how your favorite teams are doing, and stay updated on the weather situation; all without paying anything extra. It’s going to feel like you’re using cable, just without the monthly fee and hassle. HD support means content is pushed in a stunning, detailed resolution that makes it come to life.</p>



<p>The home screen is easy to navigate, and the included remote makes it quicker to find what you’re looking for. Spot something you like but don’t have the time to watch it immediately? Add it to your save list. Categories let you browse through genres within seconds, while the Recommended list makes it easy to find new content that’s relevant to your taste. Not in the mood to press some buttons? Hit the microphone option on the remote and use your voice to find your way around. Pairing it with a smart assistant makes it even more convenient. You can say something like “Alexa, show me the latest Leonardo DiCaprio movies”, or “Alexa, show me the latest Crime Thrillers with unexpected endings”, and your command will be answered.</p>
<p>There’s even a Bluetooth headphone mode that lets you connect your earbuds or headphones to the TV for a private listening experience. There are plenty of useful features packed in, and we recommend this latest Roku Streaming Stick even at its full $30 price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4493/">This 50% deal makes the upgrade much more affordable, so now is a great time to treat yourself to one.</a></p>
