As a result, when Disney acknowledges the series, even in small ways, it can feel significant, like a reminder that the game is still coming and in active development over at Square. That’s why <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>fans are having a moment over a 10-hour-long lo-fi music video Disney uploaded to its YouTube channel.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Though the movie wasn’t a huge success at the box office, it managed to gain a cult following after it was released on VHS. To celebrate the anniversary, Disney has released a documentary on the making of the movie, <em>Not Just A Goof</em>,<em> </em>on Disney+, and also put out a lo-fi ambiance video of Max studying that you can listen to while you study or work. I’ve got it open in my browser now, and maybe there is something to these videos. This is a vibe.</p><p>While the comments are turned off on the video itself, if you look around social media platforms like TikTok and X (formerly Twitter), you’ll find eagle-eyed <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>fans yapping about a few things on and around Max’s desk. The mug full of pencils has two stickers on it that appear to be the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Sea-salt_ice_cream&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Sea-salt_ice_cream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sea-salt ice cream</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Paopu_Fruit&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Paopu_Fruit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paopu fruit</a></span>, two pieces of iconography from the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>series.

While Goofy has been a mainstay in the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>series for over 20 years, Max has never made an appearance in the games after all this time. Does he not exist in the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> universe? Goofy’s never mentioned him, at least. But either way, it looks like he’s a fan of his dad’s multiverse adventures.</p><p>Whatever the case, <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>fans are wondering if this is just a cute nod to the series or if it could be a sign that Max will finally make his debut in the series in <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>.

It’s an uplifting, gentle tale, packed with superbly informed references to Arthur Conan Doyle’s fiction, delivered with a bucolic charm.</p><p>Beginning during the conclusion of <em>The Adventure of the Three Garridebs</em>, in which Watson is superficially wounded by a gunshot, we are soon in the famous rooms at 22B Baker Street, with Holmes trying to find the right words to tell Watson something important. In a densely packed room filled with objects to look at, use, pick up, and even talk to, the opening moments are all about procrastination, Holmes resorting to habit, deducing banalities as he delays informing Watson of his intention to retire.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197527" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Part 2 Is Short, Shocking, And Strangely Satisfying" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="197527,197525,197298" data-current="197527"><div><p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Part 2 Is Short, Shocking, And Strangely Satisfying</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23057.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div><h4><strong>Buried Treasure Indie Game Reviews</strong></h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

That’s something Doyle wrote about in <em>The Adventure of the Lion’s Mane</em>, one of only two stories narrated by Holmes himself, and not featuring Watson at all. This isn’t the last Holmes story however, with <em>His Last Bow</em> telling of Holmes and Watson’s spy-based adventures at the beginning of the First World War, but it suggests how Holmes intends to spend the remainder of his life. Enter <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em>.</p><p>It’s now 1918 and Watson has just returned from the war, where he was serving as a medic on the front lines. Holmes is implied to have continued his work for the British government throughout the Great War, but is now back in his retirement village of Fulworth. He lives with his new housekeeper, the rather fearsome Martha, in the tiny town filled with recognizable references to <em>The Lion’s Mane</em>, like local school The Gables and its headmaster, the affable Harold Stackhurst. Watson has come to stay, and Holmes is greatly relieved to see him. In the years that have passed, as Holmes has aged, he’s begun to regret more and more how he treated Watson throughout their lives, and he seems determined to make efforts to put this right. Primary among them on this day is to organize Watson a picnic, so the two can enjoy some quiet, comfortable time together.</p><figure id="" data-id="052d54fdd90e528522f1c5fc61dcf3b3" data-recommend-id="image://052d54fdd90e528522f1c5fc61dcf3b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A con artist draws a crowd on the beach, and lies about her qualifications." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A con artist draws a crowd on the beach, and lies about her qualifications." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="052d54fdd90e528522f1c5fc61dcf3b3" data-recommend-id="image://052d54fdd90e528522f1c5fc61dcf3b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A con artist draws a crowd on the beach, and lies about her qualifications." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To achieve this, Holmes needs to do all sorts of point-and-click adventure things, like win the best honey contest at the village fete, and find a missing cat in pursuit of some elderflower cordial. Holmes also has his “brain-attic,” where he can pair deductions together on an imagined blackboard, and muse on all the characters in his lives. And as he does, he inevitably stumbles upon a little case: the disappearance of some valuable taxidermized animals from a London museum seems to have some ties to events in the village. What’s so joyful here is that all these puzzles, no matter how contrived they may sound, are all entirely focused on relationships with people. This is a Holmes for whom the feelings of others have finally become relevant, and while he’s unquestionably the same incorrigible master detective, he would rather focus his efforts toward supporting the impetuous actions of children than catching nefarious criminals.</p><p>In fact, should you choose, you can invite Watson to the picnic at the very beginning of the main game, and ignore everything else. It won’t go well–the beach below will be unpleasantly noisy, with the crowds gathered to see the purported “mermaid” a shyster claims to have discovered, and there won’t be any food or drink, but the credits will still roll. You can also focus entirely on the picnic, ignoring the various other little stories there are to discover, and it will go to plan…it’s just that Watson won’t praise you for all the differences you made to people you encountered, some of which can be quite moving.</p><figure id="" data-id="ab195abd130dd0c09f920bb44498477a" data-recommend-id="image://ab195abd130dd0c09f920bb44498477a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab195abd130dd0c09f920bb44498477a" data-recommend-id="image://ab195abd130dd0c09f920bb44498477a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What I’m skirting around here, as does Holmes, is the nature of the relationship between the pair. While people have shipped Holmes and Watson forever, I’ve so often found this crude, and to miss so much of the point. More than anything else, it fails to recognize Holmes as a man entirely incapable of sustaining a meaningful relationship with <em>anyone at all</em>, such is the nature of his pathology and self-interest. <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em>, however, earns the right to probe this territory and suggest that things may have changed, given the many years that have now passed, the effects of the war on both men, and the results of Holmes’ years spent in quiet reflection.</p><p>Choosing to start with the denouement of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/69700/pg69700-images.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/69700/pg69700-images.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Three Garridebs</em></a></span> is incredibly smart, because it’s really the first time Doyle allowed Holmes to soften enough that Watson would be able to perceive some depth of feeling, before Holmes resets to form in the next story. Facing off against Killer Evans, Watson is shot, and Holmes immediately thumps Evans on the head with his pistol. Holmes checks Evans’ body for more weapons, then guides Watson to a chair while exclaiming,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“You’re not hurt, Watson? For God’s sake, say that you are not hurt!”</p></blockquote><p>Watson’s narration then continues,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>It was worth a wound—it was worth many wounds—to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.</p></blockquote><p>It’s within this framing that the game is set, with Holmes’ love for Watson an unanswered question. Even at the start, when Holmes is trying to find the way to tell Watson he intends to retire, the scene burns with a deeper burden he wishes he could share. It’s made very clear once we’re in 1918 that Holmes deeply regrets not saying more, and sees the picnic as a chance to make that right. But, crucially, what that love and relationship looks like is <em>not</em> determined by this narrative–it is up to you, and how you see their connection, and in the game’s final moments there’s no forced imposition of romance. I’ll leave you to discover all the possibilities.</p><figure id="" data-id="51f9ca2bc6ceeaff5bbd3f7b0fb963e7" data-recommend-id="image://51f9ca2bc6ceeaff5bbd3f7b0fb963e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51f9ca2bc6ceeaff5bbd3f7b0fb963e7" data-recommend-id="image://51f9ca2bc6ceeaff5bbd3f7b0fb963e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What results is a deeply humble love story, and the nature of that love, whether agape, eros or phllia, is your choice, and really not more important than the existence of that love in any form.</p><p>It certainly helps that the performances here are extraordinary. British actors James Quinn and Andrew James Spooner play Holmes and Watson respectively, both with an incredible calm and gentleness. Both characters have been rendered by popular culture as such caricatures that they’re often portrayed as gurning eccentrics, but not here at all. Both are restrained, their performances tinged with a melancholy, and helped greatly because <em>for once</em> a game has cast older actors to play older characters.</p><p>They’re not alone. I am astonished by the cast here, given this is an obscure indie adventure drawn in (beautiful, superbly animated) crude pixel graphics, that has not received a single review from the gaming press. Mycroft, who appears as the greatest in-game hint system in gaming history (you can telephone him at the Diogenes for a conversation, and ask for his thoughts on unfinished matters) is played by <em>Game of Thrones’</em> Maester Wolkan, Richard Rycroft. One minor character, Mrs. Whitlock, is voiced by Alison Skillbeck, an actor with credits going back to 1976, most recently appearing in <em>The Crown</em>. Enormous credit must go to <em>Wooden Overcoats</em>‘ Felix Trench, who plays the game’s most poignant character in a side-story that can be completely missed, but which is heartbreaking and can end beautifully.</p><figure id="" data-id="ddba1384ee12641db149bab0a642c472" data-recommend-id="image://ddba1384ee12641db149bab0a642c472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ddba1384ee12641db149bab0a642c472" data-recommend-id="image://ddba1384ee12641db149bab0a642c472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This game is such a total delight. It’s warm, meaningful, and packed with whimsy. (Toby III, Holmes’ new pet dog, can talk, although of course no humans can understand him. A stuffed bear in the background of one small scene can be talked to, too, for a lovely little extra.) Exploring the love between Holmes and Watson could have been <em>so</em> clumsy, but not a foot is put wrong, and the result is so heartwarming and truthful.</p><p>I don’t know how this game came to exist, nor how it has gone so completely under the radar. This is, improbably, primarily the work of one person–Helen Greetham. She has written, programmed, and drawn the entire game, and I think legitimately added to the Holmesian canon in a way so much of the post-copyright contributions fail to achieve. This is my perfect ending to the tales of Holmes and Watson, and I’m so delighted to have played it.</p><p><em>You can buy </em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic<em> from </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://jabbage.itch.io/the-beekeepers-picnic-poc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://jabbage.itch.io/the-beekeepers-picnic-poc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Itch</em></a></span><em> or </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2248890/The_Beekeepers_Picnic__A_Sherlockian_Adventure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2248890/The_Beekeepers_Picnic__A_Sherlockian_Adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Steam</em></a></span><em> for $14.</em></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-raises-planned-switch-2-accessory-prices-amid-tariff-uncertainty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The Switch 2 hardware will still retail for its initially announced $449.99, alongside a $499.99 bundle including a digital download of <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Nintendo revealed Thursday that the Mario Kart bundle will only be produced "through Fall 2025," though, and will only be available "while supplies last." <em>Mario Kart World</em> will retail for $79.99 on its own, while&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> will launch in July for a $69.99 MSRP.</p>
<p>Most industry analysts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/why-trumps-tariffs-probably-wont-cause-an-immediate-switch-2-price-bump/">expected Nintendo to hold the price for the Switch 2 hardware steady</a>, even as Trump's wide-ranging tariffs threatened to raise the cost the company incurred for systems built in China and Vietnam. "I believe it is now too late for Nintendo to drive up the price further, if that ever was an option in the first place," Kantan Games' Serkan Toto <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-trumps-tariffs-could-affect-the-switch-2-and-the-rest-of-the-games-industry-1">told GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "As far as tariffs go, Nintendo was looking at a black box all the way until April 2, just like everybody else. As a hardware manufacturer, Nintendo most likely ran simulations to get to a price that would make them tariff-proof as much as possible."</p>
<p>But that pricing calculus might not hold forever. "If the tariffs persist, I think a price increase in 2026 might be on the table," Ampere Analysis' Piers Harding-Rolls <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">told GameSpot</a>. "Nintendo will be treading very carefully considering the importance of the US market."</p>
<p>Since the Switch 2 launch details were announced earlier this month, Nintendo's official promotional livestreams have been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3llym2u63522u">inundated with messages begging the company to "DROP THE PRICE."</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/sunderfolk-is-a-couch-co-op-tactical-rpg-you-play-with-a-phone-no-really/">creators of <em>Sunderfolk</em></a>&nbsp;wanted to make a video game that would help players “Rediscover game night.” By my reckoning, they have succeeded, because I am now regularly arguing with good friends over stupid moves. Why didn’t I pick up that gold? Don’t you see how ending up there messed up an area attack? Ah, well.</p>
<p>That kind of friendly friction, inside dedicated social time, only gets harder to come by as you get older, settle into routines, and sometimes move apart. I’ve hosted four <i>Sunderfolk</i> sessions with three friends, all in different states, and it has felt like reclaiming something I lost. <a href="https://www.dreamhaven.com/games/sunderfolk"><i>Sunderfolk</i></a> is a fun game with a lot of good ideas, and the best one is convincing humans to join up in pondering hex tiles, turn order, and what to name the ogres who shoot arrows (“Pointy Bros”).</p>
<p>Maybe you already have all the gaming appointments you need with friends, online or in person. <i>Sunderfolk</i>, I might suggest, is a worthy addition to your queue as a low-effort way to give everyone a break from being the organizer. It does a decent job of tutorializing and onboarding less experienced players, then adds depth as it goes on. Given that only one person out of four has to own the game on some system, and the only other hardware needed is a phone, it’s a pretty light lift for what I’m finding to be a great payoff. Some parts could be improved, but the core loop and its camaraderie engine feel sturdy.</p>

<p><i>Sunderfolk</i> is a turn-based tactical RPG, putting you and your friends on a grid filled with objects, enemies, and surprises. You pick from familiar role-playing character classes—my party picked rogue, berserker, wizard, and a kind of pyromancer—and choose one ability card each turn. The cards put a <i>Gloomhaven</i>-like emphasis on sequence and map positioning. One of my rogue’s potential moves is a quick attack, then gaining strength by picking up nearby gold. Another involves moving, hitting, moving, hitting, then one more single-hex move at the end, to stay out of danger and get a protective “Shrouded” effect.</p>

<p>You and your squad are all watching the same screen, be it a living room TV, a laptop, or a window streamed over Zoom or Discord. You choose your cards, plot your movement, and interact with everything using your phone or tablet’s touchscreen.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once you’ve won a quest by beating the baddies and/or hitting other markers, you head back to town and do a whole bunch of housekeeping tasks. <i>Sunderfolk</i> has mechanics for both players not being present (scaling the quests and keeping the missing leveled up) and for someone having to drop mid-battle (someone else can play their seat and their own). It’s accommodating to players of different RPG experience levels and different schedules.</p>

<h2>You have my sword—and my phone</h2>
<p>Let’s address the phone controls, the roughly 6-inch-diagonal elephant in the room. My three friends all had to spend a few minutes getting used to using their phone screen as a multi-modal controller: touchpad for hex movement and cursor pointing, card picker and info box reader, and then the town landscape screen. After that, nobody had any real issues with the controls themselves. The tactile feedback guides your finger, and there was no appreciable lag in our sessions.</p>
<p>Sometimes we’d get momentarily flummoxed by the card-choosing flow, and there is perhaps some inherent mental tax in switching between screens. But the phone controls, besides making couch co-op possible, also allowed everyone in my group to play in their most comfortable spot: a TV streaming the Discord app, a tablet on the couch, a laptop at the kitchen counter.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Not for nothing, but with each player using their phone for controls—and the game announcing when players had “disconnected” if they switched to another app too long, only for them to come right back—<i>Sunderfolk</i> can apply some anti-scrolling pressure and keep everyone checked in. You could get around this with secondary devices or tiled windows, but it's better to be present and ask your friends whose turn it is to fire off their Ultimate card.</p>
<p>(To clarify how remote play works: One owner of the game can screen-cast their game to Discord, Zoom, Meet, or whatever service, everyone playing can chat there or elsewhere, and players log in their phones/controllers with a QR code that is displayed from the screen-casted main title screen)</p>

<p>All this adventuring takes place in a world of anthropomorphized animals and overgrown woods and purple-blue ogres that strongly evoke <i>World of Warcraft</i>’s style (at least in Act 1). When you’re back in town, you tap around to chat with recurring NPCs, gain friendship levels that sometimes result in gifts, and upgrade parts of the town to your liking. The town hub provides more opportunities for strategy and bonding with players. You might send some of the gold you greedily picked up on the last quest to the friend so they can nab a great weapon. You might, as a group, buy a quirky town upgrade just for the chance to rename some things.</p>
<p>But the town is one place I felt some friction, familiar from more in-depth board games. Some players will be done with making their decisions and speeding through dialogue faster than others and may or may not be more engaged with the town chatterboxes. Just as with cardboard games, you can take this moment to get up, stretch your legs, and maybe refresh a drink. But you might have to nudge people along if they’re overwhelmed by gear choices.</p>

<p>The non-gory, often goofy nature of <i>Sunderfolk</i>’s setting makes it appropriate for a wider range of players. The voice acting, almost all of it by Anjali Bhimani (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetra">Symmetra</a>), re-creates the feel of having a game master switch between “Frightened Blue Jay miner” and “Furious Ogre Queen” in one session. I’m not too engaged in the broad plot after one act—ogres, fueled by Darkstone, want to extinguish the village’s Brightstone—but it’s not a big deal. The game has given my group something else to latch onto: naming things.</p>

<p>The chance to name things in <i>Sunderfolk, </i>and have those names stick for the whole campaign, is something a good GM would do to engage their players and break up tension. <i>Sunderfolk</i> is clever about this, offering both secret naming prompts to individual players on their phones or dishing out naming opportunities in town. In my party’s campaign, healing statues are named Neatos, the town bridge is Seagull Murder (a misremembered, <a href="https://www.buffalorising.com/2008/04/change-in-peace-bridge-design/">obscure Peace Bridge reference</a>), and the beetle we rescued is named, as it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/sunderfolk-is-a-couch-co-op-tactical-rpg-you-play-with-a-phone-no-really">during my preview</a>, Michael Keaton. It’s fun to build your own stupid world out of goofy names, something too few games provide.</p>
<p>Individual phone controls give the game a chance to pull off a few other tricks, like only telling certain players about how a certain enemy looks like they’re carrying great loot. If <i>Sunderfolk</i> added even more of this, I would not mind at all.</p>
<p>I’m generally enjoying the combat, difficulty ramp (on the default setting), and upgrade paths of the characters. After three or four sessions, your character has much more move variety, and items and weapons are more useful and varied. The town of Arden, while overly chatty, has more to offer. It feels like a game that has had its pacing and onboarding fine-tuned.</p>

<p>But I have nits to pick:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are cheap but great upgrades you can easily miss in town, like tavern meals and temple fate cards</li>
<li>Enemy variety feels slightly lacking in the first act</li>
<li>Some things, like mission selection, demand all-party agreement; perhaps the game could figuratively flip a coin when parties are divided</li>
<li>Everyone in my party has accidentally skipped an attack once or twice, despite an “Are you sure?” prompt</li>
<li>Movement traces and signaling could be clearer, as we have all also wasted hexes and shoved each other around</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s been hard to be overly critical of a game that has all but forced me to log off and talk to friends for a couple hours each week. The downsides of <i>Sunderfolk</i> have mostly been the same as those of playing any tabletop game with humans: waiting, expertise imbalance, distraction, and someone’s dog needing attention.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I think <i>Sunderfolk </i>is a success at what it set out to do: Put the cardboard, cards, and dice on the screen and make it easier for everyone to show up. It won’t replace the traditional game night, but it might bring more people into it and remind people like me why it’s so good.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-not-support-vrr-when-docked-after-all/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will be available for pre-order in the United States on <strong>April 24, 2025</strong>. The console's price, including the bundle with Mario Kart World, Mario Kart World separately, and Donkey Kong Bananza, will stay the same.</p>
<p>Accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2, however, have increased in price. Nintendo announced the new pre-order date and the price adjustments in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/?srsltid=AfmBOoqyV2Xd4TTCZZtccGTsaDJIsgDY1VOZA6jdYT32aCRnPLqexD_s">blog post</a> on its website, citing "<em>changes in market conditions</em>" as the reason for the pricing increase.</p>
<p>Nintendo continued, "<em>Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future, depending on market conditions.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>We apologize for the retail pre-order delay, and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be experiencing. We thank our customers for their patience, and we share their excitement to experience Nintendo Switch 2 starting June 5, 2025.</em>"</p>
<p>While everything else has stayed the same, Nintendo-made accessories for the Switch 2 that were announced on April 2 with the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct have all gone up in price. These are all the accessories Nintendo confirmed are getting a price increase, with the new prices (in US dollars) in bold.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller - was $79.99, <strong>now</strong> <strong>$84.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera - was $49.99, <strong>now $54.99</strong></li>
<li>Joy-Con 2 Controller pair - was $89.99, <strong>now</strong> <strong>$94.99</strong></li>
<li>Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip - was $34.99,&nbsp;<strong>now</strong> <strong>$39.99</strong></li>
<li>Joy-Con 2 Strap - was $12.99, <strong>now $13.99</strong></li>
<li>Joy-Con 2 Wheel pair - was $19.99, <strong>now $24.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set - was $109.99, <strong>now $119.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector - was $34.99, <strong>now $39.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case - was $79.99, <strong>now $84.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter - was $29.99, <strong>now $34.99</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>None of these price increases is a major jump, with the biggest being a $10 increase on the Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set, but they still add a bit of sting to an already expensive console. Not to mention the fact that the threat of the console's price going up still looms with the tariffs not yet settled.</p>
<p>After pre-orders were <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">delayed in the US</a> just two days after the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct due to the tariffs announced the same day, there was a lot of confusion and concern that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/">the console's price would increase</a>. Many even wondered if the console would come to North America on its June 5 release date.</p>
<p>Pre-orders were also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">delayed in Canada</a> following the announcement that they would be delayed in the US. Pre-orders will also begin in Canada on April 24, 2025. Which is also just a day off from when reliable inside <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-april-23/">billbil-kun predicted</a> they would return.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-summer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-comes-to-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-in-summer.1167870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher VOID Interactive has announced that tactical FPS&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, and it'll be accompanied by two brand new levels for everyone to try out.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>will land on current-gen consoles in the summer, although it doesn't have a release date yet. The game will also be made available on the Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store at the same time.</p>

<p>Along with the console release,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>will also be getting a free DLC pack by the name of&nbsp;<em>Stories from Los Sueños</em>, which will add two new stages you can tackle either in single-player or alongside friends in online co-op.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-soldiers.jpg?itok=w-piyrbW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-soldiers.jpg?itok=ViUokash 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>hits consoles in summer.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're playing on PC and you're worried you'll miss out on these extra levels, you needn't be. VOID says PC players will get the two extra stages "day-and-date" with the console release. That is, of course, in addition to levels and features that have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-ready-or-not-november-update-adds-new-maps-and-more" rel="nofollow">already been added</a> to the game via <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-update-includes-new-maps-and-physics" rel="nofollow">updates</a>.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>on either PS5 or Xbox Series X|S will also get you three special weapons, but if you're a PC player, you'll get these items for free.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not</em>, VOID Interactive describes it as an "intense, tactical first-person shooter" in which you and your co-op partners (or just you, if you're in single-player mode) are SWAT officers sent in to defuse potentially volatile situations.</p>

<p>You may, for example, be sent in to negotiate the release of hostages, or you might be taking care of bomb disposal or dealing with suspects who've barricaded themselves inside a location. Suffice it to say this isn't one for the faint of heart.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It's launching for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime this summer.</p>

Nintendo has finally detailed how US tariffs will impact the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and confirmed price rises for an array of console accessories "due to changes in market conditions".
</p>
<p>A new set of Joy-Con 2 controllers, for example, will now cost $95, an increase of $5. The Switch 2 Pro controller and Switch 2 camera have also seen $5 price rises, up to $85 and $55 respectively.
</p>
<p>
But the $450 Switch 2 itself, including its $500 bundle with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, will not increase in price for now, Nintendo has decided. The cost of key software launches Mario Kart World ($80 when bought separately) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> ($70) will also remain unchanged "at launch", Nintendo has said.

<p>
The news comes amidst a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">backdrop of calls from fans for Nintendo to <em>lower</em> the price of Switch 2</a> - something that seemed increasingly unlikely as the expected impact of tariffs became clear.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, a statement from Nintendo today makes clear that price rises may still take place in future - and not just for Switch 2.
</p>
<p>
"Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions," the company said.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 pre-orders in the US, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">which had been delayed while Nintendo took stock of the fluctuating economic situation</a>, will now finally begin next Thursday, 24th April.
</p>
<p>
"We apologise for the retail pre-order delay, and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be facing," Nintendo added. 
</p>
<p>
"We thank our customers for their patience, and we share their excitement to experience Nintendo Switch 2 starting 5th June 2025."
</p>
<p>Eurogamer previously heard from an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-likely-to-stick-with-switch-2s-450-launch-price-despite-trump-tariffs-says-analyst">analyst that predicted Nintendo would likely not raise the price of Switch 2 in response to tariffs</a>, as it faced criticism of the console's cost already.</p>
<p>
While a portion of Switch 2 consoles are being manufactured in China, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">Nintendo has also used factories in Vietnam and diverted the majority of their manufactured  stock to the US</a> in advance of the current US-Chinese trade war taking effect.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-canada-april-24th<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that Switch 2 pre-orders in the US will open next week, and the price of the console won't be changing as a result of previously-announced tariffs, although accessories are a different story.</p>

<p>In a post on its official website, the Japanese gaming giant says Switch 2 US pre-orders will open on April 24th. As previously announced as part of the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">reveal</a>, the base machine will cost $449.99, and a bundle with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will set you back $499.99.</p>

<p>Pre-orders were originally due to begin earlier this month, but they were delayed due to sweeping economic tariffs imposed on countries and regions around the world by President Donald Trump. Some of those regions, like Vietnam and China, are critical to Nintendo's hardware manufacturing and production process.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-april-24th-console.jpg?itok=89Gnm850 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-april-24th-console.jpg?itok=Vi2fEMl7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Switch 2 pre-orders are back on in the US.</figcaption></figure><p>Since the pre-order delay, Trump's stance on his tariffs has been...confusing, to say the least. Suffice it to say that for now, at least, tariffs on all countries except China have been paused for a 90-day period, and several electronic devices <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20xn626y81o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">have been exempted</a> from the China tariffs (although not gaming consoles, unfortunately).</p>

<p>As well as the Switch 2's price remaining the same, Nintendo has also confirmed that both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>&nbsp;</em>won't be getting price changes. They'll stay at $80 and $70, respectively.</p>

<p>However, a number of Switch 2 accessories will see their prices increased "due to changes in market conditions", according to Nintendo. They include the Joy-Con 2 controllers, the Pro Controller, and the Camera. You can read a full list of accessory price changes via Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/" rel="nofollow">original post</a>.</p>

Canadian pre-orders will also go live on April 24th, following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">similar delay</a> in that country. There's still no news on the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-delayed-in-china-thanks-to-government-regulations-and-demand" rel="nofollow">release in China</a>, however.</p>

<p>You'll be able to pre-order a Switch 2 in the US and Canada starting from April 24th. The console itself is set to launch on June 5th.</p>

However, Nintendo also said that the Switch 2 accessories would be more expensive. The Switch 2 Joy-Con, Pro Controller, and Switch 2 camera have all gone up in price. Originally the Joy-Con was priced at $89.99 and is now $94.99. The Pro controller has also gone up $5 from $79.99 to $84.99. Finally, the Switch 2 camera has gone from $49.99 to $54.99.</p><p>Preorders were originally set to begin on April 9th, but Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">delayed that</a> following the Trump administration’s announcement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642240/trump-tariffs-imports-apple-manufacturing">of new tariffs</a>.</p><p>Specifically, Nintendo delayed preorders “in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.” At the time, the company said that the Switch 2’s planned June 5th launch date would be “unchanged.”</p><p>On April 8th, Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645240/nintendo-switch-2-canada-preorders-delayed-trump-tariffs">also announced</a> that it would be delaying Switch 2 preorders in Canada “in order to align with the timing of preorders to be determined in the US.” With this news, Canada will be able to preorder the Switch 2 on April 24th as well.</p><p>Nintendo’s new preorder date follows President Trump announcing on April 9th that he had authorized a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646029/trump-announces-a-90-day-pause-on-tariffs-outside-of-china">90-day pause</a> on tariffs outside of China.</p><p>The original preorder date was announced as part of Nintendo’s big reveal event for the Switch 2.

In the announcement, Nintendo reaffirmed that the price of the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle would remain the same along with the prices for both <em>Mario Kart World</em> ($79.99) and <em>Donkey Kong Bananaza</em> ($69.99).</p><p>The Switch 2 looks to be <a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=643616&amp;action=edit">a substantial upgrade</a> from the original Switch, with a larger 7.9-inch LCD screen, bigger Joy-Con controllers, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">and more</a>.

                <p>Marvel has announced the return of the Marvel Swimsuit Special later this year, teasing that the new issue will include some future skins for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel announced in a <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/the-marvel-swimsuit-special-returns-friends-foes-rivals-july-2025" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> that a new swimsuit special, titled Marvel Swimsuit Special: Friends, Foes, and Rivals #1, releases on July 9. As part of the announcement, Marvel said the issues will also contain designs for Marvel Rivals skins in the issue. It certainly sounds like that means swimsuit skins are coming to Marvel Rivals, and a late July or early August event would work perfectly with the summer skins. The blog post doesn't provide any more details about who would be getting these skins, or even what the skins are, but considering they are in the swimsuit issue, they will probably be beach-appropriate.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4478956-marvelswimsuit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478956" data-ratio="0.75872093023256" data-width="2064" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4478956-marvelswimsuit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478956"></a><figcaption>Marvel Swimsuit Special: Friends, Foes, and Rivals #1</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4478956-marvelswimsuit.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>The Marvel Swimsuit Special features a loose plot, with this year's based around Wasp organizing an official swimsuit special after Roxxon Comics made an unofficial one. This is just a pretense to the real plot, which is magazine-style spread of art featuring Marvel characters in swimsuits. Marvel said it would be revealing more about the issue leading up to its release, which could include teases of the Marvel Rivals skins. Based on the blog post, it sounds like it will just include designs that will be in Marvel Rivals and not skins that you can only get by purchasing the comic.</span></p><p>Marvel Rivals has seen continued success since its launch, recently releasing Emma Frost as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-2-update-adds-emma-frost-krakoa-map-and-cosmetic-gifting/1100-6530825/">Season 2</a>, themed after the Hellfire Gala. It also recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-recolor-skins-every-one-revealed-so-far/2900-6485/">new colors</a> for existing skins.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Few gaming laptops stand out like Razer’s Blades. They’ve long been the gaming alternative to the MacBook Pro: sleek, powerful, and grown-up looking, without the bulk and garish stylings of most gaming laptops. But cramming powerful graphics cards into slim confines means Blade laptops have a tendency to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review">run hot</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23595235/razer-blade-18-2023-review-specs-13th-gen-performance-nvidia-rtx-4080-qhd-gaming-laptop#:~:text=To%20be%20clear%2C%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20mean%20this%20laptop%20is%20quiet.%20It%E2%80%99s%20loud.%20You%20will%20hear%20the%20fans%20going%20%E2%80%94%20probably%20from%20across%20the%20room%20if%20you%20run%20the%20device%20at%20full%20power%20as%20you%20game.">get loud</a>, and carry <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23766755/razer-blade-14-2023-gaming-laptop-review">ridiculous</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23588660/razer-blade-16-2023-review-specs-features-design">price tags</a>.</p><p>So you’d be excused for feeling anxious that the 2025 Blade 16, which offers Nvidia’s most powerful laptop GPU, is 30 percent thinner and significantly lighter than its predecessor. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/638930/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-impressions-price">my initial testing,</a> it only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/637898/nvidia-rtx-5090-laptop-gpu-impressions-benchmarks-testing-specs">seemed a little more powerful</a> than the 4090 Blade it replaces.</p><p>But now I’ve used it much more extensively. I’ve even tested it against cheaper, thicker RTX 5080 laptops with more cooling capacity, which are the better buy if you’re focused squarely on gaming performance. However, nothing quite matches the Blade 16’s balance of top-end specs, thin chassis with all-black aesthetics, and a lovely OLED screen I’d happily stare at all day.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->4900</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great fit, finish, and build</li><li>Slim and sleek design for a gaming laptop</li><li>Excellent OLED screen comes standard</li><li>Very good performance, especially in DLSS 4 supported games</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Starts expensive and gets expensive-er</li><li>Middling battery life</li><li>Thinness aside, minimal improvements over last year’s model</li><li>A cheaper 5080 laptop may be money better spent</li><li>The matte black finish smudges easily, and the Razer lid logo is still a little cringe</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The 2025 Blade 16 is just 0.69 inches at its thickest (0.59 inches at the front) and weighs 4.6 pounds. That isn’t just thinner and lighter than last year’s 0.87-inch / 5.4-pound Blade 16, it’s also a bit lighter than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319419/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-pro-review-price-specs">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> — though the Pro is slightly thinner overall, at 0.61 inches. And it’s priced like a MacBook Pro: the Blade 16 <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-16%2FRZ09-05287EN3-R3U1" rel="sponsored">starts at $2,999.99 with an RTX 5070 Ti</a> graphics card.</p><p>Before Razer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645276/razer-blade-gaming-laptops-sales-pause-us-tariffs">removed its US preorder pages and pricing</a> and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/651199/razer-blade-16-laptop-sales-resume-us-tariffs">brought some of them back</a> amid April’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">ongoing tariff chaos</a>, our review unit, with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU, 32GB of RAM, 2TB SSD, and a Nvidia RTX 5090 mobile GPU, was listed at $4,499. That configuration isn’t listed anymore, and the only model with a 5090 now costs $4,899 but comes with twice the RAM and storage. It’s not clear how much this configuration of the Blade 16 will cost or if it will be available. But one thing is certain: the Blades will stay expensive.</p><div><div><p id="component-report-card"><h2><strong>Component report card:</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Screen:</strong> A</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Mic: </strong>B</span></li><li><span><strong>Keyboard:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Touchpad:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Port selection:</strong> A</span></li><li><span><strong>Speakers:</strong> C</span></li><li><span><strong>Number of ugly stickers to remove:</strong> 2</span></li></ul></div></div><p>All models of the 2025 Blade 16 come with an excellent 16-inch, 240Hz, and 2560 x 1600 OLED display. With superb color contrast and sharp looks, it’s one of the laptop’s strongest assets. It’s not as high-res as the 16-inch MacBook Pro’s 3456 x 2234 mini-LED, but its variable 240Hz refresh is twice that of the Mac’s. </p><p>And the rest of the Blade 16’s hardware feels “pro” without losing sight of its gaming focus. It has two USB 4 ports (one on each side), three USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, HDMI 2.1, a full-size UHS-II SD card reader, and a proprietary charging port with a reversible plug. It’s the same connector as last gen, though the power brick is now 280W instead of 330W.</p><div id=":Rmbdcer6:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The front of the Razer is slightly thinner than the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but it gets thicker by its midpoint.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The fact that Apple calls this color “black,” when compared to the Blade, is comical.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>The Blade’s 1080p webcam looks good enough and handles mixed and low lighting just fine, though it’s missing the privacy shutter from last year. Its six-speaker setup gets very loud and sounds pretty full, though a bit muddy compared to the MacBook Pro. The keyboard has deeper key travel and more tactile feedback than a MacBook’s, and its trackpad is equally humongous — though its top-hinged design is only okay compared to Apple’s excellent haptic trackpads. Razer’s trackpad is so large I was at first prone to accidental clicks with my palms, but I adjusted to it, just as I had to learn to not hit the mic mute key on the right-hand macro key column when aiming for the arrow keys. And while these components don’t always match Apple’s in terms of quality, they’re a cut above most other gaming laptops.</p><p>Last year’s thicker Blade had surprisingly good heat management compared to earlier models, so I was worried that the thinner 2025 model would be a step backward. Instead, it’s a small step forward, with caveats. The 5090 model has between 5 and 20 percent higher frame rates than the 4090 in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Black Myth: Wukong, </em>while staying around 4.5 degrees Celsius cooler, with an average GPU temperature of 81C compared to 86C. The chassis never got uncomfortable; I even played games with it on my lap without any problems (though I’ll likely feel different in the sweltering summer months).</p><p>Since my initial testing, I’ve also been using the <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Laptop/AORUS-MASTER-16-AM6H#kf">Gigabyte Aorus Master 16</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nr0ld1-m005n0-rog-strix-scar-16-2025.html" rel="sponsored">Asus ROG Strix Scar 16</a> — both configured with the RTX 5080 (the next GPU down from the 5090), both much thicker than the Blade 16 and both at least $1,000 cheaper. In a volley of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> benchmarks at 4K and 2.5K, the Blade 16’s average frame rates were at most 3 to 7fps higher (up to 27 with 4x frame generation), putting the 5080 nearly on par with the last-gen flagship RTX 4090 Blade 16. Both thicker laptops pushed the RTX 5080 past 140W, with average GPU temperatures of 76C.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>From top to bottom: Razer Blade 16 (RTX 5090), MacBook Pro 16 (M4 Max), Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 (RTX 5080), Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 (RTX 5080), and Razer Blade 16 (RTX 4090)</em>.</figcaption></p></div><p>Razer says the Blade 16’s total graphics power for sustained workloads is 135W, and Nvidia Dynamic Boost can push that to 160W in short bursts by pulling power from the CPU’s allowance. But the RTX 5090 can draw up to 150W, so it’s possible the RTX 5090 will perform better in a laptop with more cooling capacity. But I tested the Blade 16 with Razer’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24350342/razer-laptop-cooling-pad-review-hyperboost-synapse-rgb">Laptop Cooling Pad, which lets the Blade’s GPU pull closer to 150W</a>; unfortunately, even though the GPU stayed around 9C cooler, it didn’t make any consistent difference in frame rates, and the loud cooling fan drove me up the wall.</p><p>Even the fastest laptop GPU is constrained by the power and cooling capacity of the laptop it’s in. The RTX 5090 laptop GPU in the Blade 16 is about on par with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/623441/nvidia-rtx-5070-review-test-benchmark">a desktop RTX 5070</a>, so it’s right at home with the Blade’s 2560 x 1600 native resolution, and using Nvidia’s DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen software can help it take advantage of that 240Hz display — especially on the most graphically intense games. </p><p>For example, with DLSS and Multi Frame Gen, I was able to average 146fps in the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nvidia/628796/half-life-2-rtx-remix-nvidia-demo"><em>Half-Life 2 RTX</em> demo</a> at native 2.5K resolution using ultra settings. It was a graphical feast of volumetric lighting and path-traced reflections. Nvidia’s software tricks can sometimes cause <a href="https://youtu.be/QHRS0TO89UI?si=lZnMtED7wXHA8yGu&amp;t=776">small artifacting</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/xpzufsxtZpA?si=09GBCKtpAafpCCRZ&amp;t=668">a little input latency</a>. But, frankly, if you’re not the type to go pixel-peeping, you’ll likely appreciate the smooth performance at high resolutions more than you’ll notice an innocuous anomaly like a small bit of smearing or ghosting.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Blades definitely get their inspiration from somewhere. Where could that be?</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Personally, I’m cool with using DLSS and frame generation for single-player games, because being able to crank something like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> to maxed-out “overdrive” settings with full path tracing and 151 average frames per second is just lovely. But it isn’t magic: if a game isn’t running smoothly before frame generation, it’ll still feel like a choppy mess afterward, even if Multi Frame Gen pushes it over 60fps. To play at 4K — on an external monitor or the screen on the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619052/razer-blade-18-nvidia-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-preorder-asus-msi">Razer Blade 18</a> — you’ll probably still have to turn some settings down.</p><p>The Blade 16’s gaming performance on battery is pretty good, but the experience varies by game. Nvidia’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Fbattery-boost%2F" rel="sponsored">Battery Boost</a> uses just enough of the Blade’s power to target 60fps and lowers it to 30 during non-action moments like cutscenes and map displays. Using the Nvidia app’s optimized settings, I was able to get a little over 90 minutes of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on a charge and nearly two hours of <em>Elden Ring </em>on another. But <em>Cyberpunk </em>was set to low without ray tracing, running with DLSS 4 set to ultra performance mode and averaging 120fps thanks to 4x Multi Frame Gen (so around 30fps if you exclude AI frames). <em>Elden Ring, </em>which doesn’t support DLSS, averaged just 38fps.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Despite being thinner this year, the Blade 16 still has just as many ports.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>While running either game, the GPU was limited to 30W and the CPU around 10W — I didn’t even hear the fans. By comparison, while plugged in, <em>Cyberpunk</em>’s one-click optimization uses a mix of high and ultra settings, complete with ray tracing and balanced DLSS. That yields an average 179fps with the GPU getting 114W and the CPU at 36W. The fans run loud, but not enough to be a nuisance. Games look <em>so</em> much better plugged in, and games are probably why you’re spending $4,500 here.</p><p>That plugged-in performance does also translate to the Blade’s content-creation prowess. It ran our Premiere Pro 4K export test in one minute, 56 seconds — 17 seconds faster than Apple’s 16-inch M4 Pro laptop ($3,349 as tested), though 38 seconds slower than the M4 Max model ($6,149 as tested).</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>System</h3></th><th><h3>Razer Blade 16 (2025) / RTX 5090 / Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / 32GB / 2TB</h3></th><th><h3>Razer Blade 16 (2024) / RTX 4090 / Core i9 14900HX / 32GB / 1TB</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 / RTX 5080 / Core Ultra 9 275HX / 32GB / 2TB</h3></th><th><h3>MacBook Pro 16-inch M4 Pro / 14C / 20C / 48GB / 2TB</h3></th><th><h3>MacBook Pro 16-inch M4 Max / 16C / 40C / 128GB / 4TB</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Single</td><td>2968</td><td>2922</td><td>3113</td><td>3976</td><td>4011</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Multi</td><td>15922</td><td>17606</td><td>19709</td><td>22615</td><td>26422</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 GPU (OpenCL)</td><td>213016</td><td>187733</td><td>200189</td><td>70018</td><td>115870</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Single</td><td>119</td><td>125</td><td>137</td><td>179</td><td>182</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Multi</td><td>1287</td><td>1505</td><td>1965</td><td>1744</td><td>2043</td></tr><tr><td>PugetBench for Premiere Pro</td><td>12593</td><td>12239</td><td>13409</td><td>8914</td><td>12400</td></tr><tr><td>PugetBench for Photoshop</td><td>8679</td><td>8149</td><td>8482</td><td>12374</td><td>13424</td></tr><tr><td>Sustained SSD reads (MB/s)</td><td>6726.25</td><td>6654.46</td><td>6832.06</td><td>6737.84</td><td>7340.85</td></tr><tr><td>Sustained SSD writes (MB/s)</td><td>4931.41</td><td>4942.02</td><td>6550.21</td><td>7499.56</td><td>7969.07</td></tr><tr><td>Blender classroom test (seconds, lower is better)</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>21</td><td>not tested</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>3DMark Time Spy</td><td>22498</td><td>19818</td><td>20977</td><td>not tested</td><td>not tested</td></tr><tr><td>Premiere 4K Export (lower is better)</td><td>1 minute, 56 seconds</td><td>not tested</td><td>not tested</td><td>2 minutes, 13 seconds</td><td>1 minute, 18 seconds</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><br>It’s a decent alternative to the MacBook Pro for content creation, and far exceeds it in gaming, but the Blade lags far behind in battery life. Not just behind the MacBook Pro — which can get up to 18 hours on battery — but even behind other Windows gaming laptops. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point">Asus ROG Zephyrus G16</a>, with the same Strix Point CPU and an RTX 4070 GPU, lasted over eight hours in mixed non-gaming use. The Blade couldn’t make it six under the same conditions, even with its screen set to 60Hz. I eventually got it through an eight-hour workday by enabling Windows 11’s Energy Saver mode the whole time. It wasn’t perceptibly slower during a relatively light day of Slack, Google Docs, and a one-hour Google Meet call, but Energy Saver limits background app activity, so it could possibly hinder heavier multitasking.</p><p>There’s no getting around the fact that Windows laptops deliver less power on battery. On battery power, I can feel sluggishness in Lightroom Classic when the Blade 16 uses integrated graphics to save battery. Macs don’t have that issue. Forcing Windows to use the discrete GPU made it speedy again, but importing around 2,000 RAW files and doing light editing on just half of them used 25 percent of the Blade’s battery in under an hour. If I do that on a MacBook Pro, I’m usually done editing well before I even worry about plugging in.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption><em>There are five Torx screws to remove the Blade’s bottom plate.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>There’s still nothing quite like the Blade 16. It’s the well-fitting black T-shirt to the try-hard tacticool cargo pants of other gaming laptops, and it’s still the closest thing you’ll find to a MacBook Pro for gaming. The battery life is middling and the price for the 5090 version is obscene, but laptop gamers always pay a premium for portability.</p><p>The biggest hangup with the 5090 version of the Blade 16 is that the 5080 is breathing down its neck for $1,000 less. We don’t know yet if the Blade’s thinness is holding the 5090 back — not until I test a Blade with the 5080 or another 5090 laptop with more thermal headroom. Regardless, Razer aimed to make the Blade 16 a return to form, and it delivered.</p><div><div><p id="2025-razer-blade-16-specs-as-reviewed"><h2>2025 Razer Blade 16 specs (as reviewed)</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Display: </strong>16-inch (2560 x 1600) 240Hz OLED</span></li><li><span><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370</span></li><li><span><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia RTX 5090</span></li><li><span><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB LPDDR5X (soldered)</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> 2TB M.2 PCIe Gen 4 NVMe (with one extra slot)</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> 1080p, Windows Hello</span></li><li><span><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4</span></li><li><span><strong>Ports:</strong> 3x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, 2x USB4 Type-C, SD card slot (UHS-II), HDMI 2.1</span></li><li><span><strong>Weight:</strong> 4.71 pounds</span></li><li><span><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 13.98 x 9.86 x 0.59 — 0.69 inches</span></li><li><span><strong>Battery:</strong> 90Wh</span></li><li><span><strong>Price:</strong> $4,499.99</span></li></ul></div></div><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

<p dir="auto">Assassin’s Creed titles are cozy games for me. There’s no more relaxing place to go after a difficult day: historical outdoor museum tours, plus dopamine dispensers, plus slow-paced assassination simulators. The developers of <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em> seem to understand this need to escape better than ever before.</p>
<p dir="auto">I’m “only” 40 hours into <em>Shadows</em> (I reckon I’m only about 30 percent through the game), but I already consider it one of the best entries in the franchise’s long history.</p>
<p dir="auto">I’ve appreciated some past titles’ willingness to experiment and get jazzy with it, but <em>Shadows</em> takes a different tack. It has cherry-picked the best elements from the past decade or so of the franchise and refined them.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, although the wheel hasn’t been reinvented here, it offers a smoother ride than fans have ever gotten from the series.</p>
<p dir="auto">That’s a relief, and for once, I have some praise to offer Ubisoft. It has done an excellent job understanding its audience and proven that when in doubt, AAA publishers should feel more comfortable with the idea of delaying a game to focus on quality.</p>
<h2 dir="auto" data-heading="Choosing wisely">Choosing wisely</h2>
<p dir="auto"><em>Shadows</em> is the latest entry in the 18-year series, and it was developed primarily by a Ubisoft superteam, combining the talents of two flagship studios: Ubisoft Montreal (<em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Origins</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>) and Ubisoft Quebec (<em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em>, <em>Immortals Fenyx Rising</em>).</p>
<p dir="auto">After a mediocre entry in 2023’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>—which began as <em>Valhalla</em> DLC and was developed by B-team Ubisoft Bordeaux—<em>Shadows</em> is an all-in, massive budget monstrosity led by the very Aist of teams.</p>
<p dir="auto">The game comes after a trilogy of games that many fans call the ancient trilogy (<em>Origins</em>, <em>Odyssey</em>, and <em>Valhalla</em>—with <em>Mirage</em> tightly connected), which was pretty divisive.</p>
<p dir="auto">Peaking with <em>Odyssey</em>, the ancient trilogy departed from classic Assassin's Creed gameplay in significant ways. For the most part, cornerstones like social stealth, modern-day framing, and primarily urban environments were abandoned in favor of what could be reasonably described as "<em>The Witcher 3 </em>lite"—vast, open-world RPG gameplay with detailed character customization and gear systems, branching dialogue options, and lots of time spent wandering the wilderness instead of cities.</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/i-played-11-assassins-creed-games-in-11-years-and-odyssey-made-them-all-worth-it/">I loved that shift</a>, as I felt the old formula had grown stale over a decade of annual releases. Many other longtime fans did not agree. So in the weeks leading up to <em>Shadows</em>' launch, Ubisoft was in a tough spot: please the old-school fans or fans of the ancient trilogy. The publisher tried to please both at once with <em>Valhalla</em> but ended up not really making anyone happy, and it tried a retro throwback with <em>Mirage</em>, which was well-received by a dedicated cohort, but that didn't make many waves outside that OG community.</p>
<p dir="auto">During development, a Ubisoft lead publicly assured fans that <em>Shadows</em> would be a big departure from <em>Odyssey</em>, seemingly letting folks know which fanbase the game was meant to please. That's why I was surprised when <em>Shadows</em> actually came out and was... a lot like <em>Odyssey</em>—more like <em>Odyssey</em> than any other game in the franchise, in fact.</p>

    <p><span>Detailed gear stats and synergies are back, meaning this game is clearly an RPG...</span>

<p dir="auto">Similar to <em>Odyssey</em>, <em>Shadows</em> has deep character progression, gear, and RPG systems. It is also far more focused on the countryside than on urban gameplay and has no social stealth. It has branching dialogue (anemic though that feature may be) and plays like a modernization of <em>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Yet it seems this time around, most players are happy. What gives?</p>
<p dir="auto">Well, <em>Shadows</em> exhibits a level of polish and handcrafted care that many <em>Odyssey</em> detractors felt was lacking. In other words, the game is so slick and fun to play, it's hard to dislike it just because it's not exactly what <em>you</em> would have done had you been in charge of picking the next direction for the franchise.</p>
<p dir="auto">Part of that comes from learning lessons from the specific complaints that even <em>Odyssey</em>'s biggest fans had about that game, but part of it can be attributed to the fact that Ubisoft did something uncharacteristic this time around: It delayed an Assassin's Creed game for months to make sure the team could nail it.</p>

<h2 dir="auto" data-heading="It’s OK to delay">It’s OK to delay</h2>
<p dir="auto">Last fall, Ubisoft published <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, which was basically Assassin's Creed set in the Star Wars universe. You'd think that would be a recipe for success, but the game landed with a thud. The critical reception was lukewarm, and gaming communities bounced off it quickly. And while it sold well by most single-player games' standards, it didn't sell well enough to justify its huge budget or to please either Disney or Ubisoft's bean counters.</p>
<p dir="auto">I played <em>Outlaws</em> a little bit, but I, too, dropped it after a short time. The stealth sequences were frustrating, its design decisions didn't seem very well-thought out, and it wasn't that fun to play.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since I wasn't alone in that impression, Ubisoft looked at <em>Shadows</em> (which was due to launch mere weeks later) and panicked. Was the studio on the right track? It made a fateful decision: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-after-poor-star-wars-outlaws-reception/">delay <em>Shadows</em> for months</a>, well beyond the quarter, to make sure it wouldn't disappoint as much as <em>Outlaws</em> did.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm not privy to the inside discussions about that decision, but given that the business was surely counting on <em>Shadows</em> to deliver for the all-important holiday quarter and that Ubisoft had never delayed an Assassin's Creed title by more than a few weeks before, it probably wasn't an easy one.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's hard to imagine it was the wrong one, though. Like I said, <em>Shadows</em> might be the most polished and consistently fun Assassin's Creed game ever made.</p>

<p dir="auto">In an industry where quarterly profits are everything and building quality experiences for players or preserving the mental health and financial stability of employees are more in the "it's nice when it happens" category, I feel it's important to recognize when a company makes a better choice.</p>
<p dir="auto">I don't know what Ubisoft developers' internal experiences were, but I sincerely hope the extra time allowed them to both be happier with their work and their work-life balance. (If you're reading this and you work at Ubisoft and have insight, email me via my author page here. I want to know.)</p>

<p dir="auto">In any case, there's no question that players got a superior product because of the decision to delay the game. I can think of many times when players got angry at publishers for delaying games, but they shouldn't be. When a game gets delayed, that's not necessarily a bad sign. The more time the game spends in the oven, the better it's going to be. Players should welcome that.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, too, should business leaders at these publishers. Let <em>Shadows</em> be an example: Getting it right is worth it.</p>


<h2 dir="auto" data-heading="More dad rock, less prestige TV">More dad rock, less prestige TV</h2>
<p dir="auto">Of course, despite this game's positive reception among many fans, Assassin’s Creed in general is often reviled by some critics and gamers. Sure, there’s a reasonable and informed argument to be made that its big-budget excess, rampant commercialism, and formulaic checkbox-checking exemplify everything wrong with the AAA gaming industry right now.</p>
<p dir="auto">And certainly, there have been entries in the franchise's long history that lend ammunition to those criticisms. But since <em>Shadows</em> is good, this is an ideal time to discuss why the franchise (and this entry in particular) deserves more credit than it sometimes gets.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's use a pop culture analogy.</p>
<p dir="auto">In its current era, Assassin’s Creed is like the video game equivalent of the bands U2 or Tool. People call those “dad rock.” Taking a cue from those folks, I call <em>Shadows</em> and other titles like it (<em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Starfield</em>) “dad games.”</p>
<p dir="auto">While the kids are out there seeking fame through competitive prowess and streaming in <em>Valorant</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> or building chaotic metaverses in <em>Roblox</em> and—well, also <em>Fortnite</em>—games like <em>Shadows</em> are meant to appeal to a different sensibility. It’s one that had its heyday in the 2000s and early 2010s, before the landscape shifted.</p>
<p dir="auto">We’re talking single-player games, cutting-edge graphics showcases, and giant maps full of satisfying checklists.</p>
<p dir="auto">In a time when all the biggest games are multiplayer games-as-a-service, when many people are questioning whether graphics are advancing rapidly enough to make them a selling point on their own, and when checklist design is maligned by critics in favor of more holistic ideas, <em>Shadows</em> represents an era that may soon by a bygone one.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p dir="auto">So, yes, given the increasingly archaic sensibility in which it’s rooted and the current age of people for whom that era was prime gaming time, the core audience for <em>Shadows</em> probably now includes a whole lot of dads and moms.</p>

    <p><span>The graphics are simply awesome.</span>

<p dir="auto">There's a time and a place for pushing the envelope or experimenting, but media that deftly treads comfortable ground doesn't get enough appreciation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Around the time Ubisoft went all-in on this formula with <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla</em>, lots of people sneered, saying it was like watered-down <em>The</em> <em>Witcher 3</em> or <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Those games from CD Projekt Red and Rockstar Games moved things forward, while Ubisoft's games seemed content to stay in proven territory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Those people tended to look at this from a business point of view: Woe is an industry that avoids bold and challenging choices for fear of losing an investment. But playing it safe can be a good experience for players, and not just because it allows developers to deliver a refined product.</p>
<p dir="auto">Safety is the point. Yeah, I appreciate something that pushes the envelope in production values and storytelling. If <em>The Witcher 3</em> and <em>RDR2</em> were TV shows, we’d call them “prestige TV”—a type of show that’s all about expanding and building on what television can be, with a focus on critical acclaim and cultural capital.</p>
<p dir="auto">I, too, enjoy prestige shows like HBO’s <em>The White Lotus</em>. But sometimes I have to actually work on getting myself in the mood to watch a show like that. When I’ve had a particularly draining day, I don’t want challenging entertainment. That’s when it’s time to turn on <em>Parks and Recreation</em> or <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>—unchallenging or nostalgic programming that lets me zone out in my comfort zone for a while.</p>
<p dir="auto">That's what Assassin's Creed has been for about a decade now—comfort gaming for a certain audience. Ubisoft knows that audience well, and the game is all the more effective because the studios that made it were given the time to fine-tune every part of it <em>for</em> that audience.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> isn't groundbreaking, and that's OK, because it's a hundred hours of fun and relaxation. It's definitely not prestige gaming. It’s dad gaming: comfortable, refined, a little corny, but satisfying. If that's what you crave with your limited free time, it's worth a try.</p>

                <p>Star Wars Celebration has kicked off in Japan, and one of the highlights so far is the announcement of a new film in the sci-fi series that'll be directed by Shawn Levy (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deadpool-and-wolverine-review-status-quo/1900-6418260/" data-ref-id="1900-6418260">Deadpool and Wolverine</a>) and will star Ryan Gosling. Star Wars: Starfighter was revealed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-the-mandalorian-and-grogu-footage-revealed-at-d23/1100-6525692/" data-ref-id="1100-6525692">The Mandalorian and Grogu panel</a>, and it is scheduled to be released on May 31, 2027.</p><p>While details are slim for now, what we do know is that Starfighter is set five years after the events of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and Gosling will play a brand-new character. In case you're wondering, Star Wars: Starfighter shares nothing--that we know of, so far--with the video game of the same name released for PC, PS2, and Xbox in 2001. The game is currently available on PC platforms like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/32350/STAR_WARS_Starfighter/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=New+Ryan+Gosling+Star+Wars+Movie+Has+Same+Name+As+This+Great+PS2+Game&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-04-18+06%3A08%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-18+06%3A09%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6530960&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fstar_wars_starfighter&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-ryan-gosling-star-wars-movie-has-same-name-as-this-great-ps2-game%2F1100-6530960%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GOG</a>, in case you want to revisit it.</p><p>The obvious difference here is the setting, as the Starfighter video game was set during the prequel trilogy, specifically the invasion of Naboo that took place during Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Similar to Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Starfighter featured arcade-influenced action, and players could hop into several different spaceships.</p><p>A sequel, Jedi Starfighter, was released in 2002 and was set during the events of the second Star Wars prequel, Attack of the Clones. The games are also set during the Legends era of Star Wars, a different continuity than the one used by Disney following its purchase of the Star Wars IP several years later.</p><p>Beyond the reveal of the Starfighter film, the first day of Star Wars Celebration had a few more announcements. Former Sith lord Maul will headline a new animated series set after the final season of the Clone Wars, and it will chart his rise to power in the criminal underworld. There was also a <a href="https://youtu.be/AgJftuOvyis" rel="nofollow ">sneak peek at The Mandalorian and Grogu</a>, a <a href="https://youtu.be/68YdtaKRO7M" rel="nofollow ">second season of the documentary Light and Magic</a> was announced, and the second expansion for Star Wars Outlaws, <a href="https://youtu.be/Urp3XfddqZs" rel="nofollow ">A Pirate's Fortune</a>, will be out on May 15.</p>
