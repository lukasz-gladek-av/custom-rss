			<p>News for Bungie continues to be bleak, especially for Marathon, the upcoming PvP extraction shooter set in the sci-fi franchise created in the 1990s.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNDg2NDU0OCwiZXhwIjoxNzI1NDY5MzQ4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSVhUWktEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.lJDK2mJTGM2v8mjO2siujiOigS68jyckaTagfGlXp_A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a story on Bloomberg to reveal why Game Director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> earlier this year by former Valorant Game Director Joe Ziegler. According to Schreier's sources, Barrett was fired following a misconduct investigation prompted by at least eight female employees reporting inappropriate behavior from the Game Director.</p>
<p>The investigation verified that Barrett made advances and suggested that, thanks to his power within Bungie, he could help advance the female employees' careers. Schreier also shared a statement from Barrett:</p>
<p><em>I feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my closest friends. I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, other Bungie employees weren't initially told of the circumstances of Barrett's departure. They were led to believe that he was on a sabbatical year, but that wasn't actually the case.</p>
<p>While this is just a single person leaving the Marathon team, there's more problems bubbling under the surface, at least according to insider Tom Henderson, who <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1828872921168916612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1828872921168916612%7Ctwgr%5E85321f9de4618fd7479349abb24eabce6358fef8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.everyeye.it%2Fnotizie%2Fmarathon-spacciato-gioco-bungie-pericolo-secondo-tom-henderson-738593.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> that the game is 'cooked' based on his info. The game was originally meant to launch in 2024, but Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> it to 2025 alongside the delay of Destiny 2: The Final Shape.</p>
<p>The design of Marathon is ambitious, with the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wants-players-actions-to-affect-everyone-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning</a> to create a world of persistent zones where player actions actually matter and influence everyone else in the game. Perhaps they're having problems executing that high-level vision.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No space for Dino Crisis when Monster Hunter exists, says Shinji Mikami]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/no-space-for-dino-crisis-when-monster-hunter-exists-says-shinji-mikami<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Resident Evil and Dino Crisis creator Shinji Mikami said he doesn't "feel like there's a whole lot of space" for a new Dino Crisis game thanks to the success of Capcom's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> series.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> with regards to the forthcoming Shadows of the Damned remaster, Mikami discussed the topic of a new Dino Crisis game - it's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">series most Capcom fans want to see make a return</a>, according to a recent survey.

</p>
<p>
Mikami said he was surprised at the fan reaction to Dino Crisis, but it seems the popularity of Monster Hunter has put him off continuing the series.

<p>

"I'm very surprised to hear that," said Mikami in relation to fans wanting more Dino Crisis. "The awesomeness of dinosaurs and the stuff you can do with dinosaurs, that's been kind of really nailed down by Monster Hunter in recent years. 
</p>
<p>
"So even if I were to decide to make a remake or a new version of Dino Crisis, I don't really feel like there's a whole lot of space for that kind of game right now, just since Monster Hunter has become such a big game. But yeah, it is surprising."
</p>
<p>
When Capcom announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/exoprimal">Exoprimal</a>, its online dinosaur-inspired shooter, many fans jumped to Dino Crisis, only to be disappointed.
</p>
<p>
"The concept is pretty different from that of Dino Crisis," said Mikami, when I compared the games. "I guess the fans got their expectations up, but here we are."
</p>
<p>
The last game in the series was Dino Crisis 3 released in 2003 and since then it's reached cult classic status. However, there's no official word on any form of remake, remaster, or new game in the series.
</p>
<p>
And, despite rumours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-dino-crisis-ridge-racer-2-and-soulcalibur-are-heading-to-ps-plus-premium">Dino Crisis is yet to appear on PS Plus</a>.
</p>
<p>
Mikami, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-creator-shinji-mikami-left-tango-gameworks-to-break-free-from-survival-horror">left Tango Gameworks</a> ahead of its closure and has opened a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-director-shinji-mikami-founds-new-company">new studio called KAMUY</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/marvel-rivals-preview-a-new-better-overwatch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Last week I managed to get some time with Marvel Rivals, the next big PvP shooter set to (excuse the pun) rival games such as Overwatch and the like. Marvel is obviously a licence to print money and generally, you can slap Marvel branding on anything these days and you know it will do well to some degree. Of course, there’s an element of burnout as well. People are just a little bit sick of Marvel, because let’s face it, it’s everywhere.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Rivals | Stars Aligned - Official Launch Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a49DJ2bj9Gs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NetEase Games doesn’t care one bit about all that, and has set out to make an actual banger of a third-person PvP shooter. I have to use Overwatch as a comparison because, for all intents and purposes, it’s Overwatch with a Marvel skin. Well, sort of.</p>
<p>The key difference is the switch-up from first-person to third-person, and to be quite honest, this feels a lot better. Overwatch was littered with fancy skins which you only saw in key moments during gameplay. In Rivals, you get to see them all the time, which, if you’re spending money to see these skins, is kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>The starting roster is already enjoyably large, with lots of your favourite Marvel characters involved. Some of the more obvious ones such as Iron Man, Hulk and Thor make an appearance, but then you have some not-so-well-known characters make an appearance too which is nice, such as Jeff the Baby Land Shark and Luna Snow.</p>


<p>I must have put about fifteen to twenty hours into Rivals so far and still didn’t manage to play the whole roster, trying to give ample time to the ones I did try. Surprisingly, despite being a fan of the big green guy, my go-to main quickly became the thunder goddess Storm. Her ability to stay in the air and hurl the elements at enemies from above just appealed to me. And when she drops her ultimate ability, oh man, things get messy. I was regularly dropping at least three to four enemies at a time in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>So yeah, much like Overwatch, ultimate abilities play a big part of matches, with them building up as you play, and then dropping them at key moments to pull back control from the enemy team. Most of them feel very well designed and perfect for the character pulling them off. One of my favourites was Magik, who, when activating her ultimate, transforms into the Darkchylde version of herself, dealing more damage with her attacks and abilities. Hulk’s ultimate works in a different way and is honestly brilliant. It works in stages; he starts as Banner and can immediately activate his ult from the beginning to ‘Hulk out’, then, charging the ultimate again lets him Hulk out even further, turning him into Monster Hulk, an even stronger version. During this mode, he gets an ultimate called World Breaker, which sees him do a move on a single enemy which you may have seen in a popular Avengers movie. It’s truly great!</p>

<p>During the Gamescom beta, NetEase threw two new characters into the mix, Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Cap felt as he should, quite defensive and a great support for the team. One of the games I had with him saw our team hold the enemy at their spawn point. Maybe we got lucky, but I felt Cap’s leadership skills helped. Winter Soldier on the other hand feels very strong. A little too strong at the moment. His ultimate has the chance to trigger multiple times and feels very oppressive. I’m not too worried about this now as there’s just over three months to release so he can be adjusted by then, but if he does release in that state… We are all in trouble.</p>
<p>He’s not the only character that needs adjusting as some do feel like auto-inclusions in team lineups and it would be nice to see a bit more variety. I lost account of the amount of Venoms and Doctor Stranges I would see on opposing teams.</p>
<p>As for the game modes, well, you’d be forgiven for thinking that you are playing Overwatch. It’s pretty egregious, but I’ll be honest, they pull it off well. It’s unapologetically similar, but it works so well and dare I say it, is done better here. Of course, it could use a little tuning to make sure things like the Overtime mechanic don’t last for ages but aside from that, it’s pretty much there.</p>

<p>The other big question on everyone’s lips is how will this game be monetized? Right now we don’t know. A battle pass system was put in place during both betas letting you unlock new cool skins for characters. Blizzard have been very aggressive with their monetisation to the point where the fan base has had enough. Corporate greed won the battle over at Blizzard and now players are being charged £20 and upwards for skins for their favourite heroes.</p>
<p>Nothing has been announced yet for Marvel Rivals but my fingers are crossed that NetEase doesn’t get too greedy, because Rivals has the potential to be amazing and bad monetisation practices have the potential to ruin the experience. Time will tell, but as always, I’ll remain hopeful.</p>
<p>Right now, Marvel Rivals has the potential to take up a lot of my time. I’m gagging to play more and the 6th of December cannot come soon enough.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-changes-black-ops-6/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision recently hosted Call of Duty NEXT, the showcase designed to present the future of the COD ecosystem. During the show, countless changes were revealed to be coming to Warzone in the next few months, with a pivotal makeover taking place when Black Ops 6 is released at the end of October.</p>



<p>The team revealed a new small-form map, Area 99, and they confirmed that in 2025, Verdansk will make a return as a large-scale map, but elsewhere, some sizeable changes are in the pipeline.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about everything changing in Warzone soon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-refreshing">Refreshing</h2>



<p>Area 99 promises to be an exciting, fast-paced map for those who love a bit of Resurgence. It’s an ‘atomic-themed’ map centred around a nuclear power plant, which links it quite nicely with Black Ops’ Nuketown map. </p>



<p>When Black Ops 6 is released on October 25, Warzone will prepare to receive a stack of updates, including the adoption of the new ‘Omnimovement’ mechanics being introduced with the next iteration of the Black Ops series. As you’d expect, every weapon and most of the equipment from Black Ops 6 will also be brought into Warzone.</p>



<p>With the ‘Carry Forward’ mechanism applying this time around, Activision’s teams will be porting almost every weapon from MWII and MWIII into the newest version of Warzone. </p>



<p>On the topic of weapons, players will now be able to carry a melee weapon into Warzone as a third selection. When it comes to Perks, users will be able to pick three Perks that they drop into the Warzone with, as well as a ‘Wildcard’, which hasn’t been seen in the Call of Duty ecosystem for several years. It’s the first time Wildcards will be available in Warzone’s five-year history.</p>



<p>For completionists, Activision will be stacking up the challenges in Warzone. This will give players something to grind for, and the assortment of challenges will include weapon mastery tasks, reticle challenges, and ‘Dark Ops Calling Card’ challenges, the nature of which is being kept under wraps.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-there-s-more">But There’s More</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>It doesn’t end there.</p>



<p>Raven Software revealed that the backpack mechanic is being stripped from the game and that the inventory management function is going back to basics. Everything from money to your armour plates will be kept in an easily accessible menu that makes cumbersome backpacks a thing of the past.</p>



<p>Satchels are making a return, though. When you pick them up, you’ll either boost your armour plate storage <strong>or </strong>your ammunition capacity.</p>



<p>Raven has also tweaked many of the in-game mechanics tied to movement and quality-of-life features. For instance, using ziplines and ascenders has been made much more streamlined, and live ping duration has been decreased to stop the markers from obscuring your vision. </p>



<p>Finally, it was confirmed that when the first season of Black Ops 6 and Warzone arrives later this year, it’ll bring with it Battle Royale Ranked Play, which is good news for the more competitive players on the platform.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Verdansk Is Returning To Warzone In Spring 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-warzone-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/verdansk-is-returning-to-warzone-in-spring-2025.966795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-warzone-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision has announced the grand return of Verdansk to Call of Duty: Warzone. It’ll arrive in the game in just a few months, making a reappearance more than three years after it was last seen on the platform. It might have popped back up in Warzone Mobile, but let’s face it, it wasn’t ever <strong>the same</strong>.</p>



<p>Verdansk is where it all began for every Warzone player. In 2020, it served as the first Warzone map, and it became an instantly recognisable environment for tens of millions of players pouring onto the battle royale platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-king">Return of the King</h2>



<p>In 2025, Verdansk is coming back to Warzone, but there are still a lot of unknowns up in the air.</p>



<p>It’s unclear what ‘form’ Verdansk will take. The general assumption is that it won’t look like the ‘OG’ Verdansk map, but nobody can say what evolution it may have undergone over the last three-and-something years. When it was the defining Warzone map, it underwent a few changes, including a facelift (and a time travel sequence of sorts) for Black Ops Cold War.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>All Activision has shown so far is an outline of the region. It was enough to spark intense excitement within the community, though. Verdansk has an iron-like grip around the nostalgia centres of millions of gamers worldwide. It’s where we lived out the COVID-19-induced lockdowns of 2020 and beyond. In Verdansk, we made friends and enemies, and for some of us, we made <strong>a name </strong>for ourselves.</p>



<p>It’s a side note, but I fell in love with Verdansk and Warzone so hard that I secured a Guinness World Record for the longest battle royale marathon, going the distance on the map and entering the history books. My name is still against that record and I was the first person in history to secure it.</p>



<p>Are you excited about the return of Verdansk in Warzone?</p>

However, some crops are much more valuable to grow than others, so it's important to prioritize high-value crops if you want to make as much money as possible. Like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-spring-crops-in-stardew-valley/1100-6525125/" data-ref-id="1100-6525125">spring</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-summer-crops-in-stardew-valley/1100-6525175/" data-ref-id="1100-6525175">summer</a>, fall has a few crops that are very valuable and a few that just aren't worth growing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best fall crops</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4340519-fallcrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340519" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4340519-fallcrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340519"></a><figcaption>Corn fields are only worth growing if done at the start of summer, not fall.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4340519-fallcrops.jpg"></figure><p>The<strong> most profitable crops to grow in fall are cranberries, grapes, artichokes, and pumpkins</strong>. Artichoke seeds aren't sold until year 2 and grapes are grown on trellis, making those slightly more difficult options. Sweet Gem Berries are the most valuable crop, but the seeds are sold individually at the Traveling Cart, so it would take several in-game years of continuously growing them and turning them into seeds to have a full field's worth.</p><p dir="ltr">If you <span>want to complete the community center bundles to unlock the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-how-to-unlock-the-greenhouse/1100-6524916/">Greenhouse</a>, you will need to grow some less valuable crops, like corn. Corn continuously produces, but it's really only worth growing if it's done at</span> the beginning of summer.</p><p dir="ltr">Cranberries are the easiest crop to go for, since the plants continue to produce all season long, so you don't have to worry about replanting at any point. Pumpkins have high value, but you can only get two harvests in a single season, so if you want your paydays more spread out, they aren't the best option.</p><p dir="ltr">Below you can find a table containing every fall crop, the cost of their seeds, time it takes to harvest, and sell prices. All of these numbers don't include potential bonuses, like faster growth time or better sell prices. Seed costs are based on Pierre's Store, unless it's noted that they come from a different vendor.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Crop</th><th scope="col">Seed Price</th><th scope="col">Growth Time (days)</th><th scope="col">Sell Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Amaranth</td><td>70G</td><td>7</td><td><p>Normal: 150G</p><p>Silver: 187G</p><p>Gold: 225G</p><p>Iridium: 300G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Artichoke</td><td>30G</td><td>8</td><td><p>Normal: 160G</p><p>Silver: 200G</p><p>Gold: 240G</p><p>Iridium: 320G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Beet</td><td>20G (Oasis)</td><td>6</td><td><p>Normal: 100G</p><p>Silver: 125G</p><p>Gold: 150G</p><p>Iridium: 200G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Bok Choy</td><td>50G</td><td>4</td><td><p>Normal: 80G</p><p>Silver: 87G</p><p>Gold: 105G</p><p>Iridium: 140G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Fairy Rose</td><td>200G</td><td>12</td><td><p>Normal: 290G</p><p>Silver: 362G</p><p>Gold: 435G</p><p>Iridium: 580G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Pumpkin</td><td>100G</td><td>13</td><td><p>Normal: 320G</p><p>Silver: 400G</p><p>Gold: 480G</p><p>Iridium: 640G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Sunflower</td><td>200G</td><td>8</td><td><p>Normal: 80G</p><p>Silver: 100G</p><p>Gold: 120G</p><p>Iridium: 160G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Sweet Gem Berry</td><td>1,000G (Traveling Cart)</td><td>24</td><td><p>Normal: 3,000G</p><p>Silver: 3,750G</p><p>Gold: 4,500G</p><p>Iridium: 6,000G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Wheat</td><td>10G</td><td>4</td><td><p>Normal: 25G</p><p>Silver: 31G</p><p>Gold: 37G</p><p>Iridium: 50G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Yam</td><td>60G</td><td>10</td><td><p>Normal: 160G</p><p>Silver: 200G</p><p>Gold: 240G</p><p>Iridium: 320G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Corn</td><td>150G</td><td>14 for initial growth, produces every 4 after</td><td><p>Normal: 50G</p><p>Silver: 62G</p><p>Gold: 75G</p><p>Iridium: 100G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Cranberries</td><td>240G</td><td>7 for initial growth, produces every 5 after</td><td><p>Normal: 75G</p><p>Silver: 93G</p><p>Gold: 112G</p><p>Iridium: 150G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Eggplant</td><td>20G</td><td>5 for initial growth, produces every 5 after</td><td><p>Normal: 60G</p><p>Silver: 75G</p><p>Gold: 90G</p><p>Iridium: 120G</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Broccoli</p></td><td>Foraged</td><td>8 for initial growth, produces every 4 after</td><td><p>Normal: 70G</p><p>Silver: 87G</p><p>Gold: 105G</p><p>Iridium: 140G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Grape</td><td>60G</td><td>10 for initial growth, produces every 3 after</td><td><p>Normal: 80G</p><p>Silver: 100G</p><p>Gold: 120G</p><p>Iridium: 160G</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/preserving-the-past-with-charles-cecil-game-developer-podcast-ep-46<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite existing in one form or another since the early 80s, people still have room in their hearts for a good ol’ fashioned point-and-click adventure game. In fact, some folk (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>cough </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">zoomers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>cough</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) are just now learning how rewarding it can be to patiently peruse a plethora of pixels in hopes of finding the precise one that matters, or how frustrating it can be to come to grips with the developers’ unique interpretation of human logic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To learn more about bridging this generational gamer gap, Editor in Chief Danielle Riendeau sat down with adventure game designer and Revolution Software co-founder Charles Cecil to discuss Revolution’s forthcoming 4K remake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2544110/Broken_Sword__Shadow_of_the_Templars_Reforged/">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Produced by Jordan Mallory and with music by Mike Meehan, this is episode 46 of the Game Developer Podcast.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As was the case 30+ years ago, adventure game designers in 2024 must walk a bit of a tightrope when it comes to difficulty management. Cecil’s approach is to provide hints when necessary, but be sparing. Too little help and you risk frustrating the player, but too much and you rob them and their all-important sense of accomplishment.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“It would be better to provide these little hints too infrequently than too frequently, because if a player is close to a solution, and they’re really excited by the fact that they’ve worked [it] out, and then we give you a hint – they’re going to find that very, very frustrating,” Cecil explains. “Ultimately, people play these story games and they feel smart because they’re the ones driving the whole thing forward.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Cecil, writing that player-driven story is a separate but symbiotic process from designing the various puzzles that ultimately underpin the experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I’ll come up with a two or three page story,” Cecil says, “which obviously imagines how the gameplay can fit into that, and then in parallel, I will start designing the puzzles.” And while these two halves of the project “stay as separate documents,” they are also in constant conversation with each other as “the story is always affected and is complemented by the puzzles. … We'll be looking for great moments where the story and the puzzles come together in some sort of climactic moment.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the specific case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, not only does the remake provide a chance for younger players to experience the magic of the 90s computer classic, it also gives Cecil a chance to right the wrongs of the past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“In [a] particular scene, something that’s irritated me for nearly 30 years is that there is a drainpipe,” Cecil says. If the player decides to yank on the pipe, “it comes away from the wall, and [the protagonist] says ‘Well, the clown didn’t escape that way.’” But in the original 1996 artwork for this scene, the pipe isn’t actually connected to anything, which means that the clown </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>obviously</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> couldn’t have used it to escape, even if he somehow fit inside.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“It’s really irritated me for so long, so I go to the artist: ‘Please, just make me happy. Just draw the drainpipe so it looks like it goes up, beyond the top of the screen.’ There are so many little things like that.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You too can experience the delight of finally finding the right pixel when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launches on September 18. In the meantime, we recommend you listen to our charming little podcast, and then check what’s going on with the similarly forthcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://showcase.gdconf.com/">GDC Showcase</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-next-everything-announced-for-black-ops-6-and-warzone<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brzOBsdEAf8&amp;t=12387s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>COD: Next 2024</u></a> dropped in with new details about what to expect from Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, zombies, multiplayer, Warzone, and much, much more.</p><p>The day-long celebration of Call of Duty’s future didn’t disappoint, as the four-hour showcase featured interviews with developers and gameplay reveals while attendees got to go hands-on with upcoming releases. This year’s Black Ops installment had already promised a slew of changes to Activision’s first-person shooter formula, but we’ve now gotten a better look at things like the Area 99 Warzone map, omnimovement, the Liberty Falls zombies maps, and other fresh gameplay tweaks.</p><p>While we wait for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-confirmed">the Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta to kick off this weekend</a>, we gathered all of the major reveals from COD: Next for you to check out here. You can see everything the Call of Duty team had to show below, but don’t forget to keep checking in with IGN for any updates ahead of launch this fall.</p><h2>Verdansk is (finally) returning to Warzone</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Run it back. Verdansk will return to Call of Duty <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Warzone</a> in 2025 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CODNext?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CODNext</a> <a href="https://t.co/Y70gnYl2If" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Y70gnYl2If</a></p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1828873802551271432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>That’s right - Verdansk, the first Warzone map and the location that gripped millions back in 2020, will make its triumphant <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-is-finally-returning-to-call-of-duty-warzone-and-fans-are-delighted"><u>return to Call of Duty players on PC and console in spring 2025</u></a>. It’s been three years since iconic locations like Stadium and Superstore left Activision’s battle royale mode, but we won’t have to wait much longer to visit them once again. It had to happen eventually, right?</p><h2>Black Ops 6 launch and beta multiplayer maps confirmed</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/bo6-cod-next-02-mp-002-1724887914477.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>All 16 launch maps coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Image courtesy of Activision.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Black Ops 6 is bringing in eight new maps for players to enjoy during the upcoming beta: Derelict, Rewind, Scud, Skyline, Gala, Pit, Stakeout (weekend 2), and Babylon (weekend 2). Protocol will also be available during this time as a training map but will also be playable at launch in October. We also have confirmation for the remaining maps, which include Lowtown, Payback, Red Card, Subsonic, Vault, Vorkuta, and Sand House.</p><h2>Every Zombies map will feature a Main Quest for players to complete</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Upgrading Wonder Weapons to mow down endless waves of zombies is fun, but the developers at Treyarch are upping the ante with new Main Quests to keep players moving through each twisted map. Every map included in Black Ops 6 will feature a different multi-stage Main Quest to complete, and in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-black-ops-6-reveal-zombies-liberty-falls-showcase-intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a>, the team says they are “as involved and difficult as they are entertaining.”</p><p>“For veteran Zombies players, and those newer players dedicated enough to drop in and scour the maps to solve clues and secrets," the post adds, "expect to be recompensed with unique and limited-time rewards. We can’t wait to witness the launch weekend hunts to completion!”</p><h2>New Black Ops 6 multiplayer mode Kill Order revealed</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/black-ops-6-kill-order-1724888458626.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kill Order is coming to Black Ops 6 multiplayer. Image courtesy of Activision.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Every new Call of Duty game tends to introduce new modes to enjoy, and Black Ops 6 is no different. One of the multiplayer offerings set to arrive this fall is called Kill Order, a 6v6 battle where each team is tasked with keeping a high-value target (HVT) alive. With respawns enabled, every kill grants points, but taking out the HVT will get your team that much closer to victory. Activision also revealed a variation of the mode called Face Off Kill Order, which maintains the rules but turns off Scorestreaks and keeps the fight to closer-quarters Strike maps.</p><h2>Black Ops 6 zombies’ Liberty Falls revealed as second launch map</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>New zombies means new maps, and it all starts with a small West Virginia town called Liberty Falls. Activision describes its new location as a “once-idyllic, now horrific” medium-sized map that has become taken over by an undead threat.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-black-ops-6-reveal-zombies-liberty-falls-showcase-intel#tormented" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official blog post</u></a> describes Liberty Falls further: “By the time you arrive – assumed to be part of the Project Janus forces under the watchful eye of Security Chief John Blanchard – the town is overrun, and the battle seems well and truly lost.”</p><h2>Sprays and emotes are back</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sprays and Emotes return to Call of Duty: Warzone in Season 1 of Black Ops 6.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CODNext?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CODNext</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a> <a href="https://t.co/J1Z5NTumrN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/J1Z5NTumrN</a></p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1828873955697914208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Black Ops 6 will see the return of in-game sprays and emotes that can be used to taunt other players mid-match or, if you’re creative, toy with your enemies. Details about how many sprays and emotes will be available is a mystery, but it looks like players can at least expect classic taunts like clapping, giving a thumbs down, and more to make appearances.</p><h2>Area 99 revealed as the next Warzone map</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While Verdansk promises a blast from Call of Duty’s past, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzones-next-map-is-area-99-the-birthplace-of-nuketown"><u>Area 99 will take Warzone into the future in Season 1</u></a>. This Resurgence map has been called “the birthplace of Nuketown” and features a worn-down aesthetic polluted with mannequins and other retro-themed buildings. Each point of interest takes players to a new area that should feel familiar to those who have visited Nuketown for themselves, and you can expect to explore it for yourself sometime soon after Black Ops 6 launches in October.</p><h2>Prestige progression returns to multiplayer, zombies, and Warzone</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>TRADITIONAL PRESTIGE ARRIVES IN CALL OF DUTY: WARZONE</p><p>Players who reach level 55 in Warzone will be presented with a choice to enter Prestige to unlock new rewards. Account progression will be updated as part of Season 1. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CODNext?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CODNext</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a></p></div>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1828871369422967029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Old-school Call of Duty fans will remember the Prestige system, which allows players to continue earning rewards even after they reach each season’s level cap. There will be 10 levels of Prestige to reach, with each said to be inspired by past Call of Duty: Black Ops titles. Activision calls the new and improved mechanic “the most rewarding Prestige system ever” in Black Ops history, promising a lot of content to unlock in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-black-ops-6-reveal-global-systems-key-innovations-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an official blog post</u></a>. Expect Prestige to launch with multiplayer and zombies and with Warzone in Season 1.</p><h2>New Black Ops, new gameplay</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While excitement for things like omnimovement grows, the developers behind Call of Duty took the time at COD: Next to detail some of the other changes coming to the formula this fall. Time to kill (TTK) will be a bit faster than players remember from Black Ops Cold War, for example, and while enemy health bars are a thing of the past, you’ll be able to see your character’s health bar on your HUD if you’d like. Slide canceling and audio improvements were also promised, but you can also look forward to features like map voting and more.</p><h2>Black Ops 6 Wonder Weapons reveal new and returning guns</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/bo6-cod-next-03-zm-010-1724887920863.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Thrustodyne Model 23 makes its debut in Liberty Falls. Image courtesy of Activision.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Wonder Weapons are a zombies staple, so it should be no surprise to see that the Ray Gun is back and better looking than ever. The small, handy tools has been given a visual upgrade this time around, and it’ll still pack a punch on every map if you manage to acquire it. The Thrustodyne Model 23, meanwhile, is Black Ops 6’s new weapon. You’ll be able to find and use it to suck up zombies exclusively on Liberty Falls.</p><h2>Warzone will feature Carry Forward Content from past Call of Duty games</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/16/warzonemobileign1-1710576086840.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Enjoy cosmetics from previous Call of Duty games as Warzone continues.</figcaption></figure></output><p>COD: Next brought the confirmation that, as Warzone evolves, it will continue to support weapons, blueprints, Operators, Skins, and “the vast majority of the cosmetics” from games like Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3. With this comes the promise of full integration with everything yet to come with Black Ops 6. In other words, Warzone is only getting bigger and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.</p><h2>Ranked multiplayer arrives just weeks after launch</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Like other recent entries in the Call of Duty franchise, Black Ops 6 will be receiving a Ranked mode for those looking for their competitive fix. While Ranked has sometimes taken a while to launch in the past, Activision promises that the mode will release with Season 1, just weeks after launch this October.</p><h2>Someone already launched a nuke in Black Ops 6</h2><blockquote data-theme="light">— Treyarch Studios (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1828847893761142939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Black Ops 6 doesn’t come out until October 25, and its closed beta won’t launch for another few days. That didn’t stop streamer JustHazzardous from securing and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-first-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-nuke-achieved-before-the-beta-even-launches"><u>activating an in-game nuke at COD: Next</u></a>. The requirements for a nuke in this year’s Call of Duty installment haven’t even been revealed yet, so while this doesn’t necessarily qualify as a COD: Next reveal, it’s still undeniably impressive and a good look at what's to come.</p><h2>Black Ops 6 beta rewards reveal new goodies for early players</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/bo6-cod-next-02-mp-042-1724887923793.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 beta rewards revealed. Image courtesy of Activision.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Those who participate in the Black Ops 6 beta tests will have the opportunity to earn cosmetic rewards that they can carry into launch. Highlights include Squish and Squash Operator skin unlocks at level 20, as well as a Quick Draw emote that can be acquired at level 15. Getting to at least level 2 nets players an animated beta tester emblem.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>At long last, the real star of SpongeBob SquarePants--pun fully intended--is getting a chance to shine. The Patrick Star video game was officially revealed this week and is coming to Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. As you might have guessed from the game's title, it stars Patrick in his very own adventure. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1852087586275014526%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fspongebob-squarepants-the-patrick-star-video-game-preorders%2F1100-6526144%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorders are now live</a> for the game ahead of its October 4 release, including a special steelbook edition for Nintendo Switch and a standard edition available on PlayStation and Xbox.</p><div title="6526144 - Patrick Star video game steelbook preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2620" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526144 - Patrick Star video game steelbook preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://shop-links.co/1851969304830773460?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/shop-links.co\/1851969304830773460?u1=subid_value\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://shop-links.co/1851969304830773460?u1=subid_value ">Preorder SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Video Game Steelbook Edition (Nintendo Switch exclusive)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://shop-links.co/1851969304830773460?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/shop-links.co\/1851969304830773460?u1=subid_value\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://shop-links.co/1851969304830773460?u1=subid_value ">$50</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Nintendo Switch players can grab SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Video Game in a special steelbook edition.

As the optimistic sea critter with an unstoppable appetite, you'll get to explore Bikini Bottom and unleash some mayhem in your wake. Famous locations like the Krusty Krab and Glove World can be visited, and the game is described as an open-world adventure full of challenges, treasure, and familiar faces. Yes, it's pretty much a fusion of SpongeBob SquarePants and Goat Simulator, which sounds like a solid recipe for fun.</p><h2>More SpongeBob deals and preorders</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4358827-spongebob.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358827" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4358827-spongebob.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358827"></a><figcaption>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Movie 4K Steelbook Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4358827-spongebob.jpg"></figure><p>Something that will pair very nicely with Patrick's video game is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3Q53RCK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently released Blu-ray of the very first SpongeBob movie</a>, which you can pick up at Amazon for $31 (normally $35). This 4K version of the animated classic features a steelbook cover that's basically a replica of SpongeBob, and could make a nice partner piece to the Patrick Star Video Game Steelbook edition on Switch. You're also getting a ton of extra content, like a documentary on how the film was made, music videos, featurettes, and more. And if you're looking for even more SpongeBob, you can preorder<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SpongeBob-SquarePants-Another-100-Episodes/dp/B0DB78SBPW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> collections of the TV show in 100</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SpongeBob-SquarePants-Best-Episodes-Ever/dp/B0DB7FXLXF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">300-episode DVD box sets</a>, both of which launch on October 15.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3Q53RCK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpongeBob Squarepants: The Movie 4K Steelbook Edition</a> -- $31 (<del>$35</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SpongeBob-SquarePants-Best-Episodes-Ever/dp/B0DB7FXLXF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpongeBob Squarepants: The Best 300 Episodes Ever (DVD)</a> -- $60 | Preorder, launches October 15</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SpongeBob-SquarePants-Another-100-Episodes/dp/B0DB78SBPW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpongeBob Squarepants: Another 100 Episodes (DVD)</a> -- $33 | Preorder, launches October 15</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controller-preorder/1100-6525376/">Preorder Astro Bot And Limited-Edition DualSense Controller With This Bundle Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-complete-digital-collection-is-only-20-at-amazon/1100-6526122/">Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga Complete Digital Collection Is Only $20 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-atari-2600-gets-huge-price-cut-at-best-buy/1100-6520830/">Lego Atari 2600 Gets Huge Price Cut At Best Buy</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-preorder-guide/1100-6522523/">Star Wars Outlaws Preorders - Where To Find The Best Bonuses</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/buy-two-get-one-free-nintendo-switch-games-and-preorders-my-best-buy-members/1100-6525928/">B2G1 Free All Nintendo Switch Games - Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom, Mario &amp; Luigi, And More Preorders</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preorder-guide/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Live Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-anthology-preorders-quakecon-2024/1100-6525656/">Doom Anthology Preorders Are Live - Comes With 6 Games, Steelbook Case, And Replica BFG</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/retrorealms-halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-retro-game-preorder-guide/1100-6525752/">Halloween And Ash Vs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-saudi-money-overwatch-soft-power<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Did you, the Average Gamer, know that for the last eight weeks an esports tournament had been taking place in Saudi Arabia, billed as the "World Cup" and boasting unprecedented levels of prize money?</p><p>I mean, maaaaybe you did, if you are super into esports. But for most of us the world just kept on spinning, the masses seemingly oblivious to the existence of the event at all, let alone the fact it had been going on for so long and costing the Saudis millions in money.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this! For starters, this ain't 2017;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-08/the-hype-around-esports-is-fading-as-investors-and-sponsors-flee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the esports bubble has well and truly popped</a>, with leagues around the world forced to close and consolidate as advertisers cut back on spending and organisers realise that what once looked an unstoppable commercial juggernaut may have been more of a niche and unprofitable pursuit than anybody had bothered to recognize.</p><p>Then, you know, there's Saudi Arabia.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/07/saudi-arabia-deal-pga-major-step-sportswashing-golf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> The gulf state's soft power grab is a well-read playbook by now</a>, and while some entertainment pursuits--<a href="https://defector.com/pga-tour-has-suddenly-merged-with-liv-golf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like professional golf</a>--have well and truly rolled over for a share of the Public Investment Fund’s (PIF) cash, others, like football, are experiencing frostier times, with Saudi's efforts (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/oct/08/saudi-takeover-of-newcastle-leaves-human-rights-to-fog-on-the-tyne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including buying big clubs</a>) meeting protests<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4932881/2023/10/06/newcastle-saudi-city-reubens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and unease at every turn</a>.</p><p>Esports has proved to be no different. Everyone from<a href="https://richardlewis.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-a-guilt-free-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Richard Lewis</a> to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSwqlRHQObA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Travis Gifford</a> have raised questions over this event taking place in (and taking millions from) Saudi Arabia, a nation with a terrible human rights record and downright hostile attitudes to LGBTQA+ people (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/13/arts/glaad-video-games-lgbtq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who make up a significant portion of competitive esports viewership!</a>). Organisers<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5x85zd71eo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> have even had to defend the event to places like the BBC</a>.</p><p>People did attend, and people did watch it at home, sure, but the event's global reception was a far cry from what organisers must have been hoping for, given the prize money on offer and the "world cup" billing.</p><p>During those eight weeks, I got a few emails and messages asking why we hadn't covered it. I can't speak for my colleagues, but <em>I</em> didn't cover it for multiple reasons. Firstly, I don't like esports. Secondly, like I've just spelled out, the whole Saudi thing is gross, so yeah, I had no interest in covering it!</p><p>Until I got an email after it concluded from some poor PR company hired to launder the tournament's messaging. It read, in full (emphasis theirs):</p><blockquote><p>Hi there,</p><p>Yesterday marked the conclusion of an incredible&nbsp;<strong>eight weeks</strong>&nbsp;for the inaugural&nbsp;<strong>Esports&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup</strong>, where&nbsp;<strong>Team Falcons</strong>&nbsp;were crowned the first&nbsp;<strong>Club Champion</strong>&nbsp;at the Closing Ceremony - marking the biggest weekend in&nbsp;esports&nbsp;history.&nbsp;</p><p>Team Falcons were awarded&nbsp;<strong>$7 million (USD)</strong>&nbsp;in life-changing prize money from a&nbsp;<strong>prize pool of more than $60 million</strong>, alongside the&nbsp;Esports&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup&nbsp;Championship Trophy, presented to CEO&nbsp;Mossad "Msdossary" Al-Dossary by HRH Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In total, the&nbsp;Esports&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup&nbsp;recorded more than&nbsp;<strong>500 million viewers</strong>&nbsp;who consumed over&nbsp;<strong>250 million hours of content</strong>, making it&nbsp;<strong>the most-watched tournament of 2024</strong>, with a&nbsp;<strong>peak viewership of 3.5 million</strong>&nbsp;during the League of Legends Grand Final.</p><p>Following Sunday's awards presentation, winning players were honored in the&nbsp;<strong>Celebration of Champions</strong>, which featured live performances from international music icons&nbsp;<strong>Steve Aoki</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Kid Cudi</strong>.</p><p>Read on for the full press release, alongside quotes from HRH Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan (Chairman of the Saudi&nbsp;Esports&nbsp;Federation), Ralf Reichert (CEO of the&nbsp;Esports&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup&nbsp;Foundation), and Faisal bin Homran (Chief Product Officer of the&nbsp;Esports&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup&nbsp;Foundation).</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>The&nbsp;Esports&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup&nbsp;team</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Every single paragraph of this email included a reason I did not cover this tournament.</p><p>Here we were, at the conclusion of eight weeks of competition, and what does the official summary talk about? Money. More money. Some dubious viewership figures, then money again, name-dropping a bunch of guys, then mention of Steve Aoki, a guy whose mindset is so rinsed he's into<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22999333/decoder-steve-aoki-crypto-web3-aokiverse-metaverse-music-industry-business-nft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> web3 shit</a> <em>and</em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniehirschmiller/2023/10/30/stepn-and-steve-aoki-are-gamifying-the-15-trillion-wellness-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> </em>wellness scams</a>.</p><p>Where's the esports? Where's even a single mention of the matches, the suspense, the human drama? There's nothing here about the actual tournament, just a lot of talk about money, and just as we should all judge a person by their actions, you can judge a tournament by what it wants to highlight at the end of it.</p><p>The Esports World Cup wasn't about competition. It wasn't even about video games. It was soft power by brute force, speaking the only language big-league esports has ever known: empty bullet points about millions of dollars, as though the prize money is the point, and not the entertainment that precedes it.</p><p>Does any of this make the competition a success? Relative to the dollars spent, who knows. In terms of the Saudi royal family flexing their muscles to show who's in charge (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-announces-new-era-of-overwatch-esports-with-saudi-funded-partnership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">professional <em>Overwatch</em>, for example, is awash in Saudi money</a>)? Probably.</p><p>But in terms of anything that actually matters--and remember, the money wasn't even the point here, soft power and sports investment is all about the politics and prestige--not even this email could mask the fact the world simply didn't care. Especially when it proudly boasts "the Esports World Cup recorded more than 500 million viewers", which sounds impressive, until they immediately follow it up with "...who consumed over 250 million hours of content". So half an hour each on average, then. For a tournament that went for <em>eight weeks</em>. Sounds about right.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/ify-nwadiwe-and-jacob-wysocki-chat-never-stop-blowing-up-being-new-at-table-and<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em>, the latest season from Dimension 20, has wrapped up, ending the adventures of the Amazing Action Stars led by Brennan Lee Mulligan. In this adventure a group of employees at a video rental store in Lake Elsinore, California, are pulled into a VHS of Never Stop Blowing Up, a bombastic action film that draws on every trope in the book.</p>
<p>Among those players were Ify Nwadiwe and Jacob Wysocki who we had a chance to catch up with last week to discuss being the new player in the Dome, what their characters took away from their time in the VHS, and why it's great to show off your nerdy pride.</p>
<p>Nwadiwe and Wysocki weren't the only members of the <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> cast that we were able to catch up with. If you're interested in more Never Stop Blowing Up then be sure to check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s">our interview with Brennan Lee Mulligan</a> where we discussed the newly crafted mechanics, and our interview with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/izzy-rowland-and-alex-song-xia-talk-never-stop-blowing-up-how-cowardice-shaped">Izzy Roland and Alex Song-Xia</a> where we discussed character motivations whether 'too far' was possible in this game.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//xFyge5BlaII"></iframe></p>
<h2>How Does Brennan Lee Mulligan Prepare The Table?</h2>
<p>To begin our conversation I was interested in hearing how the concept of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> was introduced, and how they were prepared for a season that would reach such insanity.</p>
<p>"This is my third D20 season, this is my second with Brennan; even with Bloodkeep, Brennan does a good job of starting. Before our Session Zero, he does a long spiel about the world of the game, he has like a soundtrack to it, you get really drawn in and that I really appreciated. It's changed how I do even home games," Nwadiwe explained.</p>
<p>This experience was different for Wysocki, a regular for fans of Dropout content but his first time on Dimension 20. "I was really nervous because of the monolith that is D20 and the Dome. I think I was like, 'I need to know as much as possible and I need to know the data,' and Brennan is just the best one there is."</p>
<h2>TTRPG Are Improv With Math</h2>
<p>Wysocki explained that through the work he and Brennan Lee Mulligan had done together improvising, he was able to relay how to use that improv ability and translate that to success in the Dome. "He imbued a lot of confidence and that 'this is the ultimate <em>yes and</em> season,' so go big and go crazy."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You're here because you're big and you're crazy, so go big and go crazy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did ask both Nwadiwe and Wysocki if there was any point during the game that they did feel like they had gone too big, both immediately started shaking their heads from side to side.</p>

"As the GM, Brennan was 'Yes And'ing on a level. I think we were trying to preemptively stop thinking that might be too much and he was like, 'No, let it rip.'"</p>
<p>Wysocki chimed in "I feel like early on we were all break checking a little bit, and as soon as I was like, 'My car drives into the pre-established hanger that the secret society owns and that becomes a plane,' and that worked I was like, 'Oh, I can do whatever I want.'"</p>
<h2>A Newcomer to the Dome and TTRPG</h2>
<p>Wysocki might have had his first experience in the Dome with <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em>, but it's not his first time with TTRPGs.</p>
<p>"I definitely was a late adopter in that world," Wysocki said. "I think up until this, I had done maybe four~ish home games. One was very long standing with a core group of people who figured out we could do this every other week for a year."</p>
<p>[Zac]&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9d883f0f-b3c9-43af-9035-65518840f883" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/zac-oyama-talks-fantasy-high-junior-year-gorgugs-development-and-how-elmville-is">Oyama</a> is a good friend of mine, he was the first one to ask, 'Do you want to try doing this for entertainment?' and he's got a great podcast called the Rotating Heroes," Wysocki added, speaking to his professional TTRPG experience. "He GMs and has a rotating cast of people that come in, and one character stays while another two might leave so you're always following one familiar character."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[This was] my first experience of, 'Hey, you're going to get 12 hours of gameplay in a really small period of time and you have to make a beginning and an end.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wysocki expressed his thanks for getting that exposure. Moving from home games to professional audio podcast helped him be more comfortable for the filmed Dimension 20 experience.</p>
<p>Some kind words were shared about how Wysocki felt like 'the baby' at the table amongst the other players, but Nwadiwe reassured him that "he crushed it."</p>
<h2>What Actions Heroes Can Learn From Normal Folks</h2>
<p>A key portion of the epilogue was when all of the characters returned to their real bodies. No longer were we in the presence of Vic Ethanol and Greg Stocks, but it was Wendell Morris and Andy 'Dang' Litefoot back in Dave's Video Rental. During this time, each character expressed their growth in new relationships and perspectives on their lives and a definitive path to continue forward.</p>
<p>Knowing how much Wendell and Dang had grown from their experiences, I wondered if Vic and Greg would have grown at all from those same interactions.</p>
<p>"Vic would realize that he needs to get a better grasp on what 'La Familia' really means," Nwadiwe said. "That maybe if he truly wants to respect La Familia that he needs to consider what they want and not just to have a desire to win everything no matter what."</p>
<p>"I think [Greg] would probably take away that it's OK to unbutton the cufflinks, and maybe loosen the bowtie a bit," Wysocki said about Greg Stocks. "Maybe stumbling into a solution could yield positive results as well like living a little bit more on the instinct, that neurodivergent 'ooh shiny object.' He could become a little more loosey-goosey."</p>

<p>Before wrapping up I had to ask Nwadiwe about the unique dynamic that his characters shared. While other players were growing into the abilities and gaining the skillsets of the characters directly, Wendell had a number of moments, looking into mirrors, where Vic Ethanol would talk to him and encourage him directly.</p>
<p>This unique approach, Nwadiwe explained, comes from his experience with improv comedy and doing more but different. "I was playing improv at the table with some of the best improvisers in the world, and improv teaches us to 'yes and' but also heighten and do things differently."</p>
<p>After seeing everyone having the same fish out of water approach to it I was like 'OK, I want to do what they're doing but in a slightly different way, what's a way I can play this that highlights the coolness of what they're doing but adds another flavor to it?'"</p>
<p>This improv technique truly did allow for all characters to continue to expand their characters and fuel the chaotic world of the game right until it's conclusion.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/izzy-rowland-and-alex-song-xia-talk-never-stop-blowing-up-how-cowardice-shaped</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/izzy-rowland-and-alex-song-xia-talk-never-stop-blowing-up-how-cowardice-shaped<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Never Stop Blowing Up </em>is the latest season from Dimension 20. When a group of employees at a VHS Rental Store going out of business get Jumanji'd into an action movie filled with hard one-liners, convoluted plotlines, and every action trope in the book they need to gather their Macguffins to survive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We got to talk with Isabella Roland and Alex Song-Xia about their experiences in the world of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> and what influenced their characters.</p>
<p>If you're interested in more<em> Never Stop Blowing Up</em> you can check out our interview where we talked about showing off your nerd with Ify Nwadiwe and Jacob Wysocki, or our conversation with Brennan Lee Mulligan about the creation of Never Stop Blowing Up and letting others take on the role of DM.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//NwXm6v6TLLc"></iframe></p>
<h2>Yippee-ki-yay Jack Manhattan</h2>
<p>In <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> Isabella Roland plays Paula Donvalson, a security guard for the Lake Elsinore strip mall that Dave's Video Rental inhabits. While in the real world, she's a 58-year-old divorcee who enjoys <em>Muriel's Wedding </em>and <em>Under the Tuscan Sun</em> when pulled into<em> Never Stop Blowing Up</em> she becomes Jack Manhattan a detective who came to LA to solve the case of his partner's death.</p>
<p>It was the shared love for action films between Brennan Lee Mulligan and Izzy Roland that led to Mulligan writing this adventure. I asked Izzy where her love of action movies came from.</p>
<p>Pausing for a moment Roland expressed that she wasn't entirely sure where it originated, that there wasn't a single point that fueled her love. "I think it's a love of all things very over the top, all of my biggest heroes and inspirations in comedy and acting are the ones who are bigger than life."</p>
<p>Listing off some of her inspirations Roland continued "Gilda Radnor was huge for me and Maya Rudolf, I love people who can't be reigned in and I think a lot of that is present in action movies too."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/john-mclane-vent.jpg?itok=pNPAddFL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/john-mclane-vent.jpg?itok=cIG4Y6s0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Speaking of her favorite action film Roland was quick to highlight <em>Die Hard</em>. "I watch it multiple times a year and I watch it every Christmas because it is a Christmas movie"</p>
<h2>Kingskin, The Tortilla Chip Shaped Man</h2>
<p>Alex Song-Xia plays the valedictorian Liv Skyler who has been working at the rental store while trying to figure out if she wants to follow through with attending Stanford or whether she'll continue to search for something she'd rather do. A complete juxtaposition to her real form once she is pulled into <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> she becomes Kingskin, a hulking mob boss who could (and does) crush a man's body without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>While Kingskin is tough on the outside, especially at the outset of the game, he really becomes the heart of the team of Amazing Action Stars but also of his own mob commonly complementing members like Doug Meat.</p>
<p>Song-Xia explained that this difference in position to character was due to "cowardice." Expanding on the idea Song-Xia continued "I couldn't commit to brutality."</p>
<p>Roland cut in to offer that she thinks it's down to Song-Xia being "a very compassionate and loving person"</p>

<p>"I was like 'I'm going to play so different from Conrad'," here referencing their character Conrad Schintz, a newsie in the cerebral city murder mystery of Mentopolis, "and immediately I went back to being earnest and compassionate."</p>
<h2>Into The Action Of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em></h2>
<p>Prior to playing in this season of Dimension 20 I was interested to hear what kind of primer they received for what they might have expected going into the game and it's homebrewed version of the Kids on Bikes game system.</p>
<p>Pausing momentarily to think about it Song-Xia revealed that there really wasn't much information that they were given. "We talked about action movies, and we discussed all watching one together, but I dont think that happened."</p>
<p>"I don't think that happened," Roland confirmed "Brennan told us 'be crazy, [...] we picked all of you for a reason so you should feel so inclined to go ballz to the wall'"</p>

<p>"It was a really good pep talk" Song-Xia added</p>
<p>As Jack Manhattan and Kingskin characters went from killing needlessly and throwing around bricks of cocaine to storming the White House dressed as a senator protecting themselves from bulletfire with a briefcase. Knowing that the season was filled with a series of circumstances each crazier than the next, many brought on by player made decisions, I asked if there was any point that they felt like they had gone too far.</p>
<p>Before responding I received affirming head nods from both Roland and Song-Xia</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Every episode."</p>
<p>Roland spoke specifically in regards to the final episode "I was like… we can't do this… we're not allowed to do this. But Brennan [Lee Mulligan] seemed confident and seemed like he had it all under control so… okay"</p>
<h2>The Lessons We Teach Each Other</h2>
<p>A key aspect of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> is that each of the 'real world' characters are able to learn from their movie counterparts and experiences through the movie. Having heard in the final episode how the 'real world' characters had grown I was interested to hear what action heroes Jack Manhattan and Kingskin had taken away from the experience.</p>
<p>"I think maybe Jack, he's an homage to John McClain, I think he would come out of it wanting to be less selfish and less self-involved. You can't just make every insane move that you want to make. People's lives are at stake."</p>

<p>For Kingskin Song-Xia hopes that "he would embrace his softer side a little more, his genuine warm feelings towards his henchmen and to not be so scared to show them how much he loves them." The sentiment took a comedic turn as Song-Xia mused on Kingskin's growth "I don't know if he would let them unionize or have better benefits, but he would say 'love you' sometimes"</p>
<p>Roland offered an alternative path of growth suggesting that Kingskin could become a therapist. Loving the idea Song-Xia added that they "hope Jack suggests it to Kingskin."</p>
<p>All ten episodes are now available of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> available on <a href="https://dropout.tv/">Dropout.tv</a>, you can also watch the first episode for free on the Dimension 20 YouTube channel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-addresses-controversial-leveling-changes-in-world-of-warcraft-the-war-within<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Slow down, life is to be savored.</h2></div><section><p>Earlier this week, Blizzard announced changes to how leveling from level 70 to 80 will work in recently-released World of Warcraft expansion, The War Within. And now, after criticism from players, developers are reassuring that the overall impact to leveling time will be "minimal."</p><p>The changes were announced yesterday in <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/leveling-difficulty-changes-incoming/1931861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an official post</a>, with community manager Kaivax sharing that the team had noticed players coming into the new expansion content with endgame gear from the previous expansion, Dragonflight, were "extremely powerful relative to that intential content." The post goes on to say that a hotfix to be pushed today would "adjust the scaling of enemies in War Within leveling content to increase the power of lower-level enemies, bringing the duration of combat more in line with expected WoW behavior. These changes will be most noticeable at level 70, and will have a reduced impact as your level increases."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>All of that sounds relatively normal, and as someone who started playing The War Within in full Dragonflight endgame gear, they were desperately needed. Especially in the first half of the new expansion, I found I was easily killing even supposedly difficult enemies in just a few hits, and while it evened out over time, the speed of the experience meant I was blasting through content and levels so quickly I barely had time to blink. In fact, much of the community agreed something needed to be changed. But in the ensuing discussion, it became clear that there was significant frustration as to how Blizzard was handling it.</p><p>Players expressed two main concerns. The first, as demonstrated in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1f2m4qk/leveling_will_be_made_harder_with_hotfixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several of the top comments on this thread</a>, was that players coming into the expansion with terrible gear (perhaps because they skipped playing Dragonflight, or were leveling a new character) would be relatively underpowered and would disproportionately struggle with the content if their power was nerfed.</p><p>But a second issue players surfaced was the timing of the changes. The War Within technically launched back on August 22 for people who purchased the Epic Edition of the game. Its global launch was on August 26. That meant that people who paid for the more expensive version for earlier access essentially got four extra days of super speedy, overpowered leveling (including a period over a weekend) while those who didn't shell out the extra cash only experienced roughly a day and a half. </p><p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1f2m4qk/comment/lk7gxc6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one Redditor put it</a>: "The time to make that change was almost exactly a week ago. It's absolutely asinine to arbitrarily slow things down for people who are already behind the curve due to the late release. This is a situation where you need to just acknowledge you dropped the ball and leave things the way they are."</p><p>In response, Blizzard has issued some clarification on what the changes to leveling actually are in an attempt to assuage at least some of these worries.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We want to provide additional details on today's leveling changes and balance fixes to group content.</p><p>• Changes aim to make the difficulty curve more gradual - enemy strength will actually increase by less per level in the mid-to-high 70s than it used to</p><p>• Players coming in…</p></div>— World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1828839377042374995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1828839377042374995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Blizzard shared that the changes to leveling scaling would make the difficulty curve "more gradual" and that players coming into the expansion with basic leveling gear would find leveling "manageable" and "get powerful gear quickly." Meanwhile, players at level 78 and up should find combat "unchanged."</p><p>With the change now live, players are reporting that Blizzard's description of the shift is largely accurate, and is a much-needed balance adjustment. But frustrations about the update's timing still remain, exacerbated by existing irritation about The War Within's early access period in general. The four-day headstart for Epic Edition buyers has been fairly controversial, with top-level players expressing anger that it forced them to pay extra to stay on top of the early expansion competitive scene, and others just aggravated about missing out on what is technically the "launch day." </p><p>In Blizzard's favor, perhaps, is the reality that the early access period drastically cut down on server issues and queues on both the 22nd and the 26th, with players barely reporting any of the usual launch day friction in either scenario due to the split playerbase.</p><p>Game director Ion Hazzikostas called the early access period a "bit of an experiment" in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-game-director-calls-controversial-the-war-within-paid-early-access-an-experiment">an interview earlier this year</a>, and it's not clear whether we'll see Blizzard try the same thing for future expansions <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-three-expansions-in-world-of-warcraft-the-worldsoul-saga-blizzcon-2023">Midnight and The Last Titan</a>.</p><p>We're currently in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review">process of reviewing The War Within</a> as its launch content slowly rolls out over the next few weeks, but our review-in-progress says that, "There's still a lot of The War Within I haven't seen yet, but I'm thoroughly enjoying myself so far, and that’s just about the highest praise I can give an expansion at launch."</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[How Brennan Lee Mulligan Created Never Stop Blowing Up, A Love Letter To 80s Action Movies In TTRPG Form]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today the final episode of the latest season of Dimension 20, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-never-stop-blowing-up-pulls-cast-of-mall-employees-into-vhs-to-live"><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em></a>, wrapped up. This '1980s action movie meets Jumanji' themed season saw the Amazing Action Heroes get pulled into a VHS and face some of the most insane Dimension 20 scenarios ever conceived.</p>
<p>As the series is ending I had a chance to talk to Dimension 20 creator and GM of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em>, Brennan Lee Mulligan, about homebrewed mechanics, character choices, and his own favorite action movie.</p>
<p>We also had a chance to talk with other cast members. If you're interested to hear about Ify Nwadiwe and Jacob Wysocki going 'full nerd' or what life lesson Izzy Roland and Alex Song-Xia's action personas took away from Never Stop Blowing Up you can check out our full conversations.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//BHceSxQiIqw"></iframe></p>
<p>Upon announcement <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> was described as an "explosive, high-octane, action-packed thrill-ride unlike anything you've ever seen!" Six employees at a closing Video Rental Store are pulled into a VHS take inhabiting action movie avatars while Brennan Lee Mulligan provides voices and actions to every ally and enemy the party comes across.</p>
<p>Never Stop Blowing Up uses the<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kids-on-bikes-second-edition-now-available"> <em>Kids on Bikes</em> TTRPG system</a> but with an additional twist that every character's stats begin at a d4, then if the dice lands on its highest number it 'explodes' allowing the players to not only roll their dice again, but roll the dice of the next higher value.</p>
<h2>How <em>Kids On Bikes</em> Was Tweaked For <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em></h2>
<p>"I love <em>Kids on Bikes</em> so so much, I've so enjoyed it for Mentopalis and Misfits &amp; Magic, when we were crafting <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> as a game system we were heavily inspired by <em>Kids on Bikes</em> with the 'blowing up' mechanic."</p>

<p>In talking about why tweaks were necessary for <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> Mulligan explained "The main thing was accommodating the action genre and within the action genre characters say they have specializations but they really don't. You look at action movies and someone's the hacker and someone's the sniper but really they all know kung-fu, they all drive cars fast, everyone is great at everything."</p>
<p>"For the leveling up mechanic we thought the idea of the characters having to unlock the capabilities of their action persona would be a really fun growth arc starting as bumbling bozos and by the end being these action demi-gods."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think that one of the elements of TTRPGs that is always going to stay as a part that players seek out is the power fantasy of improvement." Mulligan continued to expand on power scaling in role playing games "It doesn't need to get to 20th level <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> archmage worldbending power, but because of the choices that I made I got a little bit better."</p>
<h2>Does <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> Know The Meaning Of "Too Far"?</h2>
<p>As <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> progressed each of the characters continued to expand their abilities and available dice creating more ridiculous scenes as the adventure went on. For a GM wanting to create an adventure not only entertaining to the players but also an audience watching at home I wanted to know what kinds of checks and balances were in place to ensure the series never took things too far, or if "too far" was even an option?</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brennan-nsbu-outfit-change.jpg?itok=s_hEjKg7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brennan-nsbu-outfit-change.jpg?itok=kMpWY8Ag 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"We bought ourselves a health amount of cushion with the double dip unreality," Mulligan began explaining that while insane events were occurring for the action heroes the players still needed to keep in mind their 'real world' selves. "You have this nice play space where characters can really do outrageous and surreal things, with the understanding that their real lives are being impacted"</p>
<p>"You fly to space, you stab someone with the Washington Monument, a car gets split in half [...] all of these impossible things are accommodated [...] while the characters get to say 'Yeah this is cartoonish, but if I die here I die in Lake Elsinor.'"</p>
<h2>Sharing The GM Chair</h2>
<p>One of the many insane abilities that the players were able to unlock was the ability to take over the GM seat if they rolled a natural 20. This power came up a handful of times and was used to successfully obtain powerful items, navigate around fights that the party didn't even know was on the horizon, and with some monkey-paw thinking also opened some entertaining avenues for Mulligan.</p>
<p>"This was my ultimate test for. There's a certain amount of zany you can get to but as a GM don't I always have this last card up my sleeve where I can warp reality to my benefit?" Mulligan began to explain his logic behind introducing this ability. "It felt like if we're really going to honor the premise of this season [...] then we've gotta open up the hot seat, we gotta let people come in here and do whatever the hell they want."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ify-nsbu-gm-chair.jpg?itok=65xWKXpd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ify-nsbu-gm-chair.jpg?itok=MGqz43wQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first example of this ability's use had Ify Nwadiwe become the GM, providing Vic Ethanol and Kingskin with powerful new weapons, and having an entire secret hotel of assassins promise that they would protect the party members from any threat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It felt like now not only am I tying both hands behind my back, but I'm also tying my legs behind my back"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Running The Chaos</h2>
<p>An aspect of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> that viewers may not notice is that while the game is ongoing on top of running the game and putting on a show Mulligan is also controlling a variety of effects including the explosions that appear at each 'blow up' and coursing electricity around the dome.</p>
<p>Mulligan let me peak behind the scenes to know what his setup looked like while GMing.</p>
<p>Mulligan began by gesturing with his hands, recreating his setup. "My laptop in front of me, tray with dice to my right, usually I'll have some cards with some game stats up in that area, to my left there will normally be some hand props or production elements, snacks — almonds and a drink like coffee scattered throughout the area — right-lower I'll have my computer bag and books, and to my right I'll have my stream deck which is where I move through my effects and stings that I want to trigger on the Dome walls."</p>

While it looked like there would be a moment of pause and contemplation the response quickly came out; <em>Die Hard</em>.</p>
<p>"Favorite action film is <em>Die Hard</em>, it's not close. Me and Izzy's favorite, it's one of the greatest screenplays ever written, it's unbelievable. The pacing of the plot and the story and action. Ya know, 'yippee ki-yay motherfucker' is one of the greatest lines of all time."</p>
<p>Mulligan highlighted that Izzy Roland's action persona character, Jack Manhattan, was very much based on Bruce Willis' John McClain. An additional shoutout was given to <em>Spy</em> with Melissa McCarthy as a favorite action-comedy of the household.</p>

            <p>
Two and a half years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announcing</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> - or rather the "the first instalment in the new Witcher saga", as it's now more officially known - CD Projekt has confirmed pre-production is almost over and that full production on the game will begin "soon".
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski shared the news in a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-looks-back-at-the-first-half-of-2024/">press release</a> outlining the studio's work so far in 2024, explaining development on the new Witcher game (codenamed Polaris) is "nearing a major milestone which will mark the end of the pre-production phase".
</p>
<p>
In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTl6U3WppEs">earnings video</a> accompanying CD Projekt's latest financial results, chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz expanded on Nowakowski's comments a little, saying, "The Polaris team, working on the next game in The Witcher saga, made substantial progress, which will soon enable us to wrap up pre-production and take this project to the full production phase."

<p>
Little has been revealed about CD Projeckt's next Witcher game beyond a tantalising bit of promo art, but actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">Doug Cockle recently confirmed</a> that while he'll be returning as Geralt of Rivia, the game "won't focus on Geralt. So it's not about him this time."
</p>
<p>
Alongside Polaris, CD Projekt is also continuing to work on projects Orion, Sirius, and Hadar. Sirius is the Witcher spin-off that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-its-better-to-cut-costs-early-following-project-sirus-rethink">re-evaluated and rebooted</a> last year, while Hadar is the studio's new unannounced IP. As for Orion, that's the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> sequel (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiplayer-being-considered-for-cyperpunk-2077-sequel-says-cd-projekt">may or may not have multiplayer</a>), and its Boston-based development team is still "laying the groundwork" for the project, according to Nowakowski in today's studio update.
</p>
<p>
And in other Cyberpunk news, Nowakowski confirmed during the company's latest earnings call (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-definitely-planning-more-cyberpunk-2077-animation-projects">IGN</a>) that CD Projekt is "definitely planning to do more in terms of animation with Cyberpunk" following the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-edgerunners-shows-cd-projekts-cyberpunk-is-still-worth-fighting-for">Netflix's Edgerunners series</a>. And while a Season 2 isn't on the cards according to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-2-is-currently-not-in-the-works-producer-says/">comments</a> made by CD Projekt's Japan country manager Satoru Honma back in 2022, Nowakowski has insisted more animation is coming "for sure".

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/can-you-play-star-wars-outlaws-on-steam-deck.966657/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/play-star-wars-outlaws-steam-deck/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I don’t always get to sit at my computer to play the latest game releases for coverage. As a parent, I play on my Steam Deck frequently, whether waiting for an appointment to start or finish, a few minutes before bedtime, or what have you. But my current obsession this past week is Star Wars Outlaws, and I wouldn’t mind taking the open-world adventure with me everywhere. So, can you play Star Wars Outlaws on Steam Deck?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-star-wars-outlaws-work-on-steam-deck">Does Star Wars Outlaws Work on Steam Deck?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, as Star Wars Outlaws isn’t yet on Steam, it’s not natively supported on Steam Deck. If you want to play on the handheld, you must use a workaround to play via Ubisoft Connect or Epic Games Store. The best way to accomplish this task is by using the Heroic Launcher, which allows you to download various third-party launches, including both we’ve just mentioned here, and download your games through them. It’s easier but not foolproof.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Star Wars Outlaws doesn’t run well on Steam Deck, even using Heroic Launcher. In fact, it doesn’t run well anyway currently, with recent reports claiming Ubisoft is asking PlayStation 5 players to restart their games with a new save file to avoid significant performance issues. It’s unfortunate, especially for those who dove in on day one and spent hours playing as Kay Vess.</p>



<p>In any case, those performance problems plague players on Steam Deck. It drops frames constantly, lags, and stutters, and it’s just an overall poor experience that’s not worth your time!</p>







<h2 id="h-will-star-wars-outlaws-eventually-offer-steam-deck-support">Will Star Wars Outlaws Eventually Offer Steam Deck Support?</h2>



<p>Following the somewhat rocky launch plagued by performance issues and its exclusivity on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store, I suspect Outlaws will inevitably launch on Steam. Sometimes, Ubisoft takes one year to launch its games on Valve’s competing platform. Other times, it’s only about six to eight months. I suspect the latter in this case, but we’ll have to wait and see.</p>



<p>When it inevitably launches on Steam, I hope Ubisoft takes steps to improve Steam Deck performance. By then, they’ll have ironed out many of the game’s bugs and performance problems, though!</p>

Based on the reveal trailer and early information about the game, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma looks to be an evolution of the established RPG-meets-farming-sim formula of previous Rune Factory games. The game is set in Azuma--a fantasy world inspired by Japanese folklore, where players take the role of a magical martial artist known as an "Earth Dancer" on a quest to restore the land by building farms, repairing villages, and taking on RPG-style quests and boss battles.</p><p dir="ltr">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma will feature two physical versions on Nintendo Switch, including a <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1852066891932500530%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-preorder-guide%2F1100-6526172%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">standard edition</a></strong> with the base game and a limited <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1852066430629796318%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-preorder-guide%2F1100-6526172%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Earth Dancer Edition</a></strong> that comes with collectible goodies and bonus in-game content.

Customers can customize their bundle with games like Death Stranding, The Elder Scrolls Online, Fallout 4, Devil May Cry 5, Resident Evil 3, and more, including a selection of solid indie titles as well. And like Fanatical's other bundles, the more PC games you pick up from Fanatical's list, the lower the price you'll pay for each of them individually. The bundle starts at two games for 7.50 each, but if you grab four or more games, they'll only run you $7 each. There's no limit to how many games you can pack in, so if you choose to get all 31 games, you'll only pay $217.</p><p>The list of triple-A titles in the Summer Superstars Collection is as long as it is impressive. As mentioned above, several Bethesda-published titles are available, including The Elder Scrolls Online collection--which includes the MMO's base game and all expansions up to and including High Isle--and Fallout 4's Game of the Year Edition, which includes all its DLC. There's also Ghostwire Tokyo, the underrated, supernatural open-world game from Evil Within and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks.</p><p>You can also pick from several Capcom titles for the bundle, including the Resident Evil 3 remake, Devil May Cry 5 + Vergil, the Devil May Cry HD Collection, and the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy. The Summer Superstars Collection also has some lesser-known gems that are worth your attention, like the side-scrolling brawler River City Girls 2, Lovecraft-themed boomer shooter Forgive Me Father 2, and Hard West 2--a turn-based strategy game set in a supernatural-tinged Wild West, among many others.

			<p>Call of Duty Zombies has always been incredibly popular, appearing in multiple games. Players were first introduced to the game mode during Call of Duty: World At War in 2008. Since then, it has appeared in many of the other Call of Duty games, with the most recent iteration being Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-showcased-in-codnext-showcase/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> will launch with zombies available, and it was revealed during COD Next that it will launch with two maps.</p>
<p>The two maps are called Liberty Falls and Terminus Island, respectively. These maps will see the return of round-based zombies, with Liberty Falls being a derelict West Virginian map. However, while exploring and surviving, players will get to experience a built-up world that highlights stories of people who used to live in Liberty Falls. There are also some side quests for players to pick up and complete for both Liberty Falls and Terminus Island.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Liberty Falls Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jswLipfg94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For Liberty Falls, players will get to experience a rush of nostalgia, as it embraces 90s America. Players can explore a comic shop, a video store, and a bowling alley, for example. The two maps arriving to Black Ops 6 Zombies are vastly different from each other, with Liberty Falls being somewhat more "upbeat" and vibrant and Terminus Island being dark and gloomy.</p>
<p>Although it may sound like the Black Ops 6 Zombies game mode adds very little to the game, there are also plenty of new weapons to use, such as the Thrustodyne M23 and the Wunderwaffe DG-2, both of which have powerful capabilities and can easily clear waves of zombies.</p>
<p>There is also a new Perk Machine for players to utilize, where players can charge up their Dedicated Melee with a perk called the Melee Macchiato. However, that's not all. While you roam around the two maps in Zombies, you can also find unique traps across both maps, such as "Trigger the Aetherella Trap in the Liberty Falls Comic Shop."</p>
<p>During this deep dive at COD Next, they also mentioned the quality-of-life changes that will be happening in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies. Door costs will now be shared across players, so there's no more worrying about another player rushing ahead without you. There will also be player-specific drops and three self-revives per player. Plenty of minor updates are being made to make the Zombies experience more enjoyable, and they have all been detailed in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-black-ops-6-reveal-zombies-liberty-falls-showcase-intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new blog</a> to recap the events of the COD Next showcase.</p>
