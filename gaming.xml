<p>What's that? You're still catching up on the news from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer"><em>last</em> Direct</a>? There's no time for that! Nintendo has another showcase up its sleeve, an Indie World to be precise, and it's right around the corner!</p>
<p>Yes, Nintendo is keeping the presentations coming today, with the Indie World set to kick off in a little under half an hour at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST</strong>. There's only 15 minutes put aside for this one, but we can expect "new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch", so that's something.</p>
<p>All of this will be heading to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional equivalent), but if you'd rather watch with us Nintendo Lifers — and have a bit of a natter along the way — you can do exactly that by checking out the stream below.</p>
<p>We are just minutes away from our second Nintendo presentation in two weeks, so make sure you're sitting comfortably, and let's get ready for some indie news.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-david-smith-leaving</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/media-molecule-co-founder-david-smith-departs-to-focus-on-personal-projects.1264314/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Media Molecule co-founder David Smith has announced that he's leaving the studio after nearly 20 years in order to focus on his own personal projects.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mediamolecule.bsky.social/post/3lvqf3rzp622e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Smith says that while he's "proud" of everything Media Molecule has created, he has been "feeling a growing itch to explore truly wild ideas and make things based on [his] personal whimsy".</p>

<p>He says that while he still "greatly enjoy[s] the creative dynamic of working at Media Molecule", he doesn't have enough time to do so and work on his personal projects "without entirely giving up on pursuing that mythical creature called 'work-life balance'".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/media-molecule-david-smith-leaving-dreams.jpg?itok=zxymWiTs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/media-molecule-david-smith-leaving-dreams.jpg?itok=f-8xYf8m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Media Molecule is best known for games like the PS4 creative sandbox&nbsp;<em>Dreams</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although he's leaving the studio, Smith says he "hope[s] to be involved with Media Molecule in future", and that he wants to "drop in from time to time", praising the "positivity and free exchange of ideas" that he says "remains true to the founding spirit of the company".</p>

<p>It's not clear exactly what personal projects Smith will be working on; whether he intends to start a new studio away from Media Molecule is unclear. We may well learn more about his plans in the coming months.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with Media Molecule, it's a development studio that was founded back in 2006 by Smith and three others: Mark Healey (who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-co-founder-mark-healey-leaves-studio-after-17-years" rel="nofollow">departed the studio himself back in 2023</a>), Alex Evans, and Kareem Ettouney.</p>

<p>The company's first game as Media Molecule was 2008's PS3 exclusive&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, a platformer that emphasized user-generated levels, although it did also offer a campaign of its own created by Media Molecule staffers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/media-molecule-littlebigplanet-franchise.jpg?itok=rIL-VXCE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/media-molecule-littlebigplanet-franchise.jpg?itok=D0xYVvAU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Media Molecule created the&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>franchise back in 2008.</figcaption></figure><p><em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>would go on to become a successful franchise for Sony, with two further sequels and a number of spinoffs arriving in subsequent years, although Media Molecule itself stepped away from the series in 2014.</p>

<p>The studio's most recent release is&nbsp;<em>Dreams</em>, the PS4 creativity sandbox that acts as a game and content creation tool more than a title in and of itself. Live support for&nbsp;<em>Dreams&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-says-dreams-live-support-is-ending-in-september" rel="nofollow">ended in 2023</a>, but Media Molecule said at the time that it was moving onto an "exciting new project", although we still don't know what that might be.</p>

        <p>They hope to announce a date this autumn</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sony remain confident that Bungie's live service shooter reboot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will launch within their current fiscal year - that is, before March 31st 2026 - and are fairly sure they'll be able to share an exact release date this autumn. They've factored it into their financial forecasts, see. </p>
<p>They're also pretty upbeat about their live service business at large, which accounted for around 40% of first-party software revenue in their last financial quarter, though they acknowledge that they screwed the pooch with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, which got to exist in public for a whole couple of weeks before Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">kicked it into the sun</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>All this comes from the publisher's latest financial earnings call, via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-its-live-service-shift-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly-but-pledges-to-carry-on-and-learn-from-mistakes/">Vengeful Giraffe Computing</a>. "First, about Marathon, how we factored it in the forecast, we expect the launch to happen within the fiscal year," Sony's chief financial officer Lin Tao commented through an interpreter, when pressed about the game's release date by an investor. "But, having said that, this is not a commitment. No official announcement has been given yet."</p>
<p>She added: "We are now doing modifications in development and, based on the progress, in the autumn time frame we believe we can communicate when we can launch [Marathon], either from Bungie or PlayStation."</p>
<p>All this comes in the context of on-going restructuring at Bungie, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">laid off hundreds of people last summer</a> and transferred others to a new studio within Sony. Bungie used to be a "very independent environment" when Sony acquired them in 2022, Tao observed, but "this independence is getting lighter, and Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios, and integration is proceeding." Slight undertones here of the Emperor in Star Wars commenting that the deflector shield will be quite operational, when your friends arrive.</p>
<p>We here at Rock Paper WSTE-M5 Combat Shotgun were moderately enthused about Bungie's recent closed Marathon alpha, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-is-real-looks-ridiculously-stylish-has-a-release-date-and-is-getting-a-closed-alpha-this-month">in terms of the art direction at least</a>. But then came news that it had made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">unapproved usage of somebody else's art</a>, and then came an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">indefinite delay</a>. </p>
<p>In the earnings call, Tao assured that this is unlikely to be another Concord situation. "We are now fixing the problems, so we believe this launch will happen," she told an investor. "If this launch is cancelled we'd need to do the revision of the valuation, however as of now this is not expected."</p>
<p>As for Sony's transition toward live service gaming, she acknowledged that there have been missteps, but pointed out that "if we look at the past five years, five years ago live service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios. We [now] have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, MLB The Show and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, and Bungie's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, so we have these four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner."</p>
<p>The aforesaid 40% proportion of Sony's revenue represents Sony's most recent financial quarter. Tao conceded that "for the full year it's a little less, probably between 20-30%. So in terms of the transformation, it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years you see that there's definitely been a change." Tao did not discuss the reported recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">cancellation of two live service games from Sony Bend and Bluepoint</a>, the latter rumoured to have been working on a new God Of War.</p>
<p>My highly original, sage and hilarious closing thought is that Sony could have just told investors that "it's a Marathon, not a sprint", then surprise-released some kind of playable teaser called Sprint. What kind of game could Sprint have been? Unfortunately, I have now run out of originality, sagacity and hilarity, so must turn the completion of this sketch over to the comments.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-confident-marathon-will-release-by-march-2026-and-that-their-live-service-transition-is-paying-off]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Sony’s chief financial officer has suggested that live-service gaming hasn’t been a&nbsp;<em>complete</em> unmitigated success for PlayStation. With quite some impressive understatement, following a year that saw <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475">the overwhelming failure of <em>Concord</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674">serious delays to Bungie’s&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>, CFO Lin Tao told shareholders on a Q&amp;A call following the release of <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-sold-over-80-million-ps5-in-five-years-2000616264">Sony’s latest financial results</a> that “it’s not entirely going smoothly.”</p> <p>She did, however, defend the company’s continued forays into the genre, pointing out that while there have been a few hundreds of millions of dollars <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">hiccups</a>, there have been successes too. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-its-live-service-shift-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly-but-pledges-to-carry-on-and-learn-from-mistakes/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>, acknowledging that “somewhat negative news has been coming out,” Tao pointed out, “if we look at the past five years, five years ago live-service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios. We [now] have <em>Helldivers 2</em>, <em>MLB The Sho</em>w and&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and&nbsp;Bungie’s&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;2</em>, so we have these four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner.”</p> <p>Fair play on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>. The game is listed in <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf">the latest financial report</a> as having sold 12 million copies across PS5 and PC, although is thought to have sold more than 15 million, and is obviously a massive hit. But it’s worth noting that <em>Destiny 2</em> came out eight years ago in 2017 from Activision, for Xbox and PlayStation, and Bungie was only bought by Sony in 2022.&nbsp;<em>MLB The Show</em> comes out with a new edition annually, so makes for an odd “live-service” proposition, and it’s notable that Sony doesn’t include its sales in its report. <em>Gran Turismo 7 </em>however, launched in 2022, still receives monthly updates, so that counts.</p>

 <p>Given rumors that&nbsp;<em>Concord</em> cost anywhere from $200 million to $400 million, and possibly made back around $1 million, it does seem like perhaps this doesn’t entirely balance the scales. But Tao makes the argument that this is still a new revenue stream that Sony didn’t have five years back, so it’s not to be sniffed at. “For Q1 the live-service ratio was about 40 percent,” <em>VGC</em> reports she told the call. “For the full year it’s a little less, probably between 20 to 30 percent. So in terms of the transformation, it’s not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years you see that there’s definitely been a change.”</p> <p>Thankfully, Sony isn’t pretending it’s all roses. “Of course, we recognize that there are still many issues,” Tao went on to say, “so we should learn the lessons from mistakes and make sure that we introduce live-service content where there’s less waste and it’s more smooth.”</p> <p>This likely explains the extreme measures taken following&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775">extremely badly received alpha</a> in April this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-concord-sony-live-service-ps5-hermen-hulst-1851784483">not risking another&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>-scale disaster so soon after. The game has since been “indefinitely” delayed, but not before it was met with <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">plagiarism accusations</a>. Sony also <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">cancelled multiple live-service projects earlier this year</a>, further casting doubt on the format as a viable medium.</p> <p>Still, the company seems upbeat about the prospects! And it’s certainly got the money to waste. If only it could figure out a way to do it without causing hundreds of people to lose their jobs.</p>

<p>A new Elden Ring Nightreign datamine reveals that developers are working on an endless ranked mode called ‘Deep of Night’. </p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign’s developers, FromSoftware, have been constantly churning out new content for the game for players to immerse themselves in. They recently added the highly requested <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-1-02-patch-notes-july-31-update-duos-finally-added-along-with-relic-filter-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duos mode</a> and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-set-of-everdark-sovereigns-arrive-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new set of Everdark Sovereigns</a>. Interestingly, the latest development reveals that FromSoftware could be cooking a brand new game mode for the title. </p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-s-endless-ranked-mode-has-skill-based-matchmaking">Elden Ring Nightreign’s Endless Ranked Mode Has Skill-Based Matchmaking </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-have-uncovered-plans-for-a-new-endless-mode-with-armored-core-6s-rank-system-and-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, a new post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adminisitrator/comments/1mh908l/elden_ring_nightreign_new_mode_deep_of_night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> talks about Elden Ring Nightreign’s upcoming endless ranked mode, which was datamined from the duos mode patch. The upcoming game mode is called ‘Deep of Night’ and it will be added to the Expeditions menu. The description states that players will not be able to choose these targets, and “difficulty increases with depth”. The player’s rating will increase with every victory, allowing them to proceed to “even greater depths”. The last statement says, “The boundless dark stretches out unto infinity.” </p>



<p>The player ratings in Elden Ring Nightreign’s endless ranked mode will be recorded through ‘Depth’. Victories will increase the player’s Depth rating, and losses will decrease it. There are 5 Depth Tiers to progress through: Depth 1 (Rating 0-999), Depth 2 (Rating 1000-1999), Depth 3 (Rating 2000-3999), Depth 4 (Rating 4000-5999), Depth 5 (Rating 6000+). Once a player is promoted to a higher tier, they cannot be demoted. Also, players will be matched with others of the same Depth; however, if there aren’t enough players in the same Depth, then the pool will be expanded.  </p>



<p>Regardless, players should take this information with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source and wait for an announcement from FromSoftware. </p>



<p>In other news, Elden Ring Nightreign and the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-and-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hit-new-sales-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new sales milestones</a> recently.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-review.1264299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since its debut, the Mafia series has steadily marched forward through the decades – the original is set in the 1930s, its sequel spans the ’40s and ’50s, and Mafia III unfolds during the late ’60s. If the next step was going to be the ’70s, or the ’80s – or both – I was certainly ready. Casino intrigue, shine boxes, borrowing huge kitchen knives from Martin Scorcese’s mother in the middle of the night – whatever it was, I was up for it. However, instead of moving closer to the end of the 20th century, Mafia: The Old Country takes us back to the beginning. And not just the beginning of the century, but to the formative era of the Mafia itself. Part mob drama and part Western, The Old Country may be a safe and conventional third-person action adventure on the surface, but it’s a moody and engaging one that makes great use of its uncommon setting and is brimming with old school atmosphere so heady you can practically smell the sun-dried tomatoes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After experimenting with a more freeform open world structure in the divisive Mafia III, Mafia: The Old Country returns to the format of the original Mafia and Mafia II. That is, it’s linear and tightly story-driven, and the open world is largely just a vivid backdrop to move through between objectives, and during some missions. This has always worked well for the Mafia series, and The Old Country is no exception. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This approach gives The Old Country an effective sense of place and scale – immersing you in a rich and evocative Sicilian countryside – but without bloat.  It’s a very detailed, varied, and convincing map, but there are no towers to scale or arbitrary icons to visit and clear. Your attention is simply required on the story, and the story alone. As a single-player sucker who inhales this kind of thing for its story, setting, and style, I was quickly hooked. If you’re the kind of person who might be tempted to use the Sicilian language option alongside subtitles in the language of your choice, you’re in the right place. If you’re the kind of person who pounds through cutscenes craving their next chance to slap the citizens of Steelport with a giant purple dildo, it’s possible the Mafia series may not be your speed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Family Splatters</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beginning in 1904, The Old Country charts a chronicle in the life of young Sicilian Enzo Favara, who escapes a life of slavery in the region’s dangerous sulphur mines – run by the ruthless Spadaro crime family – to find himself working for their local adversaries, the Torrisi family. The story hits a lot of standard beats, and all the usual suspects are here. The fair and kindly mentor, and the loyal best friend with a habit of testing the patience of others around him. The stern and powerful Don and his cynical consigliere. The slimy and treacherous rival boss, and the forbidden love. There are some neat connections to the existing games in the series too, for fans who pay close attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yes, it’s a fairly familiar and predictable 13-hour saga for anyone with a basic level of gangster movie literacy, but the writing is strong and the voice performances are stronger. The highlight is arguably Don Torrisi himself, whose English voice actor Johnny Santiago injects with a quiet, husky intensity that is as credibly intimidating as a man in his position would need to be. He stalks the screen as the kind of guy that men who kill for a living would actually take orders from.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a fairly familiar and predictable 13-hour saga for anyone with a basic level of gangster movie literacy, but the writing is strong.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Familiar too is the third-person action, as The Old Country plays like any typical cover shooter from the last decade or so. This was the case in 2020’s Mafia: Definitive Edition, and it’s the same again here, albeit with a wild west flavour thanks to the era-specific arsenal (like revolvers, repeaters, and various shotguns) and the fact that shootouts sometimes occur on horseback, and/or against fellas who look like they’ve just stumbled home off the set of a Sergio Leone picture after a full day of making Clint Eastwood look cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even without engaging much with its rosary bead system of minor combat buffs (which I <em>did </em>regularly forget about), it’s not a massive challenge with the default, soft-locking aiming controls. However, I don’t play these sorts of games to be relentlessly punished. Some enemies will hunker down behind large objects and walls, and others will stoically stride towards you to be blown out of their boots. The AI isn’t always sharp (and it’s definitely a little janky to find yourself completely flanked but still have the time to stand up and clumsily blast a bloke who had you dead to rights at point blank range) but the shootouts are nonetheless serviceable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Old Country’s stealth doesn’t rewrite the rule book either, but it does strengthen the action overall. Stealth is sometimes required by the design of the mission at hand, but on other occasions it’s available as an option. There are a number of encounters throughout with environments that have been laid out for us to be able to sneak around and pick off all the enemies one by one, but also seamlessly pivot to hosting an out-and-out gunfight should you flub it and be spotted.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can toss coins and bottles for distraction, but unfortunately only <em>some </em>bottles (that is, the ones arbitrarily marked). It’s always a bit of an immersion breaker when levels are decorated with inconsistent props. I’d vastly prefer to just be able to pick up any bottle. Failing that, just delete the bottles we can’t pick up during missions. Crucially, you <em>can </em>pick up and move bodies, and there are boxes to stash them in. The stealth is pretty standard, but with distractions and body hiding it <em>does </em>feel like a proper stealth system and not a tacked on afterthought.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The stealth is pretty standard, but with distractions and body hiding it does feel like a proper stealth system and not a tacked on afterthought.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Enzo can temporarily highlight nearby enemies in the environment, which is essentially a superpower that’s handwaved away as his impeccable instincts (it probably could’ve been more logically introduced during the underground intro as some kind of innate ability he honed after spending the bulk of his childhood in a dark sulfur mine, but no matter). At any rate, once you have a feel for where your enemies are and which way they’re headed, all that’s left is to sneak around, grab them, and either button-bash to strangle them or tap your knife attack to speed up the process. That said, I actually rarely used the latter. Not because I was feeling merciful, but because stabbing your victims costs you a block of “durability” off your knife (which needs to be sharpened with a whetstone if and when it “runs out” of… stabs). It’s not a gamebreaker, but I’m not really into the idea of not being able to stab a bloke simply because my knife is immediately no longer pointy enough to do so after slaying a few of his mates (and whetstones were a consumable I didn’t always have). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I mainly just strangled my enemies to avoid this issue, but it feels like a slightly unnecessary system – particularly when durability concerns disappear during The Old Country’s new one-on-one knife fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These knife fights are essentially boss encounters, presented as a one-on-one showdown with another man. They occur outside regular third-person action gameplay, and you’re locked into these battles until there’s a result (or your opponent is scripted to scarper). The attacks, parries, and dodges in knife fights are bespoke to this mode alone. They’re flashy and bloody, but a lot of the time I did just feel I was simply dodging and slashing my way to a cutscene, where a further complication or a switch in momentum will occur. Sometimes you’ll trigger an animation that makes you a passenger for a while, then Enzo’s health bar recharges while your enemy’s does not. I’m not sure what the thought was there. The knife fights look cool, and they’re not like anything in the series to date, but they do feel a little low stakes at times.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mafia: The Old Country – Meet Your New Family</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Red Dead Redenzione</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As a linear adventure, The Old Country admittedly doesn’t share the same scope of Rockstar’s genre-defining Westerns – but it’s certainly adjacent to them in tone and atmosphere. There’s a certain undeniable swagger that comes with riding into town on horseback (and on the wrong side of the law), and The Old County captures this with similar effectiveness to the Red Dead series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The early 1900s setting doesn’t just shine a spotlight on the early days of the Sicilian Mafia, it’s also a window back to the Edwardian era of automobiles – when cars began competing with horses as the primary method of transportation. Developer Hangar 13 has done an exceptional job in this department, especially with the sound.</p><div id="rank-these-non-gta-open-world-actiondriving-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these non-GTA open world action/driving games</h3><h3>Rank these non-GTA open world action/driving games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These 120-year-old cars have primitive engines, whining chain drives, and open cabins with no sound deadening, and The Old Country has captured their raw and lumpy burbles immaculately. It definitely can’t be understated how much richness this adds to driving around the map. It’s not just engine sounds, either. When a gramophone is brought on a drunken car trip, be sure to listen as it misbehaves when you bounce around off road. There’s a lot of consideration here, and I respect that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, there’s a race mission – but it’s not been shoehorned in here to taunt those who are still haunted by the infamously tricky racing event in the original Mafia. Sicily was the home of the Targa Florio – established in 1906 and one of the oldest motor racing events in the world – so it makes perfect sense in context.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Old Country’s riff on this race is sadly all too brief – it’s over in less than seven minutes – but it is one of the most memorable and thrilling missions. It certainly made me wish Enzo could’ve cut ties with the Cosa Nostra and raced around Europe full time. I don’t know what’s more dangerous: betraying your oath to the family or trying to tame an aircraft engine that’s had four tyres and a steering wheel strapped to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of engines, however, it should be noted that The Old Country shifts the Mafia series off its previous proprietary one and onto Unreal Engine 5. From my perspective, the impact isn’t a dramatically profound one – 2020’s Mafia: Definitive Edition remains a handsome looking game, and so is The Old Country. What I can say is that I haven’t experienced any of the minor bugs that occurred during my first playthrough of Mafia: Definitive Edition, and that I haven’t had to restart checkpoints to overcome unexpected jankiness (or fallen through the map) – at least on PC, as we weren’t provided access to the console versions ahead of launch, so we’ll have to wait and see how those run. But outside of the occasional framerate flutter and some light pop-in, my time with The Old Country has been quite robust. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although, perhaps not quite as robust as the incredible array of food and produce on display throughout. Games rarely make me this hungry. A game may have <em>never </em>made me this hungry. I’m craving cannolis and cake. I’m wading through arancini ball recipes. I’m considering a vegetable garden to grow tomato varieties I can’t find.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve officially turned into my dad, and The Old Country is the game that did it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review]]></content:encoded>

Somewhat negative news has been coming out, but if you look five years ago, live-service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, MLB, [Gran Turismo 7] and Bungie's Destiny 2," Tao continued. "So we have these four live services contributing to sales and profit in a stable manner... In terms of the transformation, it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years, you see that there has definitely been change."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, questions remain over Sony's future live-service prospects, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">Bungie's delayed Marathon</a> and also heist shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgame$</a>, the debut project from Haven Studios of which we've heard nothing for some time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Founded in 2021 and acquired by Sony a year later, Haven had been helmed by Assassin's Creed producer and games industry veteran Jade Raymond — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-woes-continue-as-playstation-executive-jade-raymond-exits-fairgames-developer-after-external-test-sparked-concern">until her exit from the company back in May</a>. Little has been seen of what Haven has been developing for the past four years, and now Fairgame$ has reportedly been delayed until at least 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing the status of Marathon specifically, Tao said Sony still expects the game to launch before April 2026, during the current financial year, but cautioned that this was "not a commitment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Based on the progress [made] in the autumn timeframe, we believe we can communicate when we will be launching," Tao said. "We are now fixing the problems. So we believe this launch will happen. If this launch is cancelled, we need to do a revision of the valuation. However, as of now, this is not expected."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Tao mentioned that Sony was in the process of gaining a much tighter grip on developer Bungie, after previously offering it "a very independent environment." This tallies with past comments from a former Bungie lawyer, who stated that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-forcing-bungie-to-get-their-heads-out-their-asses-and-run-destiny-2-like-a-business-is-very-much-a-good-thing-studios-ex-lawyer-says">Sony was now "forcing" the studio to "get their heads out their asses" and run Destiny 2 like a proper business</a> — something he said was actually a good thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This type of independence is getting lighter," Tao said. "So Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios. In the long term, you can see this as an ongoing process, so the direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behind the scenes, Sony has recently cancelled a slew of projects that never made it into the public eye. These include a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games">live-service God of War title in development at Bluepoint</a>, and another live-service title being made by Days Gone developer Bend. Firesprite previously <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-cancels-twisted-metal-live-service-game-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">ditched a live-service Twisted Metal project</a>, while Insomniac was known to have worked on a <a href="https://in.ign.com/marvels-spider-man-2/203705/news/spider-man-the-great-web-new-leak-reveals-another-gameplay-trailer-for-the-cancelled-title" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live-service co-op Spider-Man game titled The Great Web</a>. Most high profile of all, though, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-but-naughty-dog-canceled-it-after-bungie-explained-what-it-takes-to-make-live-service-games-ex-playstation-exec-says">Naughty Dog's live-service The Last of Us multiplayer effort</a>, which the studio also ultimately ditched after years of work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, recent PlayStation events have focused more squarely on the company's upcoming slate of single-player blockbusters, such as the highly-anticipated Ghost of Yōtei and Naughty Dog's sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-wouldve-tried-to-resist-sonys-live-service-push">former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida said he would have tried to resist Sony’s controversial live service video game push</a> — and mulled that "maybe that's one of the reasons they removed me from the first-party!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The DLC introduces Paint Junior as a new playable character, complete with a new weapon and unique magical moveset. Paint Junior is the first new addition to the Castle Crashers roster since Blacksmith and Pink Knight were added in 2011.</p><p>The meat of the DLC is the brand-new Painter Boss Toolkit--a feature that allows players to design their own custom characters and weapon skins. Players will be able to customize their character's head, body, weapon, shield, portrait, beefy form, and Back Off Barbarian art, by using a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/204360/view/655950199566373626" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">template</a> provided by The Behemoth. The DLC also integrates Steam Workshop for the first time, allowing players to explore and enjoy other fans' custom creations.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OYpEUMQhz8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6OYpEUMQhz8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Painter Boss Paradise comes with a handful of pre-loaded custom characters designed by The Behemoth's art team, but the indie studio is encouraging fans to get their own characters into the game. Any characters who are uploaded in the first week of the DLC may have a chance to be featured on the studio's next livestream.</p><p>The DLC also includes brand-new art for playable characters, weapons, and the world map, but players will have the option to toggle off the DLC at any time if they wish to go back to the vanilla Castle Crashers experience.</p><p>Players who choose not to purchase the new DLC will still get to benefit from a general update to the base game, including refreshes to art and animation, UI improvements, and a few other quality-of-life improvements. Check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/204360/view/543365188100816922" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">all the changes</a> for the base game and the Painter Boss Paradise DLC below:</p><h2>Global Updates (Classic + Fresh)</h2><p>The following updates are now present in the base game of Castle Crashers, in addition to the DLC version!</p><p><b>1.

The trio of Namco classics were launch titles for the 7800 nearly 40 years ago, so it's pretty cool they are launch titles for the Pac-Man Edition Console.

            <p>
Sony's chief financial officer Lin Tao has admitted PlayStation's live-service strategy - which has seen a string of high-profile flops, delays, and cancellations after a bullish start back in 2022 - is "not entirely going smoothly". Tao has also confirmed Destiny developer Bungie's independence is to be reduced as it's folded into PlayStation Studios.
</p>
<p>
Former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan infamously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">announced an ambitious live-service-focused future</a> for the company in 2022, shifting many of its studios - best known for their acclaimed single-player titles - onto live-service development in order to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">release a planned 12 games by 2026</a>. It also set up new live-focused studios, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">acquiring Bungie for $3.6bn</a>.
</p>
<p>
However, it didn't take long for rumblings of discontent at the company to surface following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">Ryan's decision to step down as PlayStation boss</a> in 2023. Just days later, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-pivot-may-not-pay-off-the-way-jim-ryan-had-once-hoped-says-industry-insider">Sony was "uncomfortable" about Ryan's dramatic live-service gambit</a>. By the end of that year, one high-profile live-service game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">standalone multiplayer The Last of Us title</a> - had already got the chop, and other projects followed.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live-service Twisted Metal Project was axed</a>, alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">live-service Spider-Man game from Insomniac</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-online-co-op-combat-game-set-in-fantasy-london">multiplayer project from PlayStation Studios' London Studio</a>. And following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Concord's dramatic flop</a> last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-layoffs-at-playstation-following-live-service-cancellations">significant layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">studio closures</a>, and more live-service cancellations - reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">including a God of War game from Bluepoint and something from Days Gone developer Bend</a> - have followed. Throw in reports of Sony's increasing frustration with Bungie management, which seemingly recently peaked with Marathon's recent delay, and it's clear Ryan's vision of a live-service future for PlayStation has been less than successful.
</p>
<p>
All of which brings us back to today, and concerned questions from investors regarding PlayStation's live-service plans as part of Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_sonypre.pdf">latest financial results</a> Q&amp;A. Speaking via an interpreter (as detailed by <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-on-marathon-live-service-strategy-its-not-entirely-going-smoothly/">TWIV</a>), Sony's chief financial officer and corporate executive officer Lin Tao acknowledged the "somewhat negative news" its live-service strategy has so far generated, specifically referencing Concord and Marathon's recent delay. "In terms of the transformation [toward live-service games]," she later added, "it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years, you see that there has definitely been change."
</p>
<p>
As to the significance of that timeframe, Tao explained, "Five years ago, live-service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios... We [now] have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, MLB, [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>] and Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>. So we have these four live services contributing to sales and profit in a stable manner."
</p>
<p>
"Of course," she added, "we recognise that there are still issues – many issues – so we should learn lessons from mistakes and make sure that we introduce live service content, where there's less waste and it's more smooth." This follows comments from PlayStation Studios boss Herman Hulst earlier this year, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remains-committed-to-diverse-and-resilient-live-service-games-including-forthcoming-marathon-and-fairgames-despite-high-profile-failures">company remains committed to building "a diverse and resilient" portfolio of live-service titles</a>, including the upcoming Fairgames.
</p>
<p>
As for Bungie's roll in PlayStation's live-service future, its previous autonomy is set to be reduced. Bungie has moved from controversy to controversy since its acquisition in 2022, facing ongoing reports of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">mismanagement and executive toxicity</a>. That's alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-delays-destiny-2s-final-shape-expansion-and-marathon">delays</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">layoffs</a>, cancellations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">claims of tumbling staff morale</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">plagiarism scandals</a>, the reported underperformance of its releases, increasing fan frustration around the handling of its flagship title Destiny 2, and more. It's long been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-staff-reportedly-worried-about-bungies-future">reported</a> Bungie's autonomy could be on the line if the studio failed to turn things around, and it seems Sony is now ready to take control.
</p>
<p>
"At the time of acquisition, we were offering [Bungie] a very independent environment," Tao explained of the studio's relationship with PlayStation. "However, thereafter, we have gone through structural reform, as we announced last year. So this type of independence is getting lighter. So Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios. In the long term... the direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios".
</p>
<p>
Next up from Bungie, of course, is its PvP-focused Marathon reboot, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">delayed indefinitely following a poor reception to its big unveiling earlier this year</a>. At the time of its delay, Bungie said it would have more news to share this "autumn", and Tao has now confirmed Marathon's launch is  expected to happen within Sony's current fiscal year. "But having said that," she added, "this is not a commitment, and no official announcement has been given yet."
</p>
<p>
"We are now fixing the problems. So we believe this launch will happen. If this launch is cancelled, we need to do a revision of the valuation. However, as of now, this is not expected."

			<p>Neverwinter Nights 2 is a game I didn’t play when I was younger. I don’t know why, because I loved the first game when I was a teenager despite not really knowing what I was doing, but I just never grabbed the sequel back in the day. I did eventually venture in about two months ago, loading up the original game with a bunch of mods, and that very recent experience has me questioning why Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition is really necessary.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TgSqwnpjxyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Neverwinter Nights 2 is a CRPG built around the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 ruleset. It’s big, complex, and incredibly satisfying provided you know what you’re doing. The star here is the story and writing, which is incredibly deep and has more detail that’s just mentioned in passing than you’ll know what to do with. Starting in a village that is inevitably attacked, you recover a macguffin and are sent to the city of Neverwinter by your almost comically disinterested adoptive father. From there begins the kind of fantasy adventure you’d expect, although sometimes with enemies you might not, such as the lizardfolk which are a scourge upon your progress early on.</p>



<p>It’s an excellent game, truly a classic, but this remaster has done the absolute minimum. For one, I played this game on PC three months ago and I’m not certain there’s much of a visual difference between what I saw on my PC then and this enhanced edition. It still looks pretty dated, despite improvements to texture quality, which have counterintuitively made environments look strangely sparse. Characters fare a little better, honestly looking quite good when you’re zoomed out considering, but when you’re in conversation and the camera is zoomed all the way in, they’re still a bit rough. They’re still better than the ones in the first game and its remaster, though that’s more down to the leap in graphics tech between 2002 and 2006 than this remaster.</p>

<p>Little seems to have been done to improve the actual gameplay experience as well. There are also bugs, such as one from just the first fifteen minutes of play that forced me to repeatedly murder a villager who kept getting back up. I was supposed to beat him up a little and then he gives up and agrees to go help defend the town, but instead he continued attacking me afterwards, constantly distracting my party members so they weren’t with me when I triggered combat.</p>

<p>There’s also annoying little things wrong as well, such as having to open a door, then interact with the door again to actually use it, which is dumb on its own (just go through the door the first time!) and fiddly because positioning yourself to interact with it is awkward and the camera has a habit of suddenly zooming all the way in when I’m standing in front of a door so I can’t see. This happened on literally the first door I used.</p>
<p>As a console port of an old PC game, the controls are about what you’d expect for a keyboard and mouse game on a controller. It works just well enough that you’ll be able to put up with the awkwardness if you love the game. It’s definitely not ideal, but it does the job.</p>

<p>Outside of all this, it’s Neverwinter Nights 2 with all of its expansions playable on consoles with a controller. That’s nice. It would’ve been nicer to see some real attention given to these games to perhaps iron out some now almost twenty year old bugs and really improve things, but at least it’s playable and exactly how you remember it. For better or worse. Of course you could just play the original on PC and benefit from all the mods that have released over the years, no doubt some of which will also improve the game’s textures.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition does the bare minimum as it brings the game to consoles. It looks a bit better, but that's about it. It's still buggy and rough around the edges, but it is at least Neverwinter Nights 2. If you really want to sit back and play it with a controller, this will do it for you. If you want anything more, the original is more than playable on pretty much any PC, and has deep mod support.	</p></div>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/mafia-the-old-country-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-the-gangster-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> launches tomorrow, nearly nine years after the last mainline entry in the franchise, making fans more than eager to get their hands on this new game. Sure, in 2020, there was the Mafia: Definitive Edition remake of the original classic from 2002, but this is a new story, albeit one set in the past.</p>



<p>As the title suggests, Mafia: The Old Country does not take place in America's fictional cities of Lost Heaven, Empire Bay, or New Bordeaux. Instead, it is an origin story of the Sicilian Mafia set on Italy's island very early in the 1900s.</p>



<p>In that light, it is more interesting from a narrative perspective because it shows the true roots of the Mafia. Most American movies have focused on the American side, but the Italian side is where you really understand what it's all about - chiefly, the unyielding adherence to certain values of that world, for better and for worse.</p>



<p>As an Italian myself, I was doubly glad that Hangar 13 chose this setting. Sicily has long been neglected in videogames, and there's hardly a better chance to portray it than in a new Mafia title. To do so, the developers from Hangar 13 (headquartered in Novato, California, but with two offices in the Czech Republic) partnered with local game developer Stormind Games, known for titles like Remothered: Tormented Fathers and Broken Procelain, Batora: Lost Haven, and A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.</p>



<p>Through a joint effort documented in a developer diary, Stormind helped Hangar 13 recreate turn-of-the-twentieth-century Sicily, and I'm pleased to report that the results are excellent. In fact, Mafia: The Old Country may very well include the best, most accurate rendition of Sicily ever seen in a game. Everything from the visuals to the dialect and the music is faithfully reproduced. To that end, I would recommend selecting the extremely well-done Sicilian voiceover and add to that whatever subtitles you need to maximize immersion.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mafia_The_Old_Country_Hillside_Church-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>That's particularly useful because the game is heavily narrative-driven. All the games in the franchise were, albeit to a different extent. Mafia III, for example, included a proper open world experience, whereas previous entries allowed for open world exploration but only offered minimal side activities. </p>



<p>For this new game, Hangar 13 cut all that. There are no real side activities to be found in Mafia: The Old Country, unless you consider gathering hidden fox-like statuettes or Trinacria symbols such a thing. No, the game is very linear, jumping straight from mission to mission. It can be compared to the Uncharted series in this regard (though the very last one, 2017's The Lost Legacy, actually allowed a decent degree of open ended gameplay that is absent here), with plenty of car chases and setpieces to mark pivotal moments in the story.</p>



<p>The game does occasionally allow you to roam a bit of the countryside of San Celeste (a fictional town located in the vicinity of Mount Etna, which would put it in Eastern Sicily) by car or horse, but there really is nothing to do there except look at the gorgeous environments. I can't help but think that's a bit of a shame - while I understand why the developers decided to go with a full linear design (and a lower price), I believe there's a lot of potential in an open world game set in Sicily, provided that it is filled with enough content to make the exploration worth it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mafia_The_Old_Country_Horse_Riding-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>During missions, gameplay consists of a blend of stealth and shooting, just like in the aforementioned Uncharted franchise (platforming, however, is entirely absent). In most missions, you're given the chance to either go in guns blazing or get the drop on the enemies first. Sneaking behind an enemy triggers a little mini-game where you must mash a button repeatedly to fill a bar to knock out the unlucky foe. You can then grab the body and hide it somewhere it won't be seen; otherwise, some other guard could alert the whole map against you. The developers have conveniently (perhaps even too conveniently) placed a great many trunks throughout the levels where bodies of knocked-out foes can be hidden. This is where I noticed something odd: not only could each trunk fit as many as three bodies before becoming unavailable for further disposal, but the previously deposited bodies simply disappeared, with the trunk looking empty each time. A missing detail, albeit a small one, to be sure. </p>



<p>Whenever multiple enemies are looking in the same direction, you can distract one either with a coin toss or by grabbing an empty bottle from the environment and launching it elsewhere. If stealth fails, it will come to shooting. Here, Mafia: The Old Country includes various era-appropriate weapons, from small pistols to sawed-off shotguns, regular shotguns, and long-range guns. These can either be acquired by spending denari (the in-game currency that can be looted off enemies and acquired from small chests after breaking them open with a knife) or by simply looting from the ground weapons used by defeated foes. The shooting component is solid enough, if not quite exceptional. Enemy AI is not the smartest during stealth, but it appears to be more proactive when fights break out, advancing at a steady pace and even flanking the main character's position. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the game lacks a seamless transition from stealth to melee combat, which is a bit jarring. If, for some reason, the enemy you're sneaking on turns early enough, you cannot really switch to fist-fighting like you would in another action/adventure title such as Uncharted. In that case, you'd have to switch to guns instead, as there is no bare-handed melee combat. </p>



<p>The game does include extensive knife fights, but only in one-on-one, cinematic duels against key characters. In these instances, the camera switches to focus solely on the two fighters, not unlike a fighting game. The moveset is a conventional one: the player can select two types of strikes, and also parry and counterattack, and dodge, which is particularly useful against those attacks that cannot be parried (as with most games, they are highlighted in red). They are, effectively, 'boss fights', including two big bars for each contender.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mafia_The_Old_Country_Knife_Fight-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country does feature some character progression, but it's honestly paper-thin. You can equip a few items that provide small boons, such as the chance to dodge a bullet or the ability to carry extra ammunition or bandages. These items can be found scattered throughout the levels, but they do not make much of a difference. Overall, the challenge level is decent when playing on Hard.</p>



<p>By far the best reason to play this game is witnessing the rise and fall of Enzo Favara. The protagonist of Mafia: The Old Country is an orphan youngster who spent long years toiling as an indentured laborer, practically a slave, in the sulfur mines. Following the death of his one and only friend in the mines, Enzo takes his chances and escapes, ending up under the protection of Don Bernardo Torrisi. He begins as the lowliest laborer there, but soon proves his worth in increasingly challenging circumstances. </p>



<p>Without spoiling anything, the plot is pretty much what you can expect from the genre: a talented low-born's tumultuous rise all the way to the top, only to fall again in the end. That said, even without any big twists, the story is told exceptionally well, especially during the cutscenes (the dialogues outside of the cutscenes have worse facial animations). The characters are memorable, if a bit trite, and will stay with you even after reaching the game's ending, which took me twelve hours.</p>



<p>From a technical standpoint, Mafia: The Old Country is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and looks suitably appealing, showing off gorgeous environmental details. Stuttering is thankfully minimal and perhaps that's mostly due to the lack of any open-world elements, which might have complicated matters. The PC version does not feature any ray tracing, offering only standard UE5 options. When it comes to upscalers, all main options are available: Unreal Engine's TSR, NVIDIA DLSS (with Frame Generation selectable in-game and the Multi Frame Generation override available via NVIDIA app), AMD FSR and Intel XeSS (both without frame generation). Even at max settings and 4K resolution, the game only needs about 6.4GB of VRAM.</p>



<p>Finally, the soundtrack is owed a well-earned mention for complementing the mood and ambience in such a striking way.</p>

				<p>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released its financial statement for the first quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and sales are up compared to last year, with the company pledging to continue focusing on its live-service offerings in the future.</p>

<p>As revealed in the statement's accompanying financial <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_sonyspeech.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">documents</a>, overall sales for Sony's gaming segment are up by 8% compared to the first quarter of 2024-25, and operating income more than doubled for "a new quarterly high".</p>

<p>These numbers are up due mainly to "increased sales of third-party software", and while Sony doesn't specify which games sold particularly well, it's very likely that games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Oblivion Remastered</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur</em></a>, and the PS5 release of&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>bolstered its numbers for this quarter.</p>

<p>In a Q&amp;A following the release (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-its-live-service-shift-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly-but-pledges-to-carry-on-and-learn-from-mistakes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Sony CFO Lin Tao said the company will continue to pursue live-service games despite "negative news" about its two most recent live-service releases, namely&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Marathon</i>.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">unceremoniously shut down last year</a> following a disastrous launch, while Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed following negative feedback</a> from its alpha test, as well as news that the game contained <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">art stolen from an online artist</a>.</p>

<p>Tao says that despite these problems, live-service games are "contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner", citing the aforementioned three still-operational live-service games, as well as&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I'm sure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> won't be exactly the same game, despite their obvious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">bullet casing-littered common ground</a>. However, they are opting to mirror each other in one manner - both will require you to enable secure booting on your PC.</p>
<p>As if summoned to do so by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">EA letting everyone know</a> that this week's BF6 open beta would necessitate a delve in your BIOS to click yes on a thing in the name of eliminating cheating, Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05">have revealed</a> Blops is doing the same thing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>With the arrival of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a>'s season five today, August 7, EA are initiating a "phased rollout" of secure booting and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 as mandatory requirements when hopping into an entry of the series. The goal is to stop folks from loading any files not flagged as 'safe' when they fire up their PCs, such as ones they might use to do the likes of aimbotting or wallhacking.</p>
<p>The switch isn't happening overnight, with this Black Ops 6 season still letting you jump in if you've not enabled one or both features, but you will be served notifications telling you to sort your setup out for the future in that case. Then, when Black Ops 7 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-been-announced-can-someone-please-explain-the-plot-of-these-games-to-me">prone-crawls its way out of the gulag</a> later this year, it'll be mandatory to have both enabled to play.</p>
<p>"These hardware-level protections are a key part of our anti-cheat efforts, and we’re asking all players to get compliant now," Activision wrote. They also provided <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot">instructions</a> as to how to check whether you've got secure boot and TPM 2.0 enabled via your BIOS settings, and turn them on if not.</p>
<p>If your game-playing box's specs are fairly up-to-date, and especially if you're running Windows 10 or 11, it shouldn't be too much of a faff to sort. That's provided you're open to taking these extra steps with your own hardware as part of publishers' efforts to try and combat cheating by, in Activision's words, enacting measures to "strengthen security and protect the experience, without impacting performance."</p>
<p>As of right now, the company don't have any immediate plans to make secure booting and TMP 2.0 mandatory for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>, but they indicate that could change in future. They also wrote that they'll "share more details on additional protection measures we’ll be putting in place for Call of Duty as we get closer to the Black Ops 7 launch", and that enabling two-factor authentication on your Activision account might become mandatory down the road.</p>
<p>If it helps, maybe imagine it's Captain Price ordering you to do all of this admin just to shoot some folks dressed in swanky tactical getups. Also, if you've been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped">sitting in a Battlefield 6 beta queue all morning</a>, some server messing about by EA should hopefully help you get in soon.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> has passed another round number milestone, as Sony has announced that they have shipped 80.3 million consoles.</p>
<p>The past quarter – ending on 30th June – saw Sony ship 2.5 million more PS5s, up from 2.4 million in the same quarter last year, which is good news for the continued appeal of the platform.&nbsp;Digging back through <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/18q2_supplement.pdf">Sony’s older financial statements</a>, the PS4 would have been at 79.6 million consoles sold by the same point in its lifetime, so the PS5 is sneaking ahead of the last generation at this point.</p>


<p>Even better, of course, is that people are still massively engaged with PlayStation gaming in general. There were 123 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network last quarter, up by seven million from the year before. Similarly, game sales for both PS5 and PS4 combined for 65.9 million games sold, up by 12.3 million from last year. Of that, 6.9 million were first party titles, and we’re now at the point where 83% of games sold are digital downloads.</p>
<p>All good stuff for Sony and PlayStation 5.</p>

		<p>Sony’s CFO has stated that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> is expected to release by the end of March 2026, as Bungie’s independence from PlayStation Studios is now “getting lighter”</p>
<p>The statements came from CFO Lin Tao as part of a Q&amp;A following Sony’s latest financial statements, in which she said that launch is still expected within the current fiscal year, ending on 31st March 2026. However, as this was in response to a question over what would happen if Marathon was cancelled outright, she added, “this is not a commitment. No official announcement has been given yet.”</p>


<p>She also said, “We are now doing modifications in development and, based on the progress, in the autumn time frame we believe we can communicate when we can launch [Marathon], either from Bungie or PlayStation.”</p>
<p>For Bungie as a studio, there’s been plenty of speculation and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/bungies-independence-reportedly-under-threat-developers-suffering-low-morale/">reporting over their independence</a> and ability to operate separately from the rest of PlayStation Studios. Through 2024, the company went through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">a painful round of layoffs and game cancellations</a>, while some teams were branched off into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/sony-founds-new-studio-teamlfg-from-former-bungie-incubation-project/">separate studios</a>.</p>
<p>Tao explained Sony’s longterm plan for Bungie and that “at the time of acquisition we were offering a very independent environment, so that was one way of thinking. However, thereafter, we have gone through structural reform, as we announced last year, so this independence is getting lighter, and Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios, and integration is proceeding.</p>

<p>“So in the long term, if you can see this as an ongoing process, the direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios.”</p>
<p>It’s definitely concerning times for Bungie, with the launch of Destiny 2’s latest expansion, The Edge of Fate, seeming to do poorly, both from the point of sales and reaction from the game’s fanbase. Marathon was intended to be the big shining hope for the company, but the extraction shooter revamp of the studio’s mid-90s FPS series has struggled to gain traction. Having been announced for release in September, closed testing drew strong criticism such that Bungie was forced to delay the game. There was also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/bungie-pins-marathon-art-plagiarism-on-former-employee-promises-to-do-right-by-original-artist/">a whole art plagiarism scandal</a>.</p>
<p>“Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear,” the team wrote in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/marathon-has-been-delayed-as-bungie-commit-to-building-on-player-feedback/">a Marathon Development Update in June</a>. “We’ve taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion.”</p>
<p>It’s expected that Bungie will be able to make fresh announcements on the game this autumn.</p>

			<p>Bungie's <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/">Marathon</a> will launch by March 2026, the end of the current fiscal year, although Sony has yet to commit to this release window.</p>



<p>Speaking during a Q&amp;A session which followed the company's latest financial report, where it was also revealed that Sony shipped <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/">80.3 million PlayStation 5 units</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-marathon-is-expected-to-release-before-march-and-bungies-independence-is-getting-lighter/">VGC</a>, Sony CFO Lin Tao confirmed that Marathon's sales were factored in the latest forecast, as the company expects the game to be out by March 2026. This, however, isn't a commitment to this release window, as the company believes it can announce a release date by this Fall, as previously confirmed. Though a release date hasn't been set, chances of Marathon being ultimately canceled are slim. The game's issues are being fixed, so the Sony CFO believes the game will indeed launch.</p>



<p>Besides commenting on the Marathon release date, the Sony CFO also commented on the current state of Bungie. Right after the acquisition, the Destiny 2 developer enjoyed a certain degree of independence, but this independence is getting lighter, and the developer is "shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios." Ultimately, the developer's direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">2024's restructuring</a> was one of the steps towards this direction.</p>



<p>Marathon was initially scheduled to release on September 23, but was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed</a> shortly after its reveal due to the game's bad reception and some controversies, including using <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">art assets from an artist without their permission</a>. With the additional development time, Bungie aims to up the survival game with more engaging AI encounters, more rewarding runs with new types of loot and dynamic events, increase visual fidelity, add more narrative and environmental storytelling elements, and improve the experience for solo and duo players. Hopefully, the additional development time will be enough to help Bungie give Marathon a distinct identity, which it didn't really show at reveal.</p>

            <p>A new joint investigation between the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud">Guardian</a>, Israeli-Palestinian publication <a href="https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/">+972 Magazine</a>, and Hebrew-language outlet <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%9e%d7%99%d7%9c%d7%99%d7%95%d7%9f-%d7%a9%d7%99%d7%97%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%91%d7%a9%d7%a2%d7%94-%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%90%d7%92%d7%a8-%d7%a9%d7%9c-8200-%d7%a2%d7%9c-%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%aa%d7%99-%d7%9e%d7%99/">Local Call</a> has claimed that Microsoft have worked with the Israeli military to store surveillance data on Palestinian civilians in Azure servers overseas, with some of that data allegedly being used to research and identify bombing targets. The report has led to renewed calls for game developers and players to join <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">the recently launched Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign</a> against Microsoft and Xbox gaming products and services - in particular, Minecraft, Call Of Duty, Candy Crush, and Game Pass. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The report is based on interviews with 11 sources from Microsoft and the Israeli military, plus access to a cache of leaked Microsoft documents. In late 2021, the Guardian piece begins, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella met with Yossi Sariel, the commander of Israel's military surveillance agency Unit 8200, to discuss plans for storing intelligence data on Microsoft cloud servers. According to the report's sources, the inspiration for these proposals was that Israel's military did not have the storage space or computing power to handle the amount of data they wanted to collect and process.
</p>
<p>The alleged result of that conversation was a cloud-based system that became operational in 2022, and has been used to gather "indiscriminate" recordings of Palestinian phone calls in the West Bank and Gaza. According to the report, as of July this year around 11,500 terabytes of Israeli military data were being held in Microsoft Azure servers in the Netherlands, while a smaller proportion were stored in Ireland, though not all of this data may be from Unit 8200.
</p>
<p>"Thanks to the control it exerts over Palestinian telecommunications infrastructure, Israel has long intercepted phone calls in the occupied territories," the report notes. "But the indiscriminate new system allows intelligence officers to play back the content of cellular calls made by Palestinians, capturing the conversations of a much larger pool of ordinary civilians." One of the investigation's sources also explains how these phone recordings may have been used to plan airstrikes, commenting that intelligence officers would use the cloud-based system to examine calls made by people in the vicinity of an individual target.</p>
<p>Sariel ultimately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/head-of-israeli-spy-agency-unit-8200-resigns-over-7-october-failings">resigned his position in September 2024</a> in response to criticism for failing to anticipate the surprise Hamas-led attacks on Israeli civilians in October 2023, which left over a thousand dead with hundreds taken hostage. According to this week's Guardian report, he was accused of prioritising fancy new technology over older surveillance methods.</p>
<p>But the cloud-based system he allegedly developed with Microsoft's assistance is said to remain in use alongside AI-driven target recommendation tools, as the Israeli military continues a punitive and open-ended assault on Gaza that has killed over 60,000 people, the majority of them civilians, and left hundreds of thousands more homeless and starving.</p>
<p>The report argues that Microsoft had some awareness during development of the system that it was being used to collect phone calls and facilitate airstrikes. It cites internal records that show that during the initial 2021 meeting with Nadella, Sariel referred only to "sensitive workloads" of secret data, not the storage of Palestinian phone calls. But it adds that "documents suggest that Microsoft engineers understood the data stored in Azure would include raw intelligence, including audio files" and that Israel-based Microsoft staff, who allegedly include former members of Unit 8200, appear to have known about the project's overall objectives. </p>
<p>The report also references files that show that Microsoft executives anticipated hundreds in millions of dollars in revenue from the project, calling it "an incredibly powerful brand moment" for Azure.</p>
<p>Back in May, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">confirmed that they had supplied technology to the Israeli military for use in Gaza</a>. But they insisted that they had found "no evidence" that it was being used to target or harm Palestinians, citing an external review carried out by an unnamed third party.</p>
<p>They have also pushed back on this week's claims, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the Guardian that they have "no information" on the data being stored in the cloud by Unit 8200. "At no time during this engagement," the spokesperson added, "has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft's services, including through the external review it commissioned."</p>
<p>Asked about Nadella and Sariel's relationship, the spokesperson continued that the CEO "attended for 10 minutes at the end of the meeting" and there was "no discussion" of the exact content of the "sensitive workloads" above.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Microsoft's comments, this week's news has fuelled calls to join the BDS boycott, with some participants pointing out that this doesn't have to mean parting ways entirely with any and all Microsoft services. "BDS has a standing boycott target on Microsoft products which people can realistically drop from their lives, understanding that not everyone can change their operating system," wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kitsune-tails">Kitsune Tails</a> lead artist and gameplay designer Allison Shabet in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rally.luckyraven.cc/post/3lvr42n2vm22i">a Bluesky post yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/austinwalker.bsky.social/post/3lvr4m3lhi222">Bluesky thread</a>, game designer and writer Austin Walker added that "I've obviously been saying this a lot lately, but BDS does not expect anyone to drop everything made by Microsoft all at once. They pick very specific targets in order to get as wide a coalition as possible, and in the case of Xbox, even suggest different tiers of engagement."

              <p>Sony’s latest financial results are in, and the PS5 is doing better than anyone expected. Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-best-selling-forza-horizon-elder-scrolls-oblivion-1851787356">a woeful lack of new games</a> exclusive to the PlayStation console, people won’t stop buying the device, with another 2.5 million units bought between April and June 2025. That’s slightly better than it sold during the same period last year, and brings the lifetime total to 80.3 million. <a href="https://in.ign.com/xbox-series-x-1/238086/news/xbox-series-x-and-s-microsoft-has-reportedly-sold-less-than-30-million-consoles-this-generation">Recent rumors</a> have suggested that the Xbox Series may have sold only 30 million in the same time. Awks.</p> <p>Sony had some other big numbers to boast about. The PlayStation Network currently has 123 million “active users,” up seven million since the same time last year. Meanwhile, 65.9 million PS4 and PS5 games were sold in April to June’s Q1 up 12 million on 2024, although it’s notable that only 6.9 million of those were first party titles. Bear in mind that <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-sales-figures-2000614194">Nintendo sold six million copies of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a> alone in a single month, for a brand new console with no previously established user base, and you can see how Sony’s first party numbers look pretty shaky right now. Although given the success of PS Plus and the hefty cut taken for every software sale, it doesn’t seem like people will be too worried.</p> <p>This all means the PS5 is performing pretty much exactly as well as the PS4 and PS3 before it, all of which should make Sony delighted. Those machines sold during times of financial recovery, while the PlayStation 5 launched in the midst of global catastrophe. Covid was at its peak, while supply chain issues and chip shortages meant the machines couldn’t fill shelves until months after the official launch.</p>

 <p>Sony of course has multiple revenue sources, across music, movies and technology, with $17.8 billion in sales across all its divisions in Q1, again, slightly up on last year, movies alone reporting $2.3 billion. But gaming was responsible for over $6.3 billion, making the sector worth almost triple that of movies to the Japanese corporation. Imagine if the mainstream press noticed.</p> <p>These numbers clearly explain <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">Microsoft’s strategy</a> to start releasing its first-party games onto Sony’s console. A base of 80 million potential new customers is more than double its own, and taking advantage of this is <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-ps5-microsoft-xbox-1851786765">already proving extremely successful</a>. Of course Xbox games are going to launch day-one on PlayStation, when its tripling the possible audience.</p>

			<p>The wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong has been very long, but it definitely looks like it is almost over, as some lucky fans will be able to try out the game developed by Team Cherry in a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>As reported on the ResetERA forums, the highly anticipated second entry in the series will be playable at the Nintendo booth at this year's Gamescom, which takes place from August 20 to August 24 in Cologne, Germany. At the booth, players will also be able to try out <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-4k-60-fps-nintendo-switch-2/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/">Hades II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-has-been-rated-by-the-esrb-suggesting-nintendo-switch-2-release-may-be-imminent/">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">Borderlands 4</a>, EA Sports FC 2026, and the already released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-hands-on/">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition.</a></p>



<p>With Hollow Knight: Silksong being playable for the first time to the public this month at both the Nintendo and the Xbox booths, and the game said to be available by the time the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds launch worldwide later this year, a release window which <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-out-this-year-team-cherry-confirms/">Team Cherry also&nbsp;confirmed</a>, there's no doubt a release date announcement is right around the corner. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-indie-world-direct-hollow-knight-silksong/">Yesterday</a>, it was suggested by creator Switchforce, who leaked the Nintendo Indie World Direct happening later today before its official announcement, that the game developed by Team Cherry won't be at the show, but there's still the chance the release date will be announced this month, as the Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase on August 19 would be the perfect stage for one of the most anticipated game announcements of the year.</p>

Or at least that's what EA say, as their wrenches slam against the game's servers in an attempt to let more people in.</p>
<p>With players stuck <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mjubus/i_guess_im_not_playing_tonight/">twiddling</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mju39x/im_getting_trolled_by_the_servers/">their</a> <a href="https://x.com/Sephiroth_VM/status/1953395511010173366">thumbs</a> in lines that can stick you as far away as 240-something thousandth from the front, the developers have been jolted into action. After all, you don't want to anger the sorts of folks who're up for shooting some blokes on an otherwise chill Thursday morning.</p>

<p>"The team is now working on a substantial increase in server capacity, which will reduce your time in the queue," the official Battlefield comms account tweeted amid the cries. "Thank you for your continued patience as we work to get as many of you into the game as soon as possible."</p>
<p>As of a few minutes ago, it appears that works begun to see the lines go down. "We are now seeing signs of queue numbers returning to suitable levels and times," reads a follow-up tweet, "Thank you for your patience as we worked to mitigate the issue. We'll continue to keep an eye on queues and server capacity, and will follow up where needed!"</p> <div>

<p>So, hopefully if you've had to wait for your dose of early FPS access this morning, you should now be facing less time spent staring at a number.

<p>If you've yet to double-check which modes, maps and changes from previous Battlefield Labs testing you'll be in for if you do jump into the open beta from today, August 7th, (early access) or August 9th (general), then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback">read this</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> developer DICE has said it’s working on a "substantial" increase in server capacity for the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, after the early access launch was met with huge Steam concurrents and equally huge queues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At time of this article’s publication, the Battlefield 6 open beta had over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam alone, making it the third most-played game on Valve’s platform behind only Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2. We don’t have concurrent player figures from Sony or Microsoft, so the open beta’s true concurrent figure will be much higher.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But not all those players are actually playing. Those with early access were met with huge queues (we've seen 250,000 in screenshots posted to social media) as the servers hit max capacity. In response, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953383562289299732" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DICE issued a statement</a> to say it was working to improve matters:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The team is now working on a substantial increase in server capacity, which will reduce your time in the queue,” DICE said. “Thank you for your continued patience as we work to get as many of you into the game as soon as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're looking forward to seeing you experience Battlefield 6, and we appreciate your patience!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That statement followed <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953364983057662181" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a message</a> in which DICE explained why it was using queues in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will use queues to protect the player experience but expect this impact to be minimal,” DICE insisted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You may encounter this during high peak moments, such as the start of servers going live. The team is working constantly to reduce any queue that takes place.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Holy sh*t 🤣<br>More than 270.000 players are waiting in server queue!</p><p>If you manage to join the Open Beta, you better don't leave game. <a href="https://t.co/x9lGfpyRAd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/x9lGfpyRAd</a></p></div>— Battlefield Bulletin (@BFBulletin) <a href="https://twitter.com/BFBulletin/status/1953377379180593285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here is that the open beta is peaking now as the early access kicks off, but the queues will ease. Given the open beta has gone live in early access form ahead of the U.S. waking up, it seems likely the player count will grow in the coming hours, and again when the open beta goes live for all this weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Battlefield 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-forces-pc-gamers-to-mess-about-with-their-bios-to-enable-secure-boot-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-next">how it requires PC gamers to enable Secure Boot</a>, how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-producer-admits-2042-was-missing-the-excellence-of-predecessor-battlefield-bad-company-2">it was inspired by the much-loved Battlefield: Bad Company 2</a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
