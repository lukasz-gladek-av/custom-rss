<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, I think it's fair to say, didn't receive all that warm a welcome when it launched back in 2003.</p>
<p>With lucky GameCubers already marinating in the delicious driving juices of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_kart_double_dash">Mario Kart: Double Dash</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, Kirby's cute and chaotic style of racing just didn't seem to stick with the mainstream, and, as a result, it's become known as one of those Marmite efforts. You either gelled with its new approach to slinging yourself around tracks or you didn't.</p>
<p>For me personally, I've always enjoyed Air Ride's novel take on track racing. I also think it's a game that sings especially strongly in multiplayer, once everyone who's racing fully knows what they're doing. Indeed, this was the first GameCube title that allowed for LAN setups via broadband adapters, so the multiplayer was 100% where the gravy was at.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160645/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Taking everything into account, though, and despite my love for the OG, a sequel in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> was an unexpected announcement during the run-up to Switch 2. I certainly didn't have it on my Switch 2 bingo card. So it's lucky, then, given that it's a bit of curveball, that it's actually very good.</p>
<p>If I had to guess the two main issues people had with Kirby Air Ride back in the day, it's a fairly even split between a lack of meaningful single-player content and how messy the game can seem to the uninitiated as races (and minigames) play out. Nintendo has obviously taken note of the first issue here, and as a result, we've got a sprawling story mode with multiple paths and endings and a metric ton of collectible content to keep you busy. It's also got a very gritty and serious sci-fi tone, which is so at odds with the style of the actual racing that you can't help but love it.</p>
<p>However, on the second problem, well, you'll have to suck eggs and learn to play the game, I'm afraid. It all makes sense when you get into the sweet Air Ridin' groove. It also wasn't broken in the first place, so bravo to Masahiro Sakurai for sticking to his guns and keeping the soul of it all intact.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160644/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note: Air Riding. It's not karting. This style of racing is a different beast entirely, and there's a learning curve in getting a hang of the basics. In Air Riders, you take control of a rider from an ever-growing roster of Kirby and his pals, each of whom has an impressive variety of stats relating to their driving abilities, along with their own specials and tricks to pull off mid-race. Stuff like turbo boosts, area of effect attacks, and lots of other stuff I won't spoil the fun of unlocking.</p>
<p>Once you've chosen Waddle De— I mean...whoever your favourite is, you then pick a machine. These aren't just different for the sake of being different, nor do they simply have varying degrees of speed, boost, handling, and so on. No, in Air Riders, there's <em>depth</em>. Proper depth. And it comes in the form of an impressive menagerie of unique machines that work in fundamentally different ways.</p>
<p>We've all seen the default Warp Star that gives you a nice balance of ground and air speed, but then you've got other options like the incredibly fast but terribly fragile Paper Star, the charging Tank Star, the slippery Slick Star, and even a few that transform or straight-up blink like electricity from point to point on a track as they slow then boost.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160643/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a lot more to take in than you may expect at first blush, and especially if you've listened to naysayers over the years who say it's shallow. Get a few seasoned riders into a race and things can get hugely intense.</p>
<p>With rider and machine chosen and on the track, you then get down to slinging yourself around. Movement forwards is automatic, the number one mental hurdle for newcomers. Your job as pilot is to make sure you utilise every opportunity on the track as it presents itself; to gain maximum forward momentum, by spinning, shifting around the course to hit boosts and jumps, and hammering enemies for mini-boosts or copy abilities to whale on your opponents with.</p>
<p>Once you 'get' it, it's incredibly moreish, and almost zen-like in the focus that's required to take down another rider who knows what they are doing. Feels too automated? You're not trying hard enough.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160637/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Also at the core of the racing, beyond the automatic nature of travelling forward, you have the all-important boost/brake button. Holding down 'B' will slow your machine right down until it eventually stops. It also, at the same time, charges up your turbo boost. So there's a strategy at the heart of everything here, and it's a pleasing one in how it relates to some very nicely designed tracks.</p>
<p>You want to know these tracks well to target the best jumps, to know the best opportunities to slow right down for a full boost (tight corners are the most obvious example) or overtake, and to find these opportunities on any given course, whilst also battling a constant stream of other riders and NPC enemies, makes for an addictive and satisfying thing to settle into. It's manic in all the right ways.</p>
<p>This sequel, too, is made all the more satisfying by some visually spectacular race sequences spliced throughout tracks. There's a mix of sections composed of proper, tight-corner racing alongside flashy on-rails sequences where you whip between rails to collect/dodge and set yourself up to boost into whatever comes next.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160635/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo has gone to town on these rail sequences, with some elaborately cool parts where riders tumble and spin through all sorts of wild scenarios, and the game does well to give you just enough control at all times, and enough ways to steal a lead or damage your opponents, that even when you're not fully in control of your machine, and even when weapons are auto-fire on proximity for a lot of the time, it still feels like you're needing to think quickly and know the rules, tracks and machines inside out to make an impact, especially in the online mode.</p>
<p>The story mode is the real big addition, and it makes a good impression. I won't ruin the narrative (and it's not much to write home about), but the setup, where you race through 11 chapters composed of levels full of races and minigames, works well.</p>
<p>Between each race and challenge, you're returned to your vehicle as it blasts along a road through each stage, and this gives you three options at all times on how to proceed, so there's variety along the way, until you hit a mini-boss or boss race battle. It also gives solo players lots to unlock, there's replayability in returning for alternate endings, and it acts as a fantastic training mode for the delights of online.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160639/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before I touch on the online, though, you've also got the returning City Trial, Air Ride, and Top Down racing modes. These generally remain largely unchanged from what was offered up in the original game. City Trial gives you five minutes to gather as many collectibles as you can whilst blasting other racers before being dropped into a minigame for a grand finale, and it's as chaotically frenzied as ever. Top Down mode is honestly addictive as all hell when you get into it (think Codemasters' <strong>Grand Prix Sim</strong> on the Commodore 64 but with crazy courses and you're 90% of the way there).</p>
<p>It's the online, though, that's the real king. I had limited time with it for this review, but I luckily found matches in Air Ride and City Trial modes against a few ferocious competitors and I couldn't be happier with the performance. No input lag, no issues connecting, and in races it was buttery smooth, as it is across all modes.</p>
<p>The City Trial and Air Ride races really do come alive here, and I implore you to dig in, learn how to drive the machine of your choice well and reap the benefits of some surprisingly fierce competition - alongside all the jumping into targets, gliding competitions, and events where you try to eat more than everyone else. I mean, Kirby gonna Kirby.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160640/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a solo game, Kirby Air Riders is a step up, then. Each of its modes brings over 100 collectible bits and bobs to unlock and create a picture scene from the story, so there's plenty to work towards. The campaign itself also does a suitably Kirby-esque job in starting out relatively normal on the narrative front before ending up in some far-out sci-fi states. The whole thing also looks and plays as good as anything I've played on Switch 2 thus far, so you're in for a treat on that front, my friends.</p>
<p>I've also got to make a special point here to mention the surprisingly deep machine customisation on offer. I was actually a little shocked! There are loads of textures, icons, unlockable pixel art, and all manner of ways to truly make all of your machines your own. It's a lot, and it's very, very welcome for solo fans.</p>
<p>Onto niggles, and I will say that the chaos — all of the huge icons and speeding around amidst groups of riders, especially in City Trials — can feel aimless at times. And it's still every bit the Marmite experience. The story is silly, and most of the side games, which see you hit air targets, make long jumps, and so on, well, they're not exactly <em>riveting</em>.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160636/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And in local multiplayer, whilst playing on the same system, we spotted that you lose the ability to see the stats for your chosen rider and machines, which sort of takes away the ability to inspect and learn on the fly. Let's hope a little tweak can be patched in on that one.</p>
<p>Overall, then, I know it can be hard to make Kirby converts, but I genuinely believe Kirby Air Riders deserves them. This is a huge big colourful beast of a sequel. It's jam-packed to the rafters with stuff to find, to unlock, and collect, and it has proper depth. There's a ton of machines, loads of riders and courses, and — should you get stuck in and learn and "git gud" — you'll find an alternative to the usual kart-racer style of business that absolutely deserves its place on any podium.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kirby Air Riders is a cracking sequel that gives solo players much more to dig into with its story campaign, whilst also bringing all-new levels of shiny graphics, bells and whistles to its returning City Trial, Air Ride, and Top Down Racing modes. This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards.</p>
<p>With lots of excellent tracks, riders and machines to unlock, sat alongside some surprisingly deep machine customisation, Kirby's latest air riding adventure is off to a strong start. Oh, and that soundtrack!</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>What is Kirby Air Riders? That’s the question I’ve found myself wrestling with throughout my time with it in the past couple of weeks. Is it a kart racer? Well… kind of. Is it a vehicular combat game? Sure, you could say that. Is it a multiplayer platform, designed almost completely to be played with others? Yes. Definitely. Yet there’s still a nagging feeling that Kirby Air Riders is one of those games that exists purely for its own reasons. As the first non-Smash Bros game to be directed by Masahiro Sakurai in over a decade, it carries an odd weight of expectation, only adding to the strange and slightly off-kilter vibes you’ll find when you check in for Kirby Air Riders.</p>
<p><iframe title="Get up to speed on Kirby Air Riders in 7 minutes! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzBvMLndm-w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Air Ride is the first pillar of Air Riders. This is racing, by way of Kirby and friends’ idiosyncratic flying, floating and grinding. It’s all largely controlled by the left analogue stick and a single button, with boosting and vacuuming up enemies forming your key abilities. Holding the button down starts a boost, with your racer slowing to a crawl before being unleashed when you release the button. Similarly, holding the button while turning initiates a drift, letting you angle your way around the corner, before launching yourself forward at the perfect moment. There is a sense of familiarity to this, part Mario Kart, part Sonic Racing, and as a basis for the game’s mechanics, it’s a good start.</p>


<p>You can then hoover up enemies and abilities from the track. This is your main offence, and there’s a real sense of fun to be had in sucking something up and spitting it at your nearest rival, letting you whizz past them. You can suck up fire, ice, poison or sleep abilities, as well as a host of others, aiming to use them to maximise your advantage. Aiming can be a little tricky at times, mostly because of the speed you and your target are usually moving at, and there’s not quite the surety you have in Mario Kart about how your attacks are going to pan out.</p>


<p>Still, the racing is fast, fun and frenetic, with a decent balance between the chaos of a kart racer and the fairness that you need to keep returning to it time and time again. It feels very different to its main rivals, and that uniqueness is probably its biggest selling point.</p>
<p>The second main mode is Top Ride. This takes the action and turns it into a top-down isometric experience, reminiscent of old-school racers like Super Offroad or its modern brethren Super Woden GP. This, of course, is all very Kirby though, and the small-scale courses look every bit as lovely as you’d expect with candy-coloured scenery and cute incidentals to careen around.</p>

<p>Top Ride is my favourite mode in Kirby Air Riders. It feels incredibly nostalgic, retaining that retro flavour of top-down racers of yesteryear, while boasting dazzling modern visuals. You can choose how many racers take part, though I’d recommend the maximum of eight, which gives you all of the competitive action you could want. Any less than that feels like a sidenote.</p>
<p>Playing in single player presents you with a cavalcade of task and rewards to make your time with Air Riders that bit more individual. There’s a large number of tasks to fulfil on each track – such as landing perfectly three times in one race, or being in the lead for longer than ten seconds – and you’ll unlock decals, machines, and riders as well as a host of other customisation options that let you tailor your vehicles and racer license to your own tastes.</p>
<p>Setting decals and messing with colour schemes and patterns is suitably user-friendly, and I can see people honing in on this mode to come up with some really unique and interesting designs.</p>

<p>City Trial is where things come a bit unstuck. Battle modes can be hit and miss in kart racers, and while City Trial presents some interesting ideas, it pumps the chaos up to 11. The camera also can’t quite keep up with the constantly accelerating action, and I found myself repeatedly dazzled by the hyperactive motion, often blinking sensation back into my eyes.</p>
<p>City Trial unleashes you in an arena where you spend your time whizzing around collecting power-ups, while trying not to lose them to your rivals. Once the timer runs out, you’re shown the number and type of power-ups you’ve acquired before then choosing a Stadium finale. You then take part in a minigame that, ideally, plays to your vehicles’ strengths.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the balance between collecting power-ups and the Stadium finales feels badly paced. I often enjoyed just tootling around, nabbing power-ups while occasionally hitting other players, but it does feel like it goes on for too long, while some of the Stadium events then take all of 30 seconds to complete. It’s not without its charms – unlocking a bunch of new things each time you play definitely helps with that – and there’s the regular events that draw players toward a certain part of the map, but it’s just a bit too drawn out.</p>
<p>Road Trip pulls all of these things together into a journey mode. Along the way, you’ll take part in races, Stadium challenges, or fight bosses in the arena, with a story mode running through that gives you a glimpse into the lore behind Kirby Air Riders, continuing the perpetually perplexing decision to give Kirby a worryingly deep and dark backstory. The cutscenes look fantastic though, and Road Trip does a good job of feeding you events, unlocking rewards and keeping things moving along at a decent lick. I’d recommend playing on Hard, though; otherwise, it’s a little too friction-free.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders’ presentation is all very Smash Bros. The chunky menus are clear and easy to understand, and the upbeat soundtrack is head-boppingly cheerful, before it all gives way to chaos. However, just like Smash, in the right hands, Kirby Air Riders becomes more tactical, more skill-based, and the more time you spend with it, the more likely you are to be swept up by its unique charms. It doesn’t have the immediacy of Mario Kart, or the growing collection of recognisable characters from Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, but it’s undeniably charming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Unity surprised everyone this morning during the <a href="https://on.unity.com/Unite2025Live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unite 2025 keynote</a> in Barcelona, Spain, when Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney was suddenly called on stage to announce a partnership between the two companies behind the most used third-party game engines in the industry. </p>



<p>Sweeney said he <span>spoke with Matthew Bromberg, president and CEO of Unity (who replaced John Riccitiello after the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-following-runtime-fee-fiasco/" target="_blank">former CEO's resignation following the runtime fee controversy</a>), about the companies' sh</span>ared objective of supporting open digital platforms. </p>



<p>The first result of this collaboration will be that Unity's brand-new in-app purchase software development kit (SDK) will soon be available to Unreal Engine developers, allowing them to choose this API to handle cross-platform purchases. Sweeney noted that this will become even more important now that Google and Apple are being forced (after Epic's lawsuits) to open up the Android and iOS ecosystems a little.</p>



<p>Arguably, though, the bigger news is that the Fortnite ecosystem, which boasts 500 million registered accounts, is embracing games made in Unity. Sweeney said:</p>



<p><em>Fortnite is a huge game that hit 100 million monthly active users last Holiday. And though it began as a little Battle Royale game that we built, over time, it's evolved into an ecosystem where 40% of playtime is going to third-party content built by independent developers. They're earning hundreds of millions of dollars a year from participating in Fortnite, and now it's going to open up to all Unity games thanks to some really amazing network technology that Unity built that connects other engines into Unity through a networking protocol to make this work. So, starting next year, Unity developers will be able to publish games directly into Fortnite to appear in Fortnite's discovery system alongside games built with Unreal Engine and to participate in the Fortnite economy as it evolves towards an open metaverse economy connecting all users and all engines.</em></p>



<p>In somewhat related news, Fortnite recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-island-creators-can-test-selling-items-in-islands-loot-box-style-random-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allowed</a> Island Creators to sell items within their Islands, including random rewards that appear to be functionally similar to lootboxes.</p>

			<p>The ROG Xbox Ally received its biggest update since launch, introducing crucial system improvements, most notably to game performance and power consumption.</p>



<p>The new update, which went live a few hours ago, brings plenty of improvements, including some highly requested community features such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>New CPU P-Core and E-Core settings for the X model</li>



<li>Quick access to the full-screen mode</li>



<li>Adjusted FPS limited option from 45 to 40 FPS to better align with the panel's 120 Hz refresh rate,</li>



<li>Improved power consumption in Modern standby</li>



<li>Improved Game performance with the AMD GPU driver V25.10.27</li>



<li>Improved firmware stability</li>



<li>Overall System Performance Improvement</li>
</ul>



<p>The features above are only the highlights of the biggest ROG Xbox Ally update since the system's launch last month. All the details can be found on the <a href="https://rog-forum.asus.com/t5/changelogs/changelog-november-2025-rog-ally-ally-x-xbox-ally-xbox-ally-x/ba-p/1124876">official update notes.</a></p>



<p>As battery life is usually a significant pain point for handheld devices such as the ROG Xbox Ally, power consumption improvements are quite welcome, and make the system an even more enticing purchase for those looking to get into PC handheld gaming, despite some lingering issues preventing it from delivering the same hassle-free gaming experience as consoles.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> is getting another new class, revealed last night as the Hive Scum. They’re a suitably skull-adorned outlaw who can dual-wield guns or shivs, while indulging in a cheeky bit of chemical warfare by homebrewing stimulants and lacing their weapons with harmful chems. Basically the opposite of the space-narc Arbites class added this summer, then: they got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darktides-new-arbites-class-is-overrunning-the-far-future-with-exploding-immortal-dogs">exploding dogs</a>, the Hive Scum gets exploding drugs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>They’re not joining Darktide’s co-op raids until December 2nd, but in the meantime, developers Fatshark have detailed pretty much all their dirty tricks in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTide/comments/1p0hejn/dev_blog_hive_scum_class_design_talents/">Reddit blog</a>. There’s also this teaser trailer, showing off the akimbo shootering and a new crowbar weapon in CGI action.</p> <figure>

<p>According to the dev blog, the Hive Scum looks to complement the existing roster of melee fiends and ranged specialists by performing as a slippery up-close gunslinger – hence being able to double up on quick-firing but less accurate pistols. They’ve also got a choice of unlockable skills geared around sustaining high-risk, close quarters play, with the option to specialise in either shooting or shanking.</p>
<p>Then there’s the <em>controlled substances</em> element. This covers remixes of existing tools, like the Chem Grenade or Chem Toxin: a stackable damage-over-time effect, similar to the existing burning or bleeding modifiers. But it also extends to an entirely new Stimm Lab mechanic wherein Hive Scummers can, by investing skill points (not unlike the main talent tree), create their own injectable Stimms with customised effects. There’s even a Combat Ability in the main tree that lets nearby teammates share the high, an interaction that I desperately hope will trigger anguished, violently guilt-ridden screams of confusion from the Arbites.</p><p>I may have been slightly underwhelmed, watching that trailer for the first time – 40K is ripe with the likes of ancient cyborgs, Hobbit-sized drunken snipers, and half-goat militiamen, none of whom would turn down a scrap with Chaos and all of whom might have made a more interesting addition to the crew than Florida Woman here. I do like the ferocious sound of the Hive Scum playstyle, though, especially after months of maining the methodical Emprah Cop.</p>

<p>Hytale was the once-canceled dream that is now fully back in development. A new, lengthy gameplay trailer has been released, not only showing more of the game, but also saying that early access is on the horizon.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games shut down Hypixel Studios</a> in June 2025, effectively ceasing Hytale’s development. It was showing a lot of promise, but the game—based on the Minecraft&nbsp;multiplayer server&nbsp;Hypixel—suddenly went up in smoke. The dream was revived in November 2025, and to show that the game is back, a new gameplay trailer is out.</p>



<h2 id="h-hytale-is-back-in-development-with-early-access-promised">Hytale Is Back In Development With Early Access Promised</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hytale was heavily inspired by Minecraft. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>We reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was back after being reacquired by Hypixel Studios</a>—rebought by founder Simon “Hypixel” Collins-Laflamme. The new ‘Breaking the Curse’ gameplay trailer shows off 16 minutes of pixel-perfect gameplay.</p>



<p>It has sword and shield action, combat rolling, exploration, tree chopping, dark and spooky forests, and everything you’re likely looking for.</p>



<p>Check out the full 16 minutes of Hytale gameplay right here.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Breaking the Curse | New Hytale Gameplay (16+ Minutes)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhaqjb_S2X8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>We checked the video’s description to look for any extra action or developments. Our pixelated jaws dropped when we read: “This is the original legacy engine from the 2018 trailer, running on a four-year-old build as we push Hytale forward again. There’s a long road ahead, <strong>but early access is coming soon.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s vague, which is understandable considering how fast this is all happening, but it offers assurances that Hytale is moving in the right direction.</p>



<p>Founder Simon also added this to the Hytale gameplay video:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I promised players videos, screenshots and blog posts. One day after the acquisition, I’m keeping that promise. Now that you’ve seen the first gameplay footage in a long time, I’m heading back to work on the early access launch. The team will share more clips and screenshots as we go. It mattered to me to release raw footage today so we break the curse once and for all.”</p>
</blockquote>

The Rock Paper Shotgun CMS groaned like a harpooned whale when I fed the above game title into our database. I was tempted to shave away some punctuation for the benefit of whoever writes about this game next, but then I remembered that I hate everybody here as I do hell, all Montagues, and thee. Anyway, what a title. It's like Type Moon and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> fell into a cyberpunk snakepit.</p>
<p>I don't even know what half the characters are called. They appear malevolently polarised, pushing other letters away from them. They seem... primordial somehow. Our distant ancestors used to hack brackets like those into the walls of caverns, when they wished to add inessential tips about flint storage to paintings of hunters getting tusked by mammoths.

The game beneath is appropriately arcane. Devised by <a href="https://dark-union.org/">The Dark Union</a> - whose official website resounds with monastic chanting and has an About page containing doomy philosophical maxims about bees - it's a third-person "story-driven stealth action immersive sim" in which you play a holy alchemist, Auronika Cortez.</p><p>Her goal is to topple the rulers of a rainy, "medieval-industrial" world of tunnels and ramparts prowled by soldiers brandishing crystal rifles. Your principle weapon is your ability to fashion bits of trash into potions and bombs. The bombs are <em>exceedingly</em> explosive. This is not one of those shooters where you hop back a few paces back after lobbing some C4 at a cave-in. You park your butt behind a nice thick wall. 
</p>
<p>
The demo on Steam leaves me mixed about the cleverness of the immersive simming - I spent a lot of time crouching and running away from guttural guard chatter - but I love the A.E.S.T.H.E.T.I.C. This includes what are probably very strenously observed "technical limitations". The intro cinematic yearns for an era in FMV when developers might luxuriate in the spectacle of individual hair follicles but had yet to animate them. In-game, I was pleased to find that I could back into a corner and poke the camera through my character's skull, to see her pasted-on face from the inside. Kids these days will never understand such delights.
</p>
<p>
Your health gauge is a clump of glaring cybermetal, screwed into the bottom right corner, while item and status notifications clatter down a feed on the left. The setting is a sparsely populated, palpably inhuman undulation of brute grey boxes and pyramids. And then there's the splendid crafting screen. It sees you assembling components inside a wavering ball of energy on a curved wireframe, then drawing a glyph. An aetherial circle plus metal and plastic nets you some bomb components. Add the components to more metal and plastic plus a curvy star glyph, and you'll produce a "basic bomb" capable of dusting a cathedral.

It's tentatively slated to release next year. The premise and emphasis on freeform building destruction here remind me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-faction-guerrilla">Red Faction Guerrilla</a>, though being the work of a much smaller team, this isn't nearly as granular in its devastation. I doubt it needs to be that granular, and it's not just a sneaky teardown sim, in any case: the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503810/TERRORtypeALCHEMY/?curator_clanid=45029635">Steam</a> page promises a "story of resistance, redemption, and the price of freedom as Auronika must navigate between her heavenly mandate and the brutal realities of uprising."

<p>If you’re yet to complete The Simpsons Battle Pass in Fortnite this season, Epic Games has a treat for you as 80,000 worth of XP is available for free—but only for a limited time.</p>



<p>Fortnite is currently in the midst of The Simpsons mini-season, with Springfield taking over the Island, but the end is in sight with a huge end-of-chapter event poised to take place on November 29, opening the gate for the launch of Chapter 7.</p>



<p>Ahead of that huge event, Epic Games is seeking players to test the experience, and is offering a hefty 80,000 XP as an incentive.</p>







<h2 id="h-epic-games-dishing-out-80-000-free-xp">Epic Games Dishing Out 80,000 Free XP</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1990865563652968596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite Status page on X</a> (formerly Twitter) announced the incentive as part of a stress test for servers ahead of the end-of-chapter event, which is expected to attract thousands of players across the world.</p>



<p>Available on November 19th and 20th at 1:40 PM ET, the ‘Epic Event Test’ playlist will appear in Fortnite for players to join and help Epic Games “prepare for an awesome live event.”</p>



<p>Joining the event won’t provide spoilers for the live event, as it won’t actually be shown, and is instead to “help slam server configurations to make sure everything runs smoothly.”</p>



<p>The final major patch of The Simpsons mini-season, and the final patch before the end-of-chapter event, is taking place today, and it’s expected several spoilers will emerge as a result across social media—so keep away if you don’t want anything ruined.</p>



<p>Plenty has already emerged ahead of the launch of Chapter 7, which will reportedly include a revamp to the revive system, along with collaborations with the likes of Harry Potter and SpongeBob SquarePants.</p>

Now, an update on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liz-albl-80772353/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> makes clear that the former narrative boss departed the company back in August — at the time <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-reportedly-getting-a-narrative-overhaul-amid-development-struggles">2K indicated it was unhappy with progress and announced layoffs</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Work on the next BioShock game has been underway for several years," noted an email to Cloud Chamber staff sent at the time by 2K president David Ismailer, and obtained by IGN. "While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> report confirmed that Cloud Chamber Games studio head Kelley Gilmore had been removed, amid other layoffs, while creative director Hogarth de la Plante had been shuffled into a publishing role. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of Albl's departure from the studio in August also makes sense, then, and it was reported at the time that 2K Games had been particularly critical of issues with the game's narrative. BioShock 4's story is now expected to be overhauled, and development will be overseen by former Gears of War head and Diablo franchise lead Rod Fergusson, who 2K has installed as the new overall boss of both Cloud Chamber and the BioShock franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to Cloud Chamber, Albl had served two years at Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor studio Monolith Productions working on Warner Bros.' now-cancelled Wonder Woman game. Prior to that, Albl had worked for several years at PlayStation's Sucker Punch studio writing Ghost of Tsushima, and at Ubisoft working on the Far Cry and Watch Dogs franchises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Little is known about the next BioShock game, though sporadic hints from job descriptions and other possible leaks have suggested it will be set in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-setting-rapture-columbia-job-listings">brand new location</a>, and feature <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-bioshock-game-hiring-writer-for-open-world-setting">open world elements</a>.

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>

			<p>Half-Life 3 fans were not nearly sated by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware announcements Valve made last week</a> (the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, all due sometime early next year). They believed before those announcements and their faith was renewed when several insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed</a> to the game's existence and potential imminent launch. Now, though, more sources have added fuel to the hype, just as the franchise celebrates the 27th anniversary since the release of the original Half-Life.</p>



<ul>
<li>Insider Nate the Hate, who has a solid track record, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990879872751735291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> that his sources also spoke about Half-Life 3. However, he received some conflicting information on the announcement timing; one of the things he heard was that it was going to happen at noon yesterday, which obviously wasn't the case.</li>



<li>Shpeshal_Nick, who has a slightly more checkered track record, <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1990890439633682499" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a>: <em>Last week I got a DM that Valve was showing off hardware “this week” (last week) and software “next week” (this week). This software was allegedly Half-Life 3.</em></li>



<li>The Verge journalist Sean Hollister was among those invited to Valve's headquarters for the aforementioned hardware announcements. In a brief story <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on the website</a>, he noted that the developer's halls were strangely filled with security guards, which never happened on his previous visits. The story also included a picture of a Steam Machine visually customized with several memes, including a title that starts with H and is 'censored'. Fans took it as a tease from Valve that soon, it might not be censored anymore, at long last.</li>
</ul>



<p>Traces of a game project codenamed HLX were discovered through extensive data mining and references across Source 2 engine updates. Tyler McVicker alleged <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as early as this past May</a> that the project believed to be Half-Life 3 was almost at the end of its development. </p>



<p>Needless to say, an announcement on the anniversary of the debut installment in the franchise would make a lot of sense. Besides, Valve unveiled its upcoming hardware exactly a week ago, so if they did want to space their news evenly, today would be the day for the next announcement.</p>

            <p>Sometimes things happen that you can't control. That's now been the case for developers Permadeath and their 2D sandbox <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/385380/Planet_Centauri/">Planet Centauri</a> twice on Steam, with first a wishlist bug and more recently the reveal of Valve's new hardware landing at just the right time to make the devs' task of getting eyeballs on their game more challenging than it would normally be.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/planet-centauri-steam-machine-announcement-valve-daily-deal-sale/">Polygon</a>, Planet Centauri's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/385380/view/519699831627710608?l=english">1.0 launch</a> in December last year saw it run into what its developers were later informed by Valve to be "a bug that impacted a very small number of game releases (less than 100 since 2015) where wishlist email notifications for the launch of a game were not sent". Oof. Valve, to their credit, did offer Permadeath a make-good in the form of having the game pop up as one of Steam's daily deals, which the steamy storerunners hoped would "help make up for lost visibility" from that launch day bug.</p>
<p>The studio were reportedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfd2ji/this_is_how_steam_can_ruin_more_than_10_years_of/">initially hesitant</a> to take up the offer, but ended up picking November 12th from a selection of dates Valve offered. That day rolled around and boom: Valve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">announced</a> a new Steam Machine, Steam Controller, and the Steam Frame VR headset. Naturally, Valve switched up the Steam storefront to blare that big news front and centre, making it much more difficult than usually might be the case for any deals or sales to stick out and catch folks' attention.</p>
<p>Laurent Lechat, one of Planet Centauri's devs, says they've had to chalk this up to yet another instance of "bad luck". They know they couldn't have expected Valve to offer a heads up by blabbing their big Steam device news to the studio ahead of time. "The day was chosen more or less randomly on our end," Lechat said. There's perhaps an argument that, depending on when it locked in that date for the big reveals, Valve could have blocked out the 12th as a no-go zone for deals, so whichever games might have been in line to be featured during it didn't end up in a battle they'd not expect.</p><p>Though, Permadeath's devs make clear that they did still get some traction out of the daily deal, despite the tough eyeball competition. A little over 5,000 copies shifted on that day, which is less than the studio hoped and apparently less than the bump in coverage when the news of the bug affecting Planet Centauri's 1.0 launch netted them when it broke a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>Despite that, Lechat stressed that these sales will still aid in the studio's efforts to keep on trucking, saying: "what seems like a small amount will be a great help because it's enough for us to survive for at least a year and allow us to finish our second game, which is currently in development." That game's a 2D roguelike which'll be getting a demo when it's ready and won't be following Planet Centauri's early access path.</p>
<p>What the latter's fate in terms of further updates ends up being depends on how well its fresher sibling does. Permadeath aren't against returning to it, even if Lechat understandably has "the feeling that Planet Centauri is cursed" given just how much fun it's run into over the past year and a bit.</p>

            <p>The developer of indie game Megabonk has withdrawn from The Game Awards after being nominated for Debut Indie Game.</p>
<p>Following the nominations reveal earlier this week, the developer of the game has admitted Megabonk is in fact not his debut game - he's been making games under different studio names.</p>
<p>"I'm withdrawing from The Game Awards," the developer shared on social media. "It's an honour and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately I don't think it qualifies for the category 'Debut Indie Game'. I've made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game."</p>

<p>The post is signed off as John Megabonk and includes a disguised face emoji. That's because the developer himself is something of a mystery, which has inevitably, confusingly, led to this nomination.</p> <div>

            <p>A new Battlefield 6 update has extended the time required to capture objectives in one of its major game modes, and has gone back to fix an ongoing issue with its challenge system. In addition, somehow, many players had their controls reset. Accidentally, one assumes.</p>
<p>The major game mode change comes to Escalation, a new mode to Battlefield 6, where large teams of players fight over a limited number of control points. When one of these is captured, a control point is removed from the match.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1990799899080688037">The official statement</a> released alongside this change states: "Following your feedback to our communication last week, Escalation now has had its time increased for capturing objectives by roughly 20 percent, extending the length of each phase for a smoother, more tactical flow. This change gives your squad more time to react, reposition, and coordinate vehicle spawns while maintaining the mode's fast-paced intensity."</p>

<p>Next up, a fix to challenges not being registered as completed despite players reaching the required milestone. This appears to have been a consequence of the widespread challenge adjustments made a short while ago, shifting them to be easier to finish in response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-challenges-are-being-made-far-easier-following-intense-community-feedback">player frustrations at how difficult completing some challenges were</a>.</p><p>The statement explains this should  now be remedied in the latest update. It reads: "We've also deployed backend fixes for challenge rewards not unlocking correctly. These updates address issues where completed challenges could fail to grant rewards or appear multiple times. Participating in a match should now reward you with any outstanding rewards from challenges."</p>
<p>Finally, a fun little change to kill-death statistics has been made, so kills made against computer-controlled bots no longer count for player statistics (often used as evidence of player skill). Funnily enough, deaths to bots still appear to be counted, so bots may still be able to make you look <em>worse</em> at Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>The Battlefield update statement concludes with: "Additionally, we have also rolled out a small change to how Player Kill/Death statistics are shown within your Player Profile. Going forward Portal Kill/Death Statistics will no longer be listed within the Kill/Death amount on your profile and Kill will only showcase Human Kills. Portal statistics will be shown in a different capacity in a future time."</p>
<p>Then there's what is clearly an unintended consequence of this update, which are widespread reports of reset controls following its addition to Battlefield 6. Across social media and community hubs like Discord and Reddit, users are complaining about their own custom control schemes being reset to the default. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1p0ef5a/comment/npibpyw/?context=3">Take Spetsnaz_420</a>, who wrote: "You left out the part where you reset our controls".</p><p>This marks the latest in an extensive spree of updates made to Battlefield 6. It was just over a week ago when Battlefield Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-update-fixes-recon-drone-exploit-letting-players-ride-them-into-the-sky-without-a-care-in-the-world">killed the Recon Drone bug</a> letting players float far up into the sky. All while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">the game remains incredibly popular</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games is teaming up with arguably its biggest game development rival, Unity, to bring games made using Unity’s engine into <em>Fortnite</em>. The change will mean that Unity games could sit alongside Epic’s own suite of experiences as well as those created by third-party developers using the Unreal Editor for <em>Fortnite</em> — and it opens the door for significantly more games to be available to play within <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>“Just like the early days of the web, we believe that companies need to work together in order to build the open metaverse in a way that’s interoperable and fair,” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney says in a statement. “Working alongside Unity we’re helping developers build fun games, reach bigger audiences, and find success.”</p><p>The change represents an important step in Epic’s long-running vision of turning <em>Fortnite</em> into an open metaverse that’s a big 3D social space with a huge number of experiences to participate in with your friends. Epic has been marching down this path for years with <em>Fortnite</em> itself by putting an increased focus on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23659492/fortnite-creator-economy-2-0-epic-games-catch">creator-made experiences</a> and making browsing through those experiences in the Fortnite lobby feel like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23912919/fortnite-creator-made-maps-youtube-redesign">scrolling YouTube</a>. You can even check out experiences on the web — and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/19/24223669/fortnites-item-shop-is-now-on-the-web-too">buy new <em>Fortnite</em> outfits in your browser, too</a>.</p><p>Right now, <em>Fortnite</em> is a closed ecosystem, meaning that creators can only make games for the platform using Epic’s tools, can’t (yet) easily drop those games into Unreal Engine to bring them to other platforms, or bring experiences built on other engines into <em>Fortnite</em>. But even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23652928/tim-sweeney-interview-epic-games-fortnite-metaverse">in 2023</a>, Tim Sweeney was telling <em>The Verge</em> how much he believed in the future of interoperable game engines being key to his vision.</p><p>Epic has had some success expanding <em>Fortnite</em> from being a battle royale into a broad, <em>Roblox</em>-like ecosystem with games from outside creators. By the end of last year, it <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-ecosystem-2024-year-in-review-celebrating-creators-and-looking-ahead?lang=en-US">had 70,000 total creators</a> that published nearly 200,000 “islands,” or <em>Fortnite</em>’s term for experiences. But the Unity Editor, which is designed to help developers build their games once and run them across multiple platforms, has more than <a href="https://unity.com/our-company">1.2 <em>million</em> monthly active users</a>. Even a fraction of those developers also bringing their games to <em>Fortnite</em> could add a lot to the platform.</p><p>The plan is to allow Unity games to come to <em>Fortnite</em> next year, Matt Bromberg, President and CEO of Unity, tells <em>The Verge.</em></p><p>The partnership potentially gives developers another potential avenue to find an audience and monetize their games, which could be a lifeline for smaller developers amid continued <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite">industry struggles</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results">layoffs</a>. It could also consolidate even more power into <em>Fortnite</em>, which is already a behemoth. But Sweeney actually envisions a world for <em>Fortnite</em> that’s much more decentralized — more like the open web.</p><p>“<em>Fortnite</em>’s still this big thing operated by Epic completely,” Sweeney says. “But there will be a day when you can, from the program that’s currently called <em>Fortnite</em>, go to other sites that are completely controlled by other companies. We have nothing to do with them. We make no revenue from them. We don’t have commercial agreements with them. They’re just like websites on the web.” Today’s news with Unity is the first opportunity for “the rubber to meet the road” of engines that are operating together.</p><p>For now, whether a creator makes a <em>Fortnite</em> experience using <em>Fortnite</em>’s tools or with Unity, Sweeney says there will be a review process to ensure that it’s “ratings-compliant and works adequately.” But in the future, “as this evolves into a completely open system, we’d only have reviews for stuff that we host, and anybody would be able to put anything anywhere, and people would be able to browse to it like you do in a web browser today.”</p><p>Allowing Unity games will “greatly expand the developer base,” Sweeney says. “The challenge of building content in <em>Fortnite</em> today is you start from scratch.” You can’t currently take an Unreal Engine game and deploy it into <em>Fortnite</em> — that’s something that Epic is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/5/24262376/epic-unreal-engine-6-fortnite-metaverse-plans">aiming for with Unreal Engine 6</a>, which is likely years away. Ironically, Sweeney says, “publishing Unity games into <em>Fortnite</em> will happen before publishing standalone Unreal Engine games into <em>Fortnite</em>.”</p><p>There’s a second component to today’s news, too: Unity will bring support for Unreal Engine to the commerce management platform <a href="https://unity.com/news/unity-launches-native-cross-platform-commerce-management-for-game-developers-worldwide">it announced last month</a>, which lets developers manage their digital storefronts across many platforms from all inside Unity Engine. That was pitched at the time as a way to make it much easier to deal with the complexities of different storefronts and payment processors.</p><p>Bringing support for Unreal Engine to the platform gives developers “more choice around how they build stores and how they manage those stores,” Bromberg says. “Ultimately, I think the thing that Tim and I couldn’t agree any more strongly on is that having more choice and more places where developers can build things and giving them more control over their destinies is the most important thing we can do to help the gaming ecosystem.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/823233/fortnite-epic-games-unity-creators-developers-tim-sweeney-matt-bromberg]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-breaks-franchise-sales-records-outsells-call-of-duty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anno-117-pax-romana-breaks-franchise-sales-records-outsells-even-black-ops-7-on-steam.1357624/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has proudly announced that its latest new release, the city building strategy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>, has registered a record launch for the franchise. There have been seven Anno installments released throughout 25 years, but none captivated the audience as much as the title that launched last week.</p>



<p>Developed by Ubisoft Mainz (previously known as Blue Byte), Anno 117: Pax Romana secured the second spot on last week's Steam chart, beating even Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which launched only a day later. You don't have to take the publisher's word for it, as SteamDB <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1990789664811172057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the news with the following Steam Top 5 chart for the week between November 11 and 18:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Anno 117: Pax Romana</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Battlefield 6 </li>



<li>Steam Deck</li>
</ul>



<p>Granted, Black Ops 7 famously delivered its own records, albeit negative, when it comes to the Call of Duty franchise. On Steam, the game only reached a concurrent player peak of around 100K users, whereas Black Ops 6 peaked at 315K when it launched last year.</p>



<p>That has, however, little to do with Anno 117: Pax Romana, whose developers are right to celebrate. Even critical acclaim is unprecedented so far, with a Metacritic average of 85 and 94% of OpenCritic reviews recommending the game. Perhaps the most important data point is that users are playing it a lot: the average daily playtime is 3,7 hours.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Stéphane Jankowski, Executive Producer on Anno, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana officially sets sail, marking a new chapter for our beloved franchise and for everyone who poured their passion, creativity, and countless hours into it. We are humbled by the incredible response from our player. Our team remains dedicated, continuously listening to feedback and striving to deliver the ambitious Year 1 content expanding our game world to the province of Egypt!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent video uploaded to YouTube, iconic Vietnamese League of Legends pro player, Đỗ “Levi” Duy Khánh, announced his official retirement from active competition. He cited wanting to spend more time on himself and start a family, and suggested he can’t do that while he continues to compete professionally.</p>



<p>Instead, Levi will step away and focus on content creation and streaming, continuing to contribute to the League of Legends scene by broadcasting content to the hundreds of thousands of followers he has amassed over the years.</p>











<p>Levi has been competing in the League of Legends space more or less since the game’s esports scene blew up. He’s been a solid player since 2013, and in his recent farewell video, Levi explained that League was ‘the answer’ to what he wanted to do with his life.</p>



<p>He would go on to become known as one of the most effective junglers in League of Legends.</p>



<p>In his video, Levi said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I hope that, in the future, I’ll be happier, smile more, and continue to be with you all. It’s time to say goodbye to the professional League of Legends Levi and welcome the beginning of the streamer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the Pacific region, especially, Levi is something of a legend, and he’s arguably the best player to ever emerge from Vietnam.</p>



<p>Here’s Levi’s full farewell video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Mình chính thức giải nghệ" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8GVw842VlpE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Like many other retired esports competitors, Levi will now turn his attention to content creation:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I love streaming. Even while I was competing, I spent a lot of my free time streaming and interacting with everyone. I love making people laugh. I’ll still play League of Legends and watch official matches.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-age-estimation-feature-users-concerned/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-adding-new-%E2%80%98age-estimation%E2%80%99-feature-that-has-users-concerned.1357600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Roblox is taking another step into the realm of child safety by setting up an age estimation feature that <strong>must be used </strong>before users can chat to anyone within the ecosystem, it has been revealed. From December, users worldwide will be forced to complete an age estimation process if they want to use Roblox to message any other player, but not everyone is pleased.</p>



<p>This is because the age estimation is being achieved via an AI-supported platform called Persona. Users will need to upload a picture of themselves, which is then analyzed by AI, and subsequently placed into an ‘age group’ that remains inherently restricted.</p>



<h2 id="h-good-not-great">Good, Not Great</h2>



<p>The Roblox Corporation has been closely scrutinized over the last year or so, with several significant lawsuits being filed against the company because it does not do enough to protect children using the platform. It has been claimed numerous times that Roblox is a breeding ground for predators, and even Chris Hansen came out to make a damning documentary against the ecosystem.</p>



<p>The latest ‘safety standard’ will see Roblox introduce an age estimation process that will start being deployed as early as next month.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent release</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re unlocking chat and age-appropriate experiences for our users by requiring them to complete an age check through Facial Age Estimation or ID verification<sup>1</sup>. Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become&nbsp;Trusted Connections&nbsp;with people they know.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It begins in regions like Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, but by January, the rest of the world will be pulled into the optional age estimation check. If you want to chat on Roblox, you <strong>must </strong>verify your ‘age group’.</p>



<p>The Roblox Corporation explained how this will work:<br></p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of our ongoing consultations with child development experts, we’ve defined common-sense limits on who can chat together on Roblox. After users complete the age check process, we will inform them of their assigned age group: Under 9, 9-12, 13-15, 16-17, 18-20, or 21+. Users will be able to chat with those in their own age group and similar age groups, as appropriate.</p>



<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Elisa (estimated age 12):&nbsp;</strong>Elisa has access to chat with users aged 15 or younger in Experience chat. All users 16 or older are prevented from initiating or engaging in chat with her.</li>



<li><strong>Marcus (estimated age 18):&nbsp;</strong>Marcus has access to chat with users aged 16 or older and could add a younger sibling as a Trusted Connection, as long as they are 13 or older.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Roblox claims that more than 145 new ‘safety innovations’ have been deployed this year alone, but critics remain sceptical. This latest evolution has users concerned about uploading images of children to a platform powered by AI.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The recent Flank Invitational has been perfect for allowing fans of the Call of Duty League a glimpse at how pro players are getting to grips with Black Ops 7’s movement mechanics. The near-future title boasts wall-hopping, faster pacing, and a more technical theme that allows the movement kings of the COD League to really finesse their opponents.</p>



<p>In a recent clip that surfaced on social media, OpTic Texas’ Cuyler ‘Huke’ Garland was seen dunking on Envoy, Abuzah, and Neptune in a slick 1 v 3 that seemed effortless for the recent world champion.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-optic-texas-make-history-again">Can OpTic Texas Make History Again?</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas is moving differently in Black Ops 7, despite Shotzzy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-no-aim-assist-cod-world-champ/">having early concerns</a> about the game’s aim assist mechanics. This game facilitates slick, fast-paced movement, which fits nicely into the wheelhouse of these players.</p>



<p>Huke, especially, is having a brilliant time, with fans recognizing a callback to the Advanced Warfare and Infinite Warfare era of competitive Call of Duty, otherwise known as the ‘Jetpack’ era.</p>



<p>Here’s a clip that surfaced recently on Reddit showing Huke piecing apart a more than capable trio during The Flank’s Black Ops 7 Invitational tournament:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Months ago, Huke was a pivotal part of OpTic Texas securing back-to-back world championship titles, and even more recently, he was part of the squad that secured the top spot at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>Going into the CDL 2026 season, the OpTic Texas roster is looking <strong>white hot</strong>, and there are high expectations for the team in the coming months. Could this be a third consecutive COD League Championship for the organization?</p>



<p>Let me know what you think OpTic Texas’ chances are for a three-peat next season on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-19-892/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-892-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-wednesday-november-19.1357594/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Midweek madness is here, and hopefully, your streak is persisting through it. The festive season is fast approaching, and you’ve got a lot more to focus on, I understand, but getting these NYT Connections hints and solutions down is important <strong>right now</strong>! With that being said, I’ve got the answers you need for today’s puzzle.</p>



<p>If you’re stumped, read on, as I’ve got the instant NYT Connections solutions for you.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-19">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 19)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #892:</p>



<ul>
<li>SQUAT</li>



<li>SHEPHERD</li>



<li>PIT</li>



<li>FALL</li>



<li>LUNGE</li>



<li>LEAD</li>



<li>SKINK</li>



<li>SOLID</li>



<li>HUSKY</li>



<li>CASK</li>



<li>DIRECT</li>



<li>COLONY</li>



<li>GUIDE</li>



<li>THINK</li>



<li>MASQUE</li>



<li>HEARTH</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>All straightforward descriptors for a compact, sturdy build.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Clear verbs meaning “to show the way” or “influence direction.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>“The Cask of Amontillado,” “The Fall of the House of Usher,” “The Masque of the Red Death,” “The Pit and the Pendulum.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each is a valid word formed from a body organ plus a single trailing letter.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 19.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-19-892">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 19 (#892)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– HUSKY, SOLID, SQUAT, THICK</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DIRECT, GUIDE, LEAD, SHEPHERD</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CASK, FALL, MASQUE, PIT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COLONY, HEARTH, LUNGE, SKINK</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

        <p><em>Bang! Bang! Bandits</em> is a completely original gun shooting game that, while preserving the tension and exhilaration of the classic gun shooting game genre, features simple rules and controls, bright pop-style characters, and an easy-to-understand world, allowing people of all ages to play with peace of mind.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Simple Rules and Controls Enable Anyone to Play</strong> – Using the Joy-Con like a handgun, simply hold it in one hand, aim at the enemies on the screen, and shoot! With unlimited ammo, you can shoot endlessly and stress-free. Plus, since field movement is fully automatic, you can focus entirely on attacking. In addition, the rules are simple and straightforward—your score is based on the coins you collect by defeating enemies and destroying obstacles, so even young children can play with ease.</li><li><strong>Packed with Fun Across 12 Stages and Two Leagues</strong> – The game features 12 distinct stages set in environments such as a jungle, city, ruins, and caves. After clearing all stages in the standard-difficulty “Normal League,” the max-difficulty “Wild League” awaits!</li><li><strong>Unique Enemy Characters Wreak Havoc All Over the Screen</strong> – As you defeat enemies called “Goomins” that rain down on you one after another, make your way to the end of each stage, where a brutal boss awaits!</li><li><strong>Enjoy Two Gameplay Styles with Challenge Mode and Battle Modes</strong> – In “Challenge Mode,” you start from lower-level stages and work your way up to the most difficult ones. You can play solo or in a team of two to four players, cooperating with family and friends to clear each stage. Additionally, two to four players can compete for the high score in “Single Battle” (individual play), or two teams of two players each can face off in “Team Battle.”</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/bang-bang-bandits-nintendo-switch-2-edition-announced]]></content:encoded>

<p>Speaking to Australian <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in/">game website Stevivor recently</a>, Requiem's producer Masato Kumazawa revealed there is currently "no plan" to make a demo accessible to the general public "at this stage". The team instead wants to focus its energy on "finishing off the game", which is due out early next year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our development team is just doing its best to make sure that it's creating the best quality game; to make sure that it's a fine product."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although there's seemingly no demo planned for digital stores in the lead up to release, there has already been Requiem <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-footage-a-surprisingly-tense-port">demos at events like the Tokyo Game Show</a>. Past Resident Evil titles, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7</a>, have also received demos to reel players in, and Capcom has even offered other game demos on the Switch 2 like one for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>So, no demo for now. If you are eager to see something before then, below is some handheld gameplay we captured at TGS this year. You can read more about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-footage-a-surprisingly-tense-port">entire experience in our hands on preview</a>. Resident Evil Requiem will launch for Switch 2 and other platforms next year on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>How do you feel about Capcom potentially not offering a demo for this title ahead of its Switch 2 release? Will you be getting it day one, or are you going to hold out and see what critics and fans have to say if you can't test it out for yourself? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 is Going Free to Play From November 25 for One Week]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-going-free-to-play-for-one-week/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-going-free-to-play-from-november-25-for-one-week.1357573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6, the latest ambitious shooter in the legendary first-person franchise, is preparing to go free-to-play for a week, starting November 25. In a recent blog post, Electronic Arts (and associated studios) revealed the free trial period that’s opening up for Battlefield 6, which will likely be accompanied by a considerable discount on the game as Black Friday surfaces.</p>



<p>This limited-time, restricted-scope offering will allow players to experience a fair chunk of Battlefield 6 without investing a penny in the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-free-trial-coming-soon">Battlefield 6 Free Trial Coming Soon</h2>



<p>In a blog post on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-california-resistance-mid-season-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA website</a>, the Battlefield 6 free trial period was revealed by the team. It was promised that ‘more information’ will be published soon, but for now, we have a description of what the free trial entails:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From November 25 to December 2, ultimate all-out warfare is free** for everyone. Fight in intense urban combat on the streets of Cairo. Drop into iconic SoCal landscapes turned into battlegrounds on Eastwood and Blackwell Fields. Enter Battlefield’s iconic massive scale warfare in Conquest or Breakthrough. Go head-to-head destroying enemy cargo in Sabotage. Engage in pure high-intensity close-quarters combat in Team Deathmatch. This is your call to squad up. Make it count.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This free trial showcases Battlefield 6’s new mode, Sabotage, which was released in the latest update just days ago. Typically, first-person shooters like Call of Duty and anything else in that vein offer free trial <strong>weekends</strong>, so an entire week for Battlefield 6’s free trial window is obviously above and beyond.</p>



<p>It’s widely assumed that the progress you rack up during the free trial week will roll over into the full game, should you choose to upgrade at any point. In a week, you can grind the living daylights out of the game and unlock stacks of content, so you might be persuaded if a good enough sale goes live to accompany the trial.</p>







<p>In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/">Battlefield 6 review</a>, we said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s plenty of juice in the tank where the multiplayer platform is concerned, and Electronic Arts’ studios will keep it plugged full of content for a while.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you plan on playing Battlefield 6 during the free trial week.</p>
