<p>Insider Gaming‚Äôs Scott Robertson recently got hands-on with the game at a behind-the-scenes event, where he sat down with Amazing Seasun Games CEO, Kris Kwok, so keep your eyes peeled on the website for that interview later this week.</p>



<p>‚ÄúIn the aftermath of the Catastrophe, a mysterious carbon-silicon mineral known as Corite has breathed new life into Earth‚Äôs depleted energy industry. But its gift came with a curse ‚Äî its pathogenic nature and uncontrollable spread are slowly devouring the last habitable spaces on the planet. Within 30 years, the heavily polluted Marcens Zones threaten to engulf the entire globe, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction,‚Äù the game description reads.</p>



<p>It continues, ‚ÄúAmid the chaos of this catastrophic event, you find yourself thrust into the role of an unlikely hero ‚Äî a pilot of the third-generation BREAK Striker. Now, you must navigate an uncertain path, one fraught with peril and discovery. But you are not alone. A secretive organization known as S.H.A.D.O.W. has extended an offer, one that could change the fate of both you and the world.‚Äù</p>



<p>‚ÄúAssault, melee, sniper, reconnaissance, support‚Ä¶ Choose your preferred mech and take on enemies across three distinct combat modes: 3v3 Deathmatch, 6v6 Hero Shooter, or PvPvE Extraction Shooter.‚Äù</p>

            <p>Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has hit out at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, saying he "should've never been banned in the first place" despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitting to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June 2024.</p>
<p>Responding to news Twitch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reckons-cheating-while-livestreaming-is-a-low-severity-violation">has updated its enforcement rules so that streamers caught violating guidelines will now be subjected to varying limited-time bans</a>, Beahm issued a comment from his personal account X/Twitter, saying Twitch "should've never allowed a low-level employee to override the entire ban system".</p>

<p>Although its difficult to verify the identity of this X profile given anyone can now purchase a blue tick, the account was established in 2011 and appears to be Beahm's personal account where he posts outside of his Doc persona.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Although things have been ‚Äòsettled üòé‚Äô, Twitch should do the right thing and correct their mistake of permanently banning the Doc by reinstating the channel.</p><p>We should‚Äôve never been banned in the first place.</p><p>Twitch should‚Äôve never allowed a low level employee to override the‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/qMcHooAsGb">https://t.co/qMcHooAsGb</a></p></div>‚Äî Guy Beahm (@GuyBeahm) <a href="https://twitter.com/GuyBeahm/status/1892635093531034057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"Although things have been 'settled', Twitch should do the right thing and correct their mistake of permanently banning the Doc by reinstating the channel," he wrote. "We should've never been banned in the first place.</p>
<p>"Twitch should've never allowed a low level employee to override the entire ban system, which had already determined we didn't do anything wrong, because of biased opinions of the Doc character.</p>
<p>"They could've reached out and had a quick five-minute call and realise these mutual jokes and bantering never had serious intentions. Pathetic."</p>
<p>Beahm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitted to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June, after Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, claimed an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor". Those allegations were later directly linked to Beahm.</p>
<p>After a period away from the spotlight, an agitated Beahm returned in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkaSTVagsgo">combative YouTube stream</a> in September in which he repeatedly accused Conners and "so-called journalists" of a "planned and coordinated attack". All this, Beahm admitted, came ahead of a 25th September "opportunity" to reapply for partnership on YouTube and re-monetise his channel, which was eventually approved.</p>
<p>Since that admission, Robert Bowling - who co-founded developer Midnight Society with Beahm - <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">distanced himself</a> from the streamer, and many long-running partners <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">terminated their agreements</a>. By the end of January, four months after making "significant" layoffs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drdisrespect-studio-midnight-society-announces-closure-four-months-after-significant-layoffs">Midnight Society announced it was permanently shutting its doors</a>.</p>
<p>Beahm has yet to publicly share the "mutual jokes and bantering" messages he sent to the minor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Brace yourself, Assassin's Creed fans - it looks like early copies of the upcoming instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, have broken the street date.</p>
<p>Unsubstantiated reports are beginning to circulate that not only have some fans been able to download the full game early from the PlayStation Store, physical copies have been prematurely sold, too.</p>
<p><strong>There may be light spoilers after this point</strong>, so only proceed if you're happy to be spoiled!</p>

</div><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows - is it good?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPR9oEqn3lQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps most notably, Assassin's Creed YouTuber The Hidden One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cm-56xcxUo">recently revealed</a> that he knows someone playing the full game on PS5 "because the PlayStation Store made a mistake".</p>
<p>Admitting that he could neither prove it or compel anyone to believe him, The Hidden One then revealed that in the leaked footage, he saw that Animus anomalies are back - something not previously confirmed for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>"In the video [the friend with early access] showed me, the player encounters something Animus in the world," he said.</p>
<p>"A pop up appeared that read: 'Animus systems breached. Stabilise anomalies and gain data fragments to advance your active strand'."</p>
<p>The player was then prompted to "press touchpad to open the Animus menu".</p>

</span></p><p>Over on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit it goes even further, with reports that <a href="https://ibb.co/PvQX2f2g">physical copies have similarly been sold early</a>.</p>
<p>While, as yet, there doesn't seem to be early footage popping up on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> or YouTube, now may be a good time to mute key words on your favourite social media apps, just in case...</p>
<p>Last week, Ubisoft signalled its expectations for Assassin's Creed Shadows in its latest quarterly financial results, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch">in which it describes pre-orders for the game as "solid"</a>.</p>
<p>While the company did not divulge exact pre-order numbers, it said they were "in line with those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>, the second most succesful entry of the franchise".</p>
<p>Our Katharine said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Assassin's Creed Shadows was "the biggest shake-up of the series in years"</a> during our recent hands-on time with the game, and praised its dual protagonist gameplay. "If Ubisoft can stick the landing on this one, it will be worth the extended wait," she wrote.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Peter Jason - a Hollywood stalwart known to most gamers as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-2">Fallout 2</a>'s Drill Sergeant Arch Dornan in Fallout 2 and Gears of War's Dizzy - has died aged 80.</p>
<p>As first reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/peter-jason-dead-deadwood-princes-of-darkness-1236315556/">Variety</a>, Jason died in his West Hollywood home on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a tribute posted to Gears of War's social media accounts, the team said: "'Got your back like a buttcrack'.</p>
<p>"A legend. Peter Jason, the voice of Dizzy, has moved on. Rest easy, brother."</p> <div>

<p>Beyond games, Jason is perhaps best-known for his roles in Deadwood, 48 Hrs, and Prince of Darkness, although you'll also spot him in movies like Rio Lobo, Impulse, Brewster's Millions, They Live, and Alien Nation. He also guest starred on Murder, She Wrote, The Golden Girls, Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories, and Mad Men.</p>

						<h5>AceZone A-Spire Wireless</h5><p><span>May 3rd, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>AceZone may not be among the most popular gaming headset brands, but it has been making a name for itself for some time by producing headsets for eSports tournaments, focusing on features tailored for this specific use case. In the past few years, however, the company entered the domestic headset market with some headsets, including the A-Spire and the A-Rise headsets, which brought some of these features, such as excellent noise canceling with Active Noise Control built for gaming, fast in-game response and more. The A-Spire model was later updated with some additional features, becoming the AceZone A-Spire Wireless, which is among the best headsets for eSports aficionados who want to step up their performance while also providing enough to to be enticing for those looking for a versatile headset that delivers great audio quality for single-player games and music playback.</p>
<p>At a glance, the AceZone A-Spire Wireless, which comes with a hard carry case, looks almost like a non-gaming headset, featuring a rather simple color scheme, black with some metallic grey highlights, with no other standout element. On the back of the left earpad are the power button and the Active Noise Cancelation button, while on the right are the volume control and pause/play buttons. On the side of the left earpad is also the microphone, which, sadly, cannot be removed from the headset (but this was to be expected for a headset tailored for eSports and competitive play). Disabling the microphone, however, is extremely simple, as it only has to be brought to a vertical position where it can easily held in place and secured.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04_cleanup.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the AceZone A-Spire Wireless design may be unremarkable, the headset shows its qualities right from the very first use. The excellent build quality, and its light weight, which makes the headset very comfortable to use even after 3+ hours in conjunction with the high-quality earpad foam, are only the beginning. Noise cancelling, as mentioned above, has always been one of the main focuses of AceZone for its headsets, and the AceZone A-Spire Wireless definitely delivers on this front. The Advanced Hybrid ANC built for gaming does an excellent job providing complete immersion, and during the vast majority of my gaming sessions with the headsets, I wasn't able to hear anything outside of the game's audio, as every loud noise was effectively canceled. To test how far the headset's noise canceling could go, I tested it out in a definitely not intended use case while playing acoustic drums, and the AceZone A-Spire Wireless still did an excellent job, as I could clearly hear the click and backing tracks clearly while playing some heavy music.</p>
<p>Pressing the dedicated ANC button on the left earpad also enables Transparency Mode, which amplifies ambient sound, allowing it to pass through the headset and let the user hear the outside world clearly without removing the headset.&nbsp; The AceZone A-Spire Wireless microphone noise canceling is possibly even more impressive, as the microphone works great and effectively only picks up the user's voice while filtering out even some pretty loud noises, although it has to be positioned slightly closer to the mouth than the vast majority of other headsets on the market to work properly, which may take some time to get used to.</p>
<p>The biggest update the AceZone A-Spire Wireless offers over the base model, not is its proper wireless capabilities. Included in the box is a USB dongle that is effectively plug-and-play, as the user does not have to do anything other than keep a button pressed on the dongle to pair the headset with it. Latency with the dongle is pretty much non-existent, although the 2.4 GHz connection could suffer from interference, which I didn't experience as all the devices I use with my PC are wired. The AceZone A-Spire Wireless can also be connected via a regular headphone jack, such as the one included with the headset, and via a regular Bluetooth connection, which works well, but not as well as with the dongle. Pairing and using the headset with a PlayStation 5 and an Android mobile phone was just as painless, and the Bluetooth connection worked great in both instances with no latency, although your experience may vary depending on interference from other devices.</p>
<p>All this wouldn't matter much if the AceZone A-Spire Wireless delivered poor audio quality, but that is most definitely not the case here. The contrary, actually, as the headset delivers great audio quality in the vast majority of scenarios, and some of the best audio quality in eSports games, where the headset, unsurprisingly, truly shines. The game's sound design really has to accommodate its unique features. In a game like Counter-Strike 2, for example, it is possible to clearly hear sounds like footsteps from further away than with other headsets and place them very accurately. In other competitive-focused games, however, the AceZone A-Spire Wireless may not help players level up their game a lot, as loud music or sound unrelated to the gameplay end up drowning sounds that could help the player understand where the opponents are and so on.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/02_cleanup.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the AceZone A-Spire Wireless has been designed mostly for eSports, I have found the headset to be quite versatile, making it a worthwhile purchase even for those who aren't into competitive play. In games I have played for hundreds of hours and know extremely well, like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Tales of Graces f, I was able to hear sounds I never noticed, such as environmental sounds that usually get lost in lower-quality headsets and audio systems, which, in conjunction with the excellent noise canceling, increased immersion considerably. In a game designed to be as immersive as possible, like Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, the headset fared even better, allowing me to listen to all sorts of environmental sounds so clearly that I really felt like I was Henry from Skalitz, traveling in medieval Bohemia. Something similar happened when listening to music, as, for example, I was able to hear clearly drummers keeping time with the hi-hat pedal, which is usually a very soft sound that doesn't emerge in most mixes, especially in heavy music like Progressive and Extreme Metal.</p>
<p>The AceZone A-Spire Wireless tries to do something different even in regards to changing settings. All of the company's headsets are compatible with a free smart device app that allows the user to set up different equalization presets for both the headphones and the microphone, tweak Transparency, enable Outside Mode, which lowers wind noise when the headset is used outdoors, and Glasses Mode, which optimizes ANC damping performance when wearing them. The best thing about the app is that it saves settings straight into the headset so that even console players can tweak them with ease.</p>
<p>All the advanced features of the AceZone A-Spire Wireless are extremely good to have, but the real question for most will be if the headset is worth its somewhat high price. That strictly depends on the user. For eSport titles with the proper sound design, the headset truly shines, giving players the same tools the best players in the world use in tournaments, giving them the chance to improve their performance. For regular use with single-player gaming and for music playback, on the other hand, the value of the AceZone A-Spire Wireless' unique features is somewhat diminished, and a more affordable headset may be more enticing. Still, if one is not afraid to spend a little more than usual, they will find a great headset that may give them a greater appreciation of the sound design of their favorite games, regardless of the genre.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has updated its enforcement rules so that streamers caught violating its guidelines will be subjected to varying limited-time bans, with even indefinitely suspendees able to reapply for their accounts to be reinstatement after six months.</p>
<p>This means even streamers with multiple infringements merely have to wait for the violations to "drop off [their] account". Providing you don't reoffend in a set period, your account will be reset to "good standing", as though the original violation never happened.</p>

<p>Higher-severity violations - such as ones for hateful conduct - could remain on an account longer, such as a couple of years. But players caught cheating in games whilst streaming via Twitch are now deem "low severity" will only face a 24-hour suspension from the service.</p>
<p>"Starting today, most violations will expire and drop off of your account after a set amount of time," Twitch <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/An-Update-to-our-Enforcement-System?language=en_US">explained</a>. "You will be able to track when they expire in the Appeals Portal, and this information will also be in the enforcement emails that you receive.</p>
<p>"Most violations committed tend to be low severity (such as cheating in online games) and will expire in 90 days. However, higher-severity violations (such as hateful conduct) will remain on an account longer, and will expire in 1 or 2 years.</p>
<p>"The most severe harms will still result in immediate indefinite suspensions. If you are indefinitely suspended due to accumulating multiple violations within a short time period, you are able to apply for reinstatement after 6 months."</p>
<p>Twitch believes "escalating consequences" will "hold users accountable for repeated harmful behaviour", defining harm as "including actions that lead to physical, emotional, social, or financial damage to a community member, to Twitch, or to society".</p>
<p>If your account was previously indefinitely suspended it will remain so despite these changes, Twitch stressed, although in those instances, users can apply for reinstatement (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/">Insider Gaming</a>).</p>
<p>In November, just ahead of the US elections, Twitch tightened its rules around broadcasts that include debates about "political" and "sensitive social issues". However, after a vocal backlash, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streams-about-political-and-sensitive-issues-including-reproductive-and-lgbtq-rights-now-require-a-label">Twitch clarified that labels would not apply if a streamer is discussing their "lived experience"</a>, or if discussion of these topics isn't the "focus" of the stream.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-ii-just-keeps-getting-better.1116555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/617730/hades-2-getting-better-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Hades II</em> just received its second major update as part of its early access development, which was a great excuse for me to jump back in. Since its initial release, I‚Äôve logged more than 30 hours and actually held myself back from playing much more ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want to get tired of the game before it hits 1.0 ‚Äì but with the new update, I wanted to see what‚Äôs new and try to beat the new final boss on my very first run.</p><p>Sadly, I haven‚Äôt even been able to see what the boss is yet. I <em>did</em> make it to the update‚Äôs new region, but I got destroyed by a dangerous miniboss. Still, I‚Äôve still been really impressed with what Supergiant Games has added since May to make what‚Äôs already a very good game even better.</p><p>The big additions are impressive. <em>Hades II</em> initially launched with six regions ‚Äî four for an Underworld route and two for a ‚Äúsurface‚Äù route ‚Äî and with each major update, Supergiant has added a new region with new enemies, characters, and music to round out that surface route.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">first major update</a>, which came out in October, added the game‚Äôs first new region, Mount Olympus, and it feels as epic as Mount Olympus should. It has grand architecture, fearsome enemies, and a fiery boss fight against Prometheus, all backed by an incredible orchestral soundtrack. (I‚Äôve spent more time than I‚Äôd like to admit listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjiYUgx74rU">this song on loop</a>.)</p><p>That update also added the game‚Äôs sixth and final weapon ‚Äì a witch-y, <em>Hades</em>-style interpretation of a mech suit. Seriously: your primary attack is punching baddies with giant fists while your special attack shoots projectiles that home in on nearby targets. You also have cool wings.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615857/hades-ii-2-warsong-update">second major update</a>, there‚Äôs a new region and boss, too, but I‚Äôve also noticed a lot of smaller details that feel just as impactful. For example, the Altar of Ashes, a place where you pick from various passive effects in the form of arcana cards that can help your runs, got a visual redesign to add intricately-illustrated custom cards. (One of them features Theseus and the Minotaur, who you may remember as bosses from the first <em>Hades</em>, in thongs, lol.) I also spotted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1itjeu2/this_new_mel_portrait_is_so_adorable/">charming new portrait for Melino√´</a>, the game‚Äôs protagonist, that added some levity to a character that‚Äôs usually pretty serious.</p><p>And throughout the major updates and many smaller patches, Supergiant has rebalanced and changed all sorts of mechanics and details in ways that I can honestly barely begin to keep track of. The studio isn‚Äôt afraid to take the hatchet to things that need to go, too; with this most recent patch, Supergiant scrapped an entire mechanic tied to gathering.</p><p>Overall, the changes have made the game feel better to play over time ‚Äì and browsing patch notes, Supergiant uses an emoji to indicate which changes are inspired by community feedback, which I think is a good way to acknowledge how players are contributing to the game, which is one of the main benefits of this type of early access release. (I should also acknowledge that <em>Hades II</em> has the advantage of building from the already-great foundation of the first <em>Hades.</em>)</p><p><em>Hades II</em> might not launch in 1.0 for a long time. Supergiant hasn‚Äôt committed to a timeframe for that, and it‚Äôs still working on a third major update that‚Äôs set to release ‚Äúsome months from now.‚Äù Because of the success of Supergiant‚Äôs other games, like <em>Bastion</em> and <em>Transistor</em>, the studio probably doesn‚Äôt need to rush.</p><p>But given how it‚Äôs treated <em>Hades II‚Äôs</em> early access so far, I‚Äôm fine if Supergiant takes its time. Even though <em>Hades II</em> isn‚Äôt finished, I have no qualms about recommending the game to anyone that‚Äôs interested. And jumping in now lets you experience just how much an already-great game can improve over time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The pace of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> US sales has "fallen behind" that of the PS4 Pro.</p>
<p>That's according to games industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who used Circana data to conclude that whilst the PS5 Pro enjoyed a solid start, January 2025's hardware spend in the US was 45 percent lower when compared to the same period a year ago.</p>

</div><figcaption>Xbox Developer Direct - four promising games also coming to PlayStation.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afaO_AuPw0o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, Piscatella posits that there was "double-digit percentage declines" across all major console platforms compared to a year ago, with PS5 hardware spend dipping by 38 percent year-on-year, Xbox Series declining by 50 percent, and Switch 53 percent.</p>
<p>The latter, however, may be as a result of players holding off for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, as part of its financial report to investors, Sony confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-now-sold-75m-ps5-consoles-and-has-record-monthly-users">sales of its PS5 console have reached 75m units</a>, which is just shy of PS4 sales after an equivalent period.</p>

</span></p>
<p>However, Sony deviated from the norm and chose not to separate console sales in this report, so we're no longer able to disaggregate PS5 Pro sales from the base console. This makes it difficult to ascertain if the PS5 Pro's eye-watering cost of admission has put off players who would typically update their hardware mid-generation.</p>
<p>That said, PlayStation 5 was once again the best-selling hardware platform of the month in terms of both units sold and dollars generated. Xbox Series was second in hardware spending, although the Nintendo Switch edged out Xbox Series in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>As yet, there's no comparative sales data for PS5 in the UK or Europe.</p>
<p>Back in November, Sony said that despite the "different comments" on the PS5 Pro's chunky price point, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-price-has-not-had-a-negative-impact-on-sales-says-sony-boss">the "pricing [...] has not had a negative impact" on PS5 Pro sales</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>We've got the Oblivion attributes returning. We've adjusted the way they progress slightly. Rather than giving you points based on how you level up each skill per level, you just get a fixed number of points per level, similar to Fallout really. That helps alleviate a lot of the issues that Oblivion had with character progression, where if you didn't optimize your level up, you ended up with a character that was too weak for scaled enemies.</em></p>
<p><em>For the most part, our level up system is comparable to Skyrim in the way that the enemies scale with you. We've got someone going through now creating different tiers of enemies, so you won't just be going straight from imps straight to ogres. There will actually be different levels of power for each species, so that helps kind of balance things out a bit.</em></p>
<p>The new Skyblivion UI (user interface) allows players to easily keep track of all their stats and also all the factions they're a part of. Answering a question from a viewer, the team said there wouldn't be a Radiant Quest system like Skyrim's at launch. However, the content is set up in a way that creating a mod like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Missives</a> should make it entirely possible to add the feature.</p>
<p>When asked whether Skyblivion would use sound effects from Oblivion, Skyrim, or original ones, they answered:</p>
<p><em>We'll be using a mix of all three. We'll create new sound effects; we've got a really great sound designer on the project. Also, where we can, we use Oblivion sounds because we can extract them from your Oblivion installation. There are certain effects, like skeletons, which come from Skyrim. And then there's small stuff like footsteps, which have been replaced and are a bit more specific for the type of ground you're walking on, and there's small little touches like that.</em></p>
<p><em>We should actually mention that the sound designer we have is the developer of the really popular Skyrim <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audio Overhaul mod</a>, so a lot of people who have played modern Skyrim are probably quite familiar with the quality of work he does.</em></p>

<p>The Skyblivion team has been working on this project for a long time. We first covered it <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in late 2016</a>, with the modders having started earlier that year. Nine years later, they are just about ready to launch, having reconfirmed in this latest video that the goal is to release it in 2025.</p>
<p>Somewhat ironically, though, insistent rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest</a> that Bethesda might be about to launch its own official remaster of Oblivion.</p>

                <p>After hours and hours of exploring three separate maps in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>, you finally arrive at Galawain's Tusks in search of the mythical Garden. Galawain's Tusks is certainly the least aesthetically pleasing map in the game, as the lava from Mt. Forja and Solace Keep along with the acid sea have turned the entire region a red, greyish color. Still, Galawain's Tusks is by far the largest map in Avowed and there's a ton to see and do as soon as you arrive.</p><p>Opening up your map for the first time in Galawain's Tusks can be a little overwhelming, as the size of the region is unlike anything you've seen up to this point. Fortunately for you, we spent hours combing through the entire map to fully uncover all of the fog on it. You can see the uncovered Galawain's Tusks map along with some points of interest in the guide below so you have a much better idea of where you're going.</p><h2>Full Galawain's Tusks Map in Avowed</h2><p>There are technically three different parts to Galawain's Tusks and there's very little that gets in your way of exploring the whole map. While there are certainly mountains, bridges, and towers surrounding every part of the map, you can fully explore all of it. Here are the major locations you'll come across in Galawain's Tusks:</p><ul><li>The Sallow Steppe</li><li>Slumbering Fields</li><li>Twinedwood</li><li>Solace Keep</li><li>Primordial Depths</li><li>Ash Forest</li><li>Mt. Forja</li></ul><p>Mt. Forja is the only location in Galawain's Tusks that isn't immediately accessible when you arrive. Part of that area can only be explored as a part of the main story quest in Avowed. However, the rest of the map is fair game and takes hours to explore.</p><p>Here are two images that showcase the fully uncovered Galawain's Tusks map:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446873-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.53.41.34.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446873-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.53.41.34.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446873"></a><figcaption>Northern Galawain's Tusks map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446873-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.53.41.34.png"></figure><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446874-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.53.30.43.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446874" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446874-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.53.30.43.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446874"></a><figcaption>Southern Galawain's Tusks map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446874-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.53.30.43.png"></figure><p>As you continue in the main story, more areas will open up to you. For the most part, though, these are areas that you wouldn't know existed until you were guided there by the story quests.</p><h2>Galawain's Tusks Key Points of Interest</h2><p>With Galawain's Tusks being such a large area, it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of fast travel beacons and party camp waystones scattered around the map. In total, Galawain's Tusks has nine fast travel beacons and only three party camp waystones. Interestingly enough, there is no fast travel beacon inside the main hub city of Solace Keep. To get there, you have to fast travel to the beacon just outside of the drawbridge and then run there. It's also worth noting that some fast travel beacons don't become usable until you reach certain points in the story.</p><p>Here's a list of some other major points of interest in Galawain's Tusks:</p><p><strong>Strangled Adra</strong></p><ul><li>Located south of The Sallow Steppe and directly east of where you start in Galawain's Tusks</li></ul><p><strong>The Voice</strong></p><ul><li>Found near the Restless Cavern in the southwestern part of Slumbering Fields. You have to climb to the top of a cliff to reach it. Slumbering Fields itself is accessible via a bridge that goes over the lava river</li></ul><p><strong>Pargrun Cache</strong></p><ul><li>The Pargrun Cache in Galawain's Tusks offers some sweet rewards and also holds two of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-all-totem-of-perseverance-pieces-and-locations/1100-6529504/" data-ref-id="1100-6529504">Totem of Perseverance</a> pieces. You can reach the Pargrun Cache through the Lost Village, which is located north of Solace Keep at the top part of the map</li></ul><p><strong>Treasure Maps</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-ancient-arrowhead-treasure-map-location/1100-6529603/" data-ref-id="1100-6529603">Ancient Arrowhead</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-my-loyal-shield-treasure-map-location/1100-6529602/" data-ref-id="1100-6529602">My Loyal Shield</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-the-blade-that-hungers-treasure-map-location/1100-6529604/" data-ref-id="1100-6529604">The Blade That Hungers</a></li></ul><p><strong>Mapping the Living Lands Cartographer </strong></p><ul><li>Sanza's missing cartographer is actually alive in Galawain's Tusks, and you can find them near Solace Keep (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-galawains-tusks-cartographer-location-for-mapping-the-living-lands/1100-6529530/" data-ref-id="1100-6529530">exact location in a separate guide</a>)</li></ul><p>And there you have it, the entire Galawain's Tusks map laid out for you in Avowed.

            <p>Good news, ghost-hunting fans - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s genre-defining voice recognition feature is coming to consoles.</p>
<p>Although PC players have long been able to experience the horror game with the added stress of voice recognition, the October console release shipped initially without the feature.</p>

<p>Now, however, Kinetic said the feature is ready to go on both PS5 and Xbox consoles, enabling console players to try out the voice prompts for equipment like the Spirit Box and Ouija Board, as well as Monkey Paw.</p>
<p>The delay of some of Phasmo's fan-favourite equipment and tools hasn't put console players off, however - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-marks-22m-total-sales-with-its-2025-roadmap-and-changes-to-maps-kit-and-our-humble-journal">the ghost-hunting sim has sold two million copies on console</a> since it came out of early access last October, bringing the total sales across all platforms to 22 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-marks-22m-total-sales-with-its-2025-roadmap-and-changes-to-maps-kit-and-our-humble-journal">Phasmophobia outlined the road ahead for the spooky sim in 2025</a>, confirming map reworks, new ghost-hunting equipment, "thrilling seasonal events", and a brand-new location, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But now we live in a post-<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> world, which rocked the gaming industry (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/" data-ref-id="1100-6519739">GameSpot named it our Game of the Year in 2023</a>), and dice-based games are getting a spotlight they previously didn't have. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solasta-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-654962">Solasta II</a> is launching into a far more favorable position than its predecessor, and feels like it could be a great game for folks who enjoyed Baldur's Gate 3 but now want a game that more closely aligns with the experience of playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p dir="ltr">I played about an hour of Solasta II and the most striking part of the demo was how closely the game more strictly sticks to the parameters of D&amp;D 5e in comparison to a game like Baldur's Gate 3. You can't, for example, drink a health potion and melee attack on the same turn. Baldur's Gate 3 adopts the commonly homebrewed rule (and now official rule in the latest edition of D&amp;D) that considers drinking a health potion to be a bonus action and not an action, so you could reserve your action to attack and then use your bonus action to heal on the same turn. That's not how it works in the rules for D&amp;D 5e, so that's not how it works in Solasta II. This parallel seems to extend across Solasta II and although I appreciate the accuracy, it does highlight some of the problems with D&amp;D 5e that games like Baldur's Gate 3 have already circumnavigated by outright changing how they work.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448454-ss_a2f5cc428942714e8b9c11bfd4bd30c225755257.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448454" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448454-ss_a2f5cc428942714e8b9c11bfd4bd30c225755257.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448454"></a><figcaption>Different members of the party will want to solve problems differently and sometimes have unique skill checks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448454-ss_a2f5cc428942714e8b9c11bfd4bd30c225755257.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Ignoring the comparisons to Baldur's Gate 3, the combat otherwise feels great. Figuring out when to use my Rogue's unique cunning action ability to bonus action dash so I can save her main action to attack an enemy being flanked by the Fighter (a scenario that lets me add sneak attack damage!) felt awesome. I was repeatedly rewarded for thinking things through before engaging a target. Knowing when and how to use resources is paramount as Solasta II tracks ammunition (so I had to keep count of how many arrows my short bow-wielding sorcerer had on him, for example), and there even seems to be a risk-versus-reward consideration tied to the rest mechanic, as the first time I tried to camp to regain health and recharge the party's abilities, one of the members of the party cryptically warned that doing so might cause enough time to pass, meaning I'd potentially miss out on future storylines. That added a sense of urgency to what seemed to be an optional quest in the demo, but I'm curious to see if this same feeling is applied to portions of the main storyline as well and how often resting might cause a player to miss out on a quest.</p><p dir="ltr">The critical path sees you take control of four adventurers--a dwarf, elf, human, and gnome--who are adoptive siblings. These brothers and sisters are traveling together as part of some sort of quest connected to their adopted family name and the legacy they've all inherited, which brings them into conflict with an ancient threat. It all seems like your traditional fantasy affair, but I only saw a snippet of this plot play out in the demo. The voice acting sounds great, and though face models sometimes descend into the uncanny valley, they're more often expressive and help bring added emotion to the scene that you, as a player, can pick up even if the four protagonists all failed their Insight checks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448456-ss_ab26a62f7b0b78fd46dfe698474191e75b2191f8.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448456" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448456-ss_ab26a62f7b0b78fd46dfe698474191e75b2191f8.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448456"></a><figcaption>Combat in Solasta II follows D&amp;D 5's rules.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448456-ss_ab26a62f7b0b78fd46dfe698474191e75b2191f8.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm most curious to see how the full game will handle the roleplaying side of things. Unlike other RPGs in which you build a party of characters with different strengths and weaknesses, but only one member of the team talks during conversations, all four members of the adventuring party in Solasta II are fully voiced and contribute to every conversation. The game lists all the available dialogue options for each party member and which bonuses each one adds to the dice roll--you can see how the dwarf Paladin's high Persuasion makes him more adept at convincing someone to help you while the human Fighter's high Insight lets her be the better choice to tell whether the person you're talking to is lying.</p><p dir="ltr">That's really cool and feels like it has the potential to replicate the essence of being a group, as opposed to a talented spokesperson at the head of a squad, like Mass Effect's Shepard or Baldur's Gate 3's Tav. The demo didn't offer an opportunity to see how the effects of conversations could steamroll into consequences, stopping me from definitively proclaiming that this is the type of squad-focused, choice-driven dialogue I've wanted in my fantasy RPGs. But I see the potential vision and I'm excited to see how it pans out in the full game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448457-ss_1877caf6cd5a36481af522878835d1418fd12204.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448457" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448457-ss_1877caf6cd5a36481af522878835d1418fd12204.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448457"></a><figcaption>The facial animations in Solasta II look pretty good!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448457-ss_1877caf6cd5a36481af522878835d1418fd12204.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each of the four characters can also be controlled as a group or independently with the keyboard instead of mouse clicks outside of battle, making it easier to guide them in comparison to similar RPGs. This makes stealth and thievery a viable strategy, which is rare in games like this, as the more precise movements ensure getting around enemy vision cones isn't a frustrating ordeal.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm still undecided on Solasta II. On one hand, it follows D&amp;D 5e's original rules to the letter, a 2014 tabletop system that has been iterated, expanded, and improved upon in the past 10 years. And keeping to rules without taking steps to change it might make for a game that is ultimately frustrating for players who have appreciated the efforts made by other developers in recent years. But the game takes strides in areas outside of combat that feel like vast improvements, like giving the player more precise control over how the protagonists move and bringing the full party into each conversation instead of having only one hero be the go-to voice. This is certainly a game I want to play more of, but I'll need more time with it before deciding where I land on it.</p><p dir="ltr">Solasta II is set to launch for PC. No release window has been announced but there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975950/Solasta_II/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free demo on Steam</a> if you want to try it out for yourself.</p>
