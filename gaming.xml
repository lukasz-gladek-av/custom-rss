            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">plagiarism scandal</a> and an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">indefinite delay</a> earlier this year, Bungie's corporate overlords Sony have reiterated again that extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is still aiming to release by March next year. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s struggles have seen the parent corp flatly admit that game's not doing as well as Sony imagined when they bought Bungie.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>During an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20251111/SzQTgsRB/202603_2q_02_en/index.html">earnings call</a> as part of the company's latest financial results, Sony CFO Lin Tao responded to a question about Marathon by declaring that they are "fully dedicated to launching the title as scheduled". That schedule being by the end of this financial year, which concludes at the end of March 2026. Tao's words aren't that surprising, given they've been the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-confident-marathon-will-release-by-march-2026-and-that-their-live-service-transition-is-paying-off">company line</a> throughout this year.
</p>
<p>However, back in August, Tao did mention that Bungie hoped to be able to stick a fresh release date on the game at some point this autumn. We're by no means out of that window yet and things could change any day now, but as of writing no new date's been forthcoming and winter beckons. To be fair, Tao revealed that Bungie are still "in the process of analysing Marathon's performance in terms of gameplay and retention during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-shows-signs-of-life-with-a-closed-network-test-scheduled-for-later-this-month">October's technical test</a>, with tweaks to be made "as needed".</p>
<p>Things being pretty quiet on the Marathon front <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">isn't unusual at this point</a>, but questions'll only intensify if it keeps inching closer to March without that new date.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, these financial results revealed that Sony's accountants have had to record an impairment charge which indicates that Bungie's current value is about 31.5 billion yen (about £155 million/$204 million) less than the number the corp would like it to be. That underperformance relative to what was envisioned by Sony when they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sonys-purchase-of-bungie-is-now-complete">bought the studio</a> is being dumped firmly at Destiny 2's door, with Tao saying that "partially due to the changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement have not reached the expectations we had". As a result, profits have been cut into and corporate frowny faces abound, though Tao did declare that the companies "will continue to make improvements". Hopefully that doesn't just mean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">more layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>Here's also hoping Marathon can avoid a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">Concord-esque fate</a> whenever it fully breaks cover.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-airpods-4-suddenly-drop-to-almost-free-early-black-friday-strategy-or-just-a-clearance-move.1349758/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re still a couple weeks shy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. While you can expect to find lots of deals over that late-November weekend across consumer tech and pretty every every other category of products, that doesn’t mean you can’t find any lucrative deals right now. The Apple AirPods 4 are just over a year old and are now seeing a pretty significant discount. It’s a great time to pick up a pair if you’ve been holding out. The base model of Apple’s versatile earbuds released at the price of $129. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">Right now, Amazon has them for 34% off, brining the price to just $85. You’ll end up saving yourself a good $44</a>. If you want to upgrade to the model with support for active noise cancellation, you can expect a 16% discount. That pair normally goes for $179, but the deal ends up shaving off $30 so you only have to pay $149 for a limited time.</p>
<p>AirPods have been around for a while now with Apple adding in some incremental improvements with each generation. The latest version in the Apple AirPods 4 feature a refined contour with a shorter stem and quick-press controls for music. Apple put a lot of focus on all-day comfort this time around.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Isolate Sound</h2>
<p>You can expect better sound quality when it comes to calls all thanks to the new H2 chipset Apple designed. The new chip enables voice isolation to remove background noises. Folks on the other end of the call will be hearing you and only you, even if you’re in a crowded, noisy environment. The AirPods are able to eliminate sounds coming from around you so you come across perfectly clear.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can expect to better audio quality on your end because of the H2 chip. the new acoustic architecture is designed for crystal clear highs and deep bass.</p>



<p>A nice little addition to the AirPods feature set is how the buds interact with Apple’s voice assistant. Sire can now interpret basic gestures such as nodding yes or shaking your head no as a response to question. Not sure which seems weirder though for someone sitting across from you on the subway. You doing that, or you just blankly saying “Yes” or “No” allowed to no one in particular.</p>
<p>Something you can see different between the AirPods 4 and the previous model right away in a side-by-side is Apple has finally done away with the proprietary Lightning port. The case for the AirPods now charge using the now standard USB-C which is a welcome change indeed.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-middle-of-journey/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-is-%E2%80%98only-in-the-middle-of-the-journey%E2%80%99-says-sony.1349755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao has said that Sony believes the PlayStation 5 is only at the midpoint of its journey.</p>



<div><p>The quote came from Sony’s latest quarterly earnings call, where Sony CFO Line Tao revealed that the PlayStation 5 is currently only in the middle of its lifecycle. Tao said,</p><p>“Our view is that compared to conventional console lifecycles. Looking at the PS4 lifecycle, it seems to be getting longer and longer. Especially the PS4, which was launched in 2013, and it’s been over a decade since then, but there are many active users enjoying the console… So from that perspective, we believe that the PS5 is only in the middle of the journey, and we are really planning to expand it even further.”</p></div>







<h2 id="h-so-when-will-the-ps6-release">So, When Will The PS6 Release?</h2>



<p>Well, Tao’s comments are not actually suggesting that the PlayStation 6 is another five years away, instead, she’s suggesting that the console generation of the PlayStation 5 will bleed through during the PS5. Just like with the current generation with the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, we’re now only just seeing developers move away from the PS4 with its games.</p>



<p>So, in theory at least, the PlayStation 6 is scheduled to release likely in 2027 – 2028, with the PlayStation 5 continuing to be supported to around 2031 – 2032.</p>



<p>The support for the ‘past generation’ is simply because of economics, allowing developers to release on a much bigger market than they would if they just developed games for the latest generation. For instance, on PlayStation 6’s launch, which could sell 10-15 million units in its first year, it’s not an ideal market to solely release a game on. Instead, it’s much better to release on the PlayStation 6 (10-15 million units), plus the PlayStation 5 (likely 100 million units+ by 2027).</p>



<p>It’s why popular games such as Call of Duty still remain on past-generation consoles, simply because the platform still has a large number of players.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-worlds-collide-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is bringing a host of new adventures into the fray, but the mysterious Worlds Collide mode has raised questions among the community.</p>



<p>First emerging as a query following the start of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preloads for Black Ops 7 becoming</a> available, a download option for Worlds Collide was confusing, as it wasn’t abundantly clear what the download was for—unlike the options for Zombies and multiplayer, which are self-explanatory.</p>



<p>Fear not, though, as the answer is out there, and we’ve got all the details you need for Worlds Collide in Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-worlds-collide-in-black-ops-7">What is Worlds Collide in Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New adventure. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Worlds Collide is the name for the Campaign in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and specifically refers to the endgame mode available once the campaign is completed.</strong></p>



<p>Black Ops 7 features co-op with up to four players throughout the campaign, with a huge focus on replayability in the post-game when the main story is completed.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-endgame-multiplayer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed by Activision</a>, the endgame mode is a new and shared experience “where the narrative continues to unfold.” It takes place on the Avalon map, with POIs from across Black Ops history, featuring discoverable intel, expansive skill tracks, and more.</p>



<p>Detailed in the Call of Duty blog, the endgame mode takes place after the conclusion of the 11 co-op campaign missions that make up the game’s story, and tasks players with exploring Avalon to find The Guild’s remaining Command Centers, while battling with exposure zones that are leaking a mysterious toxin into the city.</p>



<p>The area is expected to be the best place to grind for the exclusive campaign camos that are available for weapons in Black Ops 7, for the first time, which adds to the camos available in multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-worlds-collide-pvp-or-pve">Is Worlds Collide PvP or PvE?</h2>



<p><strong>Unlike Warzone, the Worlds Collide endgame mode is an entirely PvE operation, and there is no combat against other players.</strong></p>



<p>The mode is designed for one-to-32 players in squads of up to four, where players can choose to tackle smaller objectives individually in their squad, or combine with other squads to take down more difficult objectives.</p>



<p>Different areas of Avalon have different recommended Combat Ratings, providing varying degrees of challenge for players, but there are no PvP offerings available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bridging game and reality.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ever need to make like Sam Porter and hike through tricky terrain while lugging hefty cargo, Kojima Productions literally has your back, or in this case your knees. Hideo Kojima's studio is partnering with exoskeleton maker Dnsys to release an official Death Stranding 2 On The Beach limited edition exoskeleton to provide knee support. The surprise collaboration was revealed on Kojima Productions’ official X accounts in both <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015/status/1987883970403705323?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987884067178852705?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>English</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back on November 8, Kojima Productions’ <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015/status/1987110126332023186?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987104080892993781?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>English</u></a> X accounts teased the collaboration under the cryptic tagline: "A new experience that bridges the game and the real world is coming soon." This prompted puzzled users to guess everything from a headset to some kind of gaming chair, with some clocking that the zoomed-in pictures bore some resemblance to Sam’s supportive exoskeleton.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>DNSYS ✖️ DEATH STRANDING 2 co-branded exoskeleton is here 👍</p><p>📦 Dnsys Z1 Exoskeleton Pro – DEATH STRANDING 2 ON THE BEACH Limited Edition<br>It enhances lower-body strength and stability, allowing humans to keep moving through complex terrain and extreme environments. 🦵🦿… <a href="https://t.co/Yi1E6RnKNC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Yi1E6RnKNC</a></p></div>— KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS (Eng) (@KojiPro2015_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987884067178852705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As revealed in Kojima Productions’ more recent X post, the mystery product turned out to be an actual exoskeleton, made in collaboration with exoskeleton maker Dnsys, which worked with Kojima Productions' art director Yoji Shinkawa to make it look true to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We designed this exoskeleton with the same passion and precision as if it were built for the world of Death Stranding,” said Shinkawa. “Every detail was refined to bring the game’s futuristic vision into reality, creating something Sam himself might wear." The exoskeleton is battery-powered, and even features lights that show how much juice it has left, just like in Death Stranding. No Bridge Baby included, but that's probably just as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although handy for Sam Porter cosplays, it is also a functional and serious piece of equipment. According to the Dnsys <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>, the Death Stranding 2 exoskeleton enhances lower body strength and protects the knee joints by offloading the user's body weight, sort of mimicking the game's load-balancing system in real life. In addition to helping you hike miles further, the product description even boasts that you will “instantly feel up to 44 pounds lighter,” which might be useful when in denial about how much you ate post-Christmas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Death Stranding 2: On The Beach Limited Edition Exoskeleton will be available globally from December 2. No word on the price yet, but Dnsys is giving away three of them through a creative competition, details of which can be found at the <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>bottom of the product page</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

The park is split into two areas, a Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town. The Pokémon Forest will be a wooded trail with varied terrains in which visitors can spot different Pokémon statues. Sedge Town will offer rides like the Vee Vee Voyage carousel, a Pokémon Center for merch, a Trainer’s Mart offering park-exclusive refreshments, and the Sedge Gym, where you will be able to watch a stage show (complete with dancing Pikachus). There will also be Pokémon meet and greets, plus a Pokémon parade. Overall, the park promises to feature over 600 Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PokéPark previously existed in Nagoya (Japan) and Taiwan back in 2005 and 2006, respectively.

The Trainer’s Pass gives unlimited access to Sedge Town but gives you a timeslot for the Pokémon Forest. There are also plans to offer a Sedge Town-only pass in the future.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"How do you know what you’re going to get?"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Bungie developer Chris Sides has called out the term "extraction shooter," saying it's a "terrible" genre name because it doesn't tell the player what to expect from the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/Xqwje5N5ArA?si=ITRZ6Nsu845IdyhY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Shooter Monthly podcast</u></a>, the former director of product on Bungie's upcoming Marathon didn't hold back, stressing that with so many distinct games potentially falling under the umbrella of "extraction shooter," players will find it hard to know "what you're going to get."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The problem is Helldivers 2 can be called an extraction shooter, but it's not. The genre name is so bad," Sides said (thanks, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/former-bungie-director-different-genre-name-for-marathon-extraction-shooter-dumb/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheGamePost</u></a>). "I hate the genre name of 'extraction shooter.' When I was working on Marathon, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, 'Can we please create a different genre name, because extraction shooter is so dumb.' It's the only genre where its name is a mechanic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Extraction is the mechanic to get out. Helldivers 2, is that an extraction shooter because you extract? No. It's not like Tarkov at all. So the terminology of the genre is already terrible. It makes it really hard to compare these games. It's why Arena Breakout and Tarkov, you can kind of look at it because they're both extraction shooters and they kind of fit the same mold. Comparing Arc Raiders to Tarkov just doesn't really fit. Comparing Arc Raiders to maybe like a Rust could fit, and then Rust... is that an extraction because it's survivor? It's a problem. I cannot stand the name of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So I think that when you say the extraction genre, it should hit your spot, I think it's really the fact that the genre doesn't even know what it is. So you as a player, how do you know what what you're going to get? And I think that's one of the real issues with the genre itself."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's well worth listening to the podcast, where Sides is joined by other shooter developers in an interesting discussion about the extraction shooter genre generally, as well as the problem with how it's named. They discuss everything from Marathon to Arc Raiders and Helldivers 2 to Escape from Tarkov.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the term 'extraction shooter' may be problematic, according to Sides, it hasn't held back the performance of Arc Raiders, which developer Embark Studios describes as a "multiplayer extraction adventure," as opposed to an extraction shooter. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms">It sold 4 million copies in less than two weeks</a>, with a peak concurrent player count of 700,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, it was recently delayed out of 2025 and into 2026 as Bungie works to respond to feedback from playtests. Bungie describes Marathon as a "team-based extraction shooter."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

			<p>Destiny 2 was namedropped today during Sony's Q2 2025 investors call, and not in a positive way. Lin Tao, CFO (Corporate Financial Officer) at Sony Group Corporation, explained that the game's sales have been lower than expected when Sony acquired its developer, Bungie, thus forcing the Japanese corporation to record an impairment loss of 31.5 billion yen, which translates to roughly $204 million at current exchange rates.</p>



<p><em>Regarding Destiny 2, partially due to the changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement have not reached the expectation we had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie. While we will continue to make improvements, we downwardly revised the business projection for the time being and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie.</em></p>



<p>Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-bungie-for-3-6-billion-studio-to-remain-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the acquisition of Bungie in early 2022. They spent the huge sum of $3.6 billion, which analysts like Wedbush Securities' Michael Pachter <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-vastly-overpaid-for-bungie-says-pachter-unlike-microsoft-take-two-for-activision-blizzard-zynga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believed was disproportionate to the value of the studio</a>. The main objective was for Sony to add live service experts to its portfolio, but it's not really paying off, with Destiny 2's Steam numbers <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping significantly</a> and the delay of their next game, the first-person extraction shooter Marathon.</p>



<p>Destiny 2 will try to pick itself up with Renegades, the Star Wars-inspired expansion that goes live on December 2, featuring cool new weapons such as lightsabers. But Bungie's real test will be Marathon, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slated to launch before March 2026</a>. If it failed, it could spell doom for the once-acclaimed developer. </p>

<p>For its part, Sony can rest easy knowing that Helldivers 2, on the other hand, is doing very well. Following its launch on Xbox, the game continues to attract new players on PlayStation 5 and PC, and its sales have significantly increased year-over-year. Despite several blunders (including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-ceo-shares-learnings-from-concord-failure-reckons-psn-requirement-will-keep-pc-games-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ill-fated Concord</a>), live service revenue accounts for 40% of PlayStation's first-party revenue.</p>



<p>In the Q2 2025 financial report, Sony also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-reach-84-2-million-units-ghost-of-yotei-sold-3-3-million-units-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that PS5 shipments have reached 84.2 million units, while the game Ghost of Yōtei sold more than 3.3 million units in its first month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday is just around the corner, and early discounts are already dropping in right, left, and center. Those looking to purchase a new laptop for work or entertainment – we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>The 17-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which normally retails for over $3,000, is now going for just $990 on Amazon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5446/">That’s an unbelievable 73% discount, but there’s still more. You will also receive a free accessory kit worth almost $200 with your purchase.</a> Of course, like most big deals, this one is also around for a short time, so it’s best to act fast to grab it. We’re expecting the discount to wrap soon, and there’s no telling if it will be back for Black Friday or Cyber Monday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5446/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Everything You Need to Get Started Right Away</h2>
<p>Starting off with the accessory kit; it includes Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, an external optical drive, a wireless mouse, and a cleaning cloth. These are all useful add-ons, but Windows 11 Pro steals the spotlight. This operating system is one of the best ones out there in terms of overall experience. Microsoft has packed it with a bunch of security features, productivity tools, and system management options, making it ideal for work professionals and creatives. It’s also more expensive than the Home version, but you don’t have to worry about that here.</p>
<p>As for the laptop itself, you’re getting a massive 17.3-inch HD+ (1600×900) anti-glare touchscreen that delivers clear, vibrant visuals. Colors will pop while staying easy on the eyes. Touch support makes it easy to scroll, pinch, swipe, and type directly on the screen using your fingertips. You can use it to sketch and even take notes when you’re not feeling like using the keyboard.</p>



<p>There’s also an HP True Vision 720p camera with a physical privacy shutter paired with AI Noise Reduction for better video calls. The battery offers up to 9 hours of video playback, meaning you can go a full day without plugging the laptop in. And when you do need to recharge, it goes from 0 to 50% in just 45 minutes!</p>
<p>Powering the device is an <strong>AMD Ryzen 5 7430U 6-core processor with 32GB RAM</strong> for faster and more efficient multitasking. The <strong>2TB SSD</strong> lets you store all your important documents, media content, and programs with ease. Together, these are enough to help you be productive on your busy days where you need to work with multiple applications at the same time, take back-to-back video calls, create presentations, etc.</p>
<p>We highly recommend grabbing the deal as soon as you can, before the retailer pushes the price up for good.</p>

PokéPark Kanto, Japan's first-ever "permanent outdoor Pokémon attraction", will officially open its doors to visitors of Tokyo's Yomiuriland amusement park on 5th February 2026, with ticket applications starting soon.
</p>
<p>
PokéPark Kanto spans 2.6 hectares within Yomiuriland and is split into two areas: Sedge Town and the Pokémon Forest. In the forest, visitors can watch various Pokémon interacting with each other as they wind along a 500-metre walking trail, while Sedge Town promises its own familiar sites.

<p>
Here, visitors can stop by the Pokémon Center and Poké Mart, or gather in the Gym, and there's talk of meet-and-greets, parades, food and merchandise stores, and more. Additionally, two other attractions have now been confirmed, both requiring separate ticket purchases. Vee Vee Voyage is a merry-go-round featuring Eevee and friends, while the Pika Pika Paradise show stars over 30 Electric-type Pokémon, including Pikachu.
</p><p>
In total, 600 Pokémon are promised across PokéPark, and residents of Japan can apply for tickets via a lottery style system starting on 21st December, with overseas ticket purchases to follow. The lottery closes on 8th December, and will be the only way visitors can access PokéPark before the end of March.
</p>
<p>
For adults, the Trainers Pass starts at 7,900 yen (around £39), granting one-time access to forest portion of the park within a set time slot, and unlimited access to the town. The 14,000 yen (£69) Ace Trainer's Pass, meanwhile, offers unlimited and unscheduled access to both the town and forest, access to special meet-and-greets, a reserved seat for the Sedge Gym Show, and one-time access to each paid attraction via priority lanes.
</p>
<p>
A town-only ticket will be available next summer, and there's a bunch more information on the <a href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/top/index">PokéPark Kanto website</a>.

			<p>A sequel to Avowed is reportedly in the making at Obsidian Entertainment, but the studio has not greenlit a third The Outer Worlds game yet. The rumor comes from former Obsidian co-founder Chris Avellone, who <a href="https://x.com/ChrisAvellone/status/1986510753025704307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>Apparently, aside from DLC plans for Outer Worlds 2, it seems like Obsidian is making no plans for Outer Worlds 3 (but they are doing Avowed 2).</em></p>



<p>It's worth noting that Avellone left the studio ten years ago, following notorious disagreements with CEO Feargus Urquhart. That said, Avellone, who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-joins-republic-games-to-work-on-dark-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined Republic Games to work on an upcoming dark fantasy RPG</a>, might still have a few contacts within the company.</p>



<p>Avowed launched on February 18, 2025, opening a very busy year for Obsidian (which also released Grounded 2 in early access). The game offered an action RPG take on the fantasy world of Eora, originally introduced to the studio's fans with the Pillars of Eternity series of cRPGs. When I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed the game</a>, I had a lot of praise for it, rating it 8.8 out of 10:</p>



<p><em>Avowed marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds. The game retains the studio's signature excellent writing and narrative while improving the combat (especially the challenge level) and providing a lot of great content to go through. The visuals and performance are also praiseworthy. There are a few shortcomings, but if you're a fan of Western RPGs, you don't want to miss Avowed. It may have started as a spin-off, but it could go on to be the main series in Eora.</em></p>



<p>I have since played The Outer Worlds 2 as well, and I largely agree with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Carcasole's review score of 8.5</a>. It's another great RPG from Obsidian, not to mention an improvement over the original, but I believe Avowed is slightly superior, mainly due to better and more challenging combat, as well as more interesting companions. As such, if I had to choose, I'd rather get a sequel for that game.</p>



<p>Clearly though, if it is indeed true that the studio isn't currently planning to make more games in The Outer Worlds series, that might leave space for something else. Either a third, higher-budget Pillars of Eternity game, which Josh Sawyer <a href="https://wccftech.com/pillars-of-eternity-3-with-baldurs-gate-3-budget-is-something-josh-sawyer-would-do-with-turn-based-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said he'd love to do</a>, or perhaps the game that a lot of fans would like them to make: Fallout New Vegas 2. A few years ago, Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-entertainment-fallout/">left the door wide open for that</a>. Bethesda doesn't seem too keen on it, but Microsoft reportedly desires to get new Fallout games out more quickly following the success of the Amazon TV show, and one way to do that, considering that BGS is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep in development on TES VI</a>, would be to give it to a sister studio.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Confirms Bungie’s Marathon Will Launch by March 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-confirms-bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-will-launch-by-march-2026.1349656/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony has once again reconfirmed that Bungie’s extraction-based shooter, Marathon, will launch by March 2026.</p>



<p>The confirmation came during the company’s quarterly earnings call, where Sony’s CFO, Lin Tao, said that Bungie’s Marathon was still in active development and that the company was “fully dedicated” to launching the game in the current fiscal year. Sony’s fiscal year ends March 2026, suggesting that Marathon will likely launch sometime in February to March, if we were to guess.</p>







<p>Marathon has had an uphill battle since it was first announced earlier this year, with the game struggling to captivate players and the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing a slew of plagiarism allegations</a>, of which Bungie later admitted. The issues facing the gam<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> led to a delay of an undisclosed length</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-is-marathon-good-now">But is Marathon Good Now?</h2>



<p>However, as recently as the game’s latest playtests at the end of October, which were apparently under NDA, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-leaks-closed-test-reveal-positivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie has apparently been able to turn things around</a> with its game. </p>



<p>According to those who played the latest version of the game, it’s apparently in a much better state now, with players looking forward to its release in the coming months.</p>



<p>The game was said to be a ‘significant improvement’ since the playtests in the summer, yet the game still had some minor issueswhich were said to be easily fixed.</p>



<p>Whether Marathon will be a success on launch remains to be seen, but with GTA 6 now slipping into November 2026 and the start of the year seemingly being relatively quiet now, it could launch to some interest. </p>







<p>ARC Raiders is clearly the game’s most immediate competition, but if Marathon launches in March 2026, ARC Raiders’ playerbase and hype will likely have whittled down considerably. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> has not reached expectations following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">Sony's $3.6bn acquisition</a> of Bungie.</p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_sonypre.pdf">earnings report</a>, Sony has recorded a loss in profit in its games segment due to "impairment losses against a portion of Bungie, Inc.'s intangible and other assets in connection with Destiny 2."</p>
<p>Expanding on this during a Q&amp;A, Sony CFO Lin Tao stated: "Regarding Destiny 2, partially due to the changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement have not reached the expectations we had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie."</p>

<p>She continued: "While we will continue to make improvements, we downwardly revised the business projection for the time being, and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie."</p>
<p>Still, Tao noted Sony's live-service games "overall accounted for more than 40 percent of our first-party software revenue", citing the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and MLB: The Show 25 (and their respective Xbox releases).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-destiny-2">Destiny 2 player numbers have drastically dropped in recent months</a>, with fears it could be nearing the end of its life. Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-on-earth-do-you-find-lasting-meaningful-success-with-a-live-service-game-developers-answer-the-billion-dollar-question">finding success with a live-service game is a billion dollar question</a> that's tough to answer.</p>

<p>Let's go, Tokyo!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, here's a little something to make you smile. The Pokémon Company has today shared another look at its upcoming theme park, 'PokéPark Kanto', and announced that gates will open on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Tickets to this new section of Tokyo's Yomiuriland Amusement Park will open for Japanese residents on 21st November and will be distributed by a lottery. There's currently no information on how those of us who live in other countries can nab tickets, but the official English booking website currently hosts a "Coming Soon" message, so keep an eye out for updates in the coming months.</p>
<p>But what's this PokéPark all about? This permanent outdoor Pokémon experience — the first of its kind, surprisingly — is divided into two areas: the Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the forest area will be your chance to see Pokémon 'in the wild'. Okay, it's actually just a bunch of statues dotted throughout a woodland walk, but you can expect photo ops aplenty with the likes of Pikachu, Eevee and Nidoran.</p>
<p>Sedge Town is more of a commercial area, with a Pokémon Center and Poké Mart you can pop into for merch, rides like the 'Pika Pika Paradise' and 'Vee Vee Voyage', and the 'Sedge Gym' show area.</p>


<p>It all looks really rather sweet, if you ask us. If you happen to find yourself in Tokyo next February, you know this'll be worth popping into.</p>

            <p>A beefy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> update has just dropped, and it aims to take care of a couple of bugs and exploits which have become infamous bugbears over the last little while. No longer will people be able to fly up to rooftops by smacking drones with sledgehammers, and no longer will lock-guided missiles cheekily ignore countermeasures.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This and more can be found if you leaf through the notes for <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-update-1-1-1-5">update 1.1.1.5</a>, which has rolled out this morning on the fine day of November 11th. Those lead with the fix for the drone exploit, which was seeing folks hop atop the unmanned aircraft and whack them with hammers so they flew into the air, acting as lifts to rooftops from which you could then snipe with impunity. Personally, I'm sad such a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzT9L4llKzk&amp;t=1s">fun fairground ride</a>'s been outlawed, but I also die every 12 seconds in each match to someone playing properly, so hadn't really noticed the exploiters.</p>
<p>The lock-guided missile fix is one we've known was coming since last week, when EA opted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-devs-temporarily-confiscate-the-infantry-fighting-vehicles-bugged-lock-on-missiles">temporarily disable them</a> until this patch rolled out. Beyond those, vehicles should now spawn as intended during breakthrough and conquest matches, and "multiple battle royale issues affecting match flow, squad revives, and end of round transitions" have been dealt with. Those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-redsec-best-guns">REDSEC</a> fixes include instances of kills following respawns leading squads to be instantly eliminated and matches deciding not to end after the last team are wiped out.</p>
<p>In terms of player-specific stuff, the update's seen EA make it easier not to have your aim knocked too far off course when landing or sliding and reduce bullet "dispersion" being too high because it hasn't adjusted properly to you moving more slowly than the speed of sound. Good news for people who like tearing through the middle of battles like a toddler having an almighty sugar rush. Some progression blocks on challenges have also been lifted.</p><p>If you've participated in any of the drone hammering, remember to apologise to the next one you see for all of the trouble. We'll have to wait and see what ends up being the next glitch dubbed the scourge of the battling fields now this boogeyman's been snuffed out.</p>

<p>A fresh update has been deployed for Battlefield 6, introducing a variety of quality-of-life tweaks that impact various aspects of the game, and we’ve got the patch notes.</p>



<p>The 1.1.1.5 update for Battlefield 6 was made available on November 11 at 9 AM UTC, with tweaks to weapon accuracy, refinements to vehicle countermeasure reliability, improvements to Battle Royale match flow, and improved gameplay stability.</p>



<p>The biggest updates included fixing an exploit that allowed players to access unintended areas when standing on a Recon Drone, fixing an issue where enemy countermeasures did not effectively counter Lock-Guided Missiles, and vehicle spawning issues in Breakthrough and Conquest.</p>



<p>In REDSEC Battle Royale, multiple issues impacting match flow, squad revives, and end-of-round transitions were fixed, as well as a specific progression issue.</p>

<p>Fortnite is set to make a controversial addition in a future update, it’s claimed, with gambling mechanics set to be directly added to the title.</p>



<p>Huge updates are on the cards for Fortnite with Chapter 7 due to kick off later this month, and the annual switch in chapters usually results in the biggest gameplay changes of the year.</p>



<p>While we’ve already seen leaks suggesting huge collabs with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob Squarepants</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> are on the cards, the apparent addition of gambling will ruffle some feathers.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-will-add-gambling-mechanics">Fortnite Will Add Gambling Mechanics</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big deal. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1988203466146410851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reliable leaker ShiinaBR</a>, gambling mechanics are “coming soon” in Fortnite and will be available to games created using the Unreal Editor in Fortnite.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear whether official Fortnite experiences will support gambling, or whether content link loot boxes will be added to the Item Shop, but it appears that it will be available in community-created experiences.</p>



<p>According to leaks, random items will be purchasable with V-Bucks, but creators will be required to disclose gambling odds—something commonplace in gaming to align with international laws. Additionally, due to laws in some nations, experiences with gambling involved will be blocked in some nations.</p>



<p>While gambling aspects are already available in some user-created experiences within Fortnite, including pet eggs with a rare chance to hatch specific creatures in games like Pet Heroes Adventure, the major difference is that these are paid for with in-game soft currency that is not purchasable.</p>



<p>With this update, V-Bucks will be directly available to spend on items that provide random rewards, though it’s unclear at this stage what exactly that will entail, and it will likely depend on the experience being played.</p>

            <p>Bungie's Marathon is still aiming for a release this financial year, Sony CFO Lin Tao has confirmed, adding "as needed, we will make corrections" following recent playtests.</p>
<p>The online shooter was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">indefinitely delayed back in June</a> due to "passionate" fan feedback, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">plagiarism scandal</a> over the use of an external artist's work.</p>
<p>Now, in today's earnings report, Tao confirmed Sony and Bungie are "fully dedicated to launching the title to schedule".</p>

<p>Marathon received a technical test back in October, focused on gameplay and retention. "We are in the process of analysing the performance against those KPIs," said Tao, "and as needed, we will make corrections."</p>
<p>"We are fully dedicated to launching the title to schedule," she added. "We will assume that we will launch this within this (financial) year, and that is included in the forecast."</p>
<p>That means Marathon should still be released by March 2026.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Sony reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-playstation-5-celebrates-its-fifth-birthday-with-a-nice-surprise-sales-are-up-and-ps5-shipments-have-topped-842m">PS5 shipments have now topped 84.2m units</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-sells-over-33m-units-in-one-month-which-makes-it-about-twice-as-popular-as-astro-bot">Ghost of Yotei has sold over 3.3m units</a> in its first month.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has issued updates for its family of Switch consoles.</p>
<p>With these updates, users of both the original Switch models (including Lite and OLED) and the newer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> model will now notice there are little software symbol icons on the home menu. These will allow users to differentiate between their physical cartridge games (coloured symbol) and their digital software (blue symbol). You can see how these icons look via the screenshots towards the end of this piece. </p>

<p>In addition, Nintendo Switch to Switch 2 transfers now have options to disable downloading software and album transfers. There are also a variety of other tweaks and fixes to improve your overall Switch experience.</p>
<p>You can check out an overview of each update as shared by Nintendo below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Nintendo Switch Update Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added symbols above software icons displayed on the Home Menu to indicate whether the software is a physical or a digital version.</li>
<li>Added the ability to download data for a virtual game card even if the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22433">"Use Online License" setting</a> is turned off. This option is available in the Options of a virtual game card when accessed via Virtual Game Cards from the HOME Menu.</li>
<li>The information regarding Save Data Cloud Backup that appears when launching certain software has been updated.</li>
<li>The option "Platinum Point Notification Settings" was renamed to "Nintendo Switch Online Notification Settings" in the Notifications menu in System Settings.</li>
<li>Added the ability to disable the following options when performing a system transfer from a Nintendo Switch system to a Nintendo Switch 2 system using System Transfer to Nintendo Switch 2 in System Settings: Redownload Software on Nintendo Switch 2 and Transfer Album Data</li>
<li>Added the ability to adjust the volume from the Quick Settings menu while in VR mode.</li>
<li>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 Update Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added symbols above software icons displayed on the Home Menu to indicate whether the software is a physical or a digital version.</li>
<li>When multiple software downloads are in progress, there is now an option to cancel all.</li>
<li>If a console bundle includes a software download, there will now be an icon to Receive Software. It will display if the system is connected to the internet. The icon will launch Nintendo eShop and you can proceed to the downloadable software. You can still receive the software by navigating to Nintendo eShop from the Home Menu directly.</li>
<li>When finding users to send a friend request to, the Search for Users You've Played With option under Add Friend now includes people you've interacted with in your friends' GameChat rooms.</li>
<li>Added the ability to download data for a virtual game card even if the "<a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22433">Use Online License" setting</a> is turned off. This option is available in the Options of a virtual game card when accessed via Virtual Game Cards from the Home Menu.</li>
<li>The following updates have been made for GameChat: The game will not automatically go to sleep while chatting. The option to turn off "Chat Audio Panning" has been added. Chat can continue if the console goes from TV mode (docked) to Handheld or Table mode where this scenario changes the internet from a wired connection to a wireless connection.</li>
<li>The following updates have been made in Accessibility in System Settings: When Use Text to Speech is turned on, the description of the predictive conversion character on the Japanese keyboard is now read out loud. The upper limit of Text-to-Speech Speed was increased from 300 percent to 400 percent</li>
<li>The following updates have been made in Audio in System Settings: The ability to change the audio mode for a wirelessly connected Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller was added.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>For all that technology moves at an alarming rate, there’s something hugely reassuring about hanging onto the trappings of the past. We’re suckers for that in gaming, keeping consoles tucked away in attics for their eventual glorious return to the light, usually so that our children can look at them in dismay at how awful and old they now feel, and what do you mean you need to <em>blow</em> on the <em>cartridge?</em>&nbsp;We’re also constantly looking to the next thing on the horizon, watching and waiting for the latest game, newest console or better peripheral. The Retro Fighters Battler GCPro manages to straddle those two lines, bringing the technology of the past and shoving it full of modern updates. If you’re a longtime fan of Nintendo’s consoles, this is a beautiful piece of nostalgia that’s more than ready for the present day.</p>

<p>The Retro Fighters BattlerGC Pro is bright purple, which is a good starting point, and it’s immediately recognisable as a modern take on the classic GameCube controller. It’s furthered by the large green ‘A’ button, dinky red ‘B’, kidney-shaped X and Y inputs and the bright yellow right analogue ‘C’ stick with its octagonal gate. This is a Gamecube controller… kind of.</p>


<p>Outside of the button and stick layout, the actual form sits far closer to the current Switch 2 Pro Controller than it does its older inspiration. There’s then two fully-analogue triggers, both ending in the Gamecube’s trademark digital switch, and both L and R shoulder buttons above them, and a further two ‘pro’ styled back buttons beneath the grip. The other most noticeable change is that there is a full-size D-pad, rather than the tiny one on the original Gamecube controller – I still get ghost hand cramps on rainy days from the memories of playing Capcom vs SNK 2.0 with that thing.</p>
<p>Under the hood things have changed as well. Both analogue sticks now host Hall Effect magnetic sensors, helping to keep stick drift at bay, and they’re clicky for L3 and R3 inputs, while the digital switches in each trigger are fitted with high-quality Kailh switches. Besides that, you’re getting both Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz wireless connections and a built-in rechargeable battery life of 10 hours. As an upgrade over the original GC controller, it’s immense.</p>


<p>You can actually use it with your GameCube as well. The GC wireless dongle – also bright purple – works with original hardware, so that means you can hop right into original gaming on the GameCube, Wii and Wii U – assuming you have the right era Wii, and a further USB controller dongle for your Wii U. There’s also a USB-A equipped 2.4Ghz dongle for PC and Switch play, though right now this doesn’t work with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. There you have to rely on the Bluetooth connection, but the team at Retro Fighters have said they’re actively working on updating the controller firmware for the latest console. All in all, it’s an incredibly versatile package.</p>
<p>It feels solid in the hand. The Hall Effect-equipped sticks have been tuned to feel very close to the original GC hardware, and I was immediately at home with the sensations of using the BattlerGC Pro. Both of the stick tops are also accurate, and they just feel right when you’re settling down to play Super Smash Bros.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the biggest draws right now is the steadily growing library of GameCube games through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/luigis-mansion-added-to-switch-online-for-halloween-but-wheres-the-gamecubes-scariest-game/">Switch Online</a> the Nintendo Switch 2, and there’s a true joy to experiencing The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker or F-Zero GX with something that feels like the original hardware, especially when the controls match up properly.</p>

<p>You can play whatever you want with the BattlerGC Pro, and it feels so good that you might well be tempted to. I reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, and spent a good bit of my time using the BattlerGC Pro to mash up the hordes of Hyrulean enemies. Things would have been even better if there was the ability to customise the controls – surely in 2025 that should be a standard in-game feature? – but that’s not the BattlerGC Pro’s fault.</p>
<p>I really like the triggers and great-feeling digital switches for playing FPS games, though whether you can get on with the octgonal stick gates will be entirely up to you, and it is something of a shame that you can’t swap these out for regular circular ones. Maybe we’ll get that in a future Pro Pro version.</p>
<p>There’s a purity, though, to the BattlerGC Pro, and fundamentally, that purity is really targeted towards Super Smash Bros. and original GameCube hardware. If you’re heavily into the competitive scene for Smash, the layout and build quality of the BattlerGC Pro make it practically a must-buy. Attacks feel crisp and controlled, even as you’re hammering away at that huge A button. If you’re thinking about the BattlerGC Pro for Dolphin emulation, you need to be aware that getting the digital trigger inputs to work requires a bit of tinkering, though if you’re into emulation, chances are that won’t put you off.</p>

<p>There are a few other options outside of the BattlerGC Pro if you’re looking to relive the GameCube heyday. There is, of course, the original GameCube hardware, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-controller-review/">Nintendo’s recent revised version</a> that came out for the Switch 2, but both of these options are limited to the hardware they’re designed for and lacking in the shoulder button department for modern gaming, while the BattlerGC Pro is compatible with a host of different platforms, thanks to the dual wireless dongles and Bluetooth compatibility. Outside of these, it’s worth looking at the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/10/the-nyxi-wizard-is-a-gamecube-style-switch-joy-con-with-drift-proof-analogue-sticks/">NYXI Wizard 2</a>, which retains a little more of the classic shape, and can be used docked with the Nintendo Switch as well.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo surprised us all last month when it announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> would be getting a free content update at some point in November. Well, that "some point" finally has a date — it's today!</p>
<p>Yes, Pikmin 4 was officially updated to ver. 1.1.0 this morning, adding new gameplay options like difficulty modes, the 'Field Camera' item, Decor Pikmin and more. It might not be the grand 'Switch 2 Edition' that we were all secretly hoping for (you'll find no additional perks on the new hardware here), but it <em>is</em> an excuse to dive back into a new save file, and we could all do with that.</p>
<p>Besides these content additions, the update also includes new control options, bonus <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pikmin_bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a> connectivity, and a handful of bug fixes. The patch has even rolled out to the game's free demo, so you can see some of these newbies in action without having to spend a penny.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/62986/~/how-to-update-pikmin-4">Nintendo Support website</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Pikmin 4 ver. 1.1.0 (11th November 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Newly Added Gameplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now choose from three different activity levels for creatures: Relaxed, Normal, and Fierce.
<ul>
<li>This can be changed at any time from Settings in Options (- Button).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now take pictures with the “Field Camera” item and decorate them with stamps and frames.
<ul>
<li>The Field Camera is added to your bag on the morning of day 2.</li>
<li>If resuming save data from before the software is updated, it will be added to your bag when you return to the Rescue Command Post and morning arrives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>”Decor Pikmin” will now appear in the story.
<ul>
<li>To have Decor Pikmin join your squad, after rescuing the Rescue Corps Ranger Dingo, use the Field Camera to take pictures of a Decor Pikmin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By sharing the data of Decor Pikmin who have joined your squad in the full version of Pikmin 4 with the smart device application Pikmin Bloom, you can also get seedlings for those same Decor Pikmin in Pikmin Bloom.
<ul>
<li>You can send the Nintendo Account ID and discovered Decor Pikmin data when you finish exploration on the day the Decor Pikmin was discovered.</li>
<li>The Nintendo Account must be the same between the user playing Pikmin 4 and the one playing Pikmin Bloom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now use “Roll Over” in which you begin another playthrough, carrying over some of the save data on a file that has cleared the story.
<ul>
<li>With save data present that has cleared the story, select an empty Rescue Database on the file selection screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have ever reached the morning of day 2 in the story, you may skip that introduction when playing again from the beginning.
<ul>
<li>You begin from exploration day 2 in which you head for Sun-Speckled Terrace after creating an ID Badge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Newly Added Controls</strong></p>
<p>The following control settings have been added to Settings in the Options menu (- Button).</p>
<ul>
<li>You may switch between enabling and disabling Auto Target Lock for Cursor.</li>
<li>You may select either the cursor or the player avatar as the center point of the whistle.
<ul>
<li>This is set to “Player Avatar” when you begin with the activity level set to “Relaxed,” but this may be changed at any time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may now select either “Normal” or “Precise” for the speed of the arrow that appears when you hold down X to aim. Setting this to “Precise” will make it easier to adjust the direction of the Pikmin’s Charge and Oatchi’s Rush.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed other issues to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: A patch with the same changes has also been distributed for the Pikmin 4 demo (Ver. 1.1.0). The demo version cannot link to the Pikmin Bloom smart device application.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Exclusive news.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> has sold 3.3 million copies in its first month on sale, Sony has confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of its latest financial results, Sony said Sucker Punch’s PlayStation 5-exclusive action adventure sold 3.3 million units in the 32 days since going on sale on October 2 — so sales up to and including November 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony announced the figure without any commentary, so it’s hard to know whether the company is happy with the result. However, there is a great deal of context we can add that helps us paint a picture of Ghost of Yotei’s commercial success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first comparison we should make is to its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima. It sold 2.4 million copies in its first three days after going on sale exclusively on PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, then hit 5 million after 118 days (just shy of four months). It’s now up to 13 million copies sold, including sales of the PC and PS5 Director’s Cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it’s worth remembering that while we don’t have a figure for a comparable period of sales, it looks like Ghost of Yotei is selling about as well as Ghost of Tsushima before it, a suggestion backed up by sales data <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yoteis-us-launch-was-perfectly-fine-not-amazing-not-bad-says-analyst-but-the-true-test-will-be-in-the-months-ahead">from the U.S.</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sales-of-ps5-exclusive-ghost-of-yotei-in-line-with-ghost-of-tsushima-in-europe-new-data-reveals">across Europe</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is that good enough? We need to consider that Ghost of Tsushima came out on the PS4, which in the summer of 2020 had a much bigger install base than the PS5 does today, and amid the stay-at-home gaming boom fueled by lockdowns. Ghost of Yotei also sold for $70, which means its dollar sales are greater compared to the cheaper Ghost of Tsushima, whose standard edition launched at $60.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of each release differs also in that Ghost of Tsushima came out in the summer, and Ghost of Yotei came out in the fall. Yotei has the crucial holiday season coming soon, and it will surely be a popular pick for those buying a PS5 for the first time or upgrading to the PS5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out at some point in 2026, which will undoubtedly give Ghost of Yotei a shot in the arm next year. And we all know that Ghost of Yotei, like Ghost of Tsushima before it, will eventually launch on PC in Director’s Cut form. Perhaps there will even be a PS6 version, whenever that console rolls around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, Ghost of Yotei has some way to go before it matches the total sales figure of its predecessor, but is has plenty of opportunity to catch up. And, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3wthi4twc2u" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Circana’s Mat Piscatella said last month</a>, its launch sales were “perfectly fine... Not amazing, not bad.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what’s next from developer Sucker Punch, in an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>, co-founder and studio head, Brian Fleming, said the studio will decide its next project once Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out. But, he suggested, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-we-were-good-at-juggling-four-projects-yeah-wed-have-a-remaster-ghost-of-yotei-dev-sucker-punch-says-it-will-remain-a-single-project-studio"><u>don’t expect a flurry of games from the relatively lean developer — it’s one project at a time</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review"><u>Ghost of Yotei review</u></a>.
