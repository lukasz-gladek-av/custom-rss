            <p>Xbox has announced a release date for Ara: History Untold.</p>
<p>The upcoming turn-based historical strategy title is set to launch on 24th September. On its debut, it will be available for Windows PC and Steam. The Xbox published title will arrive on day one for PC Game Pass, as well.</p>
<p>In addition, president of developer Oxide Games Marc Meyer and Head of Ara for Xbox Game Studios Brian Stone have shared more about what players can expect on the game's release later this year.</p>

<p>The duo showcased the game during an episode of the Official Xbox Podcast with an accompanying <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/12/ara-history-untold-release-date-multiplayer-details/">blog post</a>, where they spoke about leaders and the game's "living" map. They also spoke more on the Ara: History Untold multiplayer, with Oxide describing its gameplay as "Simultaneous Turns".</p>
<p>"The way that works is you submit your actions, and everyone else in the world submits their actions at the same time, and then they all get resolved together," Meyer explained. "It's not a situation where if you go first, you get to get the claim; the person who goes second doesn't get the claim. In this model, everyone goes at the same time. So, in multiplayer you really have a fair chance at everything."</p>
<p>Meyer said the team wanted to make sure it "removed all the barriers for multiplayer", meaning players will be able to "jump in and out of as many games as [they] want".</p>
<p>Said Meyer: "You can take your turn when you have time and wait until it gets submitted. If your friend decides he doesn't want to play anymore, an AI can come in and take over for him, it doesn't mean the end of your entire world if you're playing online and you don't want to do that, you can stop, and you don't have to worry about destroying the game for everyone else who's playing."</p>
<p>You can check out the full podcast via the video below. Here, the hosts also spoke more on Age of Mythology: Retold, which was announced earlier this week.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-playstation-handheld-capable-of-running-ps4-games-natively-would-be-very-hard-to-achieve.900192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ps4-games-natively/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A PlayStation handheld console capable of running PS4 games natively would be very hard to achieve, mostly due to power draw and memory bandwidth, among other reasons.</p>
<p>Replying to a fan question regarding the rumored handheld, which is said to be in the works, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R41x68m1GXc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how a portable console capable of running PlayStation 4 games natively would be very hard to achieve due to power draw and the massive memory bandwidth of the system, 176 GB/s. In addition, such a portable system would require the use of a Jaguar CPU for compatibility, and there's nothing in the mobile space capable of providing these specs to run PS4 games natively.</p>
<p>A PlayStation handheld based on modern AMD architectures, however, could definitely run PS4 games, but they would have to be ported, which would significantly make the game library smaller. Such a system, however, would have no trouble running scaled-back PlayStation 5 games, taking a page from the Steam Deck and another modern handheld system that can run current AAA games by dropping settings and resolution. Still, Digital Foundry found the idea of a new handheld system from Sony to be a very good one, considering how well the remote play-focused PlayStation Portal sold worldwide.</p>
<p><iframe title="Could Sony Make A PS4-Compatible Portable?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R41x68m1GXc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As already mentioned, a PlayStation handheld is said to be in <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-handheld-amd-18-cus-1-8-ghz-gpu/">early development</a> by Sony. Powered by a custom AMD APU, this handheld is currently in the High Level Design Phase, meaning it is at least two years from release and has yet to be greenlit. Specs have yet to be finalized a swell, but it is said the system will use 18 CUs, and its GPU will likely run at 1.8 GHz or slower due to the PlayStation 5's variable clock speeds.</p>
<p>Following the PlayStation Vita, which could have been much more successful with better support thanks to its great hardware at the time, Sony left the handheld market, only to return to it somewhat with the aforementioned PlayStation Portal. You can learn more about the system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/">review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/todays-helldivers-2-patch-is-obscenely-large-and-fans-are-loving-it/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=todays-helldivers-2-patch-is-obscenely-large-and-fans-are-loving-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="472" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">To call the latest <em>Helldivers 2</em> patch big is an understatement. Even calling it chunky doesn’t feel apt enough, with the patch notes going into explicit detail on various balancing updates to weapons and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-stratagem-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stratagems</a>, bug fixes, and the supply lines between planets are actually visible now. While Patch 01.000.400 has only launched today, early responses from fans suggest Arrowhead is taking things in the right direction, with some calling it a big win for players.</p> <p data-characters="779" data-current-count="779" data-injectable="true">I’m not going to cover the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full patch notes</a> because, again, there’s simply too much, but one of Arrowhead’s key goals was to better balance the Stratagems. As such, some of the weaker options have received buffs to make them more viable. For instance, the Orbital Precision Strike has had both its call time and cooldown reduced, making it easier to use against moving targets. A wide array of regular weapons have seen buff too, like the Heavy Machine Gun. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/5998312279129319530?l=english**" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a separate blog post</a> detailing the rationale behind all the Stratagem and weapon adjustments, chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt explains how the Heavy Machine Gun “failed to deliver on the fantasy,” which is why its rate of fire has been lowered and it deals more damage than before.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="811" data-injectable="true">Perhaps one of the most welcome changes is the inclusion of visible supply lines. Despite being an important mechanic that dictate which planets players can actually go to, you initially couldn’t see them. Arrowhead says this was to avoid the Galactic War map getting too cluttered, but “based on the feedback from our community we have made an implementation showing them on the map. This solution tries to maintain the general readability while still exposing the system to players in game.”</p>
 <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">Initial responses from players appear to be mostly positive. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/patch_01000400/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this Reddit thread</a> discussing the patch notes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/comment/l8ef34g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">many fans</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/comment/l8effrw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">are frankly elated</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/comment/l8efap0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with some of the changes</a>, saying Arrowhead “cooked” with this update. “We asked them to cook and they gave us a full buffet,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/comment/l8ehv93/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote one player</a>, highlighting the various buffs and the implementation of fixes suggested by the community.</p> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="768" data-injectable="true">Several are also thrilled with the changes made to the Orbital Gatling Barrage Stratagem, which now has a 70 second cooldown (it used to be 80 seconds), a 25% increased fire rate, and increased armour penetration. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/comment/l8eh6bu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fans who frequently</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/comment/l8ej6ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">used this Stratagem</a> to begin with are happy with the improvements, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/comment/l8el9n0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a couple of others</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/comment/l8ei7sn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">intend on using it for themselves</a> from now on.</p>
 <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="false">There are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/comment/l8ehdoz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">some who have complained</a> about how the FAF-14 Spear Stratagem has been affected. It was in need of a fix to improve its aiming and while the patch has done exactly that, it unfortunately can no longer target Automatic Spawners. Arrowhead has stressed this was unintentional and will be fixed, but this is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1deunkd/comment/l8ehhm0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a sticking point for a handful of players</a>, though they appear to be the minority. On the whole, while there are definitely more fixes required, this patch seems like it’s done almost everything right in keeping the player-base happy.</p>

            <p>
Sonic Dream Team has received another update, adding additional levels and an endgame mission.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-3d-platformer-sonic-dream-team-announced-by-sega">Apple Arcade exclusive was released in December last year</a>, but developer Hardlight has continued to update the game ever since.
</p>
<p>
Previous updates added the Sweet Dreams Zones as a bonus for completing the main adventure. This new update adds two new Acts to the zone, with new level features and new takes on missions.

<p>

Further, a new endgame mission has been added called Bittersweet Way, available for players who collect all Dream Orbs and Moons. It promises to be the most challenging level so far.
</p>
<p>
New achievements and competitive rankings have also been added alongside these new levels, plus collectible music tracks are unlocked via hidden musical notes across the game's levels.
</p>
<p>
Sonic fans should absolutely get on Sonic Dream Team, despite it being a mobile game. It comes highly recommended as a full 3D Sonic adventure with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-dream-team-puts-players-in-exhilarating-flow-state-says-studio-head">great skatepark-esque level design</a> and a brilliant soundtrack.
</p>
<p>
It's playable across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro.

            <p>
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Konami's forthcoming remake, will have a visual filter to recreate the look of the original game.
</p>
<p>
On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw&amp;rco=1">Xbox podcast</a>, producer Noriaka Okamura discussed more about the game and confirmed the Legacy control style "applies a visual filter to more faithfully recreate the screen look of the original game".
</p>
<p>
Konami has since confirmed to Eurogamer this visual filter can be applied to either control style, meaning players can use modernised controls with the classic filter. More information is expected soon.

<p>

As Metal Gear Solid fan account Perfect Stealth noted on X, this visual filter was hinted at on the Konami website with a short clip for the Legacy Style controls.

<p>
While the development team at Konami is using Unreal Engine 5 for high-fidelity graphics (as discussed on the Xbox podcast), fans have criticised the visuals for lacking the same colour palette and tone as the original.
</p>
<p>
One thread on X uses gifs to directly compare the remake with the original to see the difference.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
But is a visual filter enough? While it certainly adds a certain warmth to the graphics, it's unclear if other visual effects used as an artistic choice will be included.
</p>
<p>
In a video from Konami this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-leaks-as-producer-wants-fans-to-hold-team-to-account">Okamura asked fans to hold the team to account</a>.

</p>
<p>
"We want the players to be able to judge for themselves whether this new team is right for the job of keeping Metal Gear going," he said. "So please, keep watching, and keep us honest."
</p>
<p>
The visual filter is certainly a welcome addition, but I've no doubt passionate fans will continue to share their thoughts.

<p>If you don’t want to go through the hassle of joining and downloading the demo based on the scant details from the trailer, YouTuber ENFANT TERRIBLE has uploaded an entire 50 minute session. I have no idea who they are, though, so while I’m sure they’re lovely, don’t come to me if it turns out they barbecue babies for fun or something.</p>

<p>The game looks to be stuffed with creepy pasta and conspiracy theory-esque paranormal shenanigans. Back when the game was called Hornet, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-cyberpunk-and-bioshock-devs-reveal-eerie-post-apocalyptic-open-world-shooter-hornet">Edwin wrote</a> about its ARG marketing campaign, which included a ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/LJ15D9r_awQ">found footage</a>’ video and a <a href="https://www.anomaleaks.net/">mock conspiracy theory</a> website named AnomaLeaks. I must say, I do enjoy this sort of thing. Does anyone remember those choose your adventure books you’d get with audio tapes and other paraphernalia where you’d have to piece the story together? There was a semi-famous one with werewolves, I believe.</p>
<p>Phantom Line does not, at time of writing, appear to feature werewolves, and looks to be going more for slow build, exploration, horror-with-mates vibes. But what it lacks in big dogs, it makes up for in pedigree. The line-up at Antistatic include former Cyberpunk 2077 writer Lukasz Ludkowski and Kris Teper, former Bioshock series lead environment artist. I’ve also just noticed they’ve described the studio as "committed to…the immersive sim genre.” And now I’m suddenly extremely interested, mark for piling crates on top of each other that I am.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-story-will-show-the-coalitions-tech-the-best-creative-director-says-will-be-the-best-f-gears-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to The Coalition's Matt Searcy, the story of the upcoming Gears of War E-Day will best show the tech that the team has been working on.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement of E-Day</a> during the Xbox Showcase last week came as a surprise to many - most of us didn't see a prequel title coming following the events of Gears 5. The trailer that Microsoft and developer The Coalition debuted during the showcase was impressive, to say the least, and it was all in-game as well. Of course, we don't know whether the footage was shown running on PC or Xbox Series, but the trailer was, without a doubt, stunning. Interestingly enough, some months back, reputable insider Nate Najda, mostly known as shinobi602, already <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-might-appear-at-xbox-showcase-people-arent-ready-for-how-good-it-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that people would be impressed with what The Coalition would show off with the next Gears.</p>
<p>As said, many didn't expect a sequel from The Coalition, but according to the studio's Creative Director Matt Searcy, the tech that the team had been working on, will best come into its own via E-day's story. "Making games is really hard,” the Creative Director told Console Creatures in a recent interview. “There’s a lot of investment that you do. And when you find the idea that lit us up at this moment, even if you’re talking about your strategies and games and trilogies and what you could do or not do. You grab that lightning in a bottle. That’s the game everybody is hyped about. We’re gonna make that game.</p>
<p>He continued, "Because it’s gonna be the best fucking <em>Gears</em> game everybody’s ever played, if we make that one. We had this technology that we were working on. This is the story that’s gonna showcase it the best. I think it’s really, at the end of the day, it’s about, again, it’s not Nicole and I making this call. There’s a whole studio of people that are invested in this idea. And you go, “Hell yeah, let’s do that then."</p>
<p>Whether Gears of War E-Day will indeed turn out to be the best Gears game to date remains to be seen (after all, that's what developers always say about their upcoming titles), but going by the game's trailer, E-Day has great potential.</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day is coming to Xbox Series and PC on a yet-to-be-announced date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/13/helldivers-2-patch-1-000-400-is-a-big-buffing-balance-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s time for a big balance patch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> with update 1.000.400. Will Arrowhead manage to walk the tightrope of shifting the game’s weapon, Strategem and enemy power around? Or will the community hate it merely for the fact that things have changed and the go-to loadouts aren’t quite as effective anymore?</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/">accompanying explainer post</a>, Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt said, “First, I want to thank you, the community, for clearly voicing your opinions and concerns for the balance and fun of the game. […] With these balance changes we wanted to buff up some of the weaker stratagems to make them more viable and add more opportunity for variety in loadouts. We also changed a few to make them more consistent, but the goal was to keep a similar or higher power level.”</p>


<p>This means that various Sentry turrets are getting improvements to power and durability, orbital strikes are being made better for moving targets, while the Eruptor’s shrapnel removal is being compensated for with higher damage.</p>
<p>There’s also some functional changes, so supply lines and attack origins are now visible in the Galactic War, and you can create invite-only lobbies.</p>
<p>Here’s the full Helldivers 1.000.400 patch notes:</p>

*Some enemies have durable body parts that receive only a portion of base damage from projectiles</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Updated Recoil stance modifiers:</strong> We made changes to the recoil stance modifiers to make them more consistent and also reward being prone more. Almost all of them will improve the recoil and only a two have been made worse (and only by 10%).<br>
See the blogpost for a more detailed description.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01J08E30YDPTR29HECYMT2QD96"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed operation modifier AA-Defenses: Reducing the stratagem slots by 1
<ul>
<li>We want to look over the operation modifiers in the future. Right now there are too few of them which become repetitive and the ones we have do not create variety or promote different playstyles. For now, we removed this one because it only encourages the players to bring the best stratagems and does not promote variety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disabled the Retrieve Essential Personnel defend event mission for the time being
<ul>
<li>This is to give the mission the proper attention and care that it deserves as it is now deemed not fun enough or performing as we want it to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Super Samples
<ul>
<li>Super samples now spawn on difficulty 6. The reason for this change is that we feel that their existence only on difficulty 7+ forced some players to play the game on a harder difficulty than they wanted to comfortably play on. We do however still want a gating of them but a less punishing one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The SEAF Artillery stratagem is no longer blocked by stratagem jammers or Ion Storms, and is available after the mission timer ends and the destroyer leaves close orbit.</li>
<li>Enemies in melee range of the gates in the Evacuate High-Value Assets mission will now attack it more consistently.</li>
<li>Added the ability to chat from in-game menus and mission loading screen.</li>
<li>Updated some first person crosshairs to improve readability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Invite-Only lobbies are now supported</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Armors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New armor passive Peak Physique (+50% melee damage, +30% weapon ergonomics)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Planets &amp; Hazards</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spike Plant
<ul>
<li>The spike plant that appears on certain planets has been reworked.</li>
<li>No longer causes bleed or stamina drain if hit by the plant explosion or spikes.</li>
<li>Now “pops” three times sending spikes everywhere, dealing increased damage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fire Tornados
<ul>
<li>Fire tornados have had their behavior changed, they should no longer feel like they actively respond to player movement, and should move more randomly.</li>
<li>While a fire tornado storm takes place, enemy vision is reduced. Player vision is unaffected.
<ul>
<li>Fire tornados being more random should result in more variance in situations players find themselves in. Tornados are significantly less likely to pile up and overlap on extraction points or objectives, and will generally be a bit easier to deal with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tremors
<ul>
<li>Tremors have had their spawning tweaked to be slightly more random.</li>
<li>Tremors have had their epicenter size and effect range increased.
<ul>
<li>These changes should result in more situations where enemies away from the player get stunned, as well as reducing how consistently the player has a tremor occur next to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Visibility
<ul>
<li>A lot of planets have had their fog amounts tweaked to be a bit less harsh and dense, to provide less fatigue from constantly fighting on planets with bad visibility. We still intend there to be foggy planets with worse visibility, but the balance was a bit off.
<ul>
<li>Desert planets such as Erata Prime, Chort Bay, Hellmire, and similar.</li>
<li>Highlands planets such as Varylia 5, Matar Bay, Oshaune, and similar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Artificial light sources have had their intensity rebalanced and reduced across the board to fix situations of lights completely blinding the player.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unexploded Hellbomb
<ul>
<li>The unexploded malfunctioning hellbombs that can sometimes be found on planets will now explode immediately if hit with strong explosions or heavy weaponry. They will still have the same delay if hit by small arms fire or weaker attacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Vegetation
<ul>
<li>Vegetation that’s large enough to slow the player now has an extra function. When inside the vegetation helldivers will be harder to detect, reducing their detection range by enemies. This effect stacks with other detection reducing effects such as nighttime, being crouched or prone, or things such as the scout armor passive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ion Storms
<ul>
<li>Added additional VFX for Ion Storms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enemies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Acid effect
<ul>
<li>The acid effect applied by hunters, bug mines, etc. now allows you to sprint while under the effect and slows you by 30% instead of 50%. Duration has been increased from 3 to 4 seconds. These changes are intended to make it less punishing for players to be slowed while fighting the Terminids, This allows us to use it in more places without making the experience very punishing, for example the Bile Spewers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Armored enemy balance
<ul>
<li>We have toned down the amount of heavily armored enemies like Bile Titans, Chargers on higher difficulties and instead spawn more hordes of smaller enemies, the difference should be quite noticeable and the amount should be at least 30% less than before during bug breaches. We have also toned down slightly how many Hulks that spawn for the Automatons. Our intent is to ease up on the demand of anti-tank weapons and by having more of the other enemies give a better incentive for the group to bring stratagems and weapons that take care of hordes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Patrols
<ul>
<li>Patrol spawning is now back to how it worked before patch 01.000.300 with some slight tweaks so that the levels are less empty if you are far away from important locations with enemy presence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Stunning
<ul>
<li>Medium and large sized enemies now don’t get stunned as easily. This will not affect the stratagems that stun, and will mostly just affect how easily the Pummeler can stun larger enemies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Terminids</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bile Spewers &amp; Nursing Spewers
<ul>
<li>Spewers will now get slowed if they lose their legs.</li>
<li>Spewer puke now applies the acid effect.</li>
<li>Spewer puke now can only damage helldivers up to 4 times per second and the helldiver cannot take damage multiple times from the same projectile. This should reduce instances where you are instantly killed by it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bile Titan
<ul>
<li>The Bile Titan’s head is slightly less durable against weaker anti-tank weapons. It’s not a large change, and will mostly matter for weapons like the railgun.</li>
<li>The Bile Titan’s puke can now only damage the helldiver 4 times per second and the helldiver cannot take damage multiple times from the same projectile. The damage is still very deadly so running through their puke is not recommended. Their puke now also has a bigger spread.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Charger Behemoth
<ul>
<li>The Charger Behemoth is now joining the battle on higher difficulties, it can now also take more damage than before. This enables us to spawn fewer chargers but still retain the difficulty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Chargers
<ul>
<li>Will now only show bleedout effects from the body if the bleedout state has started. It can still show bleedout effects from the mouth without having started the bleedout state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Automatons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hulk Scorcher
<ul>
<li>The Hulk’s flamethrower now does less damage and cannot damage helldivers more than 4 times per second. In addition, the helldiver cannot be damaged multiple times by the same flame projectile. This should reduce instances where you are instantly killed by it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Automaton Tanks
<ul>
<li>The Tank armor value on the front has been lowered to be the same as the non-vent sections on the rear of the tank. The intent was initially that it was supposed to be more armored in the front, but the visual language did not show that.</li>
<li>The vents on the back of the Tanks turret still has the same armor value as before, but will check for explosion directions correctly now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The damage of exploding automaton jump packs has been decreased by 50%, it will still set you on fire though.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Galactic War</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introducing Supply Lines &amp; Origin of Attacks:</strong></p>
<p>Supply lines were previously not shown on the Galactic War map to reduce clutter and improve readability. However based on the feedback from our community we have made an implementation showing them on the map. This solution tries to maintain the general readability while still exposing the system to players in game.</p>
<p>You will now also be able to see which planet an attack is originating from, potentially allowing for the community to stop the attack at its source.</p>
<p>We have also updated visuals in the sector and planet info pop-ups.</p>
<h2 id="h_01J08E30YDHXSCEXCWY0BE8K4Y"><strong>Fixes</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The FAF-14 Spear targeting has been reworked and should now function much better. However it has lost the ability to target Automaton spawners, this is not intended and will be fixed in the future.</li>
<li>Intense Heat and Extreme Cold environmental modifiers will now affect the Quasar Cannon’s reload speed and will show correctly in the HUD.
<ul>
<li>Reload speed on Cold planets -2.5 sec</li>
<li>Reload speed on Hot planets +2.5 sec</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The radar pulse that detects enemies on the mini-map is now visible.</li>
<li>Most of Automatons weapons have now gotten tighter limits to how much the projectile they shoot can deviate from its weapons muzzle angle. What this means is that situations where devastators shoot sideways and similar should be fixed.</li>
<li>The weapons of the Exosuits are now allowed small adjustments in the angle they fire their projectiles versus their muzzle angle. This should make their weapons more accurate.</li>
<li>Ballistic shield now collides with grenades.</li>
<li>The unblock button should no longer disappear from the social menu.</li>
<li>Blocked players can no longer join the blockers lobby through recent players.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where enemies killed, missions played, and missions completed stats would not be properly displayed in armory.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the player can throw an unlimited amount of grenades by pressing the “Quick grenade” button right after closing the Stratagem menu.
<ul>
<li>Helldiver now also switches to the last active weapon when out of grenades, fixing the issue where they would be holding a stratagem ball without the stratagem menu being open.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed some text overlap in various locations.</li>
<li>The burning effect applied to the player when a combat walker dies is now a normal burn. The intent is that you should be able to escape it alive. But you will be on fire so hit the ground!</li>
<li>The extraction shuttle can no longer take damage preventing extraction. New high grade materials directly from Super Earth R&amp;D have been utilized.</li>
<li>On PC you can now navigate the super credits menu with “WASD” keys</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sample count in missions were incorrectly displayed</li>
<li>Levels no longer generate with blocked areas preventing player progression.</li>
<li>Your Ships bridge is no longer cast in perpetual shadow.</li>
<li>Reduced situations where blue stratagems would bounce when placed next to the detector tower.</li>
<li>The warbond menu now displays correct emote &amp; victory poses in the thumbnail.</li>
<li>War Medals cap is now displayed in the UI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Helldivers armor could appear invisible for other players.</li>
<li>Refined player reporting UI.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Helldivers could be launched into the air if close to a Bile Titan or Factory Strider corpse.</li>
<li>Fix for Factory Strider sometimes spawned an extra model after being destroyed.</li>
<li>Reduced situations where helldivers could spontaneously die while walking into seemingly walkable valleys on some planets.</li>
<li>Fixed rare issue on arctic planets where players could spontaneously die close to large bodies of water.</li>
<li>Fixed Pelican-1 sometimes leaving immediately after any player gets onboard.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where helldiver could get stuck in grenade idle state after throwing grenades</li>
<li>Fix Superior Packing Methodology not working for other peers.</li>
<li>Recent Players list will now include hot-joining players.</li>
<li>Relaxed disconnection policy for PC users.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where previous sessions’ player names might not be saved correctly when restarting.</li>
<li>Defend event attack origin now visualized when hovering the planet with the defend event or the attack origin planet.</li>
<li>Implemented outlines for previously poorly readable texts.</li>
</ul>

            <p>
Fans of the 1993 film Jurassic Park will be able to revisit many locations from Isla Nublar on Jurassic Park: Survival's release, but also some previously unseen spots.
</p>
<p>
Jurassic Park: Survival was announced at last year's Game Awards. It's a single-player action-adventure coming from Saber Interactive in partnership with Universal, and will take place the day after the events of the film. 
</p>
<p>
The announcement trailer, which you can see for yourself below, showed us poor scientist Dr. Maya Joshi running from the now-destroyed visitor centre before coming face-to-face with a mighty T-Rex. Other than this brief tease, further details were quite sparse.

</figure>
<p>
Now, however, the Jurassic Park: Survival team has revealed a few more tit-bits about the upcoming game. Sharing details with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-fresh-jurassic-park-survival-details-revealed-including-new-locations-and-more">IGN</a>, Universal Products and Experiences executive producer John Melchior and Saber Interactive creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick said the team has been "working with all our stakeholders on what the island would have looked like after the events of the film".
</p>
<p>
Melchior said this will include locales such as the Visitor Centre, but also other areas the film didn't include. "Those on the island were supposed to be there overnight, so what does that mean? What would they have seen and where would they have stayed if everything went according to plan? That is where we are starting," he said. "One thing is certain - the island is as much a part of the story as the characters and dinosaurs."
</p>
<p>
Hollis-Leick said players will have to negotiate  "different types of terrain" on Isla Nublar, with many of them being quite challenging. "The player will need to use caution and planning in some cases, checking routes in advance," he said. 
</p>
<p>
"There will also be times when the player will need to move very carefully through an environment to avoid the attention of certain predators. Maya, the main character, is neither superhuman nor an action hero. There are real risks for her around every corner and the player will need to use a mixture of intelligence, grit and patience to survive the island's many challenges."
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, while we only saw Maya in the announcement trailer, the Jurassic Park: Survivor developers said there will be other characters introduced on the game's release, as well as perhaps some new 'special' dinos. As Melchior noted: "Life finds a way..."
</p>
<p>
Jurassic Park: Survivor does not have a release date yet, although we know it won't be out this year. When it does ultimately launch, it will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-your-flares-jurassic-park-survival-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc">coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.

            <p>
Mental Salvo describes itself as having an "infinite open world" in which you can do so many things, "they're impossible to list". Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I'd be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a "top down art adventure with light RPG elements" that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Here are some things that might tumble out of it: opinionated cats. A gun that shoots words. Unspecified things that depend upon the time of day. Concentric rings of doors. A trolley seemingly adapted from the widespread internet sketch of the trolley problem. A large... deer... thing? Some events or entities can't be seen, but will still respond to your presence. Your objective, amid all this, is to travel far enough away from spawn to find "something special". If the cats and trolleys grow overwhelming, you can always make your character's head explode to reset the simulation.
</p>
<p>
Mental Salvo is the first in a series of "Figmental" games from developer Pawel Pachniewski, whose other works include the Bennet Foddy-esque platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2164500/99_Fails/">99 Fails</a>, which I wrote about for little-known RPS offshoot PCGamer back in the day. It should be noted that Pachniewski has a research interest in modern generative AI software, but his interest appears to be more "we can do absurdist philosophical experiments with these tools" than "we can use these tools to optimise/reposition 10 percent of our art department into the gutter". Here's a cut from a <a href="https://x.com/pwlot/status/1794699445080088813">twittering</a> digging into Mental Salvo's origins:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
It's part hand-crafted and part procedural, but the procedural part is using very advanced AI (let's just say, that there is a meta-agent that inventso [sic] some of the procedures on the fly, but there's much more to it) which means not even I can predict what's in it. Semantically though and with respect to what I put in, it's a visceral, emotional, but also cerebral experience.. where you can endlessly explore topics and indulge in experiences...from my consciousness stream, work, from the world, and more. It's also part parody, part commentary,... on existence, meaning, the world, gaming, AI, consciousness.. and beyond. I'm really excited about it as I have prototyped and worked on several iterations and candidates of various games from this series since 2013(!), including a trip generator of sorts (probably next), but due to various life circumstances and other projects, I abandoned them. Not this time. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Mental Salvo is technically out in August, though I guess you could argue that being infinite, it has always existed. Questions of tense mean nothing to Mental Salvo. What we call 'spacetime' is but an outspoken feline scurrying across the grinning face of its quantum immensity. Anyway, if you dig the purgatorial whitespace aesthetics here but need a bit more structure, I heartily recommend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sixty-four-is-a-very-elegant-abstract-factory-sim-with-sinister-depths">Sixty Four</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phantom-blade-zero-is-not-a-soulslike-game-demo-won%E2%80%99t-release-anytime-soon.900153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Phantom Blade Zero, the impressive Unreal Engine 5-powered action RPG in development by S-Game recently showed off during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-trailer-summer-game-fest-2024/">Summer Game Fest 2024 show</a>, is not a Soulslike game, although the experience has been somewhat influenced by FromSoftware's series.</p>
<p>Game Director Soulframe provided a development update earlier this week on<a href="https://x.com/pbzero_official/status/1800646449690034320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1800646449690034320%7Ctwgr%5Ed78764866fc6c2aa52b4ce8eb3b7754840f196fd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmultiplayer.it%2Fnotizie%2Fphantom-blade-zero-non-sara-un-soulslike-e-altri-dettagli-dagli-sviluppatori.html"> X/Twitter</a>, revealing how, as those who had the chance to try out the SGF24 demo surely noticed, the game is not a Soulslike, as that was never the plan. The developer wanted to create "combo-driven, heart-pumping combat" that was hectic, rewarding, and exhilarating, which is exactly the opposite of the combat featured in games inspired by FromSoftware's games. The Soulslike inspiration for Phantom Blade Zero is limited to map design, as the game's locations will feature multiple paths, hidden nooks, and so on. The game will also feature difficulty options, and defeated enemies won't respawn after dying or interacting with checkpoints. Unfortunately, it will be a while until the vast majority of players will be able to try out this Phantom Blade Zero, as the demo available during Summer Game Fest 2024 is not ready for a wider release due to technical issues.</p>
<p>In the new update, the Phantom Blade Zero game director also reiterated how the game is not a PlayStation 5 exclusive, as the studio has no deal in place with Sony. As such, it will also be released on PC.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero launches on PlayStation 5 and PC on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date. You can learn more about this impressive game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-qa-dev-says-bosses-are-the-games-highlights-confirms-hardware-ray-tracing-ps5-specs/">interview</a> with Soulframe from last year.</p>

            <p>
FragPunk, the new hero shooter revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase earlier this week, will have a closed alpha test on Steam at the end of the month.
</p>
<p>
The five-versus-five free-to-play online shooter is vibrantly stylised with a card-based twist, where players include shard cards in their loadout to modify the rules of gameplay.
</p>
<p>
News of the alpha comes alongside an extended trailer you can watch below.

<p>
Developer Bad Guitar boasts FragPunk is "endlessly replayable" thanks to its selection of heroes, weapons and maps, but mainly its shard cards.
</p>
<p>
The alpha test will include 70 of the shard cards, which as per the trailer include flipping the world upside down, dragon's breath to power up weapons, adding an electrifying chain reaction to bullets, slicing projectiles as a blade master, sprouting long grass or strange plants, giving opponents a big head for easier kills, and more.
</p>
<p>
There will also be 10 playable heroes with unique abilities, four playable maps, and 15 weapons to wield in the alpha test.
</p>
<p>
The alpha test will run from 27th June until 1st July, with a focus on North America. Registration is open on the <a href="https://www.fragpunk.com/#/">game's website</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943650/FragPunk/">Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
FragPunk is set for full release in 2025 across Xbox Series X/S and PC, so this alpha test provides a very early look.

            <p>
Sony is rolling out the ability to join Discord calls from your PlayStation 5 without relying on the service's PC or mobile apps.
</p>
<p>
This means you can now use the Discord tab in the PS5 Control Center to access a Discord server or DM group directly, and from there pick from the available voice channels to join. 
</p>
<p>
You might not see the option available today - Sony says it is rolling out first in Japan, before Europe, Australia/New Zealand, the Middle East and finally the Americas in the coming weeks. See how it all looks in the video below:

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-voice-chat-now-available-on-playstation-5">PlayStation initially added Discord integration a year ago</a>, though until now it hasn't been a seamless process - requiring you to transfer calls over from the separate Discord app.</p>
<p>
One other new feature coming to PS5 from this week is the ability to share your PSN profile to quickly connect with others. You can generate a shareable link from your console or the PlayStation App and then send it to a friend via any other messaging service.
</p>
<p>
It's been a busy time for PlayStation, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-is-a-perfect-match-a-breezy-light-hearted-approach-the-series-has-perhaps-always-needed">recently shown off Lego Horizon Adventures for the first time</a> - a bold new take on its blockbuster franchise that's also coming to Nintendo Switch.

        <p>“We believe Valve Corporation has been unfairly shutting out competition for PC games”</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>In what is possibly the biggest scandal the UK has seen since the last time the price of Freddos went up, a digital rights campaigner is suing Valve for £656m in compensation, accusing the company of overcharging and anti-competitive behaviour. The accompanying <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/">website</a> describes the collective action claim as a “ground-breaking legal action,” which is very gamer of them. 16 times the litigation, etc.</p>

<p>“Valve Corporation faces a £656 million collective action claim for overcharging 14 million PC gamers and abusing its dominant position in the UK,” reads the website. “We believe Valve Corporation has been unfairly shutting out competition for PC games and in-game content, which has meant that UK customers have paid too much for these products,” it continues, also accusing the “gaming giant” of “charging an excessive commission – of up to 30% – to publishers.”</p>
<p>If the claim is successful, then you - yes, you! - could be eligible for up to £44 in compensation, if you’re based in the UK and have bought either a game or “add-on game content” since the 5th of June 2018. The total £656 million appears to come from the 14 million UK based PC gamers the website alleges “could” have been overcharged by Valve. Here’s a look at the ‘key stats’ on the site. Cowardly move not to go full hog and make it look like an RPG character sheet, honestly.</p>

<p>This is all being headed up by digital-rights activist Vicki Shotbolt and legal firm Milberg London LLP. The firm were also involved in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">£5bn lawsuit against Sony</a> in 2022, who they alleged “ripped people off” by charging a 30% commission on PlayStation Store purchases. Valve themselves faced a similar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-lawsuit-accuses-valve-of-abusing-steam-market-power-to-prevent-price-competition">antitrust class action legal-me-doo</a> in 2021, though that appears to have gone nowhere.</p>
<p>As both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">Eurogamer</a> and the website’s FAQ point out, this current story could take years before anything more of note happens. Personally speaking, maybe there’s something in that 30% publisher commission being a touch high, but I’ve got no idea how much it realistically takes to keep something like Steam running.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-ps5-system-update-24-04-09-40-00-discord/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has started to deploy PS5 system update 24.04-09.40.00, allowing players to start or join Discord voice chat directly from their PS5 console.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/ps5-players-will-soon-be-able-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-their-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official blog post</a> on the PS Blog, the new firmware will be rolled out over the coming weeks, starting for PS5 owners in Japan and Asia, followed by those in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and the US. We can confirm, however, that the new system update has already been rolled out in Europe.</p>
<p>Support for Discord was already available on Sony's console, but this latest update makes it easier for players to access voice chat by allowing direct access to voice chat from the PS5 console. As such, players will no longer have to rely on using applications or Discord PC to start or join Discord voice chat.</p>
<h2><strong><em>How to join Discord voice chat on PS5</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>To start, select the Discord tab in Game Base within the PS5 Control Center and choose the Discord server or DM group you’d like to join. Then, select your preferred voice channel. This will reveal more details, such as who is already in the channel chatting. You’ll also receive a PS5 console notification when another Discord user calls you, allowing you to join right away.</em></p>
<p>In addition to making access to Discord easier, PS5 system update 24.04-09.40.00 also allows PS5 child accounts to link and add third-party services as well as apps for the PSN account. Also, the new firmware version includes improvements the device software for the PULSE Elite wireless headset, PULSE Explore wireless earbuds, and PlayStation Link USB adapter.</p>
<p>As always with Sony's system updates, this new one once again further improves the PS5's system software performance and stability. You can check out the full release notes <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for this new system update here</a>. Interestingly enough, Sony's official blog post mentions the option to share a PlayStation Network profile on any messaging or social app, but the official release notes don't mention this new option.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 is available worldwide now. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> last month, more than 59.2 million PS5 consoles have been sold globally since the console's launch back in November of 2020.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-valhalla-amd-fsr-3-0-frame-generation-mods-more-than-doubles-performance-on-rog-ally.900129/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-amd-fsr-3-0-frame-generation-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Assassin’s Creed Valhalla AMD FSR 3.0 Frame Generation mod has been released online, bringing considerable performance improvements in a variety of scenarios.</p>
<p>The new mod, developed by well-known modder PureDark, brings considerably better performance, more than double in most benchmark scenarios, in conjunction with the FSR 3.0 Performance setting on a ROG Ally, as shown by the modder in a new test video. Unfortunately, the mod is not available for free right now and is only available for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PureDark">Patreon supporters.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Valhalla FSR3 on ROG Ally" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnZXt02JjQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-nvidia-dlss-3-rtx/">Last month</a>, PureDark also released an Assassin’s Creed Valhalla NVIDIA DLSS 3, which supports both Super Resolution and Frame Generation, which work extremely well. NVIDIA Reflex support also ensures that input delay is kept as low as possible.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is the latest main entry in the open-world series by Ubisoft. Released back in 2020, the game was later expanded with multiple expansions, although the base game is already a massive experience, as well as an enjoyable one, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-once-sent-from-the-golden-hall/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a definite step up for the series, thanks to the many tweaks made to the RPG mechanics that powered the previous two entries in the series, better storytelling, great atmosphere, and meaningful side-content. Even with the tweaks, however, Assassin's Creed Valhalla is still an Assassin's Creed game at heart, so those who are not into the Ubisoft open-world game design will hardly change their opinion with the game. Everyone else will probably love every second of Eivor's adventure, especially if they are into Vikings and ancient Norse culture.</em></p>

  <p id="rzY2vD"><strong>Weapons </strong>are the most important tools in your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/monster-hunter-now-guides"><em>Monster Hunter Now</em></a> arsenal.</p>
<p id="cr8aA0">This mobile version of the series stripped back the usual roster of weapons down to six choices at launch, locking them behind story quest progression or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23635639">Hunter Rank</a> progress, with more being introduced with seasonal updates over time.</p>
<p id="jcJqDn">Despite smaller number of weapons in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, there are a couple of ranged options and series staples, such as the Great Sword, giving you some variety to play around with.</p>
<hr id="tRFQUJ">
<h2 id="MX1pj6"><strong>Monster Hunter Now weapons list: How many weapons are there?</strong></h2>
<p id="x9QCVz">To date, the roster of weapons in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="r1Cnx2">Sword and Shield</li>
<li id="rQj8kE">Great Sword</li>
<li id="tI2EN1">Bow</li>
<li id="z7vcxd">Hammer</li>
<li id="YVCF8X">Light Bowgun</li>
<li id="xSg1Aa">Long Sword</li>
<li id="NC8rcK">Dual Blades (added in Dec. 2023’s “Fulminations in the Frost” update)</li>
<li id="8toloA">Lance (added in Dec. 2023’s “Fulminations in the Frost” update)</li>
<li id="LzMg9Q">Charge Blade (added in March 2024’s “The Vernal Invader” update)</li>
<li id="QBs9gl">Gunblade (added in June 2024’s “Dancing in the Tempest“ update)</li>
</ul>
<p id="4Ial3w">Developers Niantic and Capcom have confirmed new weapon types will continue to be added to the game as seasons progress, so for those familiar with the main series, hopefully your favorites will roll out before too long.</p>

<p id="cnL5X3">To begin with, you’ll only have access to the Sword and Shield, albeit with multiple variations by forging together parts from slaying large <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23635999">monsters</a>.</p>
<p id="6LkBCI">To unlock new weapon types in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, <strong>you must progress through the main story quest. </strong>In Chapter 2, you’ll first unlock three more weapons, and just a few steps later, you’ll get the remaining roster of weapons.</p>
<p id="wDSasH">Specifically, you need to reach the following points in the story:</p>
<ul>
<li id="MBNPmT">
<strong>To unlock the Great Sword, Dual Blades, and Lance,</strong> complete the first stage of “Chapter 2: Shimmering Swamp” in the main story.</li>
<li id="dvtNST">
<strong>To unlock the Bow, Hammer, Light Bowgun, and Long Sword, </strong>reach <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23635639">Hunter Rank 15</a>.</li>
<li id="st0AFM">
<strong>Finally, weapons added in seasons (Dual Blades, Lance, Charge Blade, Gunblade), </strong>will be available automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p id="t3bUId">These pre-requisites aren’t too far into your <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> journey — requiring just a few hours of play. Of course, that might be staggered out depending on how much you’re able to explore, with many story steps based on collecting resources, which will be limited if you are playing in just a single spot.</p>
<p id="WbFHQk">Meanwhile, though large monsters do spawn frequently on your stationary position, making use of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23632412">paintballs</a> for when you need to complete large monster steps quickly is advised.</p>
<hr id="0dnbjL">
<h2 id="ahiZBC"><strong>When will new weapon types arrive in Monster Hunter Now?</strong></h2>
<p id="aquF4D">New weapon types — alongside new monsters and story updates — will be coming to <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> as part of major quarterly updates.</p>
<p id="Kn6IO1">The first of these was “Fulminations in the Frost,” arriving Dec. 2023, which introduced the Dual Blades and Lance.</p>
<p id="04Xnzy">The iconic Charge Blade was added in March 2024 as part of the “The Vernal Invader” update, while the Gunblade was added in June 2024’s “Dancing in the Tempest”.</p>
<p id="AZNwEA">From here, expect more weapons to be rolled out in subsequent updates.</p>

This will reveal more details, such as who is already in the channel chatting. You’ll also receive a PS5 console notification when another Discord user calls you, allowing you to join right away.</p>

After three years of Epic Games Store exclusivity, the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series will make its debut on Steam later today, and Square Enix has handily shared exact launch times for when the games will be available for purchase.</p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">We already have <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-games-make-steam-debut-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a breakdown on exactly which <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> titles will be available</a> but, as a quick reminder, there will be seven games across three separate compilations (plus three movies), and you can purchase all of them as part of a <em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em> collection. As for when you can actually start playing them, below is a list of release times for every timezone <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1800513569290924305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as provided by Square Enix</a>:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true"> <li>Los Angeles—9am PDT June 13</li> <li>New York—12pm EDT June 13</li> <li>Brazil—1pm BRT June 13</li> <li>London—5pm BST June 13</li> <li>Berlin—6pm CEST June 13</li> <li>Tokyo—1am JST June 14</li> <li>Australia—2am AEST June 14</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">At the time of writing, no prices have been shared, but I have to imagine the games will cost about the same as they do on other platforms:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX</em>—$49.99/£39.99</li> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em>—$59.99/£49.99</li> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts 3 + Re Mind</em>—$59.99/£49.99</li> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em>—$89.99/£79.99</li> </ul> <p data-characters="803" data-current-count="1102" data-injectable="true">While this is a meaty collection of games, and perfect for anyone looking to get into <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, it doesn’t include any of the mobile games. Said mobile games can’t be played anymore, but you can still download them to watch their cutscenes (or watch them on YouTube) if you crave extra lore and backstory. What’s more puzzling, though, is that this Steam line-up doesn’t include <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory</a></em>, a rhythm game spin-off released after <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-kingdom-hearts-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 3</a></em>. It’s available on every other platform, including the Epic Games Store, and yet there’s been no mention of a Steam release. Hopefully, it’s only a matter of time since aside from being a very fun game in its own right, it has important plot details that help lead into <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">Speaking of <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, the game was sadly absent from Summer Game Fest, and while there have been rumours of it launching in 2025 or 2026, Square Enix has yet to share any official info. Given the publisher intends on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/expect-more-multiplatform-square-enix-games-as-company-pledges-itself-to-new-aggressive-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“aggressively pursuing” a multiplatform strategy</a> going forward, perhaps we’ll see <em>KH4</em> launch on consoles and PC at the same time, which would be ideal.</p>

		<p><span data-contrast="auto">We’re getting ever closer to that all-important release date of 2</span><span data-contrast="auto">nd</span><span data-contrast="auto"> July and our first visit to Tural, the supposed “New World” of Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, and based on the trailer we’re in for another amazing experience. The sweeping vistas, local cultures, and – of course – the food all look enticing. It’s shaping up to be the holiday we (and the Warrior of Light) have been waiting for. In the meantime, if you want to take a short break in Eorzea (and beyond) and get your tan started or just relax while you wait, we’ve got you covered with our travel guide to the best places to visit in Final Fantasy XIV. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em>Warning: minor spoilers for Final Fantasy XIV ahead.&nbsp;</em></p>


<h3><strong>The Churning Mists</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s not the easiest place to get to, given that you must travel through Dravania to reach them, but those without a fear of heights will love the views from the floating islands of The Churning Mists. One for thrill seekers, regardless of vertigo, as you need to be constantly aware of the dragons that reside in the region and there aren’t any safety rails to be seen anywhere. The tourist bureau also advises that you keep a keen eye on your belongings as moogles are known to frequent the area.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>


<h3><strong>Tamamizu</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Nestled beneath the waves of the Ruby Sea, yes you read that right, is the beautiful town of Tamamizu. Inhabited by the industrious kojin, this underwater dome contains some of the most breathtaking sights in Eorzea, and you don’t even have to hold your breath to witness them. Once you’ve settled into the town, you can also pay a small fee for excursions to nearby sights like the Shisui of the Violet Tides, a resplendent palace between the waves. The only downside is having the lung capacity to get there!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Eulmore</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You deserve to treat yourself, and nowhere says decadence more than Eulmore. If you have a lot of money to spend, you can gorge yourself with some of the best food and drink in existence – we would recommend the meol – while surrounded by the upper crust of Kholusia. After nightfall, you can visit the Beehive; a nightclub with music, dancing performers and strong drinks that’s open all hours. We’ve heard reports of suspect news coming from the area, but these rumours are unsubstantiated.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Gridania</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Those seeking a return to a simpler life should visit the city of Gridania nestled in the Shroud. There’s no wi-fi, and the tomestone signal is poor, but surrounding the city are some of the best rambling routes you can find. You can wander to Bentbranch Meadows and meet the friendly chocobo farmers of the woods, stop to watch the soldiers of the Twin Adders in training, or those with a thirst for danger can even visit Sorrel Haven. This is the best option for those wanting to get away from modern life.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>New Sharlayan</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Do you love places with a deep and rich history? Being surrounded by beautiful architecture? How about insular and elitist people? What about a stellar cup of coffee? Well, New Sharlayan has you covered. Explore the pseudo-Ancient Greek architecture, get in trouble exploring the gigantic (but restricted) libraries, or just wander the beautiful harbourside. Any seeker of knowledge and culture will find plenty to enjoy here, if you have the approval of the Forum to enjoy it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Mandeville Gold Saucer</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A mere airship ride from Ul’dah is the glittering and gaudy Gold Saucer. Staffed by girls in bunny outfits, suited cactuars and owned by a studly gentleman with an aversion to clothing, you can fritter away hours in palatial decadence. With card games, arcade machines, chocobo races, mahjong and other events every 20 minutes, you will always find something to do. The best part? The place operates on its own currency system, saving you from needing to dip into your gil coffers!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Costa del Sol</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Obviously, this was going to be top of the list. Just a short hike away from the towering Limsa Lominsa is a beautiful stretch of golden beaches. You can take a swim in the crystal blue waters, soak in the atmosphere at one of the beach-side bars or drop down onto the beaches to take on a myriad of creatures that patrol the coastline. The only points it loses are from the annual festival that sees a strange obstacle course take over the coast, but that’s a small price to pay for beaches like this.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177548/discord-ps5-integration-calls-from-console<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is improving its Discord integration on the PS5 so that you can join voice calls directly from the console. First <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630228/sony-ps5-update-discord-1440p-vrr-support">launched last year</a>, Discord support on PS5 currently requires you to manually transfer a call to a console by using the Discord app on mobile or PC. Sony is now <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/ps5-players-will-soon-be-able-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-their-console/">rolling out an update</a> that integrates Discord directly into the PS5 dashboard so you can select the server or DM group you want to join.</p><p>The update is rolling out gradually over the coming weeks, starting with PS5 owners in Japan and Asia followed by Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and then finally the US and Canada. You’ll need to update your PS5 to the latest system software to get this new Discord integration, and a PlayStation Network account will need to be linked to your Discord account, too.</p><p>“To start, select the Discord tab in Game Base within the PS5 Control Center and choose the Discord server or DM group you’d like to join,” explains Sabrina Meditz, senior director of product management for the PlayStation platform experience. “Then, select your preferred voice channel. This will reveal more details, such as who is already in the channel chatting. You’ll also receive a PS5 console notification when another Discord user calls you, allowing you to join right away.”</p><p>This latest PS5 update puts the Discord experience nearly on par with what Microsoft offers on the Xbox. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/20/23271170/discord-xbox-voice-calls-integration-hands-on">first offered Discord support on Xbox</a> in July 2022 for testers, before then rolling out an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/16/23460701/xbox-november-update-discord-voice-channels-deals-capture">improved experience</a> without the need for a phone in November 2022. Discord on Xbox was also updated to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23816949/discord-xbox-stream-feature-testing-xbox-insiders">let you stream your gameplay</a> to friends last year.</p><p>Sony is also rolling out the ability to share your PlayStation Network profile on any messaging or social app, with a new share profile option in the PlayStation mobile app next week. The feature generates a shareable link or QR code so people can easily add you as a friend.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Claim accuses Steam maker of market dominance and overcharging consumers</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Steam is facing a £656 million collective action claim, brought forward by a digital rights campaigner who has accused Valve of using market dominance to overcharge 14 million UK consumers.</p>
<p>The claim was filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal on June 5, brought forward by Vicki Shotbolt.</p>
<p>"Valve is rigging the market and taking advantage of UK gamers," Shotbolt told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwwyj6v24xo">BBC News</a>.</p>
<p>She said the claim was filed "to stop this unlawful conduct and have people get back what they are owed."</p>
<p>The claim also accused Valve of "forcing" publishers to sign up to pricing restrictions, in addition to charging publishers commissions of up to 30%.</p>
<p>"We believe that Valve has been unfairly shutting out competition for PC games and in-game content, which has meant that UK customers have paid too much for these products," a statement read on an <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/the-claim/">accompanying website</a> for the claim.</p>
<p>Shotbolt is represented by Milberg London LLP, which represented consumer rights expert Alex Neill in bringing forth a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/legal-claim-filed-against-sony-over-30-store-cut">similar claim against Sony in 2022</a>, in which the firm was accused of overcharging players, developers, and publishers.</p>

<p data-characters="290" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following a short delay, it’s finally time to get our hands on <em>Fortnite</em>‘s v30.10 update, which brings a host of Metallica content including a concert and a new weapon, an updated Loot Island, and changes to <em>LEGO Fortnite</em> and <em>Rocket Racing</em>. Check out the full patch notes below. </p> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false"><em>Fortnite</em>‘s 30.10 patch was originally scheduled to drop on June 11, but after a two-day delay, it’s finally here. The headline addition, of course, is the Metallica collaboration, which is taking place across all of <em>Fortnite</em>‘s modes. </p> <h2 id="h-fortnite-v30-10-patch-notes" data-injectable="false"><em>Fortnite</em> v30.10 patch notes</h2>  <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true">Fancy experiencing six of Metallica’s biggest songs as you’ve never experienced them before? Then get ready for Fuel. Fire. Fury, a six-song in-game concert that will take place over the weekend of June 22. </p>
 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false">Unsurprisingly, Metallica is headed for <em>Fortnite Festival</em>, where they’ll take part in a PvP Battle Stage where 16 players enter and one is left standing, kind of like a musical battle royale. </p> <figure data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>“Exit light! Enter night!” Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Of course, all four members are also available as skins too, included in the <em>Fortnite</em> Festival Season 4 Premium Reward Track. Players will unlock Lars Ulrich as soon as they purchase the track, with James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo unlocked by earning XP and ranking up. Special “Master of Puppets” versions will also be available to purchase in the in-game store.</p> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true">There’s also a special Metallica-themed <em>Rocket Racing</em> track which plays Fuel in the background as you speed around, so there are plenty of ways for fans of the band to celebrate. </p>
  <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">As part of the crossover, a special Metallica-themed Loot Island is coming to Battle Royale! In the middle of every match, the floating island will appear from a rift, with a stage on top inspired by the one used on their M72 World Tour. </p> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">Epic Games says that if you “rock out to the holographic James, Lars, Kirk, and Robert,” you’ll be able to capture the POI, and the loot that comes with it. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>It’ll just appear in the sky. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-ride-the-lightning-guitars" data-injectable="false">Ride the Lightning guitars</h2> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">Ride the Lightning guitars are one of two new additions to the loot pool, allowing players to create a lightning bolt in the sky that you and your teammates can ride on to rotate around the island. </p>
 <p data-characters="99" data-current-count="99" data-injectable="false">This Mythic item is available as both ground loot or from Chests, so grab one and take to the sky. </p> <figure data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>This thing looks awesome. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-tow-hook-cannon" data-injectable="false">Tow Hook Cannon</h2> <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">Epic has also added the Tow Hook Cannon, a new weapon that should help you combat all those <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-season-3-wrecked-slams-the-brakes-on-the-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pesky vehicles</a> driving around. </p>
 <p data-characters="103" data-current-count="103" data-injectable="false">Fire it at a car, and you’ll be able to slow it down, making it harder for them to run you over. </p> <figure data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Anything to slow down these vehicles is great for me. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-cozy-and-expert-mode-in-lego-fortnite" data-injectable="false">Cozy and Expert Mode in <em>LEGO Fortnite</em></h2> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">Epic has given us more ways to play <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-lego-fortnite-a-battle-royale-game-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Fortnite</a></em> by dropping two new difficulty levels. Cozy Mode makes enemies easier to fight, turns of Storm-Wild creatures entirely, removes hunger, temperature, and stamina, and lets you keep your inventory when you die. </p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="false">Expert, meanwhile, is for those who really want a challenge, as the Storm-Wild enemies deal more damage, have more health, and move faster than regular creatures. It’s also a hardcore mode, which means that when you die, that’s it. No more respawns unless you have a Totem of Return. </p>

			<p>Ahead of the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hands-on-preview-the-erdtrees-light-casts-the-longest-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, the first and only expansion to Elden Ring, PC Gamer <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-rings-developers-know-most-players-use-guides-but-still-try-to-cater-to-those-who-go-in-blind-if-they-cant-do-it-then-theres-some-room-for-improvement-on-our-behalf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> game creator and FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki and asked whether the development team was aware of how many players had to use guides to complete their games, and if it changed anything in their design plans.</p>
<p>Miyazaki said:</p>
<p><em>Of course players are going to consult guides, and there's going to be a wealth of information on the web and in their communities where they have access to the secrets and the strategies. We expect that. We obviously understand players use guides, but we don't make or plan anything with that as a prerequisite. If anything, we try to cater to the player who is completely blind and wants to go through organically. If they can't do it, then there's some room for improvement on our behalf, and we'd like to try to embrace those players more in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>We don't necessarily cater to players who are reading guides as they go. Of course, it's a perfectly valid playstyle, and we respect those players who like to approach it with a guide in hand. We just want to let you know it's not our prerequisite, designing the game in their favor.</em></p>
<p>You are absolved of the 'sin' from the man himself, then. That said, Miyazaki also believes that everyone who went far enough into Elden Ring to be able to access Shadow of the Erdtree won't have too much problem with the expansion's new obstacles.</p>
<p><em>We have faith that they will be able to continue, find these secrets, and overcome these challenges.</em></p>
<p>Shadow of the Erdtree launches is out on Friday, June 21; look forward to our review soon. By the way, FromSoftware just <a href="http://1800890964925366476" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Elden Ring has passed 25 million units sold to date.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-devs-explain-why-the-game-doesnt-support-ps-vr2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-devs-explain-why-the-game-doesn%E2%80%99t-support-ps-vr2.900072/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-devs-explain-why-the-game-doesnt-support-ps-vr2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Astro Bot is arguably Sony's most promising first-party exclusive for 2024 in a year otherwise devoid of big releases. The platform game <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked great</a> on its State of Play debut, but it won't support PS VR2 despite the franchise launching on the first PS VR headset with 2018's Astro Bot: Rescue Mission.</p>
<p>At Summer Game Fest 2024, Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/06/ps5s-astro-bot-doesnt-support-psvr2-because-it-was-never-designed-to-do-so" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked</a> Team Asobi's Studio Director and Creative Director Nicolas Doucet why. You can read his response below.</p>
<p><em>So, we focused 100% on this one from the get-go after Astro's Playroom. It was the hope that if it was welcome, it could be a platformer that stands on its own feet, and we could go off to make a bigger version of it. So no, PS VR2 was not a consideration.</em></p>
<p><em>When we talk about VR versus non-VR, for a game like Astro, if you were to make a VR version, it has to be fully designed for that medium. And if it's not a VR version, it has to be fully designed for that medium. Certain games can afford to be hybrid, like first-person games, because there's a closer similarity. But in our case, the design philosophy for both are very, very different. So, you know, it was a decision to expand on the world of Astro's Playroom and bring Astro to the big stage. So, from the beginning, that was really our focus.</em></p>
<p>Another possible reason is that Astro Bot is by far the <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-is-the-biggest-game-made-by-team-asobi-with-80-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest game in the franchise yet</a>, featuring around 80 levels spread across six planets. This inevitably means a larger investment from Sony, which will be interested in selling as many copies as possible. PS VR2 isn't doing too well, and it would certainly have limited the game's sales potential if it was only available for the VR headset.</p>
<p>Astro Bot will be released for PlayStation 5 on September 6. However, given Sony's stance on PC, it's likely the game will be ported to the platform in the next couple of years.</p>

A demo will also be available. <span id="more-891976"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via ACQUIRE:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Scars of Mars</em> is a new real-time RPG. During combat and exploration, time flows, so you must make split-second decisions, execute precise commands swiftly, and vanquish enemies within a limited time. It’s a thrilling experience that captures the unique tension and satisfaction of the gameplay.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>December 6, 2158.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You take on the role of a commander of a humanoid unit, embarking on a top-secret mission to rescue survivors and escape from a research facility on Mars, which suddenly lost contact.</p><p><strong>Real-time Formation Battle</strong></p><p>Engage in strategic combat where you control four humanoids in a 3×3 grid, making real-time decisions on their <a title="Genres > Action [1,929 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. Every move counts as you decide which characters to control, when to attack, dodge, heal, or protect. The constant flow of time demands tactical positioning and precise timing, creating an immersive and strategic battle experience.</p><p><strong>Character Customization</strong></p><p>Assemble a party of four humanoids and take on missions. Each humanoid can be customized by combining different classes, frames, and weapons, allowing for a wide range of character variations. Whether you prefer a Sniper who attacks from afar but moves slowly, a Fighter who swiftly slashes through enemies, a Berserker specialized in close combat but with low defense, or a Healer focused on support and defense, the choice is yours.</p><p><strong>Battery Consumption</strong></p><p>Routes are procedurally generated for each playthrough, offering different paths, but you can select your movements to progress without getting lost. Every enemy encounter, event, and item container changes in each playthrough, making battery management crucial. Battles, events, and route movements all consume time, gradually depleting your battery. To succeed, you must make precise decisions based on your party’s condition and remaining battery power. Whether you aim for defeating the boss at the deepest level or return midway for equipment and item collection, player wisdom and experience are vital for success.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sinister Ravenous and his legions of brutal demons are poised for battle. Even all the armies of the world can’t stop them, but humanity has one final ace in the hole: a cutting edge power armor called Paladin.</p><p>It’s now up to the strong-willed android named Flame to become a Squire, take control of the Paladin and track down all Weapon Keepers and their diabolical leader. The showdown between mankind’s highest technological prowesses and the powerful forces of the occult has begun!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Seize weapons from the denizens of the Netherworld and dish out a taste of their own medicine! Show them the power of cutting edge technology combined with swordsmanship.

The protagonist pilots a power armor called Paladin to fight giant demons by using their own weapons against them.</p><p>The key components of the swordplay mechanic includes the ability to equip and use any weapon dropped by defeated enemies, high versus low attacking and blocking, a rock-paper-scissor weapon type system that grants attack bonuses, and the ability to cast spells by breaking weapons. Weapons abound in levels, so the player is encouraged to use them profusely. The Paladin is the main means to fight enemies but players can eject and also play as the swifter and smaller pilot called a Squire. The Squire uses a laser whip to attack enemies, swing across gaps, and recharge the Paladin’s energy.</p><p><em>Panzer Paladin</em> lets the player choose the order in which to complete the first 10 levels of the game. The last 6 levels must be played in a linear fashion.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Giant weapons—swords, lances, hammers—hailing from the dark depths of space, blazed across the sky and pierced through historic locations all around the world. Like a declaration of war against mankind, the Parthenon, atop the Acropolis of Athens, was first to be cut right through by an ominous blade. Upon impact, each of the weapons opened a breach in the fabric of reality and unleashed legions of colossal demons.</p><p>In anticipation of such unforeseen Earth-threatening events, the International Security Council had formed Gauntlet, a science committee developing super sophisticated defense technologies. Gauntlet discovers that denizens of the Netherworld can only be obliterated by their own weapons. Spirit Weapons are forged with spirits of the deceased and humans can’t brandish them without becoming corrupt by their foul power… However, a machine would be immune to demonic corruption! Gauntlet recommissions Flame, a former rescue operations android, to become a Squire and take control of the last remaining Paladin unit, a state of the art power armor capable of wielding Spirit Weapons.</p><p>To arms! Overseeing their operations from aboard the Avalon, their flying headquarters, Gauntlet is ready. The showdown between mankind’s highest technological prowesses and the powerful forces of the occult has begun! It’s up to Squire Flame and her Paladin named Grit to defeat all Weapon Keepers, and ultimately face off against Ravenous, the sinister leader of the invasion.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What wasn't so widely discussed was the future of another Gamer Network site, Dicebreaker.</p><p>Dicebreaker<em> </em>is (was?) a website dedicated to independent, serious coverage of the board game industry. Unlike video games, where (even if it's been on the decline lately) we're used to it, that's not a common thing in board games! You can count the number of credible outlets on one hand, which is why first the silence, and now the layoffs at Dicebreaker<em> </em>are especially shitty.</p><p><a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/06/12/dicebreakers-future-remains-unclear-as-silenced-site-makes-editor-in-chief-senior-staff-writer-redundant-after-ign-takeover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As BoardGameWire--one of those remaining fingers on the hand--report</a>, after weeks of silence from IGN regarding the future of the site, Dicebreaker's editor-in-chief Matt Jarvis, senior staff writer Alex Meehan and head of video Michael Whelan have all now been made redundant.</p><p>Since the sale in May, Dicebreaker--normally an active website that updated several times a week, covering not just the industry but the culture surrounding board games--had only published a single article, which was basically a sponsored ad. Not a great sign!</p><p>In an email to remaining staff sent earlier this week,<a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/06/12/dicebreakers-future-remains-unclear-as-silenced-site-makes-editor-in-chief-senior-staff-writer-redundant-after-ign-takeover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> obtained by BoardGameWire</a>, Jarvis said:</p><blockquote><p>I’m not able to say exactly what the future holds for the Dicebreaker website and wider brand – mostly because I am now not in the position to know myself.</p><p>My understanding is that the website will remain live for the time being. Needless to say, I would recommend archiving your work if you haven’t already, just in case.</p><p>Thank you for helping create what I honestly believe was a place that represented and championed the best that tabletop gaming journalism and coverage has to offer, all while bringing deserving, welcoming work to as great an audience as possible.</p><p>I hope you’ll all remain as proud as I am with everything you brought to the site and the success and reputation Dicebreaker built in the industry and beyond thanks to your hard work.</p><p>A particularly huge thanks to Chase [Carter], Jason [Coles], Alicia [Haddick] and Caelyn [Ellis], whose monthly coverage across news, MTG, Yu-Gi-Oh! and Warhammer was consistently outstanding and helped take the site in directions it would’ve never travelled so ably without your expertise and efforts.</p><p>I really can’t thank you enough for everything you did over the last few years. You are as much a part of the Dicebreaker team as anyone.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That does not read like a farewell email for one person. That reads like a eulogy for a website.</p><p>This fucking <em>sucks</em>, because as an industry<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/toys-hobby/toys-games/board-games/worldwide#:~:text=The%20Board%20Games%20market%20worldwide,US%242%2C740m%20in%202024." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that continues to grow</a>--despite the world's<a href="https://kotaku.com/board-games-are-having-a-bad-time-1842653367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> best attempts to slow it down</a>--board games need independent, critical voices now more than ever. Yet in 2024 it's a scene whose idea of "media" is usually friends playing games around a table and filming it for YouTube, and who for the most part are so cosy with publishers that they essentially serve as a marketing arm for the industry.</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U0UJQAiUWI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I actually went on a podcast last year just to talk about this, since the idea that board games need actual journalism can be so weird to some board gamers!</a>)</p><p>If you want to continue supporting independent voices in the space, please try checking out<a href="https://boardgamewire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the aforementioned BoardGameWire</a>,<a href="https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> watch <em>Shut Up &amp; Sit Down</em> on YouTube</a> and/or, if you're more into tabletop RPGs,<a href="https://www.rascal.news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> then you must also subscribe to Rascal</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="kxuMhj"><strong>Interceptions</strong> are how you encounter Elder Dragons in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/monster-hunter-now-guides"><em>Monster Hunter Now</em></a> .</p>
<p id="bBtBDj">First introduced in June 2024’s Dancing in the Tempest update with the arrival of Kushala Daora, Interceptions are a mix of the game’s Hunt-a-thon events and <em>Pokémon Go</em>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/24168766/raid-schedule-legendary-mega-shadow-five-star">raids</a>, where hunters team up to take down a rare, powerful creature.</p>
<p id="8p7fPK">Here’s how Elder Dragon Interceptions work in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, and the list of Elder Dragons added to the game so far.</p>

<hr id="V1ZNNt">
<h2 id="lYYZjh"><strong>Elder Dragon Interceptions release time</strong></h2>
<p id="QdReTg">Elder Dragon Interceptions will debut as part of Season 2 Dancing in the Tempest on <strong>Thursday, June 13</strong>, with the first events appearing from <strong>12 p.m. local time</strong>.</p>
<p id="JAnnlq">From there, they will rotate in and out of Gathering Points throughout the day, starting from around 7:15 a.m. until around 10:45 a.m.</p>
<hr id="KL5F0S">

<p id="AJvefr">Similar to Hunt-a-Thons, Elder Dragon Interceptions are events which <strong>appear on the map at Gathering Points for a limited time</strong>. Approach the encounter before the timer ends to begin.</p>
<p id="q5e6Kb">In battle, a key difference with Elder Dragon Interceptions is <strong>the health bar is split into two</strong>. If you reach the halfway point (known as the “repel” phase), you will receive monster parts even if you don’t complete the rest of the encounter. Additionally, you will still receive a reward if you only manage around 20% of the overall health bar.</p>

<p id="opsMg4">The time limit for Elder Dragon Interceptions<strong> are longer than most battles</strong>, with each of the two phases lasting around 75 seconds, likely to account for the higher difficulty of the encounter.</p>
<p id="zH2xtl">Finally, similar to Hunt-a-thons, solo players who enter an Elder Dragon Interception <strong>will have matchmaking</strong>; simply wait in the lobby when you first join until it populates with other players. They will also have a<strong> cooldown of 180 minutes</strong>, unless you purchase and use an Ultra Hunting Ticket from the in-game shop.</p>

<h2 id="w9s1y9"><strong>Elder Dragons list in Monster Hunter Now</strong></h2>
<p id="J0PAsQ">For those new to Monster Hunter, Elder Dragons are among the rarest and most powerful creatures in the game — described by Niantic as “monsters that have existed since ancient times and possess characteristics that transcend human knowledge.”</p>
<p id="TNkEm1">As with <em>Pokémon Go</em>’s Legendaries, it’s likely they will be rotated in and out of the game through Interceptions over time.</p>
<p id="8VFQG9">The Elder Dragons that have appeared in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> so far are:</p>
<ul><li id="xFTvJU">Kushala Daora (appeared June 2024)</li></ul>
<p id="G3MwQQ">With more than 40 Elder Dragons appearing in the series as a whole so far, there’s many more for the game to catch up on — though the rate at which we’ll see them is currently unknown. </p>
<p id="pjDWMv">You can get a sense of how many there are in this graphic of their rollout, generation-by-generation, on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/wvoqyp/thought_id_make_a_post_that_shows_how_many_elder/">Monster Hunter subreddit</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/destiny-2-final-shape-end-to-light-and-darkness<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2014, the launch of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/destiny"><em>Destiny</em></a> promised the start of an epic ten-year story. It was a promise echoed by other live-service games that rose (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/marvels-avengers-11-months-later">and fell</a>) in its wake.&nbsp; With <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, Bungie's space opera is the first to reach this major milestone. As such, <em>The Final Shape</em> is packed with high expectations.</p>
<p>The narrative must surpass previous expansions, and work as an extended conclusion, bringing narrative threads and character arcs to a close. The gameplay must continue the high bar set by Bungie's esteemed pedigree. Finally, it must set the stage for what will come next in this sci-fi universe.</p>
<p>Yet, despite all of these expectations, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and">series of layoffs</a>, and the studio's pivot to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/learn-what-marathon-is-all-about-in-new-video-from-bungie">other projects</a>, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> delivers. It's the best expansion ever released in Bungie's history, packed with excitement, larger-than-life drama, and the most satisfying gunfights.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-pale-heart-cosmodrome-artwork.jpg?itok=JgW0A1Fd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-pale-heart-cosmodrome-artwork.jpg?itok=maP4U6xm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's the Cosmodrome but...wrong.</figcaption></figure><h2>Destiny 2: The Final Shape – Into The Pale Heart</h2>
<p>After the year of confusing storytelling in last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/destiny-2-lightfall-what-happened-with-that-finale"><em>Lightfall</em> expansion</a>, the main story of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is simple in plot and grand in stakes. The Witness, the godlike being of the Darkness and grand architect behind some of Destiny's most horrendous atrocities, is on the cusp of completing their grand design. By delving into the heart of The Traveler, it plans to use the cosmic powers of Light and Darkness to form the universe into The Final Shape: A calcification of reality where everything is forced into a waking nightmare of permanent stasis.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Alliance forces have found a way to pursue The Witness into The Pale Heart, spearheaded by the player's Guardian.</p>
<p>Complicating matters is the nature of The Pale Heart. It is a landscape formed by memory twisted into surreal and unnerving shapes by The Witness' influence. To make things worse, this funhouse mirror of nostalgia is invaded by a brand new enemy faction known as The Dread.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-pale-heart-canyon.jpg?itok=QcCMyqki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-pale-heart-canyon.jpg?itok=R0Z5SCfP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This imagery gets worse the more you progress.</figcaption></figure><p>Presentation-wise, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is packed with the kind of fast-paced, larger-than-life, operatic storytelling that made Bungie a household name. It navigates high drama and bombast alongside quiet contemplation on the nature of life, suffering, and the bittersweet beauty in something coming to an end.</p>
<p>In every sense of the word, the story of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> feels... well, final.</p>
<p>This propulsive storytelling blends well with the level design of The Pale Heart. The environments are familiar vignettes and locations across <em>Destiny's</em> history corrupted into unsettling new forms. Faces contorted in anguish jutting from a rock face. Hands with too many fingers breaking out of the ground. Buildings and caverns that are built upside down. This is taken to its natural extreme in the new Salvation's Edge Raid: an uncanny fortress packed with alien liminal architecture.</p>
<p>Bungie' narrative team uses this surrealism to provide fan service with sinister overtones. From art direction alone, the campaign celebrates the game's history, an exercise in nostalgic horror, and a masterclass in an apocalyptic atmosphere.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-cayde-6-monologue.jpg?itok=T-wsMyWg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-cayde-6-monologue.jpg?itok=YmG3R3g3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Melodramatic? Yes. But powerful.</figcaption></figure><p>While I was initially skeptical, Nathan Fillion's return as Cayde-6 is handled expertly, forming the beating heart of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. He completely nails the emotional minefield of coming back from the dead with the right amount of solemn contemplation and wry wit.</p>
<p>A close second for acting MVP is Keith David as Commander Zavala. David effortlessly makes the character his own, maintaining the taciturn stoicism of the late Lance Reddick's performance while bringing a tangible pain and vulnerability to the role.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-prismatic-warlock-menu.jpg?itok=NWUbpXVk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-prismatic-warlock-menu.jpg?itok=7xBK8oMo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I am still finding new synergies with this.</figcaption></figure><h2>Breaking Down The Wall Between Light and Darkness</h2>
<p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> doesn't try to fix what isn't broken. A loop of guns and space magic striking down aliens and getting loot. At this point, you've either bounced off of this gameplay, or it is comfortably familiar.</p>
<p>The new wrinkle added in this expansion is the new Dread enemies. Overall, they are a great new enemy faction. They introduce elements of air superiority with the flying Grim alongside crowd-control with the Subjugator's Strand abilities. They feel like a natural extension of The Witness' forces and complement established enemy factions.</p>
<p>But the biggest draw of this expansion is the new Prismatic subclass. In the simplest of terms, it is the Build-A-Bear of <em>Destiny</em> subclasses. You can take elements from different subclasses and combine them. This leads to strong combos that aren't normally possible. Furthermore, it introduces a new empowered mode called Transcendence, which introduces more enhanced abilities for a brief period.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-blooming-event-gameplay.jpg?itok=T-GbrTtD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-blooming-event-gameplay.jpg?itok=S1AIk81F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Strand needles, Void grenades, Stormtrance Super... life is good.</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who has put hundreds of hours into <em>Destiny 2</em>, the Prismatic subclass is a dream come true. Overlapping damage-over-time effects with Jolt, Scorch, and Devour. Combining Strand, Stasis, and Void into nightmarish crowd control. The list of possibilities goes on.</p>
<p>Prismatic feels like a acknowledgment by Bungie to their dedicated fans. After so many years learning the ins and outs of abilities and gear, this new subclass represents your mastery of the game-breaking your limitations.</p>
<p>This burst of personal empowerment doesn't completely disrupt <em>Destiny 2's</em> overall balance. Prismatic is great, but it doesn't give you every class ability. Some are only accessible within their dedicated subclass.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-the-witness-boss-fight.jpg?itok=qTx5WG6k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-the-witness-boss-fight.jpg?itok=CTHTKpW2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This was a nightmare on Legendary difficulty.</figcaption></figure><p>The gear game continues a gradual shift in Bungie's weapon design. Early on, weapons were key to damage and crowd control with class abilities playing support. Now, outside of exotics, weapons support the abilities. Popular perks involve reducing ability cooldowns, generating Super energy, and even briefly healing teammates.</p>
<p>The result is more visually busy gunfights with larger enemy hordes. But it also means getting god roll on weapons feels less important.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-epilogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=wsyMC6_j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-epilogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=FePPHGYz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>After ten years, it's over.</figcaption></figure><h2>The End of An Era</h2>
<p>Recently, Bungie laid out their plans for <em>Destiny 2</em> after <em>The Final Shape</em>. They will be moving from long overarching narratives to an episodic structure, exploring the consequences of the final battle against The Witness. It's a noticeable but measured scaling back of ambition. One that comes with the acknowledgment that people may wish to move on to new things; both the players and Bungie themselves.</p>
<p>In 2014, Bungie launched <em>Destiny</em>, a game that spawned the concept of the live-service game with an epic ten-year story.&nbsp;After initially bouncing off, I have been an avid player. Reading lore, playing through the raids, and developing long-lasting friendships with my fellow Guardians. In 2024, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> concludes its story in a way that players will remember forever in an industry flooded with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">failed attempts</a> to capture its magic.</p>
<p>It was a decade packed with euphoric highs and salty lows, but when it mattered most, it ended beautifully.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/monster-hunter-now-season-2-is-good-time-to-jump-back-in<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re reading this, <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> has just entered its second season, Dancing in the Tempest. Niantic’s adding a lot of exciting stuff to the game, perhaps the biggest thing being an Elder Dragon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mobile game has reached 15 million downloads at the time of writing, which is a pretty good measure of success in my book. To capitalize on the player base, many of season 2’s updates are focused on making it a more social game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, Kushala Daora from <em>Monster Hunter 2 </em>is coming to the game, along with a new mechanic called Elder Dragon Interceptions. These function a lot like Hunt-a-thons, but instead of a gauntlet of five monsters, it’s one big encounter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-now-basarios.png?itok=bfHjufc8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-now-basarios.png?itok=v7ymNJDW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>Season 2 is also coming with two other new monsters: Basarios and Khezu (who will not be shown because they are very cursed).</figcaption></figure><p>I played an Interception at Summer Game Fest with a decently kitted out squad (that's where I also saw <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-wildly-impressive">the latest from <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>). We still ran the clock all the way to the literal last second, and that’s including the extra 75 seconds you get after taking out half of its health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, even if we failed at that point, taking out half of Kushala Daora’s health will give you some bonuses, as you’ve repelled the creature (instead of slaying it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Niantic spokesperson declined to comment on whether we can expect more Elder Dragon Interceptions, but as <em>Monster Hunter </em>fans know, there are many more Elder Dragons to work with from the main games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of more things to work with, Season 2 also comes with a new weapon: the Gunlance. This brings <em>Monster Hunter Now </em>up to 10 weapon types, out of the 14 typically found in a mainline game.</p>
<p>The Gunlance was a lot of fun to use; much like the other weapons I’ve used, the interface was intuitive and simple, with a lot of options for somewhat more robust gameplay. After four taps, you can do some pretty big damage, but you have manually reload it to get that big damage on the fourth tap.</p>

<p>You can manually reload by holding, and then swiping down. It’s not quite as intuitive as you’d think, and that’s somewhat true for the other weapons’ controls, too. That’s why Season 2 is also coming with guides for every weapon for more accessibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To round out the social aspects here, Niantic is also adding a button to quickly send a friend request after a hunt. If you see a familiar username on your morning commute, now’s the time to shoot your shot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Friend Quests are being added, where you and three others can opt in to complete a bigger quest within a time limit (think something like “slay 250 monsters”).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-now-review-in-progress">Last time I checked out <em>Monster Hunter Now</em></a>, I was having a pretty good time with the early game. However, I was hitting a wall thanks to the grind that was setting in, and the microtransactions at the time had me feeling wary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I’ve just reinstalled it with a sense of freshness in my eyes. I want to try reincorporating it into my routine, because after all, I have 14.99 million or so new friends to find.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/demo-trailer-e3-gamescom-pax-tgs-made<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome back to '<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What I Do</a>', a feature that shines a spotlight on the essential, bizarre and often unheralded work that people do every day across the video game industry.</p><p>Today's instalment is a timely one: it's summer, the time for big game announcements, so I wanted to talk to someone who had some experience with what it was like not just working at a big studio that was going to be starring at a major international games event, but having to meet journalists/fans about a game as well.</p><p>That person is Albert (not their real name!), a jack-of-all-trades working across platforms and genres whose identity has been withheld so that they could spill the beans on what it's like getting media training and having to build a vertical slice just so some press could play part of the game ahead of release.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: </strong><strong><em>Hi Albert! Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your history in the games business?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: I've been in the industry for nearly 20 years? How is that true?! I started in QA, where I spent the first five years of my career at a number of studios. I've been a designer for almost 15 years. I've worked at studios of around 60 people up to a studio of nearly 300. I've worked on AAA MMOs, AAA singleplayer RPGs, and AA RPGs. In that time I've been an active part of development on several demos for press, show floors, and publishers. I've primarily worked in content (like quests and such), but I've also worked on PvP modes, co-op gameplay, and other systems as an implementer and lead.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>Because it's summer and we've all got big game reveals on our minds, which of those games had a presence at a major show?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: The MMO and AA RPG I worked on had presences at a major industry show, the MMO multiple times. I also worked on a demo for a big consumer-facing event for the MMO.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>What were your exact roles on both games mentioned in these answers?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: For the MMO I worked on the maps as an open-world designer, as well as in the PvP portions of the game. For the RPG I was responsible for implementing quests.</p><p><strong>LP: <em>What was involved in getting the demos ready for the big reveal? Were people pulled off actual work to get them ready? How long did it normally take to put something together?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: For the MMO, the biggest and most important show demo of ours was the major industry show, as it was the first time any players got their hands on the game. We put a lot of energy into the zones we were showing off, and probably pushed the polish level of those higher than was strictly necessary for that time in development. It was most of the studio focused on that, but ultimately that work wasn't so much throwaway work as it was focus on things that we were either going to need more broadly (like combat skills), or it was work that would ship eventually, think map content.</p><p>I honestly don't remember how long we were focusing on it, but it was months and months of essentially the whole studio's time. The fact that it was going to be on the show floor, and thus we couldn't control the impressions the media would get out of it, meant that we were very mindful of not just how it would feel to players at the show, but also how it would look when recorded. The sheer scale of it prevented us from being able to fully polish all of it, but it did allow us to build a slice of our game up to a much closer-to-final level than we had done up until that point. Where and when this work became the most onerous is as we got closer and we needed to make sure the build wasn't going to crash or break in any critical ways. That involved very few changes, but lots of time playing the build, identifying one critical issue and then waiting for a fix.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I was at a studio (if not directly involved) in a trailer that was 100% Grade A bullshit. Essentially our publisher really, really wanted stuff to show and despite the fact that our next project wasn't even in the pitch phase, let alone production...</p></blockquote></figure><p>For the RPG, while we built something using a lot of the existing tools, there was a large amount of work on all disciplines to get things to a level that we were comfortable showing to the press. And a large amount of that work was one-off and trashed afterwards. I'd say we put somewhere in the realm of 3-4 months of work with 25% or more of the studio building things. There was a lot of special-casing of things because it wasn't like the game was ready to ship yet, or even fit within console memory. There were folks that grumbled about it and were upset about throwaway work.</p><p>The studio head was a micro-manager about details and so we had daily play sessions where he would find small art issues and pull in multiple people to talk about how we could fix them. He wanted all the details to be very tightly controlled, which honestly just takes a ton of effort, especially in a game with any sort of underlying simulation that is inherently random. A specific example: there was a bush next to a house that we were playing around that would flicker a little at certain points. The studio head was fixated on it and we had to figure out how to fix it for the demo. Which meant a number of leads or other folks getting pulled in to look at it, talk about potential fixes, etc. We also rehearsed so many times to try and have everything perfect. Which was helpful, I suppose, but honestly just overkill.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>How did people on the team feel about this? Was it a huge pain in the ass? Did anyone resent being taken off other work for it?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: For the MMO, I think folks were mostly understanding and onboard, because it was so tightly linked to our first time in front of players and to so many parts that were stuff we would need to do anyhow to ship the game. The most clearly throwaway work was all the stuff required for the specific logistics of a show floor. How do we log people out? What happens if someone walks away in the middle? Stuff like that. That wasn't so much work, but was certainly not related to the actual game at all. That's not considering a lot of the things I didn't have insight into, like planning the show floor, travel plans, etc. It's not easy to get a bunch of PCs over to another country and set up to run for three days straight.</p><p>For the RPG, folks weren't super happy. It was a press-only demo that also wasn't going to be recorded, so I think the degree to which that felt like a waste of their time was noticeable. Not to mention that we just had a lot of shit to do in order to try and get the game built and we were always up against milestones. Those two things really pushed folks to a place of seeing this as stupid, rather than necessary. Something with that tight of a leash and the desire to make and see very small changes is always going to be a pain in the ass, because you need builds to process and all that takes time. We also did the work on a separate version of the game build, so it meant you had to be able to swap between places and do your work in the correct location, which is a hassle. It felt very ancillary to the actual work of making a game. And it had the fear always in the air that someone would promise something or say something offhand to the press that would turn into a must-have feature that we had no plans to deliver.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>Be honest, how much of these showcases, if any, was bullshit? Not accidentally bullshit (like something WAS going to be in the game but plans changed), but just a straight up smoke and mirrors job?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: For the MMO, I'd say it was mostly not bullshit. Performance and balance wasn't close to final, but we weren't faking things to any major degree.</p><p>For the RPG, I'd say it was 50% bullshit? I literally custom did all the content work, nothing about that was going to ship. And we put our thumb on the scale of all sorts of systems to make the demo exciting and reliable for those of us giving the demo to press. As a simulation game, that's somewhat going to always happen in that you either go in fully with the idea that we're open to whatever, or you very tightly constrain what can and will happen in the demo. For example, if things would sometimes spawn and sometimes not because of the simulation, we would force them to always spawn for the demo.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Our relationship with the press is both antagonistic in some sense but also highly reciprocal...</p></blockquote></figure><p>Actually, now that I think about it, I was at a studio (if not directly involved) in a trailer that was 100% Grade A bullshit. Essentially our publisher really, really wanted stuff to show and despite the fact that our next project wasn't even in the pitch phase, let alone production, we had an external team create a trailer to build hype. It was completely divorced from anything we hoped to do, and it was so early in development that it couldn't help but be misleading or tie our hands. That one sucked. It thankfully didn't eat up a ton of our resources and time, but it was still demoralizing because we had little to do with it and we all knew it was going to be promises that we couldn't necessarily deliver on.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>Did you attend any of these events in a public or press-facing capacity? And if so, did you ever receive any kind of media training?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: Yes, pretty much every single time. Now, front-facing in the first several times was just in the sense of the show floor and talking to fans and players, mostly. But for the RPG I was one of four people presenting to the press. We did get press training each time for the MMO, although it varied in quality.</p><p><strong>LP: <em>I've long been fascinated by this: what exactly did that press training entail? Did anyone have to role-play, were there powerpoints, who exactly was doing the training?</em></strong></p><p>The press training took a number of different forms. The most rigorous was an outside consultant coming in, walking us through how to approach things, doing some role-playing, that sort of thing. In general at the MMO studio we would run folks through an internal training before they did any press or public-facing stuff. Some of the key takeaways are: defer to someone else if you aren't sure about the answer, don't let long silences trick you into giving more details, and remember that as soon as you walk out the door, you are working and guard what you say. It's a fairly different experience being with fans compared to the press, however. We generally are less worried about major mistakes with fans, because it's just not the same as a press hit. I am fortunate in that I was able to observe folks that were really good at press before I had to do much myself. And I'm a solid extemporaneous speaker, which is a double-edged sword and hasn't yet gotten me fired, but has come close!</p><p>What I've found most personally useful with press is to remember that making shit up or lying is never, ever going to work. Not only are you likely to get called out by your boss, the players are eventually going to actually play the thing! I focus on telling the most positive, but still grounded in reality, version of the story that I can and hope that comes across. For example if we aren't going to release any new skills for a particular class, I want to be able to say something like "Our focus, in this release, is on the classes that are furthest from our overall goals. Something that is really important to us is making sure we are making measured changes that don't put too much stress on the team." Or something like that.</p><p>Our relationship with the press is both antagonistic in some sense but also highly reciprocal. And press that are doing their jobs, looking out for the truth and for the audience, will sometimes ask tough questions. But those questions come from an important place and you can bet your players are asking the same ones.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>Thanks for your time Albert!</em></strong></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
