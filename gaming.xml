            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ghost Ship Games has announced the&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>Season 5 release date, and it's just a few weeks away.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/5993806139359858959" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement on Steam</a>, Season 5, otherwise known as Digging Deeper, will arrive on June 13th across all platforms, bringing with it a new mission type and more.</p>
<p>Said release date was actually technically revealed on Tuesday in the form of a series of numbers hidden in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/4194617370630456481" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a teaser image</a>, but the aforementioned post has made the release date explicit, so you don't have to guess at what those numbers might mean.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-release-date-teaser.jpg?itok=mlaa1RDM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-release-date-teaser.jpg?itok=exud53kL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Can you spot the 06, 13, and 24 hidden in this image?</figcaption></figure><p>Back in late April, Ghost Ship revealed tons of information regarding exactly what's coming to Deep Rock Galactic in Season 5.</p>
<p>A new mission type, Deep Scan, is coming, tasking you and your crew with locating Morkite Seeds deep within Hoxxes and extracting with them before you get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to a mysterious new Season Event involving a "peculiar new mineral formation" known only as a Core Stone, although Ghost Ship is remaining relatively tight-lipped as to what these formations are.</p>
<p>New enemies and Overclocks will also be available as part of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>Season 5, so you'll have plenty to look forward to when the season arrives.&nbsp;</p>

What does it do? You'll have to wait to find out.</figcaption></figure><p>Remember, too, that you can now <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-season-reactivation">access the content</a> from previous&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>Seasons if you've missed out, so if you don't feel like starting Season 5 straight away, you won't have to.</p>
<p><em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>is a co-op shooter in which groups of dwarves delve deep into the planet of Hoxxes to mine it for minerals, complete objectives, and defend themselves against the hordes of insectoid enemies that await them.</p>
<p>The game features procedurally-generated maps, tons of loot to collect, and destructible environments, and it's also regularly being updated with new content.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/deep-rock-galactic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/deep-rock-galactic/9NHFVWX1V7QJ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also available on Game Pass. Ghost Ship says it'll share more about Season 5 and what you can expect from it soon, so stay tuned.</p>

  <p id="B562Ak">When the revised 5th edition of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> becomes available on Sept. 17, the world will finally get a taste of the seminal role-playing game’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23730399/dnd-dungeons-dragons-revised-core-rulebook-preview-players-handbook-dmg">upgraded mechanics</a>.

<p id="SWwzU0">Illustrated by <a href="https://www.wyliebeckert.com/">Wylie Beckert</a>, the alt art cover of the <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024)<em> </em>features a party comprised of D&amp;D’s four iconic classes — the fighter, the wizard, the cleric, and the rogue — all gathered around a friendly gold dragon, sharing tea. This gentle scene stands in stark contrast to the mainline <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024), which<em> </em>will have a bright, bold cover by <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobsontyler/status/1790443483280584774">Tyler Jacobsen</a> with similar characters posed in the moments before striking a blow.</p>

<p id="vFoX24">“We liked the idea of making the alt cover something that has a sweeter, calmer version of that,” said Wizards’ head of art, Josh Herman, in a video interview with Polygon. “Something that’s not so aggressive, [with] combat [and] fighting right away. That’s certainly a [...] huge pillar of D&amp;D, but sometimes a lot of what D&amp;D is, is just storytelling.” </p>

<p id="KB0lfH">“I kind of wanted a coffee table book,” Herman continued, “but a book where I would sit and relax in that sort of <a href="https://denmark.dk/people-and-culture/hygge">hygge</a> way, where you can relax and just cozy up and read something.”</p>

<p id="HTwf8U">Fans will likely recognize Beckert’s style from the alternate art cover of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/11/16/21569738/dungeons-dragons-tashas-cauldron-of-everything-review"><em>Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything</em></a>, which was released in 2020. The artist, who works in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3nSSOqrWf7/?hl=en">ink and watercolors as well as with oils and powdered graphite</a>, was Herman’s first choice for the project. He praised both the softness of her textures as well as the motion in her composition. You can see it first in the momentum of the smoke over Tasha’s cauldron, and in the movement of her arms. </p>
<p id="i5uETu">On the <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024), Beckert’s prowess and style are expressed through the sinewy curves of the dragon that surrounds the party, almost protectively, before terminating in a cheeky ampersand symbol with the end of its tail. A light source, centered on the dragon’s magical breath, also calls back subtly to the very first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player%27s_Handbook"><em>Player’s Handbook</em></a>, with art by David Trampier that featured a fire-lit golden idol with giant red gems for eyes.</p>
<p id="enctMP">“I think what that old cover does so well,” Herman said, “is it shows people on an adventure. It shows people doing a thing in the middle of an adventure. This is the contrast of that. This is almost your downtime [between adventures]. This is relaxing. We’re at camp, and I’m recovering my spell slots. I’m just relaxing and chilling.”</p>

<p id="pCU34N">Beckert’s art is only one piece of the final cover treatment. The alternate art on each of the three core rulebooks, including the <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024), <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide </em>(2024), and <em>Monster Manual </em>(2025),<em> </em>will also include a special gold filigree border designed by <a href="https://www.smeyerartist.com/">Simen Meyer</a>, a sign painter who created the alternate art covers for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22315969/dungeons-dragons-candlekeep-mysteries-review"><em>Candlekeep Mysteries</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23608660/dnd-dungeons-dragons-keys-golden-vault-best-heists"><em>Keys from the Golden Vault</em></a>. That, along with the 50th-anniversary logo on the back, should make these books stand out in any collection.</p>
<p id="IW8avx">“I genuinely love the idea that a local game store is the first place you can get your hands on something,” Herman said. “And I especially love it that you can do it with the alt cover, too.”</p>
<p id="Nb3KPe">The <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024) will be available for pre-order beginning June 18 before arriving at local game shops on Sept. 3. Fans should expect <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide </em>(2024) a bit later on in November, with <em>Monster Manual (2025) </em>arriving in February next year. </p>

<p>Last week, trademark finder <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1789233776456872005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kurakasis tweeted</a> that Sony and Lego were soon to announce a collaboration of a well-known IP. At the time, Kurakasis revealed the game, but as what seems to be obligatory from insiders these days, I <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1789324181210796309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vaguely tweeted</a> that the project was ‘on the horizon’.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources, it was said that the game is essentially “Horizon Forbidden West but Lego” and that the game will have “realistic graphics” – whatever that means for a LEGO game.</p>



<p>While the exact details of the game are unclear, I got wind of an advertisement trailer for the game which was completed last month, which suggests that an announcement is on its way (although admittingly could be delayed). But combining this information with Kuraksis’ <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1791073620069929442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest tweet</a>, who finds the majority of his information via trademark filings, it suggests that the trademark has recently been registered (brownie points to anyone who finds it), backing up that an announcement could be soon.</p>



<p>Exact details on when the game will be announced are unclear, but recent rumors of a PlayStation Showcase in the coming weeks align nicely with what is happening with this game (trademarks, ad trailers, etc.). </p>



<p>What do you think of a LEGO Horizon Adventures game? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

But it now seems clear Activison has decided on Black Ops 6, which makes sense given Call of Duty 2024 is the sixth main Black Ops game, but that does also mean we’re skipping Black Ops 5 (2020's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Black Ops Cold War</a> looks set to be considered Black Ops 5 in the run).</p><p>Reports from last year indicated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fresh-call-of-duty-2024-details-confirmed-alongside-gulf-war-setting-in-new-report">Black Ops 6 will take place during the Gulf War</a>, additionally touching on the global political fallout after the Cold War. Additionally, the reports suggest the new game will lean back into more traditional military combat tech and Black Ops gadgets, rather than focusing on the futuristic tech some of the more recent Call of Duty games have embraced.</p><p>Currently, Black Ops 6 is planned for a launch in 2024 around roughly the usual time in late fall/early winter. Activision owner <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june">Microsoft has announced an Xbox showcase for June</a>, with a Call of Duty Direct to follow afterwards.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/owlchemy-vision-pro-is-biggest-step-towards-vr-mainstream-adoption.872661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/owlchemy-vision-pro-is-biggest-step-towards-vr-mainstream-adoption<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>We talk to the exec team about virtual reality's latest developments, and why hype cycles are making the journey to mainstream seem longer than it is</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Rumour has it that the Vision Pro is finally getting ready to get shipped outside of the US. Three months after its American launch, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/apple-set-to-sell-vision-pro-headset-internationally-for-first-time">Bloomberg</a> reported that Apple's VR headset could be shipping in several territories worldwide as early as next month, off the back of the firm's Worldwide Developers Conference.</p>
<p>It's unclear how many headsets Apple has shifted since retail availability in the US but the high $3,500 price point has made the Vision Pro somewhat of a niche within a niche product. Global availability could heighten the demand though.</p>
<p>And that's good news for the developers who are supporting the Vision Pro, including Owlchemy Labs. The studio announced back in February that it was porting VR hits Job Simulator and Vacation Simulator to Apple's headset, and CEO Andrew Eiche says that the strategy has always been for the studio's games to be on as many platforms as possible, regardless of how big the platforms are.</p>
<p>"Owlchemy has always been a multi-platform studio even back to the days when we were doing mobile games," he tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. "And so it's less about a niche within a niche and more about the future. I think a lot of what Vision Pro represents, and a lot of what people care about, is they're hearing that this headset has reinvigorated the popularity of XR. I gave a webinar with Unity [about Vision Pro] and it was the most popular webinar they had ever done.</p>
<p>"And so, for us, this particular one is less about 'Oh, we need to be on the most popular headset.' It's more about what is good for the ecosystem. Our games are staples of VR and we love for the people who are just jumping into VR to play our games."</p>
<p>We ask Eiche whether he sees the Vision Pro as a viable platform for the mainstream, or whether he believes that's not the goal here.</p>
<blockquote>"This is less about 'we need to be on the most popular headset', [and] more about what is good for the ecosystem"<cite>Andrew Eiche</cite></blockquote>
<p>"No," he answers. "I see it as one of the biggest steps towards mainstream adoption. I think there's still a lot of things that we have to figure out to get there. But as far as friction [goes], which is one of the biggest things that we fight in XR... It's one of the lowest friction devices. You put it on, there's no room setup, it's not yelling at you to draw circles or whatever, it just runs the apps. There's no caveats to it.</p>
<p>"And I think that, thinking strategically, that's really important to have a headset that you could just put on, it auto adjusts the lenses, it logs you in, it does everything."</p>
<p>The Vision Pro works with hand tracking, so not having to use controllers is also a strong selling point, he says, adding: "I think it represents the biggest step towards changing VR from a specific use case to a general computing use case."</p>
<p>Sandra Marshall, the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jobs-roundup-january-2024-hutch-appoints-peter-hansen-chambers-as-co-ceo#:~:text=Sandra%20Marshall%20%7C%20COO%2C%20Owlchemy%20Labs">newly appointed COO of Owlchemy</a>, is in agreement that reducing friction as much as possible is the key, and that Vision Pro is a good example of that.</p>
<p>"It's in an ecosystem or a platform that people are used to, so if you already have the phone or the watch or whatnot, it's an extension of that, from a UI perspective, to get in and get it set up," she points out.</p>

<p>It feels like every new headset is expected to become <em>the</em> VR headset that will reach mainstream adoption. Back in 2013, <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> contributing editor Rob Fahey was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/can-the-vr-dream-go-mainstream">pondering whether or not the 'VR dream' could go mainstream</a>. And a decade later, it feels like the same questions are still unanswered, with the very same Rob Fahey arguing in 2023 that VR <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/vr-isnt-ready-for-a-must-play-experience-opinion">still isn't ready to play host to the cultural phenomenon that a 'must-play' experience would provide</a>.</p>
<p>We ask the Owlchemy team what they think is missing, and how much longer the journey is going to take.</p>
<p>"I think the thing is that we were spoiled with smartphones," Eiche says. "And we forgot that smartphones had to go through Blackberry, they had to go through Palm… We had to go through all this stuff, and what we remember is Apple showed up and released this magical square that thinks and does everything for you. And you forget that Apple also made the Newton, which was a handheld device way back when, and famously was not successful.</p>
<p>"And I think a lot of what you get with enthusiasm is this kind of short look at things, but what has to happen first is the friction has to go down and we're still not there."</p>
<blockquote>"We need the usefulness of it to rise and there will be an inflection point [when] the device becomes useful enough that the friction is worth it"<cite>Andrew Eiche</cite></blockquote>
<p>Even the best VR headsets feel heavy after a while, or get hot, he points out. And loving VR still sometimes feels like you have to justify yourself because people don't quite get the point.</p>
<p>"We need the usefulness of it to rise and there will be an inflection point," Eiche continues. "And it's going to be the inflection point of when the device becomes useful enough that the friction is worth it.</p>
<p>"For many of us it's there, but it's not there for the mainstream yet. But we're starting to see chipping away at that broader problem. So, I think, as developers and enthusiasts, you always want your eye on mainstream adoption but we need to be less worried about 'Are we there yet?' and more worried about 'Are we on a path to get there?'</p>
<p>"Sometimes technology appears and it's super useful, and you understand. Like Chat GPT shows up one day and everyone just f***ing gets it. But what you forget is that AI started in the '70s, and the first neural network proposal that [eventually] became Chat GPT, that started then, and we're just so used to not watching technology evolve, because it happens behind [the scenes] and then it gets productised and sent out as this great thing... And I think VR is one of the few cases where we've been so openly involved in watching every single step that we're like, 'But I love it, it should be here now!' And it's like… just wait!"</p>

<p>We mention some of the misconceptions VR has to fight, which are not dissimilar to some stigma associated with 2D-screen games at their debut; like the idea that VR is inherently isolating, as opposed to something that can be enjoyed as a group in the same room. (I'll personally always recommend to whoever says that to spend an evening with some friends and Beat Saber. Or Home Improvisation.)</p>
<p>Owlchemy product director Matthew Hemby comments: "Some of that is just also... it takes time. I remember getting my first iPhone and feeling like an absolute a**hole anytime I'd take it out in public. And so to Andrew's point about the tipping point of utility and friction... Some of this is also just us getting comfortable interfacing regularly with new technology around other people."</p>
<p>Marshall argues that people feeling like they're playing together when they're not physically in the same space is something a 2D screen can't give you.</p>
<p>"And I think having more multiplayer games will enable people that have these shared experiences together in a way that you can't get on other platforms," she adds. "The introduction of more mixed reality, as a way to see the environment around you as you have others with you, also contributes to that."</p>
<p>Owlchemy has been working on a multiplayer project that uses hand-tracking, which was announced at Gamescom 2022. So it certainly hopes to continue contributing to the march to mainstream adoption.</p>
<blockquote>"We need to be less worried about 'Are we there yet?' and more worried about 'Are we on a path to get there?'"<cite>Andrew Eiche</cite></blockquote>
<p>The mention of Chat GPT earlier in the conversation leads us to discuss the ebbs and flows of hype cycles, which is currently all about AI but was about VR still not that long ago. And Eiche sees the trend going the same way it did for VR: "You just crash against the wall."</p>
<p>He continues: "Remember, VR was called the empathy machine, it was going to solve all of our problems… We're just at the top of the hype curve here, and a lot of that gets driven by where people want to invest, and very fancy demos. And my opinion [about AI] has always been that I'm very positive on it, but I'm positive on a very boring version of it.</p>
<p>"The ultimate end state of it is not that everybody suddenly has a [machine] over their shoulder just chatting with them all day. The ultimate end state is that you're going to buy an AI as a service package to integrate into your enterprise deployment and some companies are going to offer you that… It's very, very boring. But it's extremely useful.</p>
<p>"But right now, we're in the weird stage where people are over-applying. So, it's a buzzword the way that VR was. And it's funny because the group of people who chase the buzzwords, you always see them; they were in VR, they left VR for crypto, crypto was trash, they went to AI, it turns out AI is actually really hard to make, now Vision's [here] so they're back, and we see them again... And it's this cyclical group, and you're never gonna fix that, you just need to wait for the next buzzword. And then the people who are going to actually build it will stay and they'll work really hard."</p>

The project became a record-breaker after amassing over 3.2 million wishlists on Steam (a platform record) and topped 1 million sales within 24 hours of its early access debut.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hooded Horse co-founder and CEO Tim Bender said the title has exceeded the company's wildest expectations. "It's been wonderful to see so many players give </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a try," said Bender. "We had some pretty optimistic expectations and even some wild hopes, but reaching two million copies on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> so quickly has exceeded even those."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hooded-horse-co-founder-says-publishers-should-ditch-horrible-recoup-clauses-to-help-devs">recent interview with Game Developer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Bender explained Hooded Horse began to suspect </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might do well after a Steam Next Fest demo generated around 500,000 wishlists during the event. Another 800,000 wishlists arrived in the two weeks prior to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> early access launch thanks to an upswing in press and influencer coverage, but still Bender refused to get carried away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As much as I'd like to say 'I saw it coming.' Anybody would have to be absolutely arrogant to expect that.

If I expected that I would have been insane. I was hoping for half of that," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As of May 11, which is when we spoke with Bender, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had a lifetime wishlist conversion rate of 26 percent. Bender clarified that percentage was different on launch day because more players have wishlisted the title since, but it's a metric that's indicative of the title's colossal success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The great thing is, you'd think because we launched with little over 3 million wishlists, that would mean we now have less than 3 million wishlists. But the wishlists have been increasing with the sales, so we still have over 3 million," added Bender. "It has basically built wishlists back up as quickly as it's converted them, so it's going to have a long future."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Bender, fostering longevity is about encouraging players to hop aboard when the time is right–even if that means waiting for future discounts or the full launch. "I did the thing in business school they tell you not to do, but I told players more discounts are coming," he said. "But we don't mind [customers] waiting. We don't want them to experience regret."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can hear more from Bender, including his thoughts on the use of "fundamentally stupid" recoup clauses in publishing deals, by checking out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hooded-horse-co-founder-says-publishers-should-ditch-horrible-recoup-clauses-to-help-devs">another excerpt from our interview</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p>GameSpot has reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p><p>Nowadays, Ubisoft requires an online connection to install its recent games. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora had this requirement, as will the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-many-games-star-wars-outlaws-physical-edition-requires-internet-connection-to-download/1100-6522531/" data-ref-id="1100-6522531">upcoming Star Wars Outlaws</a>.

Due to the game's always-online requirement, it's completely unplayable with the servers gone, including its single-player content.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows launches on November 15 for PC, Amazon Luna, macOS, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Those who purchase the Gold, Ultimate, and physical Collector's editions will be able to play the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">three days early on November 12</a>.</p>

            <p>
It looks like PS2 game Star Wars: The Clone Wars will join PS Plus next month.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by PlayStation Store price tracker <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2774293/star-wars-the-clone-wars">PS Deals</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/ps2-emulated-star-wars-the-clone-wars-listed-on-playstation-store">Gematsu</a>), the game will release on 11th June and will likely be part of the next wave of classics available to Premium subscribers.

</p>
<p>
This version of the game will include new modern features, including up-rendering, rewind and quick save functions, and custom video filters.

<p>
Reads the store listing description: "This title has been converted from the PlayStation 2 version to the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles and provides newly added features. Consequently, there may be times where the title plays differently from the PlayStation 2 version, or where some features may cause the title to not function properly. This version does not support the PlayStation 2 console's peripherals, therefore some functionality may not be available."
</p>
<p>
It will also feature offline multiplayer for two players.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars: The Clone Wars released on PS2 in Europe in 2003, alongside similar releases on GameCube and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
Developed by Pandemic Studios and published by LucasArts, it's set during the prequel era and has players controlling both vehicles and popular heroes for its single-player campaign. Multiplayer included four player splitscreen, plus an online mode for the Xbox version.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-headlines-playstation-plus-premium-and-extra-games-for-may">Sony revealed the next wave of games hitting the PS Plus subscription next week</a>, including Red Dead Redemption 2.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-is-pulling-its-own-blockbuster-game-from-ps-plus">Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition will leave the service on 21st May</a>, leading to speculation a PS5 version could be on the way.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sandbox survival adventure&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date, with the game's 1.0 update and console version emerging from the caves in summer.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/4175476431591562550" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>Steam page, the top-down pixel-art survive-'em-up is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on August 27th, which is also when the 1.0 update will arrive for PC.</p>
<p>If you're one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-top-500k-in-two-weeks">hundreds of thousands of people</a> who picked the game up during its Early Access period, you'll be pleased to know that&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s 1.0 update will feature major changes to the game's content and features, and it'll also bring a ton of quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-release-date-1.0-treasure-chests.jpg?itok=nusULWp5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-release-date-1.0-treasure-chests.jpg?itok=7me7PGHc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>is finally emerging from Early Access this summer.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what's actually coming as part of that 1.0 update, developer Pugstorm is remaining tight-lipped for now. The studio says it's got "something cool" planned for the full&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>release, though, and that more information is coming soon.</p>
<p><em>Core Keeper</em>'s Summer update, which was scheduled to launch...well, sometime in summer, will now take the form of a performance and bug fix-focused patch rather than bringing any new content with it.</p>
<p>However, the content that was originally planned for the Summer update will now arrive as part of&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0, so you're not missing out on any extra fun.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s full PC and console release right here. If you've never encountered&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>before, it'll give you a good sense of what kind of game you're in for.</p>

<p><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>is a survival sandbox game in which you (and, optionally, up to seven friends) explore a massive procedurally-generated cave complex, mining and crafting (ahem) your way towards unraveling the mystery of the titular Core.</p>
<p>The game was originally released in Early Access back in March 2022, racking up 100,000 sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-reach-100k-in-two-days">within its first two days on release</a>&nbsp;and breaking the 250,000 barrier <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-top-250k-within-week">within a week</a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out Pugstorm's full vision for&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on August 27th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>When they’re not banding together <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">to take on Sony</a> or attempting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disgruntled-helldivers-2-fans-start-petition-to-bring-back-fired-community-manager">reinstate fired community managers</a>, it turns out that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> players just want to make sure everyone feels included. Included in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op game</a>’s endless war of attrition to protect Super Earth from bugs, robots, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-just-helldivers-2-plenty-of-games-owe-a-lot-to-the-films-of-paul-verhoeven">basic awareness of military propaganda</a>, and included in just having mates. Enter player ‘dremskiy’, whose tragic booting from a private game in which they just wanted to make friends has resulted in so many friend requests that their Steam account won’t accept any more.</p>

<p>This is a story best introduced through the Reddit post that originally chronicled it, so here’s the inciting incident:</p>


<p>Whether through comedic timing or just an earnest desire to buddy up, the post struck a chord with fellow ‘divers, who bestowed upon dremskiy the monkey’s paw previously reserved for the likes of Keanu Reeves or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/let-me-solo-her-has-completed-a-stunning-malenia-only-elden-ring-run">Let Me Solo Her</a> - temporary Reddit deification. Soon, dreamskiy had so many friend requests that Steam got jealous and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cshou1/dremskiy_have_frends/">put a halt to them</a>.</p>
<p>If this is all a bit too UWU wholesome for your tastes, then never fear. There is a sardonic lining to this candyfloss cloud, you fonts of perpetual misery. It didn’t take long for the official Helldivers 2 Xitter account to get in on the meme. We love a terminally online brand rep. However, when Playstation UK’s account <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1csmqzi/not_you_lol/%22%3Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1csmqzi/not_you_lol/">tried to join in the fun</a>, they were soon heartily ratio’d, as is the custom of our times.</p>
<p>This might have something to do with the fact that, despite earlier promises, Sony have started quietly <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldiversmedia/status/1789049418404229409">locking out </a>certain countries without PSN account access from playing the game they’ve already purchased on Steam. <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldiversmedia/status/1789337531517219154">This Helldivers 2 news account</a> has a handy map of affected locations, including the majority of Africa. My sources tell me this is some bullshit, a take I have corroborated with myself. Let's hope a better solution is found sharpish, before players start teaming up to change international laws or something. </p>

						<h5>Die by the Blade</h5><p><span>May 16th, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam, Epic Games Store)</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Grindstone, Triple Hill Interactive, Toko Midori Games</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>The late 90s were a great time for video games as a whole. Instead of focusing on certain franchises that were sure to sell well, developers worldwide were constantly attempting to innovate established genres. Squaresoft, now Square Enix, was among the Japanese developers more willing to experiment, dipping their toes in many different genres, including the fighting games genre, with series like Tobal and Bushido Blade. The latter, despite only being comprised of two entries, is still well-regarded today for having managed to create an experience centered around 1-hit-kill mechanics that worked surprisingly well, and very few games managed to replicate properly.</p>
<p>Die by the Blade by Grindstone is only the latest fighting game that attempts to become a modern-day Bushido Blade. Unfortunately, the long development time wasn't enough to make it a game worth playing for fans of the series, as its decent core mechanics are marred by the subpar execution of everything that surrounds them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240514124106_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike most modern fighting games that attempt to draw the player in with elaborate story modes, Die by the Blade doesn't even feature a semblance of one. There's little to no information on the bland roster of characters, and what little there is, found in the Characters menu, doesn't say much about the samurai punk world they inhabit. From what can be gleaned from the brief descriptions available, a mega-corporation called Praxis is about doing all sorts of shady business which involves the main characters, whose names like Yoshi, Daisuke, Ronin, and Butterfly are as appealing as their design, but this is not elaborated in any way in the game.</p>
<p>While this is usually not a major issue for a fighting game, it most definitely is Die by the Blade. Getting players invested in the characters and their stories is what brought fans into Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Soul Calibur, Guilty Gear, and even Bushido Blade itself, whose story was among the highlights of the experience. The lack of such, in conjunction with the aforementioned bland character design, doesn't really work in the game's favor. There's simply no reason to care about these individuals, and this hurts the experience immensely.</p>
<p>The fact that the characters essentially all play the same doesn't help either. In Die by the Blade, the weapon dictates the moveset, as the characters only have some light differences in stats. Yoshi, for example, is the most balanced character, while Butterfly sacrifices Resolve, a stat that indicates stamina, for Speed. The combination of the seven characters and five weapons (Katana, Chokuto, Nodachi, Wakizashi, and Naginata) should provide players with plenty of options, but in reality, the differences between characters are minimal, and they do not matter as much as the weapons of choice do.</p>
<p>No matter the selected character and weapon, Die by the Blade plays unlike most fighting games on the market. Inside smallish 3D arenas, two players confront one another using their weapons, and the first one to get hit dies. Matches do not have a timer in most modes outside Challenges, so rounds could last very long if none of the players make any mistakes.</p>
<p>Being a 1-hit-kill experience, offense and defense work differently from most modern fighting games, centered on a stance system controlled with the right stick. Depending on the stance, it is possible to block the opponent's attack automatically if the stances match and unleash different vertical and horizontal attacks as well as Sequences, combo strings that can pressure the opponent heavily. Defensive options also include a parry, which allows the character to block any attack in a short time window after activation, regardless of the chosen stance, rolling, and sidestepping. Each of these techniques is effective in avoiding certain types of attacks, so mastering all of them is extremely important to win matches. Each must also be used judiciously, as it is not only dangerous due to this rock-paper-scissor system but also impossible due to the aforementioned Resolve system. This stamina gauge gets depleted by performing any combat action, and once depleted, attacks become slow, and it is impossible to auto-parry attacks. Hence, keeping it up is just as important as keeping an eye on the opponent.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240514123941_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the clunky movement, animations, and slight input delay are difficult not to notice, I must admit that the Die by the Blade core mechanics hold decent potential. With some choice tweaking, they could easily become noteworthy. Once a round gets going, the tense exchange of attacks is definitely exhilarating, especially after the Stance mechanics are fully understood, and the gruesome Finishers unleashed after certain Sequences are performed contribute to making the game feel like a true duel to the death.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as mentioned, these core mechanics are marred by the subpar execution of everything surrounding them. The biggest offender, in my opinion, is the camera. Not only is the angle not very good for proper positioning, but it rotates for no reason every time an attack is parried. There are plenty of good reasons why the camera is consistent in fighting games, but Grindstone went for a cinematic approach that doesn't work well. The game also lacks visual clarity due to the sparks produced by parrying and blocking, so, in conjunction with the camera, it sometimes is difficult to understand what is going on, a critical issue in a 1-hit-kill game. Clarity issues are further compounded by certain arenas, like the dojo, which have some visibility and lighting issues.</p>
<p>Die by the Blade also leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to content. Alongside the extremely limited number of characters and movesets, the game features only a few play modes that do not even cover the essentials. Offline modes include a Versus and Tournament Mode, and single-player modes are limited to a Tutorial Mode, a Practice Mode that lacks important features like the ability to pin Sequences input on screen to practice them, and a Challenges mode, a basic survival mode that pits the player against a sequence of generic grunts for no reward other than Player Experience and Coins. These two currencies are part of the atrocious system used by Die by the Blade to unlock additional content, such as characters, weapons, customization options, and even play modes.</p>
<p>What makes this system horrible, besides the fact that it locks essential content like characters and weapons behind an arbitrary progression system reminiscent of free-to-play games, is the small amount of XP handed out - 50 points per victory, 5 per defeat. As such, it can take well over two hours to unlock everything, which is a very long time for a game without compelling play mode. The system seems to have been thought out to pad the game out and attempt to hide the fact that it offers very little.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240507130013_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Online modes in Die by the Blade don't fare much better. Unfortunately, I couldn't test out the netcode due to the low online population during the review period, and I will update this part of the review accordingly once the game is out. Still, even if it was the best implementation of rollback netcode around, it wouldn't really change the fact that the mode selection is just as limited as the offline one. Besides Ranked Matches and Ranked Tournaments, the game only offers a friendly match mode that requires the host player to invite another player. The lack of casual matchmaking feels like a major oversight, although I feel it may have been a conscious choice from the developer not to disperse its player base among different matchmaking pools. Even after it launches on consoles later this year, I feel Die by the Blade will become one of those niche Discord fighting games that only get to be played by a small community.</p>
<p>Die by the Blade also disappoints in regards to visuals and performance. Simply put, the character models look undetailed, are stiffly animated, and have no visual flair that distinguishes them. Same for the environments. They are the blandest take on the "samurai punk" theme that powers the experience, and they have nothing remarkable going on for them. They are empty and feel completely lifeless. With such underwhelming visuals, seeing how even performance wasn't good was baffling. On the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM), the game ran at an average of 116 FPS during a benchmark session in the Challenges mode with DLSS Quality and maximum settings. While the average framerate was high, frame times were all over the place, with evident stuttering before the match began and during Finishers. The 32 1% low recorded during the benchmark session tells everything there is to say regarding the smoothness of the experience.</p>

<p>Despite some decent core mechanics, Die by the Blade seems to lack a solid vision, featuring design choices suggesting both competitive and casual, single-player approaches that are not realized in the slightest. As such, it is very difficult to recommend the game to anyone in its current state, especially to the Bushido Blade fans who have waited so long for a spiritual successor worthy of its name.</p>

<p>Solid core mechanics are not enough to make Die by the Blade the compelling spiritual sequel of the Bushido Blade series fans have been waiting for a long time. Bland character design, clunky animations, horrendously slow progression system, extreme lack of content and mediocre visuals are only some of the issues that mar an experience that is very difficult to recommend to anyone in its current state.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/poed-definitive-edition-review-more-like-pooed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In all likelihood, you saw the headline of this review or scrolled down to check out the score before coming to read this here introduction. If that's the case, let me tell you: yes, <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition</em> is not a good game. But I must also emphasize this is of no fault to <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios">Nightdive Studios</a>, the excellent developer that ported this confusing mess of a "game."</p>
<p>If you're like me, you never knew it existed until <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poed-definitive-edition-nightdive">Nightdive announced its remaster</a> on April 1st of this year. A fitting date to announce this incredibly frustrating and bizarre game, but at the same time, I'm glad to have played it. Originally released in 1995 on the 3DO, this obscure retro shooter narrowly avoids its fate of falling into obscurity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poed-platforming.jpg?itok=TjiCzPzt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poed-platforming.jpg?itok=cTiYL2fE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They had a vision for this game, and I still don't know what it was.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Confusing World that is <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition</em></h2>
<p>When <em>Po'ed</em> was released, it was still during the frontier period of FPS development: <em>Wolfenstein </em>led to <em>Doom</em>, which led to a boom of pioneers testing the limits of what the first-person shooter genre could achieve. In came <em>Heretic </em>and entries for juggernaut franchises like <em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>. And then there was <em>Po'ed</em>.</p>
<p><em>Po'ed </em>is a confusing mess of a game, marred with issues ranging from its movement and level design, all the way down to levels that look unfinished or haphazardly put together. Its arsenal of weapons is a bit more unique than other FPS games and certainly, the enemy design stays with you. But it is generally unpleasant to play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poed-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=hEz03ytA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poed-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=S4p1__0c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Chess? Well, that's a choice to have in your level.</figcaption></figure><p>Levels start out easy enough -- just make it to the end teleporter to move on to the next area. It is most certainly <em>not</em> a corridor shooter. <em>Po'ed</em> favors wide open spaces, some of which are shockingly large for a game of its era. It <em>is</em> actually impressive to see this, even though most of this wide open space feels like bloat.</p>
<p>For most of the campaign, you're equipped with a jetpack to help navigate these spaces while shooting at foes all the while. The jetpack's pretty darn fun to use and, once you get the hang of the controls, is pretty smooth. The downside to using the jetpack is you might end up motion sick, and no, I'm not talking about in the game.</p>
<p>The way the jetpack lurches around actually made me nauseous, and I went through extensive testing to come to this conclusion. The way the jetpack lurches the camera around can be a bit jarring, so keep that in mind and perhaps adjust the FOV if you run into this issue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poed-level-design.jpg?itok=8yYFFfV5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poed-level-design.jpg?itok=GKYkuKeD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hope you have jetpack fuel for this one.</figcaption></figure><p>If I had to describe <em>Po'</em><em>ed</em>'s level design in one word, it would be "experimental." Everything has this slapdash look to it, with floating platforms and environments placed with no rhyme nor reason. This leads to some truly confusing moments, and you get lost. It seemed nigh unable to find what I needed to to do proceed, and this strange level design exacerbated this.</p>
<p>To proceed, it would often end up that you'd need to kill a certain amount of enemies or hit switches hidden in such absurd locations. It seemed almost impossible to proceed without consulting a guide, which someone had thankfully made years prior. I don't mind exploring, but it's frustrating when the solution to move forward is so absurdly vague.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poed-laser-gun_0.jpg?itok=pI-Em3HG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poed-laser-gun_0.jpg?itok=fWf2Fb-N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This gun was actually fun to use but ate up a lot of ammo.</figcaption></figure><h2>Butt-Aliens and More -- Welcome to the <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition</em> Experience</h2>
<p>So yes, <em>Po'</em><em>ed</em> has these puzzle elements in its level design, but it's also an FPS, so there are plenty of enemies and shooting. You have an eclectic cast of enemies like butt-aliens that shoot foul projectiles, retro robots, and other strange beasts.</p>
<p>The most annoying of the bunch are these flying enemies that are so difficult to hit, especially when you consider<em> </em>your shots auto-target enemies. With dozens of little floaty bastards zooming to and fro, contending with auto-targeting is the last thing I want to deal with.</p>
<p>When you're not zipping around on a jetpack blasting away at enemies, you can wrestle with two wonderful movement options. I like to call them "sluggish and slippery," since the base walk just isn't fast enough and the sprint makes it feel as though you're running on ice -- this makes for some rather frustrating gunplay, especially if you try to platform around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poed-pistol.jpg?itok=oW43kS4u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poed-pistol.jpg?itok=kVturmaO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's the classic starting pistol for <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition</em>. It's fine, I guess.</figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, the cast of weapons is at least adequate. You have a range of alien-like energy weapons, a frying pan and drill for melee, a flamethrower, and a few more. It's nothing crazy, but these weapons get the job done, sound pretty cool, and nothing feels underpowered. I didn't like using the flamethrower, though, since it shared fuel with the jetpack.</p>
<p><em>Po'ed</em> got a generous helping of touch-ups to make it accessible and playable on PC at 144 FPS. It runs flawlessly, to Nightdive's credit. The biggest thing going for <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition</em> is that Nightdive did the amazing work of bringing it over to their proprietary engine. This includes visual enhancements.</p>
<p>Said visual enhancements only go so far with <em>Po'ed</em>, though, as the overall art direction is ugly. Repeated, drab textures and a lack of visual cohesiveness are rampant in <em>Po'ed</em>. I applaud Nightdive's efforts in creating a more legible game, but you can only do so much when the original product itself wasn't all that appealing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poed-rtx.jpg?itok=OMTro_Xf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poed-rtx.jpg?itok=zfpqC3dh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kudos to Nightdive for doing what they could to enhance this game.</figcaption></figure><h2>Po'ed: Definitive Edition Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Anything <em>Po'ed</em> does, just about any other FPS does better. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-review-return-of-kex"><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em></a> came out a year before and its level design is far more advanced, and visually much more appealing; <em>Hexen</em>, out the same year as <em>Po'ed</em>, managed to create an awesome fantasy atmosphere and keep levels looking fresh. <em>Po'ed</em> does none of that.</p>
<p>Nightdive could have easily let <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition </em>live in near obscurity, but I appreciate their gumption in porting a very strange game that isn't nearly as fun as its predecessors. Though I may be harsh on<em>&nbsp;</em>this title, sometimes it's fun to check out the weirder side of gaming, and <em>Po'ed: Definitive Edition </em>matches that criteria.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Po'ed: Definitive Edition </strong>was reviewed on PC with a code provided by the publisher over roughly 5 hours of gameplay. All screenshots in this review were taken by the reviewer during gameplay. </em></p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
It's commendable work by Nightdive to port this obscure title, but it's no wonder they announced its existence on April Fool's Day. Po'ed: Definitive Edition is a confusing mess of a game to play, but it does leave a lasting impression. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

Without spoiling too much, you can expect all kinds of excitement, including new and unique ways to play and ways to customise your game. We don’t know about you, but everything suddenly feels very real right now!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Tell Us More About What’s Coming in 1.0!</strong></p><p>You’ve probably noticed that we’ve been a little secretive when it comes to revealing 1.0 content, and that’s because we’ve got something cool coming up. In true teaser fashion, we can’t reveal what this is yet, but we can let you know that we’ll be bringing you a much closer look at what’s coming in 1.0 soon. You’ll have to hang on until then, Explorers, but we promise it’ll be worth the wait.</p><p><strong>Summer Update Details</strong></p><p>Those of you following our roadmap will recall that we’ve got one last update coming before we launch in 1.0. Our Summer Update was originally positioned as a minor update, which usually means a little bit of new content to play with. After a lot of careful consideration—and, of course, taking a good long look at community feedback—we wanted to work on what matters to you, so we’ve decided to reformat this update slightly.</p><p>We’ll still be releasing our Summer update, but this will now focus on performance and bug fixes to ensure the game is in as enjoyable a state as possible ahead of its full launch. That isn’t to say that we won’t continue to work on optimisations between the Summer Update and 1.0, just that we have heard your comments and feedback across all of our channels and we agree that we should be making playability a priority right now.</p><p>Oh, and don’t worry, the new playable content that we had planned for the Summer update hasn’t been scrapped; this is now coming with our 1.0 launch so you can experience it at its best.</p><p>That’s everything from us for now, Explorers! We’re beyond excited to finally be able to begin our 1.0 countdown. Keep an eye out for more news, information, and announcements from us here on Steam, over in the official Core Keeper community Discord, and on X!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Core Keeper - Console &amp; PC 1.0 Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ga6q6vUluzE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-has-entered-a-second-galactic-war-after-players-failed-to-kill-enough-automatons/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=helldivers-2-has-entered-a-second-galactic-war-after-players-failed-to-kill-enough-automatons<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="431" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s meta-narrative has constantly kept players on their toes since everyone’s contributions to missions has a tangible effect on how the Galactic War plays out, with it entirely possible to fail the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-how-to-track-major-orders-and-war-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Major Orders</a> and lose control of planets. But perhaps the biggest shake-up is the community’s recent failure, which has triggered what developer Arrowhead Game Studios is calling the Second Galactic War.</p> <p data-characters="615" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">For context, players were tasked with killing two billion Automatons in five days, but only managed to reach 78% of the goal. An in-game update and a post to the <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord (which has since been shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1csoqe8/the_second_galactic_war_has_begin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>) states, “The war now escalates into what is officially called The Second Galactic War,” adding that everything up until this point was only part of an “elaborate special operation.” There is something quietly terrifying about all the chaos, destruction, and death so far as being but a prelude, though that also makes <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s future all the more exciting.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="938" data-injectable="true">This failure also means players won’t be unlocking a new <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-stratagem-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stratagem</a>, but Arrowhead says it will “elude the Helldiver arsenal for now,” suggesting there’ll be another way to obtain it later down the line. Perhaps the most intriguing detail is that players are expected to protect training facilities full of new recruits. Some players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1csnxll/it_was_all_just_a_special_military_operations/?sort=top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> suspect this is leading up to an actual in-game mechanic, such as a Stratagem that lets you summon NPC allies to help you in battle. I’ve also seen it suggested that the new recruits in question are actually meant to be new players via a free trial or an Xbox port.</p>
 <p data-characters="656" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">An Xbox port sounds like wishful thinking considering <em>Helldivers 2</em> is a Sony published game. There has been a demand for it, though, and Microsoft has shown a willingness to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-confirms-which-four-xbox-games-are-heading-to-new-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">port some of its exclusives to PlayStation</a>. Sony’s general manager Sadahiko Hayakawa did also comment on the importance of improving player engagement during an earnings call (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693040-sony-group-corporation-sony-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Seeking Alpha</a>): “By steadily maintaining and expanding the consistently increased number of active users and user engagement while also strengthening control over business costs, we believe that we will be able to steadily increase sales and profits on the PS platform going forward.”</p>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">Bringing a game as popular as <em>Helldivers 2</em> to Xbox would certainly improve player engagement, though whether Sony is genuinely considering putting one of its biggest successes on a rival platform is something only the company knows.</p>

Always Sunny in Philadelphia star Danny DeVito has been asked whether he'd take on the role of Wario in a Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel, after having been suggested for the role by Luigi voice actor Charlie Day and Mario performer Chris Pratt.
</p>
<p>
Day, who co-stars with DeVito in Always Sunny in Philadelphia, previously told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amXv_9pg3SM">Digital Spy</a> he wanted the actor to take on the role of Mario's moustache-twirling, nose-picking nemesis in a future film. 
</p>
<p>
Now, DeVito has been asked whether he'd accept the offer and, seemingly unwittingly, has replied with the perfect money-grabbing Wario response.

<p>
"I'm going to take them to the cleaners," DeVito told YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAn3Q61q8Io">TheMovieDweeb</a> - which sounds pretty similar to something the loot-loving Wario would say. "But I should be in the movie."
</p>
<p>
"You never know what happens in the world," DeVito said when asked about taking on the Wario role in future. "I'm up for a lot of things. I'm up for - I'm ready to do a lot of things. Whatever's coming, I look at, I see, I evaluate."
</p>
<p>
Will we see Wario make his big screen debut in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-bros-movie-will-release-in-2026">next Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, set to arrive in cinemas in 2026? </p>
<p>Nintendo is, so far, keeping the plot and main characters of the next Mario movie under-wraps, though we've already donned our plumber's thinking cap and overalls to speculate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-the-mario-movie-series-may-go-next">where the Super Mario Bros. series might go next</a>.

            <p>Absurd Ventures, the company started by Rockstar Games co-founder and head writer Dan Houser after he left said juggernaut, are working on a new "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> action-adventure" game. That's according to recent job listings on Absurd's website (cheers <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/rockstar-co-founder-and-former-gta-lead-dan-houser-is-making-an-open-world-action-adventure-game-of-his-own-at-his-new-studio/">Gamesradar</a> for the spot), which mention such a thing. And to be honest, are any of us surprised? Not really. Will the finished product resemble GTA to some degree? I imagine yes. Am I happy about this? Yeah, go on then.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Last year, Absurd Ventures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-co-founder-and-gta-writer-dan-houser-founds-new-company-absurd-ventures">said</a> they'd, "create a new IP across all platforms and for all formats", with a focus on storytelling. On top of that, they said they'd produce "narrative worlds" in the form of other things like books, graphic novels, and podcasts.</p>
<p>Later, a couple of those worlds would be <a href="https://x.com/AbsurdVentures/status/1729909061683155364">unveiled</a> as American Caper and A Better Paradise, American Caper being a graphic novel and A Better Paradise an audio drama, but both likely to spin off into other forms in the future.</p>
<p>All of this is to say, Absurd Ventures now have a bunch of roles going on their <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/careers#4366082007">site</a> and some of them give a glimpse into the game they're working on. The Lead Gameplay Designer vacancy mentions an open world action-adventure game, but also someone to help develop "best-in-class combat" and "third person action across multiple game modes". There's also mention in this listing of someone with knowledge of "melee and shooting mechanics", as well as "driving, mounts, climbing, traversal, platforming, etc."</p>
<p>A look at some of the other roles on offer, like Senior Art Director, don't really give anything away. It's the usual spiel of delivering on a "creative vision" and "aligning with the game's design and narrative goals". Yeah, uhuh, cool.</p>
<p>So what can we surmise from all of this? Absurd Ventures are working on a game that sounds quite like GTA. But if their latest <a href="https://x.com/AbsurdVentures/status/1790448666844754190">Xweet</a> is any indication of the vibe they're setting, I'd imagine it's going to be edgy alright.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japanese-switch-online-players-just-got-an-important-piece-of-zelda-history.872598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/24157710/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-links-awakening-the-frog-for-whom-the-bell-tolls<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YTeolB">While here in the US the Nintendo Switch Online service got <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157336/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-update-super-mario-land">three new Mario games this week</a> (yes, <em>Alleyway </em>is a Mario game), the update for Japan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4czuDKwgc8">included a bonus classic</a> you may not have heard of. <em>Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru</em> (officially translated as <em>The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>) was a Japanese Game Boy release, co-developed by the familiar tag-team of Nintendo R&amp;D1 and Intelligent Systems, responsible for much of the Game Boy’s lineup. And while <em>The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls </em>may not be a household name, if you’re a fan of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23609051/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-nintendo-switch-online-ending"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em></a> (and who isn’t?) you should take the time to play it.</p>
<p id="VfJMLS">“<em>Link’s Awakening</em>’s development story is retold time and time again, but what’s almost always left out is that it’s built directly on top of [...] <em>Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru</em>,” Nintendo Life’s Jon Cartwright details in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaOhJbSufJI">this excellent video</a>. That is really apparent when you see the game in motion. From the engine to the font to the transition from top-down to side-scrolling, <em>The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls </em>should look familiar.</p>
<p id="9wYiKi">Something else should look familiar to those of you who have played <em>Link’s Awakening</em>. Prince Richard, the weird guy with the frogs living in Pothole Field, who asks you to help him find his five Golden Leaves? That character is actually from <em>The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>, and even the music that plays in his villa is a variation on that game’s theme. Here’s a description from Marc Normandin’s fun <a href="https://retroxp.substack.com/p/its-new-to-me-for-the-frog-the-bell">RetroXP newsletter</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p id="TLLzVC">Prince Richard is actually not the protagonist of For the Frog the Bell Tolls, but is instead the best friend of him. The protagonist is the Prince of Sable, named and controlled by you. The adventure begins with the two princes (oh no) finding out that a princess is in trouble and must be saved, leading to the two trying to race the other to the finish line.</p></blockquote>

</p></div>
<p id="hrEv6R">Another familiar face for the Smash Bros. fans out there is the aforementioned Prince Sable, who shows up as an Assist Trophy, using his frog and snake powers. Oh right, about those, again <a href="https://retroxp.substack.com/p/its-new-to-me-for-the-frog-the-bell">from Normandin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="OpsBjG">Prince Sable can transform into a frog or a snake, and eventually, can do so basically at will. A witch turns Prince Richard and his men — who arrived to save Princess Tiramisu from Delarin first — into frogs, and then later on, turns the Prince of Sable into a frog as well.</p></blockquote>

<p id="bYvilN">If you don’t live in Japan or don’t read Japanese, don’t worry! An <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/translations/1623/">English fan translation</a> was created in 2011, which can be applied to a copy of the ROM . (Or, if you prefer, <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/translations/6517/">here is an updated version</a> that changes the title from <em>For the Frog the Bell Tolls</em> to Nintendo’s now “official” translation <em>The Frog for Whom the Bell Tolls</em>.) As far as how to apply patches to ROM files, or how to dump a cartridge to obtain a ROM file, I will leave that up to you and your ability to search the internet. From there, you just need to find a suitable emulator — and these days <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150467/delta-emulator-apple-app-voice-notes-ai-vergecast">even iPhones</a> are in on the game. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-outlines-skull-and-bones-season-2-after-tremendous-response-to-the-game-since-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> Season 2 is on the way after what Ubisoft called a “tremendous response” from the game’s community.</p><p>Skull and Bones launched in February on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, anbd PC (but not on Steam) after years of delays and was thought to have suffered from low player numbers. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skull-and-bones-review">Skull and Bones review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Skull and Bones is a maritime RPG with a strong foundation, even if it feels like a live-service first draft.”</p><p>Season 1 soon followed, and now Ubisoft has confirmed what to expect from Season 2. “Let us begin by saying how amazing it has been for all of us working on Skull and Bones to witness the tremendous response from our entire community since the launch of our game,” Ubisoft said in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/skull-and-bones/news-updates/4JskVoFQcIbc50OENc1JxT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post.</a>. "From the ways our players engage with our game and content, to the ton of screenshots, videos and livestreams shared across social media, Discord and Reddit."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Skull and Bones - The Complete Timeline</h3></div></output><p>“It is thanks to your incredible engagement, that we were able, throughout Season 1, to observe, listen, understand, and more importantly react to your feedback on a weekly basis," Ubisoft continued. "Our commitment continues to remain the same - to create and update our game together, with our community. This wouldn't have been possible without the passion and dedication you've shown to Skull and Bones.”</p><p>During its most recent financial report, Ubisoft failed to say how many copies Skull and Bones sold since going on sale at full price on February 16. But it did say the game saw “strong engagement”, with the second-best daily playtime for a Ubisoft game. That included an average of four hours in the first weeks following launch. Ubisoft put this down to end-game content that launched with Season 1.</p><p>“We target to further improve this retention and enlarge the player base with the upcoming launch of Season 2, Chorus of Havoc, that will continue to enrich the end-game with the addition of new bosses, world events and ship upgrades,” Ubisoft added. “Season 2 will also bring new PvE &amp; Solo game modes.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ubisoft has committed to at least one full year of content for Skull and Bones, divided up into four seasons. It will be interesting to see if the game gets a second year of support.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/screenshot-2024-05-16-115926-1715857180291.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Ubisoft further detailed Season 2 in the blog post. Here are the notes:</p><h2>Skull and Bones Season 2 key features and improvements preview</h2><p>With Season 2, we're bringing many improvements to our end game loop, adjustments to our seasonal formula and a ton of new content which we believe will address some key concerns from the community.</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Ship Upgrades, which will allow you to upgrade your ships to improve ship stats and gain new perks.</li><li>Fleet Management, which will allow you to assign ships to manufactories to automatically collect pieces of eight.</li><li>Helm Leases, which will allow you to acquire a manufactory of your choice.</li><li>New PvE &amp; Solo Game Modes</li><li>Balancing the costs of our Manufactories</li></ol><p>These changes come in addition to the new content (new boss fight, new sea monster, new ship, weapons, armors and furniture) that will be introduced and communicated to you through additional dev updates and devblogs, in the upcoming days/weeks on Discord, Reddit, Social Media and our website.</p><h3>Seasonal reset</h3><p>With Season 2 right around the corner, many of you have been eager to find out what exactly is going to change when Season 1 ends.</p><h3>Rewarding your achievements and preparing for season 2</h3><p>Our seasonal model on Skull and Bones is designed around the idea that players fight against seasonal antagonists, Sea Monsters and other Ghost Ships to protect The Helm's smuggling activities and grow both their profit and influence in the Indian Ocean.</p><p>Each new season in Skull and Bones sees the arrival of a new threat, coming to disrupt and force the Helm and its associates to adapt the way they operate and manage their trading network.</p><p>With Season 1, we deliberately took the time we needed to carefully monitor and understand your feedback and the way you engage with our game content. The learnings we gathered throughout the season helped us make the necessary adjustments and balancing to our end game economy, features, and systems. Now that Season 2 is coming, we can share more details on the full list of rewards that will be handed out to the most successful Kingpins from Season 1.</p><p>The first thing we announced during a previous livestream of The Deck was that everyone who reached the Diamond Rank on the leaderboards by the end of Season 1, would receive the cosmetic set at the beginning of Season 2.</p><p>In addition, we will also be rewarding those of you who successfully and significantly grew their empire, with some of the new items coming with our Season 2 update: World Helm Leases and Ship Upgrade Parts. These two items will become key in growing your fleet of ships, acquiring the manufactories of your choice, and get a head start in shaping your empire to your strategy.</p><p>As stated above, with the end of each season, and the arrival of a new antagonist, comes significant disruption to The Helm and their smuggling operations. As a result, all players will see their ranks on the leaderboards, their manufactories, and upgrades be reset. Not all is lost however, as your efforts have been recognised by The Helm's representative, who will trust you with new tools to re-build your empire and prove your worth as a Pirate Kingpin once again.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/screenshot-2024-05-16-115809-1715857094499.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Last but not least, we will not be fully resetting the number of Pieces of Eight collected throughout Season 1 but applying a soft reset instead to all players who accumulated more than 300,000 Pieces of Eight. Effectively, most of you will get to keep all your Pieces of Eight in your wallet, while a few will see their balance reduced to that number.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

If true, it would be the first new PS2-emulated title to come to PS5 or PS4 since 2019. And given the June 11 release date, Star Wars: The Clone Wars may well launch into the Classics Catalog titles as part of the June PS Plus lineup.</p><p>Star Wars: The Clone Wars was developed by Pandemic Studios and published by LucasArts for GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox across 2002 and 2003.

<p data-characters="433" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Barely any PS2 games have been added to the PlayStation Plus Classics catalog since the service’s 2022 revamp, and the ones that are included are HD conversions or remasters, meaning they lack the additional features seen in the emulated Play Station 1 and PlayStation Portable titles. However, that may be about to change according to a leaked listing for an upcoming re-release of 2002’s <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em> game.</p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">This comes courtesy of <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2774293/star-wars-the-clone-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PS Deals</a> (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/ps2-emulated-star-wars-the-clone-wars-listed-on-playstation-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), which specialises in tracking the backend of the PS Store for updates. The listing obviously isn’t live, but PS Deals was able to find and share a description and screenshots for <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars </em>alongside a purported release date of June 11. This should mean we’ll see the game added to the Classics catalog in next month’s update.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true">What’s most interesting, however, is how the game will be “enhanced with up-rendering, rewind, quick save, and custom video filters.” This will make it the first PS2 game on the catalog to have such features, and seems to suggest that there’ll finally be a dedicated PS2 emulator on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. Ideally, this will result in PS2 games being more frequently added to the service.</p>
 <p data-characters="611" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">I can think of several PS2 classics that myself and fans would love to see arrive on PS Plus via emulation, such as the original <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> and <em>Sly Cooper</em> games. Although I wouldn’t be surprised if more obscure choices took priority considering <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/playstation-plus-premium-ps1-ps2-psp-classics-playable-on-ps4-ps5-game-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s track record with the catalog</a> so far. To date, the PS1 line-up still lacks era defining games like the first <em>Tomb Raider</em> and the <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> series, but does have <em>Buzz Lightyear of Star Command</em>. Not to mention it seems the first of these emulated PS2 games will be a <em>Star Wars</em> movie tie-in rather than any major first-party exclusive.</p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">Still, we can always hope, and more PS2 games is better than none. It should at least add some extra value to the Premium tier for PS Plus and, depending on which games are added, could incentivise more people into subscribing. Maybe one day, Sony will somehow get a PlayStation 3 emulator working too, so we don’t have to make do with its cloud streaming service to play old PS3 games.</p>

            <p>
Toys for Bob has updated its website with a new logo, leading to fan speculation of new Crash Bandicoot or Spyro games.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.toysforbob.com/">The website</a> now leads to a black page with just a new central logo of a Tiki mask in purple. What could it mean?
</p>
<p>
Toys for Bob is, of course, most notably the developer behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time and the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. The Tiki mask would hint at Crash, while the purple colour would indicate Spyro.

<p>

Does this mean the company is in fact working on new games in these series? Fans have certainly been <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1790818824465330387">speculating as much on social media</a>.

<figcaption>Is this the new studio logo or something more? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Toys for Bob</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>
Equally, is this just a new logo for the developer that combines the two games? The image itself is named "TFB_LogoVector_TikiMask-purple", which would imply as such. Indeed, one post on X suggests this is an old logo, adding the studio previously had a Tiki bar theme.

Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activisions-skylanders-crash-bandicoot-studio-toys-for-bob-going-independent">studio parted with Activision to go independent</a>, but is "exploring a possible partnership" with Microsoft.

</p>
<p>
That follows Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and subsequent decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">lay off 1900 employees across Xbox</a>, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-layoffs-affect-86-staff-at-spyro-crash-bandicoot-studio">86 from Toys for Bob</a>.


</p>
<p>
"Over the years, we've inspired love, joy, and laughter for the inner child in all gamers," the studio wrote at the time in a statement on its website. "We pioneered new IP and hardware technologies in Skylanders. We raised the bar for best-in-class remasters in Spyro Reignited Trilogy. We've taken Crash Bandicoot to innovative, critically acclaimed new heights."
</p>
<p>
"With the same enthusiasm and passion we believe that now is the time to take the studio and our future games to the next level. This opportunity allows us to return to our roots of being a small and nimble studio."
</p>
<p>
This statement now no longer exists due to the updated website.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24157533/asus-rog-ally-x-prototype-hands-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On June 2nd, Asus will formally announce <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision">the ROG Ally X</a>, a semi-sequel to its handheld gaming PC with <em>a way bigger battery</em>.<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision">We exclusively revealed</a> the broad strokes last Thursday, but I’ve now touched an early engineering sample, too — and I’m pleased to say it’s far more comfortable to hold. </p><p>Asus has made a whole bunch of ergonomic changes that make it practically melt into my hands, in the exact way the original did not. While I still prefer the Steam Deck’s beefier grips and symmetrical thumbsticks, the Ally X could easily be my runner-up.</p><p>First, a disclaimer: <em>this is not what I’d consider a proper hands-on</em>. Asus wouldn’t let me power it on, play any games, or show you any photos. I couldn’t bring the old ROG Ally into the room or use any tools. The company even covered its ports with black electrical tape to keep me from sleuthing too much! </p><p>But I figure you’ll appreciate a discussion of the design changes anyhow. Let’s get into it, shall we? </p><div><figcaption><em>The original ROG Ally, below the original Steam Deck.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Imagine a black ROG Ally — a black version of the white handheld you see in the image above. That’s how the ROG Ally X looks from the front: same big screen bezels, same glossy cover glass, same button layout, same speaker placement, almost the same exact shape throughout. But instead of palm rests with bumpy corners, you now get smooth curves.</p><p>Flip it over, and those curves dominate the handheld’s rear grips, with no more unnecessary edges. Asus no longer makes you try to wrap your fingers around embedded versions of ROG’s trademark diagonal slash — though the iridescent foil slash design mark itself is still there. </p><div><figcaption><em>The back of the original ROG Ally, as a visual aid. The Ally X back buttons and grips are quite different.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The new back buttons no longer embody the slash, either; they’ve been shrunk down to small, almost heart-shaped pebbles and moved further away from the grips. The grips aren’t as beefy as the Steam Deck’s, but there’s enough to get my fingers around.</p><p>Add it all together, and I can now pick up this handheld and hold it above my head without any edges digging into my fingers or palms. It’s easier to grip, and the back buttons no longer get in the way — they’re there if I need them, not if I don’t. </p><p>It’s not a light handheld. The bigger battery will make it a thicker and heavier one, and the engineering sample definitely had more heft than the original. But I wouldn’t say it felt <em>heavy</em>, either, thanks to the added comfort when holding it. </p><p>I won’t guess at its weight, but I <em>can</em> give you an educated guess at thickness: maybe a third of an inch thicker at most. </p><p>How can I tell? I used my index finger as a ruler! The handheld’s “tablet” portion is roughly as thick as the length of my index fingertip, and the grips add roughly the thickness of my index fingernail. Since my fingertip’s about an inch long (27mm), and my fingernail’s about half an inch long (13mm), the Ally X is roughly 1.5 inches and 40mm thick in total. Meanwhile, the original ROG Ally is 1.27 inches (32mm) thick, and 0.83 inches (21mm) of that is its tablet region.</p><p>While I mentioned earlier that the Ally melted into my hands, I do feel saying that is a bit premature: the engineering sample I saw was an entirely unfinished, smooth, cheap-looking piano black, and Asus plans to stipple and texture its grips before launch.</p><p>So that’s the sculpt... what about the rest? It’s pretty hard to judge without actually playing a game, but here’s what <em>I think I noticed</em> playing around:</p><div><ul><li>The ABXY face buttons feel like they’ve nudged slightly southward, closer to the analog stick, so that the B button now slightly intersects the grip</li><li>The face buttons are a little less rattle-y, though they still do pleasingly rattle</li><li>The joysticks now have a nicely tacky rubber coating in the middle, like the Steam Deck OLED — their throw felt slightly tighter, too</li><li>The D-pad now has eight-way indicators and felt very slightly floatier</li><li>The triggers maybe have a touch more throw and still have a nice smooth pull</li><li>There’s still just two back buttons</li><li>It still uses Phillips head screws</li><li>You still get RGB LED ring lights around the sticks; I couldn’t tell if they’d been added to the buttons, but they’re still double-shot</li><li>I could see through vent gaps in the chassis that there’s still a pair of fans inside</li></ul></div><p>That’s all I was able to glean — but if Asus manages to nail comfort <em>and</em> battery life without a much higher price tag, this’ll definitely be a handheld to watch. Leaker @MysteryLupin <a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1789672436918538420">claims it will cost $799</a> and come with 1TB of storage, <a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1790769227214782940">24GB of RAM, and up to eight hours of battery life</a> — but if I recall correctly, Asus claimed the original Ally had up to eight hours of battery life, too.</p><p>I guess we’ll find out in June!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Lies of P DLC expansion is going to be released before the end of the year, developer NEOWIZ confirmed.</p>
<p>As spotted by Ziostorm on <a href="https://twitter.com/Ziostorm1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X/Twitter</a>, the Korean developer confirmed in its latest financial report a second-half of 2024 release window for the DLC. A precise release date hasn't been confirmed, but with so many Summer showcases coming up, it is likely we will learn more about it in the near future.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lies of P DLC will be released later this year according to the Neowiz fiscal report. <br>-<br>It is currently windowed for the second half of 2024, but an exact release date hasn't been announced. The fiscal year for Korea is Jan 1-Dec 31 so we can expect it before the calendar end. <a href="https://t.co/1tq9X1W9hD">pic.twitter.com/1tq9X1W9hD</a></p>
<p>— Ziostorm (@Ziostorm1) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ziostorm1/status/1790751397501177926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lies of P is among the best Soulslike games released in the past few years. While it doesn't even attempt to hide the massive influence FromSoftware's Bloodborne had on it, the game developed by NEOWIZ has enough going on to stand for itself, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Not even attempting to hide the massive influence Bloodborne has had on it, Lies of P is a solid imitation of the game developed by FromSoftware. While it lacks the same combat and world design finesse of its illustrious inspiration, the action role-playing game by NEOWIZ is among the most accomplished soulslike game released this year, thanks to its dark retelling of the story of Pinocchio, combat and character customization tweaks and great enemy design.</em></p>
<p>Lies of P is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

        <p>"We have made the choice to play to our strengths."</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft will now focus on open world and live service games, as it invests in AI to assist development.
</p>
<p>
The strategy was outlined in the company's latest financial report, which claims record annual sales - in particular for the Rainbow Six and Assassin's Creed franchises.
</p>
<p>
The company's next games slot neatly into this strategy: namely Star Wars Outlaws, the newly-revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

<p>

"We have made the choice to play to our strengths and are sharpening our strategic focus on two verticals, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences," reads Ubisoft's latest financial report.
</p>
<p>
"This focus not only offers profitable growth and recurrence prospects but also allows us to leverage and better cross-fertilise Ubisoft's established brands as well as ongoing targeted investments in proprietary technologies to reach and sustain a competitive advantage."
</p>
<p>
For open world games, Ubisoft specifically mentions Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, The Division, Ghost Recon and Star Wars.
</p>
<p>
Notably, open world series Watch Dogs appears to be no more, after the mixed response to the London-set Watch Dogs Legion. 
</p>
<p>
As for live service games, Ubisoft cites the success of Rainbow Six Siege alongside the forthcoming XDefiant, Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft also quietly announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-the-division-heartland-cancelled-three-years-after-being-announced">cancellation of free-to-play shooter The Division Heartland</a>. Little was known about this game, though presumably it somehow did not fit into this new strategy as the company focuses on "bigger opportunities".

</p>
<p>
To achieve all this, Ubisoft is relying on both its "proprietary cutting-edge technologies" to enable innovation and facilitate sharing across studios, as well as using generative AI.
</p>
<p>
At GDC earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-unveils-generative-ai-neo-npcs-and-the-spirit-of-peter-molyneuxs-milo-lives-on">Ubisoft unveiled NEO NPC</a> that uses generative AI to create characters in its games. "It is designed to transform the way players interact with non-playable characters and create more immersive gameplay experiences," said Ubisoft in this new report. "And beyond several ongoing internal projects, Ubisoft also partners with leading AI companies on joint initiatives."

</p>
<p>
NEO NPC remains something of a prototype, so it's unclear if this technology has been used in Assassin's Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws, or if it will be employed in future games instead.
</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A following the report's release, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot provided further details on the AI strategy. "We have two groups working on gen AI," he said. "One pool to the different jobs that we have - marketing, sales, IT, legal, and all the other jobs - where we look at how we can be more efficient, and how we can automatise a certain number of things. That's coming along quite well, with good systems to improve our efficiency there."</p>
<p>The second group is focused on "how we can improve the quality of our games, in making those games more alive. So we did present a new NPC at the last conference. It was well appreciated, and it showed what we will be able to do in our games that will make them more alive and richer. So I expect a lot from gen AI in our games, to make our games more interesting and for people to really have a personalised experience."</p>
<p>
Looking ahead, Ubisoft will reveal more of its forthcoming games at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-forward-showcase-for-june">Ubisoft Forward event</a> on 10th June. We'll likely get further looks at both Assassin's Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws.

</p>
<p>
The showcase takes place the same week as the next Xbox showcase, and Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Games Fest</a>.

			<p>The 12 GB LPDDR5X RAM the Nintendo Switch 2 is rumored to feature could deliver better texture quality than the Xbox Series S, and address many of the visual quality issues of the current Nintendo consoles.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> analyzed the latest round of<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12gb-ram/"> Nintendo Switch 2 leaks</a>, focusing on the 12 GB LPDDR5X RAM the new console is said to feature. This would a massive upgrade over the RAM of the original Switch, which has been proven over and over how much of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-ram-performance/">bottleneck</a> it was for the vast majority of titles. Even if the console's RAM will not run at full speed, it should have more than enough bandwidth for the processor, so multiplatform games are likely not going to compromise too much, considering the 10 GB RAM of the Xbox Series S. The 12 GB RAM will also allow the system to upscale to "reasonable" resolutions using NVIDIA DLSS, which has an intense memory cost, as textures need to be at the resolution of the output resolution to achieve the best results and thus require more memory. This would address the low image quality the current console delivers in docked mode in certain titles, mostly multiplatform games.</p>
<p>Equipped with 12 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, the Nintendo Switch 2 could potentially deliver better texture quality than the Xbox Series S, although the new Nintendo system is unlikely to match the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-chip-hardly-match-xbox-series-s/">performance</a> of the Microsoft's console. Using DOOM Eternal as an example, the Xbox Series S has the processing power to handle the light ray tracing the game features, but not without some heavy trade offs in terms of texture quality, due to its RAM.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-conservative-hardware-evolution/"> Nintendo Switch 2</a> has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p data-characters="239" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As is tradition, Supergiant Games has stuffed <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-is-a-magical-massive-early-access-worth-getting-into-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> with interesting NPCs and interesting dialogue. Of major interest to players is sleepy-headed Hypnos, who can be found napping to the right of Hecate’s cauldron at The Crossroads.</p> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">Hypnos is a returning character from <em>Hades 2</em>, and looks extremely comfortable curled up in his red cloak, strewn in a hammock, and enjoying some rest. He has been asleep since the events of the last game, and was actually brought by Hecate to The Crossroads after Cronos decided to take over Hades. Of course, you will be curious whether it is possible to rouse Hynos from his slumber, so we have the answers you need.</p>
 <h2 id="h-can-you-wake-up-hypnos" data-injectable="false">Can you wake up Hypnos?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="498" data-current-count="798" data-injectable="true">At the moment, it is not possible to wake up Hypnos in <em>Hades 2</em>. Known as “Sleep Incarnate”, he is true to his title and refuses to fully wake, no matter what you do. Should you speak to him he will remain asleep, and even if you give him a gift, you cannot wake him as he will just mumble at you a little. There doesn’t appear to be much reason to give him such gifts right now, so you might as well hold on to them for a while, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-keepsakes-in-hades-2-and-how-to-get-them-nectar-gift-guide/">or give them to other characters to gain Keepsakes</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="568" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">Hypnos in <em>Hades 2</em> is a little different to how he was first shown in the original game. It’s hard to know if this will change dramatically over the course of early access, but Hypnos was one of the very first NPCs we met in the first game. His job was to meet people who made their way to Hades, but would often be asleep on the job. This time around, they are deep in a slumber that we cannot wake them from. It seems likely that it will be our job to wake them up, or we will hit a point in the story as the game develops that will see him wake up on his own. </p>
 <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="false">The first time you speak to him, Melinoë will express a desire to wake him up, so you can bet it is on the cards, one way or another. An interesting piece of information is that Hypnos and Nemesis are actually brother and sister, so you can expect some fun interactions from them when the time comes. I’ll be playing Hades 2 religiously throughout the early access period, and shall return to this article to update it as soon as there is a way to get lazy Hypnos out of bed.</p>

<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve played <em>Warzone</em> since Season 3 Reloaded, there’s a decent chance that you’ve been beaten to death by a Tonfa stick. Despite the developer nerfing them, <em>Warzone</em> players still think they are way too strong, and are begging for them to be made useless. </p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Before the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-may-15-update-patch-notes-riveter-and-tonfa-nerfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 15 patch</a>, the Tonfa killed players faster than any other weapon in the game inside a three-meter distance. That’s because with just three hits of the Tonfa, a player can kill an enemy with full health and three armor plates, which is very strong considering how quickly you can swing it. </p> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">Now, while it takes four hits with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tonfas-have-strong-potential-to-take-over-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tonfa</a> to eliminate players, fans of the battle royale still think it’s too powerful, and were not impressed with the nerf handed down. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>This thing haunts me. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1csqx8a/tonfa_nerf_changed_basically_nothing/?sort=new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> on the official <em>Warzone</em> subreddit, which claimed the patch “changed basically nothing,” players vented their frustrations. </p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">“So useful,” wrote Moistman123456. “Regardless, that little sh*t can still aim-lock you like a free Cronus Zen, hit you so fast you barely have enough time to pull out your gun before getting battered and beaten to oblivion, and it’s still ridiculously overpowered.”</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">As for how they’re performing in-game now, Formal-Cry7565 stated that he had just been “screwed out of a 20 kill win by a dude camping behind a bathroom door with that weapon in about 0.2 seconds,” while Dreadnar called the the nerfs “a joke” and said most people were still running Tonfas in his Plunder matches. </p>
 <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="191" data-injectable="false">With these nerfs seemingly not doing enough, IDKWTFG suggested nerfing “them into oblivion until no one wants to use them, and then slowly buff them back to a level that is fair.”</p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true">“It feels like you could quadruple the TTK on them and they’d still probably be annoying to deal with,” they continued. “If there is anything in this game that feels broken, OP, annoying, [or] doesn’t feel right, it’s dealing with melee.”</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">While it’s good news that <em>Warzone</em>‘s development team is paying attention to fans and dropped the nerf, it clearly hasn’t gone far enough. I actually stopped playing <em>Warzone</em> at the weekend because of the Tonfa, and until I hear that the issue is properly addressed, I’ll stay clear. I’d rather not play at all than get beaten to death every game, that’s for sure. </p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is the latest Ubisoft blockbuster to warn players they'll need an online connection when first installing the game - despite the fact it is otherwise an offline title. 
</p>
<p>
Shadows follows in the footsteps of last year's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and the upcoming Star Wars Outlaws in requiring an internet connection to first play physical copies of the game. 
</p>
<p>
All three titles include a warning note on the front of their box, visible by retailers such as <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/assassins-creed-shadows-gold-edition-xbox-series-x/6584016.p?skuId=6584016">Best Buy</a>: "Internet required to install the game."

</figure>
<p>
While this is likely due to the need to install a mandatory day one update for the game, it's still unclear to what extent Shadows will also rely on Ubisoft's mysterious new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">Assassin's Creed Infinity</a> hub/launcher/thing, which will launch alongside the game and act as a central home to the franchise going forward.

 </a>

<p>
Shadows does not feature any online play, and indeed it has now been a decade since the last major Assassin's Creed title to feature any form of multiplayer (2014's Paris-set Unity, which featured campaign co-op). 
</p>
<p>
There are also the usual concerns around servers eventually being switched off, and the longevity of online games in general (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">Ubisoft has now completely deleted online racer The Crew</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">taking its servers offline</a>), though its difficult to see Shadows getting pulled any point in the forseeable future.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft debuted its first cinematic trailer for Assassin's Creed Shadows yesterday, which introduced the game's dual protagonists - a shinobi and a samurai - who ultimately team up and offer two distinct playstyles.
</p>
<p>
Shadows is set in 16th century feudal Japan, and is developed primarily by the Assassin's Creed Odyssey team at Ubisoft Quebec, assisted by no less than 15 support studios, including teams in Osaka and Tokyo.
</p>
<p>Yesterday also brought news of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-details-premium-editions-collectors-edition-plus-season-pass-featuring-exclusive-quest">Assassin's Creed Shadows collector's editions</a>, which include the game's season pass for two DLC expansions and an exclusive quest.</p>

            <p>Our Edders, the RPSer I’d most trust to help me gank a rival covenant member with hammers, reckoned Pinocchio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> was an “instant must-play” in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">his review</a>, and I was pretty fond of it myself. We already know that we’re <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-course-lies-of-p-is-getting-a-sequel-after-selling-a-million-copies">due a sequel</a> at some point the future, thanks to impressive sales. Director Jiwon Choi previously teased some DLC concept art, and now it looks like we’ll be seeing that DLC by the time the year’s out, according to a fiscal report.</p>

<p>The fiscal report, <a href="https://twitter.com/Ziostorm1/status/1790751397501177926">spotted</a> by content creator Ziostorm, details upcoming releases for the remainder of the Korean fiscal year, which is handily just the actual year, running January 1st to December 31st. Lies of P’s DLC, unnamed at present, is slated for the second half of 2024. The soulslike has previously seen several substantial updates, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-casual-soulslikers-lies-of-ps-latest-update-makes-it-dramatically-easier">such as difficulty adjustments</a>, but this'll be its first expansion - assuming its not some rabbit costumes or another pair of wireframe glasses that make you look like a scholar that’s one hit of laudanum away from dying of consumption. Good news, then, if you’re up for some more puppet parrying. (Actually, it was more focused around blocking, but I’ll never let the truth interrupt even the most minor opportunity for alliteration, hack that I am.)</p>
<p>In other ‘more soulslike to go on top of the soulslikes we already have please’ news, the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date">Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> draws ever closer. I know about as much as you at this point, which is to say: I know it’ll have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-enemy-revealed-a-bloke-with-a-basket-for-a-head">some blokes with baskets for heads</a>. The woman with a basket on her head was actually my favourite Sekiro fight, so this bodes well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/more-xbox-exclusives-ps5-holiday/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>More former Xbox exclusives could be coming to PS5 during this holiday season, according to a well-known insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on the ResetEra forums in a thread about a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new WindowsCentral Xbox article</a>, noted insider NateDrake has said that he's heard that, aside from Starfield, more Xbox games might be headed to Sony's console later this year. Yesterday, the insider mentioned that Starfield <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/windows-central-microsofts-quest-for-short-term-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond.871437/page-7?post=123020469#post-123020469" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might end up hitting PS5 as a complete edition sometime in late 2025</a>. Later on, 'NateDrake' said that, between possibly Starfield in 2025, there could be other games coming to PS5. "Who said there wouldn't be anything between the 4 from earlier this year and that?", the insider<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/windows-central-microsofts-quest-for-short-term-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond.871437/page-8?post=123026721#post-123026721" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> wrote</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Earlier today, he clarified his post from yesterday, saying that he was only referring to Bethesda's hit title, but he's heard of other games coming to Sony's console, although he isn't entirely sure about which titles and when they will be released. "Yes. Was strictly talking about Starfield there", 'NateDrake'<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/windows-central-microsofts-quest-for-short-term-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond.871437/page-10?post=123039288#post-123039288" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> wrote</a> today. "I've heard of other games coming to PS5 &amp; they could be during holiday season this year -- but working to confirm the games &amp; the release windows."</p>
<p>While this doesn't confirm that additional Xbox exclusives are coming to PS5, recent rumors and reports suggest that this is likely the case. Last month, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-ps5-xbox-exclusives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the Sea of Thieves PS5 version was a key test for Microsoft for whether other games will make their way to rival platforms. Additionally, earlier this month, Warren said that Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-still-evaluating-whether-to-put-cod-on-game-pass-and-a-game-pass-price-increase-hellblade-ii-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is still evaluating whether Ninja Theory's upcoming Hellblade 2 will be ported to Sony's console as well</a>. Interestingly enough, back February of this year, Warren also suggested that Microsoft has been considering to bring other popular Xbox flagship franchises to rival platforms, including Gears of War and DOOM. "I understand that Microsoft has also previously been weighing up the idea of bringing Gears of War, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and even the next Doom game to rival platforms", Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-was-considering-bringing-gears-and-next-doom-to-rival-platforms-tom-warren-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in February.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? If true, which games will likely make the jump to PlayStation 5 later this year? Hit the comments below.</p>

<p data-characters="324" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ubisoft recently shared proper information on its Japan-set <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/assassins-creed-shadows-carves-a-bloody-path-through-feudal-japan-this-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></em>. Aside from two trailers, which confirmed two playable protagonists, developer Ubisoft Québec has given some further insight about the game’s new mechanics, but the one that most intrigues me is its new dynamic weather system.</p> <p data-characters="579" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">I’ve always been a fan of dynamic weather systems in games, mostly for how they make a world feel more alive and can radically alter the mood of a scenario. Sometimes, though, they can offer more than just an aesthetic difference and can alter gameplay, like how rain makes it more difficult to climb up walls in <em>T<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN interview</a>, the staff at Ubisoft Québec explained how the changing seasons in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> have a direct influence on gameplay, drastically affecting how you approach completing objectives.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="864" data-injectable="true">One example producer Karl Onnée provides is how, in summer time, you can go underwater in ponds to hide from enemies. Come winter time and those ponds will have frozen over. You may need to ditch your favoured hiding spots as the seasons progress, but this in turn opens up new opportunities. The stronger winds, for instance, will help obscure the sound of your footsteps, making it easier to sneak up on enemies. As creative director Jonathan Dumont succinctly puts it, “Players will have to adapt constantly to what the environment is giving them.”</p>
 <p data-characters="520" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> certainly isn’t the first <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game to have a weather system, but I don’t think it’s ever had one as advanced as what Ubisoft is promising for <em>Shadows</em>. What’s especially unique is that the seasons don’t just rotate after enough time has passed. Instead, the seasons change when you hit certain points in the story, which allows for an added sense of realism and suggests the events of <em>Shadows</em> will take place over the course of a whole year.</p>
 <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true">According to art director Thierry Dansereau, some side quests can be attempted during different seasons: “When in an open world [side] quest, it might happen that you will play a quest in autumn and I will play the same quest and I’m going to be in summer.” This should mean how you approach completing side quests will depend on the current season, allowing for players to come up with different methods. It may even make some quests more challenging or easier to complete.</p>
 <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="false">It’s obviously still too early to tell how this game will turn out, but so far <em>Shadows</em> is shaping up to be the most interesting <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game in a long time. Elsewhere in the interview, Ubisoft is also promising a stronger emphasis on stealth and parkour, which combined with a revised combat system is making <em>Shadows</em> sound like an ideal hybrid between the modern action-RPG <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games and the original stealth-based entries.</p>

            <p>Bandai Namco has announced the appointment of Adrien Guerra as country manager for the UK and Nordics.</p>
<p>Guerra assumed the role on April 1, 2024, and is based at the company's UK headquarters in Richmond, London.</p>
<p>Guerra joined Bandai Namco in 2009 as marketing and communications director for the France-Benelux region, and previously worked for Electronic Arts as senior international marketing manager from 2004 to 2009.</p>
<p>"The UK and the Nordics are key territories for development in Europe, so I feel both honoured and excited to work with the amazing teams that John Galloway has assembled," said Guerra.</p>
<p>Guerra's appointment follows the retirement of Galloway, the current vice president of Northern Europe, who will leave Bandai Namco in June after 15 years with the games firm.</p>
<p>"It's been an amazing 15 years with Bandai Namco, and 30 years in this industry," said Galloway. "I leave knowing the teams, the company and growth are in capable hands with Adrien taking up the helm.</p>
<p>"Thank you to all our partners I have had the pleasure of working with over the years, and the teams in the UK and Nordics, along with the German and CEE teams."</p>
