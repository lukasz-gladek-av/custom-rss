		<p>EA Sports WRC players can now see what EA has in store for the next year, as it has revealed the content roadmap. The key highlight is the Season 6 Rally Pass, which launches July 30th, bringing rewards of helmets, suits, gloves, and vehicle liveries. And for the first time, there will be liveries for vehicle classes outside of WRC. The Season 6 Rally Pass will run from July to September.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS WRC - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JFy_cWefBtQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Accompanying the Season 6 Rally Pass will be the 2024 WRC Esports Championship, with online events being added for players to compete in. The most successful will face off against each other in an in-person final. Online qualifiers will take place <a href="https://racenet.com/ea_sports_wrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Racenet,</a> but further details are to be confirmed on what online events will take place, and when.</p>

<p>In October, the WRC 24 Season Expansion will be available to purchase, adding two new locations, rally stages, liveries and vehicles. The expansion will also grant access to two future DLC packs, the first of which will launch in the winter and the second will be made available in the spring. Both DLC packs will contain more cars and additional rally stages in already available locations.</p>

<p><em>“The 2024 WRC Expansion ensures our game content remains fresh, allowing players to advance their careers with the introduction of two thrilling locations, more vehicles, and expanded customisation options,”</em> said Matthew Battison, Creative Director at Codemasters.<em> “The free Season 6 Rally Pass gives players more reasons to jump back into the game ahead of our major plans for later in the year.”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/ea-sports-wrc-review/">EA Sports WRC Review</a></h2>
<p>In our EA Sports WRC review, Dom said, <em>“If you’re looking for a fully featured and great handling rally game, EA Sports WRC is the undisputed champion this year, though PC players need to be aware that some technical bugs still need to be ironed out.”</em></p>

The news comes as the game division’s former boss, Mike Verdu, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177141/netflixs-gaming-boss-is-moving-to-another-role-at-netflix-in-gaming">moved into a different role at Netflix</a> focused on a new team “on the cutting edge of game innovation.”</p><p>In his previous role at Epic, which he held since 2018, Tascan was in charge of the company’s first-party output, which included not only <em>Fortnite</em> and its various modes like <em>Lego Fortnite </em>but also other live-service games like <em>Rocket League</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>. In a statement, Tascan explained that he took the role at the streamer because “I firmly believe that Netflix is uniquely positioned to redefine the future of gaming.”</p><p>Though it has yet to become a major part of Netflix’s business, the company has dabbled in games since 2021, with a growing library of titles available to subscribers via mobile. More recently, the company has shifted somewhat to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171526/netflix-games-too-hot-too-handle-interactive-fiction">focus on games that are connected to its most popular shows</a>; the next season of <em>Emily in Paris</em>, for instance, will premiere on August 15th, alongside the launch of a tie-in game.

The launch of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III </em>on Game Pass could soften the blow of the price increases, which, in some regions, are up to 25 percent more. Game Pass Ultimate will increase to $19.99 a month on September 12th, a $3 increase over the current $16.99 a month pricing. PC Game Pass is also moving up to $11.99 a month, and Microsoft is planning a new Xbox Game Pass “Standard” option for new members in the coming months that doesn’t include access to day-one games and has online multiplayer included.</p><p>Microsoft is also planning to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">launch <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a>, the next installment in Activision’s popular franchise, on Xbox Game Pass later this year.

I mean, sure, it’s one thing to see other players questing in the open world, but do you have to <em>talk</em> with them? Maybe even <em>play</em> with them? Is there a class you can pick in <em>FF14</em> that minimizes how much you have to interact with others?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194907" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Releasing Beyond Diablo IV" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="194907,194141,193627" data-current="194907"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Releasing Beyond Diablo IV</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194907/194907_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194907/194907_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194907/194907_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194907/194907_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20346.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>There’s good news for those of us who like to run solo: You don’t need to worry about picking certain classes over others if you plan to play alone. All classes will offer a great experience whether you play solo or with others. While dungeons and boss battles are designed for groups of players, the game will automatically match you up with others via the Duty Finder system. <em>FF14</em> also lets you use NPC companions in almost all its leveling dungeons. These NPCs can cover defense, offense, and healing. In other words, you don’t have to worry about picking a class that can tough it out on its own; <strong>every class and job is solo-viable throughout the entire main story quest.</strong></p><p>For reference, I’m a mostly solo player and play the Astrologian Job. This Job primarily buffs and heals other players. I’ve never felt held back by my choice of class, even though it might seem like a class meant to support other players. In other words, <strong>new players should pick whichever class they find most appealing, regardless of whether they’ll play solo or with friends</strong>.</p><p><strong><em>FF14</em> also offers some optional challenges for solo players to chase. In these specific instances, some classes and jobs will give you an edge over others</strong>. If that sounds interesting to you, then consider playing some of the classes and Jobs listed below.</p><h2 id="h132311"><a id="best"></a>The best solo class in <em>Final Fantasy 14</em></h2><p><strong>Classes in <em>FF14 </em>strictly refer to roles you can pick at level 1</strong>. These will all turn into “Jobs” after completing their respective questlines. And while you can pick any class and have a great time, there is a particular one that is a little better for first-time solo players. </p><h3 id="h132312"><a id=""></a>Marauder</h3><figure id="" data-id="fcb45434d9fbed7ec3c78963bac2f3ad" data-recommend-id="image://fcb45434d9fbed7ec3c78963bac2f3ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Marauder leaps into the air while wielding an enormous ax." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Marauder leaps into the air while wielding an enormous ax." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fcb45434d9fbed7ec3c78963bac2f3ad" data-recommend-id="image://fcb45434d9fbed7ec3c78963bac2f3ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Marauder leaps into the air while wielding an enormous ax." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Marauders don’t necessarily outperform other classes from level 1, but they still hold their own in the early game. These ax wielders are Tanks, which means they’re designed to grab the attention of enemies away from your party members and take hits in their stead. For solo players just starting out, this is a nice perk. Your naturally high defense and HP will cushion you if you accidentally get in over your head against high level monsters all by yourself.</p><p>After you level up Marauder enough to unlock the Warrior Job, you’ll find that you’re so bulky it’s almost like you don’t need other players. The cooldown skills Thrill of Battle and Equilibrium provide powerful self-healing, reducing your need to rely on other players to heal you. </p><p>At level 56, Warriors unlock Raw Intuition, a skill with a 25-second cooldown that heals you whenever you hit an enemy. So the next time you find yourself trapped in a mob of six enemies who are all attacking you, you can just use some area-of-effect attacks after using Raw Intuition and watch your health climb back to full in a matter of seconds.</p><p><strong>The Warrior’s incredible self-healing makes it a top choice when trying to solo bosses from past expansions</strong>. The Warrior’s high health also comes in handy in group content,since you won’t need to count on healers to keep you alive as often as other characters. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFcZCEny4x4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFcZCEny4x4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Job is even capable of soloing level-equivalent 8-player encounters</a></span> .</p><p>For those interested in Marauder/Warrior, Gunbreaker<strong> </strong>is another Tank job that has seen notable success in the Heaven on High deep dungeon (more on this later). What’s more, Tank jobs equip the same armor, so you can jump between them easily. Sadly, Gunbreaker is not currently available in the free trial.</p><h2 id="h132313"><a id="jobs"></a>The best Jobs in <em>Final Fantasy 14 for solo play</em></h2><p><em>FF14</em> also contains “Advanced jobs,” which you can unlock after either reaching a certain level threshold or crossing a specific milestone in the main story quest. These Jobs don’t have preceding classes, so you can play them as soon as you can unlock them. Aspiring solo players should check out the jobs below.</p><h3 id="h132314"><a id=""></a>Red Mage</h3><figure id="" data-id="c33b66b789c2dcde643a0bc3edb7fa5a" data-recommend-id="image://c33b66b789c2dcde643a0bc3edb7fa5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Red Mage holds a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Red Mage holds a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c33b66b789c2dcde643a0bc3edb7fa5a" data-recommend-id="image://c33b66b789c2dcde643a0bc3edb7fa5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Red Mage holds a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Unlock requirement</strong>: Reach level 50 and complete the quest Taking the Red in Ul’Dah.</p><p>For longtime <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans, the Red Mage’s place here should come as no surprise. It’s traditionally a jack-of-all-trades job in the series’ canon, and that’s generally true here. The <em>FF14</em> incarnation of Red Mage is a magic DPS class, meaning its primary function is to cast long-range magic spells to inflict damage. However, there are two specific reasons why Red Mage appeals to solo players.</p><p>Red Mage’s first major perk is mobility. Spell casters in <em>FF14</em> typically need to stay in one spot to attack, relying on short windows between spells to dodge attacks without decreasing their DPS. Meanwhile, Red Mages have the Dualcast trait, letting them cast every other spell instantly. Red Mages can also build a gauge that lets them use powerful melee attacks that lack any sort of cast time. Combine these abilities with the Corps-a-corps<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>Displacement abilities, which lets Red Mages leap towards and away from enemies respectively, and you get a class that can easily counter enemy mechanics and dodge attacks.High mobility isn’t exclusive to Red Mage, but what <em>is</em> exclusive is the spell Vercure. In a vacuum, Vercure is a basic curing spell that’s inferior to anything a dedicated Healer can use. However,<strong> </strong>Vercure is the best on-demand healing spell learned by any DPS class in the game. Other DPS classes have defensive and healing options on a cooldown, but Red Mages can reliably heal themselves as long as they have enough Magic Points.</p><p>The Red Mage’s mix of offense and healing makes it a comfortable job for players who don’t want to rely on friends to help them out<strong>.</strong> As an added bonus, Red Mage is one of the best jobs to play if you plan to defeat <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goKGyO0ieU4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goKGyO0ieU4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the rare solo bosses in the Bozjan Southern Front</a></span>. </p><p>For new players interested in Red Mage, consider starting out as the Arcanist class. In the early game, Arcanist feels remarkably like the Red Mage, since it learns both ranged magic attacks and basic healing magic. Additionally, if you choose to promote yourself from the Arcanist class to the Summoner job, you can carry over almost all your gear to Red Mage upon unlocking it..</p><h3 id="h132315"><a id=""></a>Machinist</h3><figure id="" data-id="74da0add0d16ee68ca07afdd744b5761" data-recommend-id="image://74da0add0d16ee68ca07afdd744b5761" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Machinist stands next to a flying machine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Machinist stands next to a flying machine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="74da0add0d16ee68ca07afdd744b5761" data-recommend-id="image://74da0add0d16ee68ca07afdd744b5761" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Machinist stands next to a flying machine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Unlock requirement</strong>: Reach the <em>Heavensward </em>expansion and complete the quest So You Want To Be A Machinist in Foundation.</p><p>Compared to the picks above, Machinist might seem like an odd choice. This Physical RangedDPS Job doesn’t sport on-demand healing or high defense, and its damage output doesn’t compare to melee DPS jobs either. So what makes the Machinist so special?</p><p>First, let’s talk about mobility. Machinist is a Physical Ranged DPS<strong> </strong>Job, which means it can freely move and attack from a distance. <strong>Machinist has no cast times</strong>, and only its situational Flamethrower attack limits its movement. Not only can a Machinist dodge attacks like a champ, it’s one of the only jobs in the game that can kite normal enemies. Kiting (when you run from a mob of enemies pursuing you) is typically discouraged in group content, but it can become a massive boon when playing solo.</p><p>While Bard and Dancer are also Physical Ranged DPS jobs, they derive most of their power from supporting other players. Machinist is more of a “selfish” job as it focuses on dishing out lots of damage on its own. <strong>In a solo environment, the Machinist massively outperforms its Physical Ranged counterparts</strong>.</p><p>Dismantle cuts an enemy’s attack output by 10% for 10 seconds, bolstering the Machinist’s survivability against tough foes. Head Graze can stun targets (invaluable in canceling certain strong attacks), while Leg Graze and Foot Graze<strong> </strong>can control the mobility of common enemies you’ll face. And while it doesn’t affect battle performance, Peloton increases your movement speed while out of combat, which makes running around cities and dungeons a bit faster.</p><p>All of these traits make Machinist one of the best jobs to challenge <strong><em>FF14</em></strong>’s Deep Dungeons. Deep Dungeons are roguelike-style challenges that task players with clearing upwards of 200 randomized levels filled with traps and monsters. While these are primarily designed with parties of four in mind, players can earn some of the rarest achievements in the entire game by clearing a Deep Dungeon by themselves without dying. So if you want to prepare yourself for the most hardcore challenge available to solo players, Deep Dungeons are essential.</p><p>For new players interested in the Machinist, you’ll want to start as the Archer class. An Archer can eventually upgrade to the Bard Job, and while Bard’s personal DPS potential <em>is </em>low, that gap isn’t so pronounced at lower levels. More importantly, Archer/Bard most closely resembles the Machinist’s playstyle of all the starting classes. You can also unlock Machinist as soon as you progress into the <em>Heavensward </em>expansion. Machinist equips the same armor as Bard too!</p><h2 id="h132316"><a id="others"></a>Honorable Mentions: Other Jobs worth considering for solo play</h2><p>The Ninja Job–which is derived from the Rogue class–boasts high burst damage and uniquely has the Hide ability that predominantly benefits solo players. </p><p>The Samurai Job is another good pick as it can inflict among the most damage in the game without relying on others . It even has some mitigation built into its kit via the Third Eye<strong> </strong>ability.</p><p>Healers typically don’t thrive in solo environments, but solo players might feel more comfortable knowing they can heal themselves on demand. Conjurer–which up-classes into the White Mage Job–is one of the better healer roles for players that plan to undertake solo content. </p><p>Sage is also relatively solo friendly, though unlocking this job does require the <em>Endwalker </em>expansion (alongside a hefty prerequisite of hitting level 70 first).</p><hr><p>Solo players in <em>FF14</em> have a lot of great options when it comes to picking a class or Job. Ultimately, you should main the job you enjoy playing most in <em>FF14</em>, regardless of whether you’re a solo player or not. <em>FF14</em> also lets you easily switch between classes and Jobs as well, so feel free to experiment with different roles and see which ones stick with you. Whether you intend to challenge bosses and Deep Dungeons by yourself in <em>FF14 </em>or wind up getting distracted by fishing, enjoy your time in Eorzea!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m <em>this</em> close to absolutely adoring this assortment of timed challenges from NES games. In many ways, it feels like it’s designed precisely for NES sickos like me, folks who have an enduring fondness not just for well-regarded classics like <em>The Legend of Zelda </em>and <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>but also for the rougher, more frustrating first-party games on Nintendo’s first console, like <em>Ice Climber</em>. But one huge, glaring flaw holds it back, relegating it to an interesting curiosity rather than the conversation- and competition-driving release it could have been.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196698,196766" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let me start with some of the things I really like about this game. First of all (and least importantly), I think the Deluxe Set Nintendo is selling is quite nice. It comes with a set of pins, postcards featuring the box art of all of the games featured in <em>Championships</em>, and a (strictly ornamental) gold NES cartridge. It’s all Nintendo paying tribute to itself, of course, but it’s a well-made assortment of goodies for a lot less than typical “special edition” prices.</p><p>Now, onto the game itself. <em>Nintendo Championships </em>is essentially a slew of challenges that have you playing moments from classic NES games and trying to achieve a given goal as quickly as possible. These range from really short and simple (grab the sword at the start of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>) to much more challenging (beat <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>), and I think the structure of the game is wonderful. The way it starts out by having you do the simplest things gives you a feel for how important every little movement can be. You learn from experience that valuable milliseconds can be gained or lost in something as basic as the angle of a jump.<br></p><p>In this regard, it feels like a real gateway to the joys of speedrunning. By the time you’re tackling one of the game’s more elaborate challenges that see you completing an entire stage or even an entire game, you intrinsically understand that it’s a matter of putting all the pieces together, trying to pull off every movement as gracefully and effectively as you pulled off the movements in those much smaller challenges you started with. I have probably played World 1-1 of <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>hundreds of times over the course of my life, and yet <em>Nintendo World Championships</em> pushed me, for the first time ever, to really focus on completing it as quickly as possible, and it felt like a totally different stage. Simply beating 1-1 is easy as pie. Beating it really quickly and efficiently? That takes practice and determination. Repeatedly, <em>Nintendo World Championships </em>thrilled me by giving me exciting new ways to tackle games that I’ve been intimately familiar with for most of my life, and I suspect that I’ll continue having fun going back to it for some time and trying to improve my rating in some of the game’s many challenges.</p><p>But here’s where we get to the game’s colossal oversight. Do you know what would have made me (and, I suspect, thousands of other players) way more enamored with these challenges, and way more determined to come back to them again and again to improve our times? Leaderboards. Particularly friend leaderboards. Look, if I knew that a pal of mine had picked up the Screw Attack power-up in <em>Metroid </em>.03 seconds faster than I had, you’d better believe I’d be obsessed with doing it again and again until I’d surpassed her time. For me, this game could have been the hottest source of online competition since <em>Pac-Man Championship Edition </em>burst onto Xbox Live way back in 2007. And you know what <em>Pac-Man CE </em>offered on top of leaderboards that helped make it such a competitive sensation? The opportunity to watch replays of your friends’ games, to identify exactly how they’d edged past you to the tune of 125,000 points.</p><figure id="" data-id="ad06773fc40136c406b9c6ff70e12824" data-recommend-id="image://ad06773fc40136c406b9c6ff70e12824" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen showing the writer's online profile as well as a number of &quot;Ghost Competitors&quot; in the game's survival mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen showing the writer's online profile as well as a number of &quot;Ghost Competitors&quot; in the game's survival mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Nintendo World Championships clearly stores ghost data, as it’s needed for the game’s survival mode.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad06773fc40136c406b9c6ff70e12824" data-recommend-id="image://ad06773fc40136c406b9c6ff70e12824" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen showing the writer's online profile as well as a number of &quot;Ghost Competitors&quot; in the game's survival mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s absolutely no reason why <em>Nintendo World Championships </em>shouldn’t offer both leaderboards and replays for its challenges. We already know the game stores replay data! One of its modes is called Survival Mode, and it pits you against ghost replays from seven other players in races to complete three challenges. Okay, Nintendo. So you have the damn data. <em>Please</em>, let me watch my friends’ best attempts at completing a loop of <em>Donkey Kong</em>, or beating Mouser in <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em>. Speedrunning is as much about cooperation and sharing information as it is about competition, and even if you <em>see </em>how a friend shaved five seconds off their time in a given challenge, you still have to execute the technique. It’s absurd that I have to take to Twitter to share information like this with my friends and fellow players, instead of them just being able to watch my replay in-game.<br></p><p>Obviously, I’m speaking as a die-hard NES fan here, but god, this misstep by Nintendo is so crushing. I really think <em>NWC </em>could have and should have been a game that brought people together and had us enthusiastically competing at its myriad challenges for many weeks. It could have been one of the games of the summer. Instead, because Nintendo failed to implement sensible online features, it’s an experience we can only really enjoy in isolation. It’s an oversight that, to me, is so mind-boggling I can scarcely believe it. I keep expecting Nintendo to announce that they’re patching in support for challenge-specific leaderboards and the ability to watch friends’ replays. But I doubt it will actually happen. This is Nintendo we’re talking about, a company that, for all its brilliance, has frequently been well behind the curve when it comes to knowing what to do with online functionality.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2bbc11593454a3be450307fee44007bc" data-recommend-id="image://2bbc11593454a3be450307fee44007bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen showing off the game's only actual leaderboard, for the weekly World Championships mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen showing off the game's only actual leaderboard, for the weekly World Championships mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Yay, I ranked in the top 58 percent!</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2bbc11593454a3be450307fee44007bc" data-recommend-id="image://2bbc11593454a3be450307fee44007bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen showing off the game's only actual leaderboard, for the weekly World Championships mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><br>To be fair, there is ONE online leaderboard in the game, in the appropriately titled World Championships mode. Here, each week, you and players all over the world can compete in a series of five challenges, and once the week is out, you’re shown how you ranked against everyone else. That’s all well and good, but it feels grossly insufficient. I don’t just want to compete against the masses once a week. I want to have a spirited back-and-forth with my closest friends as we each obsessively try to be the fastest to grab the first mushroom in <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>or to beat Ridley in <em>Metroid</em>. God, it’s just so disappointing. My only hope is that the title of this game—<em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>—hints that in the future, we may see other entries, a SNES Edition, perhaps an N64 Edition, and so on, and that, by the time those come around, Nintendo decides to add the features this game is so glaringly missing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After weeks of calls from both consumers and even game studios, Intel <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/July-2024-Update-on-Instability-Reports-on-Intel-Core-13th-and/m-p/1617113#M74792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has publicly addressed</a> the instability reports surrounding its 13th and 14th-generation desktop CPU.  </p>



<p>According to the company, elevated operator voltage is causing the problem in “some” desktop processors. Intel says that its analysis shows that the elevated operator voltage is coming from “a microcode algorithm resulting in incorrect voltage requests to the processor.”</p>



<p>As far as a fix for the issue, Intel is releasing a microcode patch that addresses the cause. The update is currently being targeting for mid-August after “full validation” of its success.</p>



<p>You can read Intel’s full statement below.</p>



<h2 id="h-intel-statement-on-cpu-instability">Intel Statement On CPU Instability</h2>



<p><em>“Based on extensive analysis of Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors returned to us due to instability issues, we have determined that elevated operating voltage is causing instability issues in some 13th/14th Gen desktop processors. Our analysis of returned processors confirms that the elevated operating voltage is stemming from a microcode algorithm resulting in incorrect voltage requests to the processor.</em></p>



<p><em>“Intel is delivering a microcode patch which addresses the root cause of exposure to elevated voltages. We are continuing validation to ensure that scenarios of instability reported to Intel regarding its Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors are addressed. Intel is currently targeting mid-August for patch release to partners following full validation.</em></p>



<p><em>“Intel is committed to making this right with our customers, and we continue asking any customers currently experiencing instability issues on their Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors reach out to Intel Customer Support for further assistance”</em></p>

This time it’s with a selection of cards set in the world of the Monty Python and the Holy Grail. </p><p>Split across two Secret Lair drops, the latest Universes Beyond tie-in will have eight reprints and one token reskinned with references and jokes from the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-comedies-of-all-time">classic 1975 film</a>. One drop will have five cards total, one of which is double-faced so you can choose if it’s either an African or European swallow, while the other will have three cards and a token.</p><p>You can <strong>flip through the gallery below to see all the cards in both Monty Python drops</strong>: </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>9 Cards in Secret Lair x Monty Python and the Holy Grail: Vol. 1 &amp; 2</h3></div></output><p>To find out how the heck a crossover like this even comes about, I spoke with Secret Lair Senior Product Designer Daniel Nguyen, who said the first step for many of their Universes Beyond projects is to simply reach out to the representatives for lots of different properties and see who might be interested in working together.</p><p>“This was a really fun one to get,” Nguyen says. ”It’s kind of a funny pairing. They seem like such different ideas, but I think the cards came together really nicely and it’s just very quaint to see on Magic cards.” He also explains that the business folk their outreach team initially gets in touch with don’t always know what Magic even is, but that it’s “fun if someone on the other side actually is a Magic fan, which does happen quite often.”</p><p>While this isn’t the first old movie to get a crossover drop, with The Evil Dead and The Princess Bride both getting Secret Lairs of their own, the jokes within it do feel tailored toward both Holy Grail and Magic in a particularly satisfying way. That’s both in seeing iconic scenes from the movie represented by notable cards that align perfectly (such as, the card Dismember depicting the Black Knight), but also in a few Magic jokes that use the language of Monty Python instead.</p><p>For example, John Cleese’s Tim the Enchanter is represented by the card Prodigal Sorcerer, which is lovingly referred to as “Tim” by much of the Magic community. “That’s just the top line on the document, right? You gotta have that one,” says Nguyen, who jokes “if we don’t do that we’re all fired, clearly.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While the designs and thought behind the cards in these drops is impressive, the fact that Vol. 1 has five cards (one of which is double-faced) while Vol 2. only has three cards and token did make me curious about how Wizards of the Coast decides on the contents of each Secret Lair. Nguyen tells me that these decisions are generally more art than science, taking into account a card’s desirability in the playerbase, the bandwidth they have for coordinating artists and other resources, what each individual drop might call for thematically, and more. </p><p>“I take it very seriously,” Nguyen assures me. “We think deeply about everything that goes into these drops. Every aspect you can consider, I’m thinking about that all day long and losing sleep over it sometimes.” He says one part of that is hitting staple cards people are using a lot already, but also balancing that with some tastemaking picks that go off the beaten path when it makes sense, even if the appeal of the latter may be narrower as a result. “Every drop should [have] <em>someone’s </em>favorite card.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We think deeply about everything that goes into these drops.” -<em> Daniel Nguyen, WOTC</em></p></div><p>The Monty Python and the Holy Grail drops will be available in both foil and non-foil starting on July 29 as part of the next Superdrop.

                <p>Earlier this month, Capcom released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-danse-macabre/1900-6418258/" data-ref-id="1900-6418258">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, which may potentially be the start of a new franchise. It's also one of a growing number of games that are skipping a physical release altogether and going digital-only. However, Capcom wants to assure its fans that the video game publisher isn't abandoning physical releases.</p><p>During a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/assets/pdf/stock/2024capcom_d.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">meeting for Capcom shareholders</a>, the company stated, "Given that a significant number of end users demand physical games, we currently do not expect to eliminate physical products."</p><p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-says-80-of-all-of-its-sales-are-now-digital/1100-6479521/" data-ref-id="1100-6479521">80% of Capcom's sales were digital</a>, and the company stated that its long-term goal was to hit 90%. Capcom surpassed that mark in its 2023 financial year when digital sales accounted for 90.1% of the company's total sales across consoles, PC, and mobile. For 2024, the company is projecting that digital sales will rise to 93% of its total.</p><p>The recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-drops-six-classic-crossovers-into-one-game/1100-6524367/" data-ref-id="1100-6524367">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a> is getting a physical and digital release, but the long-term direction of the company suggests that the number of digital-only games will continue to rise. It's not inconceivable that Capcom could eventually cut back on physical releases altogether. Thankfully, that doesn't appear to be happening right now.</p>

            <p>
Roblox's record on child safety has come under fire yet again, this time in a damning new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">Bloomberg</a> report that details the scale of the issue faced by the game's developers, who are unable to keep all of its young players safe. 
</p>
<p>
Last year, Roblox itself reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation to US authorities, and responded to over 1300 requests from authorities for detail on predatory players. 
</p>
<p>
In the last six years, at least two dozen people have been arrested in the US for abusing victims met via Roblox.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg's report goes into detail on the case of DoctorRofatnik, real name Arnold Castillo, who ran a hugely-successful Sonic the Hedgehog rip-off and earned tens of thousands of dollars in revenue. 
</p>
<p>
The 22-year-old Castillo was admired by an army of children who played his Roblox game, some of whom he paid to work on the project with him. But despite reports by Roblox players of inappropriate contact between Castillo and players as young as 12, it wasn't until a 15-year-old girl he had preyed on went missing from her home that Castillo was caught by the FBI.
</p>
<p>
Castillo is now serving a 15-year sentence for grooming and sexually abusing the child.
</p>
<p>
The scale of the issue and the work needed to solve what Bloomberg calls a "pedophile problem" is enormous. Roblox filters 50,000 chat messages a second between its tens of millions of concurrent users, most of whom are under the age of 18. It employs 3000 human moderators, though relies on AI for much of the work. 
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg has spoken with Roblox moderation staff who say they feel overwhelmed, with hundreds of reports of child safety issues reportedly flooding in every day.
</p>
<p>
The report alleges that Roblox is putting growth over player safety, as the company pushes towards an eye-opening target of reaching a billion daily users (Roblox currently has around 100 million today).
</p>
<p>
Responding within the report, Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman declined to comment on specific cases, but said that safety and civility were "foundational". 
</p>
<p>
"Tens of millions of people of all ages have a safe and positive experience on Roblox every single day," Kaufman said.
</p>
<p>
Roblox has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-commits-to-ensuring-a-positive-and-safe-experience-for-its-users">repeatedly faced criticism</a> it isn't doing enough to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">ensure its young audience are safe</a> on its platform. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-studio-boss-children-making-money-on-the-platform-isnt-exploitation-its-a-gift">Roblox also responded to criticism over comments made by studio head Stefano Corazza regarding payments to children who create games on the platform</a>.

Concept art on Ubisoft’s site showed a flag used by Sekigahara Teppo-tai, an infantryman reenactment group, but the publisher had not sought permission to use it. </p><p>At the time of the issue, the group’s “cannon chief” contacted Ubisoft, which responded by removing the piece of art from its site and apologizing. Sekigahara Teppo-tai were still not happy, given their flag will also appear in the game’s collector’s edition’s art book and it’s too late for Ubisoft to stop that. At the time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1810238727064854807&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1810238727064854807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft tweeted</a></span> (in Japanese),</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> The art in question will not be used or distributed any further beyond this date, except for being included in the artbook in the Collector’s Edition.  We deeply apologize for this matter.</p></blockquote><p> However, so primed are those who believe they are saving gaming from the evil poison of progressive pleasantness, that any legitimate fault by <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is leapt upon and blown up to the most enormous scale. It’s this that Ubisoft’s statement seems to be addressing.</p><p>Today’s statement, released in both English and Japanese, feels fairly defensive. It’s  clear that Ubisoft’s development teams went into this game with a huge desire to recreate a period of Japanese history as accurately and respectfully as they could, much as they’ve approached other historical periods, but also wanted to do something off-piste and explore the (entirely real) person Yasuke, a black samurai. (His contested samurai status is, of course, fully dismissed by those acting as if they’ve just completed their post-doc in Japanese history, rather than read a Wikipedia entry).</p><p>Yet, it’s also a video game, not a documentary series on PBS. People can’t actually dive off tall, tall towers into a hay cart and not break all their bones, for instance. Nor can they, apparently, re-enter the past by using magic DNA machines. Despite this, the studio wants to make clear it’s not attempting reality. In the statement Ubisoft says,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>...our intention has never been to present any of our <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, including <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, as factual representations of history, or historical characters.</p></blockquote><p>It’s such a “well, duh” point, but it’s one that unfortunately seems to need making in plain text amidst the ludicrous brouhaha that surrounds the game. So many bad actors are determined to win some imagined battle because one of the main characters is Black (it’s important to note the other main character is a Japanese woman).</p><p>However, the statement goes on to imply that other—entirely unmentioned—issues have been raised by Japanese players, and that the company is going to “continue our efforts” to respond to “constructive criticism.” “All game footage presented so far,” they say, “is in development and the game will keep evolving until launch.” It’s frustrating that these issues aren’t identified.</p><p>The most telling aspect of the response that directly addresses those who continue in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428">the delusion that external companies are controlling the “woke” content of games</a></span>, reads,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We also want to clarify that while we have been consulting with many people throughout the development process, they are in no way responsible for the decisions that are taken by the creative teams in the interests of gameplay and entertainment.</p></blockquote><p>It goes on to add the publisher’s wish that everyone stop harassing such groups.</p><figure id="" data-id="a634fa84035c9892bada3165c662f028" data-recommend-id="image://a634fa84035c9892bada3165c662f028" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The assassin stares across snowy Feudal Japan as the sun sets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The assassin stares across snowy Feudal Japan as the sun sets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a634fa84035c9892bada3165c662f028" data-recommend-id="image://a634fa84035c9892bada3165c662f028" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The assassin stares across snowy Feudal Japan as the sun sets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The final part of the statement reads:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The representation of Yasuke in our game is an illustration of [creative license]. His unique and mysterious life made him an ideal candidate to tell an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> story with the setting of Feudal Japan as a backdrop.</p><p>While Yasuke is depicted as a samurai in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, we acknowledge that this is a matter of debate and discussion. We have woven carefully into our narrative and with our other lead character, the Japanese shinobi Naoe, who is equally important in the game, our dual protagonists provide players with different gameplay styles.</p></blockquote><p>Lots of people want to see themselves represented as the main character of a video game. There are rather a lot of games that feature white men in this role, and indeed a fair few with Japanese men as the lead. This one, as it happens, features a Black dude and a Japanese woman. People can choose to buy the game or not based on this knowledge. It perhaps doesn’t help when publishers give oxygen to those who fail to grasp this simple concept by issuing forelock-tugging statements that attempt to address the bad-faith arguments such people raise.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Eventually, these releases slowed down, at least in part because they were causing numerous problems for the community.

That begins with the reintroduction of the Impaler, a Terminid enemy type that burrows in the ground and unleashes large, ferocious tentacles to fight players. According to <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s design director Miklas Malmborg, the Impalers are meant to “cut off your escape route” with their large tentacles, at which point you can reroute or stay and fight. Fans actually began theorizing that the Impalers were on their way to <em>Helldivers 2 </em>months ago, after a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cie618/a_real_what_now/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cie618/a_real_what_now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post mentioned tentacles a few times</a></span> and seemed to show off at least <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-warbond-battle-pass-weapon-bad-1851467213&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-warbond-battle-pass-weapon-bad-1851467213">one new weapon specifically meant to combat them</a></span>.</p><p>There are even more enemies, too. Terminids will also be getting a new variant of the Charger that rocks a bunch of noxious spores on its carapace and is followed by a fog effect. Expect to see these things pop out of nowhere every now and then, folks. Automatons, the brutal robot horde that <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players are also combatting in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing Second Galactic War</a></span>, are also getting some upgrades. Basic foot soldiers seem to be getting a jump pack upgrade, but the biggest incoming threat on that front are new rocket-launching tanks. From afar, you can see them unleashing volleys into the sky to come back down on your head; otherwise, they’ll be firing right at you.<br></p><p>These updates to the enemy forces are being accompanied by a whole new difficulty level. While Arrowhead didn’t go into too much detail about what to expect on difficulty 10, it’s probably safe to assume that it’ll be a nightmare, especially if these new units are a part of things.</p><p>Mission variety is also being spruced up in the Escalation of Freedom update. Arrowhead most heavily teased a new mission type about the retrieval of a Terminid larva, which goes into a case on a player’s back and then must be escorted back to extraction. To make things difficult, the larva will cry, which can be heard by the bigger Terminids, who will proceed to swarm squads. Additionally, and perhaps most exciting to me personally, there will now be bigger enemy outposts to take out. Arrowhead’s CEO Johan Pilestedt referred to these things as fortresses and goddamn, do they kind of look like it.</p><p>These encampments have always been randomly generated and placed around the map, but they were hardly an issue due to their small size. Throwing the right kind of stratagem (deployable weapons and abilities like orbital strikes) into one would wipe it off the map, and eventually we even got weapons that were really excellent about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-r-36-erupter-best-gun-premium-warbond-1851419855&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-r-36-erupter-best-gun-premium-warbond-1851419855">taking out even the biggest bug nests</a></span> in a matter of seconds. These much larger outposts seem like they’ll present far more of a challenge, whether due to their increased scope, the new enemies bound to populate them, or the sheer density of foes we should likely escape, especially on the new difficulty.</p><p>The additions simply don’t stop there, either. There will be a new version of the swamp environment because Arrowhead wanted to “spook it up.” It appears to tout a darker sky with the occasional crack of lightning, and the whole thing really does look a fuckton moodier than before. There will also be new environmental hazards and reworks of existing ones, like the Acid Storm, which now applies a debuff to both players and enemies instead of just limiting visibility.</p><p>There will even be some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quality-of-life fixes in the new update</a></span> that players will likely appreciate. Social menus are being improved to make it easier to join friends, and kicking is being retooled to stop griefing players as much. Kicked players will now become the host of their own session immediately after being given the boot, and they will be able to pick up any loot from the last match.</p><p>Elsewhere, the galactic war is still in full swing, and while the studio teases <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-black-hole-meridia-major-order-1851515722&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-black-hole-meridia-major-order-1851515722">developments for the story</a></span>, including mention of Terminid migration patterns and “irregular readings” of their spores in sectors of the galaxy, it stops short of giving away anything major. In fact, the trailer ends with various members of the studio doubling down on secrecy and outright declaring that they haven’t shared everything new that’s coming. Fine, keep your secrets.</p><p>As far as I’m concerned, this major update marks the beginning of a new kind of season for <em>Helldivers 2, </em>as well as a new cadence for releases. Seeing Arrowhead begin to take its time to properly stew on some ideas and mechanics is a relief after they released new content at an alarming clip in <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s early months, and it seems to be going over well with fans. Updates began to get consolidated into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-buff-stratagems-1851540317&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-buff-stratagems-1851540317">more impactful patches</a></span> that didn’t break the game as much, and after an especially turbulent period following the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071">PSN login debacle</a></span>, fans appreciated the stability, as well as the ability to just keep up with their new favorite game.</p><p>I wouldn’t mind if we moved to a model where we get one of these major updates every few months over the past haphazard schedule. As impressive as it was, <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s early content releases and surprises always seemed untenable, and this new update feels a hell of a lot more healthy for everyone involved. Moreover, slapping a date on a bunch of new content has me genuinely excited to jump back in when <em>Helldivers 2 </em>receives its first major update in just two weeks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new official <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc/news/2024-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, EA revealed a full 2024 roadmap for EA Sports WRC, confirming a new expansion is coming October 2024 and other key details.</p>



<p>October’s Season Expansion will include “new locations, rally stages, high-performance vehicles, liveries and more.” The devs add they will reveal the complete details about the expansion “in the coming months.”</p>



<p>It also announced that two additional DLC packs will follow. The first will release in Winter 2024, while the second is currently slated for Spring 2025. Among other things, the DLC packs will feature new cars, rally stages, and moments.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Today’s 2024 roadmap for WRC also confirms the Season 6 Rally Pass will launch on July 30 with new liveries, suits, and helmets. </p>



<p>The new Rally Pass will be free for all players, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wrc-moments-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the moments feature</a> will return. Fans can also unlock liveries outside the WRC Rally1 class. Further, it will overhaul the rewards system, allowing players to customize drivers with complete cosmetic sets rather than unlocking them piece by piece.</p>



<p>In addition to the roadmap, today’s blog gave fans an update about WRC eSports. EA confirmed it is “still in development” and coming soon. The devs are “almost ready” to share details about official competitions.</p>



<p>EA Sports WRC first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-wrc-releases-november-3-features-car-builder-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in November 2023</a>, and is available now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/original-signed-nes-tetris-charity-auction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A signed copy of the original NES version of influential puzzle classic&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>is to be auctioned off to support a trans charity.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/alyssa_merc/status/1815519512944361922" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alyssa Mercante on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the cartridge has been signed by Alexey Pajitnov and Henk Rogers, the creator and original licenser of&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>respectively. It also bears the rather amusing legend "PLAY&nbsp;<em>TETRIS</em>!". As if you could stop yourself.</p>
<p>The game will be up for grabs during the Firefall Firesale Get Rich or DEI Trying Stream-a-Thon, which is being held on August 3rd to support trans charity <a href="https://translifeline.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trans Lifeline</a>, a "peer support and crisis hotline" organization that supports the trans community.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nes-tetris-signed-copy-alyssa-mercante.jpg?itok=bI2O4yvc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nes-tetris-signed-copy-alyssa-mercante.jpg?itok=f_yk79uY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Image <a href="https://x.com/alyssa_merc/status/1815519512944361922/photo/1">courtesy of Alyssa Mercante on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Pajitnov, who currently resides in the US, is known as the original designer of&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>, which was based in part on the game of pentominoes he used to play in his childhood.</p>
<p><em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>was originally released in 1985, but perhaps its most famous port is the Game Boy version, which was released in 1989. A version for the NES followed shortly afterwards, and that's the cartridge you'd be buying if you bid at the aforementioned auction.</p>
<p>Henk Rogers, meanwhile, is the person who originally acquired the rights to&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>and subsequently negotiated with Nintendo for its inclusion on the Game Boy. Alongside Pajitnov, he'd later found The Tetris Company, an organization that remains active today and that still holds the exclusive rights to&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>in all its forms.</p>
<p>In essence, what all of this means is that these signatures are from people extremely important to the&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>lineage, so this is a pretty swanky piece of history to own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tetris-99-nintendo.jpg?itok=mqDxNVhO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tetris-99-nintendo.jpg?itok=9bOKcWEU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>remains a hugely popular game today.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to know more about the history of&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>, you can check out the movie of the same name, which is <a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/tetris/umc.cmc.4evmgcam356pzgxs2l7a18d7b" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available on Apple TV+</a> and which stars&nbsp;<em>Rocketman&nbsp;</em>actor Taron Egerton. It's a surprisingly fascinating story.</p>
<p>It's a good time to be a fan of retro gaming curiosities right now; yesterday, a super-rare gold Nintendo World Championships NES cartridge <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gold-nes-cartridge-auction">went up for auction</a>, and at time of writing, its most recent bid is <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1990-nes-nintendo-gold-world-championships-missing-cartridge-usa-cartrwlodh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an eye-watering $67,000</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>auction is for charity, let's hope it reaches similar heights. Stay tuned for more.</p>

On August 6th, the Escalation of Freedom update will offer players new game modes, enemies, mission objectives, and a much more punishing difficulty. In the announcement trailer, chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt and design director Niklas Malmborg went over the details, sharing that they’re planning on bringing back an old enemy from the original <em>Helldivers</em> to terrorize freedom lovers across the galaxy. </p><p>The impaler is a large enemy type designed to halt divers’ attempts to esca... err <em>tactical retreats</em>. The update will include a number of new enemy types both terminid and automaton, while remixing existing enemies to give players a new experience. Speaking of experiences, the <em>Helldivers</em> team also shared details on one of the new mission objectives: retrieve the larva. In that mission, divers will be tasked with carrying a screaming terminid larva through enemy territory to reach the extraction point. In addition to the new mission, enemy outposts have been expanded, turning them into massive, more challenging bases for players to capture. Finally, <em>Helldivers 2</em> will be getting a brand-new difficulty level, combat rating 10, that’s meant to be a significant step up from other difficulties.</p><p><em>Helldivers 2</em> has enjoyed massive success since its release in February of this year. The game did, however, suffer a couple setbacks with server instability and by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24148144/helldivers-2-steam-psn-account-link-review-bombing">requiring PC players to connect to a PSN account</a>. Arrowhead and Sony <a href="https://youtu.be/pQl2BmhSCsA?si=1kr25OfDJqF-08G7">later walked back that decision</a> after a massive outcry from players, including review bombing the game on Steam.</p><p>Despite the game’s success, player numbers on Steam have seen a bit of a dip since February. Likely, this new content refresh, which the developers say is the first step of many they have planned, will be what the game needs to bring back the masses. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To continue the mostly fun vibes of the expansion, the raid puts the Warrior of Light in an anime-style tournament in which they face off against progressively tougher and more eccentric foes. The second opponent you go up against is Honey B. Lovely. As her name might suggest, she’s a bee-themed boss wearing yellow and black from head to toe. The stage you fight her in is also full of bright neon pinks, purples, and yellows. In fact, it’s essentially a concert stage, with adoring fans of Honey B. Lovely sitting in the audience. Once the raid itself starts, it’s a frantic fight, a surprisingly upbeat pop song begins to play, this is “Bee My Honey.”</p><p><em>Final Fantasy 14</em> is no stranger to incredible music.

From the song’s almost <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hatsune-miku-expo-2024-hologram-led-tv-screen-concert-1851395526&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hatsune-miku-expo-2024-hologram-led-tv-screen-concert-1851395526">vocaloid</a></span> sounding intro you can tell that this song is going to be a hit. </p><p>Honey B. Lovely gives a fantastic comedic performance switching between playing a pop idol persona to adoring fans while also reminding you, her opponent, that if you don’t succumb to her “you’re as good as dead.” Even if the Warrior of Light does ultimately defeat Honey B. Lovely, the idol has won the hearts of countless new fans in the community.</p><p>What’s so impressive about “Bee My Honey” is that, as a raid song you’ll have to hear on repeat as you farm the fight for gear, it never seems to get old. Quite the opposite, it only gets better every time you listen. I’ve been listening to it on repeat the entire time I write this article, it rocks! The community seems to agree, with many sharing the sentiment that the weekly reward reset is a welcome event because it gives them a reason to go back to the Arcadion and listen to “Bee My Honey” while battling Honey B. Lovely. That’s made even funnier by the prospect that any raid drama that does arise from the Honey B. Lovely fight will always occur with this earworm in the background. </p><p>Now all we have to do is wait for the official <em>Dawntrail </em>soundtrack to release so I can put “Bee My Honey” on loop instead of restarting a YouTube video every time the song ends.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Archetype Entertainment has unveiled new concept art along with a short story for its upcoming sci-fi RPG Exodus. </p>



<p>This new short story “articulates the high stakes and specific challenges that The Travelers face throughout their brave journeys across the universe.” This is the sixth short story in the prologue to give players the backstory of the game, and why things have gotten to the state they’re in.</p>



<p>First revealed at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exodus-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2023</a>, Exodus tells the story of travelers who were forced to leave Earth. Upon leaving the planet, “humanity has found a new home in a hostile galaxy” where they are the underdogs who must fight to survive.</p>



<p>There is currently no release for the game. When it launches, Exodus will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>You can see the new Exodus concept art and read the latest short story below as well as catch up on past stories via <a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US/prologue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-exodus-the-travelers-humanity-s-eternal-warriors">Exodus: The Travelers–Humanity’s Eternal Warriors</h2>



<p><em>The loud echo of the steel door closing on your ship, the silence that grips your heart as you depart, and with each and every star you pass, a subtle reminder that time is ticking away back home. Becoming a Traveler is no small feat.&nbsp; There is no training program to ease the transition into a lonely and isolating life that comes to surround you like a skin you cannot shed. The act of balancing the known threats looming over your homeworld versus the unknown dangers you will face on your mission is the first trial you have to conquer.&nbsp; Everything else is just table stakes as we used to say back on Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Nothing you have experienced up to this point can prepare you for the perils that await. But you know that.&nbsp; That’s why you became a Traveler. The fear of losing everything, even our very lives, is not daunting enough to deter us from our goal – ensuring the survival of our species.</em></p>



<p><em>What defines us? We believe in the value of our inheritance and the promise of our heritage. The belief that we will survive, and triumph, is in our DNA—it is the most powerful weapon we have against our Celestial adversaries. We have not lost that spirit that empowers us to confront the unthinkable and believe we can prevail. Humans share an undying faith that we are meant to be. History has taught us to stand firm in the presence of evil and to tap our inner strength—to harness our faith in humanity as the power to fuel our actions. This bond unites us in our commitment to humanity’s survival, to our salvation. Against the Celestials, it is our secret weapon. Well, one of them anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>We hardly think about the fact that surviving an Exodus is a near miracle. On the surface, we are ill-equipped to battle such insurmountable power and live to tell our tales. But what we lack in physical strength or technology, we compensate for with courage, conviction, and commitment. We leverage our hearts against their intelligence; we use our instinct to fight their intentionality and inspiration to outwit their innovation.&nbsp; Our mission is spiritual: a commitment to humanity’s salvation.&nbsp; Their goal is practical. Based on the logic that they were here millennia ahead of us and have evolved well beyond us, they do not need us—or want us.&nbsp; We are but a grim reminder of a past they have chosen to forget. But does superiority trump spirituality? Does it?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Travelers are a rare breed. Committed to challenging an enemy whose intelligence vastly outstrips our own. The Celestials, once our equals, 40,000 years ago, are now highly advanced beings with superior technology, ingenuity, and therefore, great power. To the Celestials, we are relics of a past they have discarded; useless and worse, a threat to their continued existence and dominance. They see us as a passing infestation that they must eradicate. To us, they represent what happens when you sacrifice your humanity on the altar of technology. We fight to shift the balance in our favor, hoping to create a new civilization that is wiser, more compassionate, and more connected.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Hailing from disparate homeworlds, all Travelers are bound by The First Principles: “Assume Nothing, Question Everything.” This philosophy is vital for maintaining our sanity in a universe where so many of humanity’s beliefs are challenged or discarded and deemed irrelevant. Separated by our travels and spread across distant stars, it is not often we have the chance to connect with our comrades. But we are allied – united by our shared faith in humanity.&nbsp; We know they are out there fighting with us.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Our common bond is that we can never escape the real enemy – time dilation. While we spend mere weeks on a mission, years slip away at home. Time stretches and warps, reshaping our homeworld and forcing unforeseen changes on loved ones left behind. Ties to our homes grow tenuous, our relationships are tested, and the heartache of separation from all that we hold dear is a constant companion on every mission. In the endless stretch of space, the silence is deafening, giving our nightmares free rein.&nbsp; Most heart-wrenching of all is when we return to find our homeworld pillaged or destroyed.&nbsp; The horrors that strike in our absence dull whatever successes we achieve, be they hard-won relics, tech, or insights. Though outwardly we appear unchanged, our souls carry indelible scars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>The life of a Traveler is a heroic pursuit of survival and spirituality fueled by skill and grit (something no longer present in our technologically advanced descendants). It’s less about braving the unknown and more about the defiance that comes from a bold heart and a resolute spirit. We are humanity’s eternal warriors, traversing time and space to face the unexpected and capture the unimaginable. We are the explorers, treasure hunters, archaeologists, scientists, and engineers… the pathfinders who are always pushing the barriers and battling the obstacles that block the way to a better future. We are also mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Friends and lovers.&nbsp; We don’t know any better than to overcome.&nbsp; That is our heritage… the same legacy that follows us from Earth, where we escaped extinction. We did not come this far to go quietly.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>For each of us, every Exodus mission is a leap into the abyss —the only thing we can be sure of is that days for us are decades back home. Time dilation is a blessing and a curse. Every minute we lose with our loved ones, every tear we shed upon our return is a part of our story and a reminder of our humanity.&nbsp; Every decision is made in service to ending the sacrifices we make to time. We are the frontline fighters in humanity’s final battle: survival vs. extinction. We are humanity’s last hope. When you think back on our history as a species, we have survived political upheavals, cultural revolutions, and wars.&nbsp; Who knows… perhaps one day we will have our day of independence, a day to celebrate and honor the timeless sacrifices we Travelers make for humanity’s future.</em></p>



<p><em>And that, my child, is what it means to be a Traveler. We exist outside of time; it is the price we pay. One day, I hope our story will be etched ‘into the history books’ of Centauri.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/at-least-it-will-be-satisfying-to-wreck-fortnites-cybertruck<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The internet is full of things to cheer you up, or at least distract you, when you’re sad. One of my go-to videos is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCQn_FkFElI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Moonlight</em> winning Best Picture</a> at the Oscars in 2017. Another is the video of the Cybertruck reveal, where Elon Musk<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udxR5rBq_Vg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> dares a guy to break the monstrosity’s armored windows</a>, but when the guy throws a ball at the car the glass cracks. It’s a good video because Musk is terrible, and his truck is terrible, so it’s satisfying to watch them both be humiliated on a public stage. If you want to experience some of that humiliation in virtual form, the Cybertruck is in <em>Fortnite</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Cybertruck is a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/unlock-the-cybertruck-in-fortnite-by-goin-on-a-summer-road-trip-with-the-squad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quest reward</a>, where getting a certain amount of XP in different game modes earns progress toward unlocking the car and some variations. (If you’re not a <em>Fortnite</em> player, it’s worth noting that the Cybertruck isn’t a discrete vehicle, but rather a cosmetic for in-game SUVs.) The car can be earned for free, but will also be on sale in <em>Fortnite</em>’s item shop in August. The quest can also be progressed in Epic-owned <em>Rocket League</em>, which has its own terrible version of the truck.</p><p>People have been rightly <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1815386568263110908/quotes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mocking</a> this since its reveal on Monday, when the <em>Fortnite</em> Twitter account posted a <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1815386568263110908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> featuring the Cybertruck in a car-vs-car game of tug-of-war, a reference to a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1198751258384818176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla video</a> showing a Cybertruck against a Ford about which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elon-musks-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-available-to-buy-in-fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer </a>writes that “Tesla's original video shows the Cybertruck winning, though Ford said Tesla cheated and asked for a rematch.” The most common jabs have been that you shouldn’t be able to drive the <em>Fortnite</em> Cybertruck in water or up hills, and several very funny <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1e9q3ya/gameplay_footage_of_the_upcoming_cybertruck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fakeouts</a> of supposed in-game footage of the truck that are just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1e9xq3z/howd_they_get_the_tesla_cybertruck_early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pictures of dumpsters</a>. Players have been saying that anyone sporting the vehicle in-game should be driven from the match on site; I woke up early this morning curious to see this happening, but since the truck can’t be unlocked yet, we’ll have to wait a bit to see if players stay true to their vow.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3OKTfZS5qE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This reaction reflects feelings about the real-life Cybertruck, which is a universal <a href="https://jalopnik.com/this-is-how-the-tesla-cybertruck-became-a-culture-war-o-1851601057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laughingstock</a>: a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/cars/tesla-recalling-cybertruck/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">constantly-recalled</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-rusting-complaints-from-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blemish-prone</a>, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/tech/the-tesla-cybertrucks-fail-safe-for-a-stuck-charge-cable-can-actually-break-the-plug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">janky</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cybertrucks-stiff-structure-sharp-design-raise-safety-concerns-experts-2023-12-08/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dangerous</a> machine that highlights Musk’s bad taste and worse decision-making. I recently saw my first Cybertruck in the wild while biking through Brooklyn a few weeks ago, and I was weirded out by how it looked both too big and too small, a disturbing hunk of angles that calls to mind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHGczDHTDpo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Homer’s disastrous car design</a> from <em>The Simpsons</em> except in no way funny.&nbsp;</p><p>The bad car is the brainchild of a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/12/tech/spacex-elon-musk-former-employees-lawsuit/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad</a> man, who has driven Twitter into the ground and is currently being a weirdo about <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184097/trump-elon-musk-causing-kamala-harris-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kamala Harris running for President</a> and <a href="https://x.com/GBBranstetter/status/1815518427093557614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying some appalling shit about his trans kid</a>. While it’s gross to see <em>Fortnite</em> get in bed with this guy, even if you could argue it’s at a remove, it’s also not totally surprising; Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has the kind of free speech, “no politics” <a href="https://kotaku.com/epic-boss-confusing-comments-about-games-and-politics-d-1841706060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politics</a> that are prone to jumping the track. Part of me worries that, since kids are going to see the <em>Fortnite</em> Cybertruck, this is some effort to launder the car’s reputation–and, by extension, Musk’s reputation–to a younger generation, though I also have zero faith that the real-life car will still be on the road by the time your average <em>Fortnite</em> player is old enough to drive.</p><p>When I booted up <em>Fortnite</em> this morning to look for the truck, I was prominently greeted with a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/disneys-pirates-of-the-caribbean-docks-into-fortnite-br" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> event</a> replete with a Jack Sparrow character. Players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1dndgg5/thoughts_on_jack_sparrow_not_really_looking_like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">torn</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeppDelusion/comments/1e3abiq/it_boggles_my_mind_that_in_a_few_days_fortnite_is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether</a> the skin actually resembles <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23043519/johnny-depp-amber-heard-defamation-trial-fairfax-county-domestic-abuse-violence-me-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnny Depp</a>, and this feels like an obvious outcropping of Epic’s recent <a href="https://aftermath.site/disney-epic-fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deal with Disney</a> rather than anything more nefarious, but the two events combined caused me to heave a deep sigh. We have enough <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dr-disrespect-allegations-journalists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad men</a> in and around games to not need to tap in guys from other fields to make things worse, and it feels like one more symptom of <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-cant-go-home-again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how different <em>Fortnite</em> is </a>from what it started as. Of course it was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3bkgj/fortnite-fortnight-black-appropriation-dance-emote" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never</a> some happy wonderland, but we’re likely to see more and more questionable tie-ins as the game races after the <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-donald-mustard-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metaverse</a> ambitions that have already cost so many people their <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/layoffs-at-epic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jobs</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Because now I’ve made myself depressed, it will be fun to see who brings the shame of the Cybertruck on themselves and what happens in response, so at least we have that to look forward to. I will take a particular delight in wrecking one of Musk’s trucks while kitted out like a <a href="https://aftermath.site/lego-fortnite-cat-enters-his-queer-elder-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trans guy cat</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
