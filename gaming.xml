              <p><i><span>Dead Space </span></i><span>was revealed to be</span><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/dead-space-franchise-is-on-ice-ea-has-zero-plans-for-a-revival-rumor"> <span>permanently on ice</span></a><span> last year. We haven’t seen a non-VR version of the </span><i><span>Thief </span></i><span>franchise since 2014. </span><i><span>Deus Ex</span></i><span> has lain dormant for a decade. </span><i><span>Titanfall 2</span></i><span> also came out ten years ago. There hasn’t been a new 3D </span><i><span>Prince of Persia </span></i><span>for 16 years, and with</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"> <span>this week’s news</span></a><span> it’s looking unlikely to return. So many massive, deeply loved gaming franchises are routinely being shelved by companies too afraid to gamble the nine-figure sums publishers believe is necessary for success. Yet there’s such an obvious solution!&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Every time I read a headline about a game franchise being shelved because it’s become too expensive, too big of a risk for a publisher to gamble $200 million on, I want to scream into the sky at the obviousness of the solution. But now, following the 2025 success of games like </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Lies of P</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Helldivers 2</span></i><span>, surely the answer is clear to everyone? License these once big-name franchises to proven mid-size AA teams, and don’t interfere.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the wake of</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869"> <span>Ubisoft’s latest</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169"><span>disastrous</span></a><span> plan to rearrange itself by cancelling multiple projects, and the seemingly constant drip of major publishers shelving major franchises, all while giant company buys giant company for imaginary money, the industry has clearly got itself into a very bad place. Right now, during this grotesque phase of consolidation, with multi-billion-dollar sales seeing publishers consume one another, a financial black hole is being formed.</span></p> <p><span>With the colossally over-inflated prices involved in these deals, those buying are either borrowing heavily from predatory investors or gambling huge stakes of their own fortunes, such that the sheer notion of creating a new game in a once-loved series (let alone an original IP) becomes fantastically risky. To match the ridiculous valuations, the games these companies make are burdened with a need for justification, and every project must be predicted to bring in at least half a billion bucks to be worth even storyboarding. Ubisoft has just declared that it intends the games it makes to annually bring in a billion dollars each! Development costs therefore become self-destructively high, with expectations of figures of at least $200 million being spent to create something with enough spectacle to dazzle a hypothetical mainstream audience. Everything now needs to be the next </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> at a time</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-activision-2000652111"> <span>when even </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> can’t manage that</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sure, welcome to capitalism 101: It doesn’t work. The need to always grow bigger, for share values to always increase, is a model so unsustainable that a pre-schooler could explain why. But here’s the thing, also easily grasped by toddlers: a moderately successful game that costs around $50 million to develop will make an awful lot more money than no game at all.</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Dead Space</i></b><b> Needn’t Be Dead</b></h2> <p><span>The most recent example of a beloved game series being shelved is </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span>. In late 2025,</span><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/dead-space-franchise-is-on-ice-ea-has-zero-plans-for-a-revival-rumor"><span> following rumors some months before that </span></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-2-remake-canceled-sales-motive-battlefield-1851400721"><span>a </span><i><span>Dead Space 2 </span></i><span>remake had been cancelled</span></a> <span>after the supposedly disappointing sales for 2023’s remake of the original game, </span><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/dead-space-franchise-is-on-ice-ea-has-zero-plans-for-a-revival-rumor"><span>word went around</span></a><span> that EA had put the franchise “on ice.” In December 2024 we’d also learned that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-4-ea-remake-horror-1851727387"><span>the series’ original creators had tried to pitch a </span><i><span>Dead Space 4</span></i><span> to EA</span></a><span>, but had been immediately rejected. One of those original creators, Glen Schofield, still didn’t give up,</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-creator-sees-chance-make-dead-space-4-ea-saudi-deal-2000636125"> <span>maintaining in October last year that he was attempting to buy the IP back from EA</span></a><span> in the wake of</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829"> <span>the company’s attempted sale to Saudi Arabia</span></a><span>, but by December 2025</span><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/dead-space-franchise-is-on-ice-ea-has-zero-plans-for-a-revival-rumor"> <span>this looked incredibly unlikely</span></a><span>. Which is crazy! Because a new </span><i><span>Dead Space </span></i><span>is not something EA needs to be the least bit afraid of.</span></p> <p><span>The original </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span>, released in 2008,</span><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/18/ex-visceral-dev-reveals-dead-space-2-cost-60-million-and-underperformed-on-4-million-sales/"> <span>cost approximately $37 million to make</span></a><span>. Adjusted for inflation, that’s $55 million in 2026 money.</span><span> And that was an in-house Electronic Arts studio, spending EA money within EA’s ludicrous corporate structure. I truly believe, with my whole lovely heart, that a well-established AA team would be easily capable of making a game of the caliber of that first, excellent horror-shooter for even less money than that, especially if innovative and novel ideas are used in place of the very fanciest modern graphics.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000662618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662618"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662618">© Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Here’s another thing my heart believes: That </span><i><span>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</span></i><span> remake that Ubisoft</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-leak-2000647174"> <span>was unable to make for six agonizing years</span></a><span> before eventually</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"> <span>killing it entirely</span></a><span>, could have been turned around by any number of excellent smaller teams. I’m not suggesting for a moment it would be </span><i><span>easy</span></i><span> to do so—it would be fantastically hard, just like making any other top-quality game—but it would be eminently achievable. Not least because, not being made internally at Ubisoft, it wouldn’t have Ubisoft constantly getting in the way. By all reports, </span><i><span>Sands of Time</span></i><span>‘s remake went through multiple iterations, scrapped and started over at least twice, and eventually was the victim of so much feature-creep that it was adding all-new powers, making Farah an entirely different character (for the better, I should add, but in the most complex way), and adding all-new content.</span></p> <p><span>However, in the hands of a super-capable and proven AA team with a proclivity for the genre and a love of the original, it could have been a far more straightforward process. That 2003 original doesn’t need new powers, nor new levels, because it was </span><i><span>fantastically good</span></i><span>. It’s one of the best third-person action games ever made, and featured a time-manipulation gimmick that should have become industry standard. At 23 years old, the original is still a great game, but a clunky and dated one that would benefit so wonderfully from a modern refresh. And that’s all anyone had ever been hoping for from Ubisoft.</span></p> <p><span>I’m sure there are many throwing up their arms and claiming that I’m over-simplifying things here. And yes, I’m being perfunctory, but I’d argue that’s because this is all relative. You might be surprised to learn just how needlessly complicated Ubisoft has made making games, even as far back as the 2000s. . I remember visiting Ubisoft Montreal for the announcement of </span><i><span>Splinter Cell: Double Agent</span></i><span> in 2005, and sitting in their offices as executives explained that development of the game was taking place 24 hours a day by being spread across at least three international studios. When Montreal finished work, they tagged in Ubisoft Milan, who would then pass the baton to Ubisoft Shanghai, and then back to Montreal. There were multiple daily video calls (2005 video calls at that) to try to manage this. Throughout the creation of the game it was </span><i><span>also</span></i><span> worked on by Ubisoft Toronto, Paris-based Gameloft, and North Carolina’s Red Storm. Imagine working like that. Try to imagine a more chaotic way to develop a game. (I remember asking developers how it could possibly work, and the rather taut smiles as they explained that it “wasn’t easy.”)</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000662616" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662616"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662616">© Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Something &gt; Nothing</b></h2> <p><span>So no, a AA team making a $50 million (or even a $5 million) game won’t deliver the spectacle and mainstream breakthrough appeal of </span><i><span>Battlefield</span></i><span>, but nor does it need to. If you’re spending $400m on a game (before you even factor in the cost of a global promotional campaign and wildly expensive influencer events), you need it to be bringing in numbers as close to a billion dollars as possible. If that’s not at all realistic, then the project can’t get greenlit in the first place. But if you’ve spent $50m, and justifiably charge $60 for a top-quality product, you are in the black with so many fewer sales. If your game hits (and let’s remember, we’re in this mess because of all the $200m+ gambles that have missed), you could be in for vast profits.</span></p> <p><span>And it’s not fantasy figures, either! </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trigger-nade-kettle-pvp-nerfs-2000659269"><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> announced this month that it has sold 12 million copies</span></a><span>, which at $40 a pop amounts to $480,000,000. Yup. Half a billion bucks. Sure, minus store fees that’s “only” $336 million. We don’t know its development costs, but developers have stated it was nowhere near AAA budgets. And this is a game with optional in-game cosmetic purchases, meaning that figure is going to be </span><i><span>so</span></i><span> much higher.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s developers </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html"><span>claim</span></a><span> it cost less than $10 million to make, and it had sold over 6 million copies by the end of 2025. That means the $50 game has brought in at least $300,000,000 before store tithes. That’s a 3000 percent profit, and these are the numbers from </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sees-sales-spike-following-game-awards-success/"><i><span>before</span></i></a><span> the game won all the 2025 GOTY awards and the sales that will have resulted from that.</span></p> <p><span>These are certainly stand-out examples from last year (although only some of them), but these are figures Ubisoft or EA would sell their grandchildren’s souls to see. The point is, I’m not talking out of my hat here about the potential of spending far less on a far smaller team.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662617" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662617"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662617">© EA</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Many AA teams wouldn’t be interested in making a licensed game using someone else’s IP, and honestly, I wouldn’t want to trust a big-name publisher right now even if I were one who did. But many would! If you’re a small team with a $10 million project that didn’t catch fire, you’re in a very difficult place no matter how incredibly talented you might be. Many, many mid-size studios fold at that point, but what if there was the route of being trusted with the next </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Legacy of Kain</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Sleeping Dogs</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Thief</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Trespasser</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Command &amp; Conquer</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Titanfall</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Splinter Cell</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>SSX</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>Red Faction</span></i><span>, or…</span></p>

 <p><span>Maybe there’s some big, fatal flaw with this concept that would come to the surface on trying. But I’m really doubtful. The issue is the complete lack of ever trying! And honestly, in their crumbling, fire-sale-driven state, what does an Ubisoft or an EA have to lose?! There hasn’t been a </span><i><span>Splinter Cell</span></i><span> game since 2013, meaning for the last 13 years precisely $0 has been made on new </span><i><span>Splinter Cell </span></i><span>games. I realize that’s perhaps somewhat obvious, but it’s a really rather important point! A $10,000,000 </span><i><span>Splinter Cell</span></i><span> that “only” sells a million copies at $50 a pop: that’s a 500 percent profit. And even if it might seem like small change in a world where (very, very few) games bring in a billion dollars, it’s a heck of a lot more than $0.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has finally revealed its plans for the future of ARC Raiders, and as you could expect, it’s chock full of content. </p>



<p>This was all revealed in a recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders 2026 Roadmap</a>, where content for the next four months was laid out. A few bits drop in the remainder of January with the release of Headwinds, such as a new Player Project and Minor Map Condition, but the real fun begins in February with Shrouded Sky. </p>







<p>Check out this guide for everything to know about the new content coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-meta-guns-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> in February 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-every-piece-of-new-content-coming-to-arc-raiders-in-february-2026">Every Piece Of New Content Coming To ARC Raiders In February 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get ready for new experiences topside. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, the Escalation Roadmap for ARC Raiders suggests that plenty of new content is on the way, including a new Map Condition, new ARC, and even a new Map Update. </strong></p>



<p>And somehow, that’s not all, as February is gearing up to be a major month in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-aggression-based-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>. Here’s everything coming to ARC Raiders during the Shrouded Sky updates.</p>



<ul>
<li>New Map Condition</li>



<li>New ARC Threat</li>



<li>Player Project</li>



<li>Raider Deck</li>



<li>Map Update</li>



<li>Expedition Window</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a comprehensive list, and each phrase has a small image next to it, which might hint at more details. For example, the New Map Condition is pictured alongside a gust of wind—can we expect a storm to hit certain maps? As for the new ARC threat, a flying insect is shown, implying another airborne ARC is on the way. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-the-february-content-release-in-arc-raiders">When Will The February Content Release In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no detailed release window for the upcoming content, but it’s fair to assume that when it does drop, it’ll be at the usual ARC Raiders timings: 1:30 a.m. PT / 4:30 a.m. ET / 9:30 a.m. GMT / 10:30 a.m. CET</strong></p>



<p>It looks like it’s going to be an exciting month, but it can be frustrating to be left guessing when it could all arrive. It’s reasonable to assume that Embark Studios will scatter the content throughout the month to keep the game as fresh as possible. </p>







<p>That’s how they’ve handled it in the past, but everything is subject to change as it draws ever nearer. As usual, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> will keep this article updated should anything change or be announced.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Somehow, Beyond Good & Evil 2 Survived Ubisoft’s “Major Reset,” Claims it Remains a “Unique Proposition” Among Fantasy Genre]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-still-in-development-after-ubisoft-major-reset/</link>
            <guid>1414456</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The biggest news of the week is undoubtedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>Ubisoft</strong> undergoing a <strong>"<em>major reset</em></strong>" as a company</a>, shaking up its portfolio by cancelling six projects, including the <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>, delaying <strong>seven other projects</strong>, and <strong>spinning up four new IPs</strong>; and that's just what we know happened to its portfolio. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/"><strong>The whole structure of the company</strong> was shifted around to boot</a>, but through all of this mess, one long-running project survived: <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong>.</p>



<p>A game that was said to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-evil-2-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release/">"<em>years away from release</em>"</a> after it had already been in production for <strong>14 years at the time of that report</strong> (which itself is now <strong>four years old</strong>) is still worth burning money on, according to Ubisoft. In fact, the company still believes that the game has something to offer that makes it a "<em>unique proposition</em>" when compared to other modern fantasy games.</p>



<p>"<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains part of our portfolio and our roadmap and fits with our strategy of focusing on open world adventures</em>," a Ubisoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-long-in-the-works-beyond-good-and-evil-2-a-unique-proposition-in-the-open-world-adventure-market-studio-says">Eurogamer</a>, before continuing to say that fans of fantasy games are "<em>underserved</em>," and that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains a "<em>unique proposition</em>" for players.</p>



<p>We've known about Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 being in development at Ubisoft since <strong>2008</strong>, when it was first publicly revealed. Since then, the last time <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-revealed/">we saw an official trailer for it was at <strong>E3 2017</strong></a>. And while Ubisoft deemed the six to seven years spent on the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake were ultimately unsalvageable, the <strong>nearly 18 years it has spent on Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong> clearly aren't in the minds of Ubisoft leadership. They were <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-still-hiring-beyond-good-and-evil-2/">even hiring people for the project <strong>as recently as last November</strong></a>.</p>



<p>(<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">This is the same leadership that led the company to lose <strong>95% of its value in the last eight years.)</strong></a></p>



<p>Ultimately, who knows if this game will ever come out. If it does, and it's a hit, that's great for Ubisoft and for the people who will have likely been waiting a full <strong>20 years</strong> for it to release. But it's more likely that no matter the quality of the final release, no game, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 included, can live up to the expectations of a 20-year development period. If anything, you might find more people expecting the worst after it remained gestating for that long.</p>



<p>The fact that people are still working on it, and that there are still players waiting on it, is a testament to the mark left by the first game, which you can thankfully still go and play, and will be able to play for many more years now that a <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-confirmed-to-launch-on-june-25/">remaster of <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</strong> is available</a>. But with every passing year, the idea of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 releasing as a 'masterpiece of a video game worth the two-decade wait' is a pitch that becomes less and less convincing.</p>



<p>And that's all without mentioning the real kicker in all of this: by the time it comes out (if that day ever arrives), will anyone actually care? Which is to say, it's always a gamble when trying to bring back something old and make today's consumers who didn't grow up with it care about that thing.</p>



<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has been in development long enough to go to college, and it wouldn't be a surprise if today's generation of young players, who are more interested in playing 'forever games' like <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/"><strong>Roblox, Fortnite,</strong> <strong>Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto V</strong> and <strong>Minecraft</strong></a>, couldn't care less about a game from over a decade ago they've only heard of in passing, if they've heard of it at all.</p>

<h2>Arriving in Gold River</h2><p>Your adventure begins in a camping office where you can view brochures and look at some nice decorations. You're promised that supplies will be made available at your campsite; upon arriving, however, you find that the campsite is destroyed and you have nothing to your name other than the clothes on your back.</p><p>By all accounts, absolutely everything has gone wrong. The pilot who dropped you off via seaplane left without checking if everything was okay. Your supplies are gone. There are no other people around other than yourself (and if you're playing multiplayer, your friends).</p><blockquote><p>The tutorial seems a little too bare bones for this game, and the situation only gets more disappointing from there.</p></blockquote><p>A short tutorial directs players to their intended campsite and gives serviceable guidance for basic crafting. Once you've looted the area, you can then go wherever you like. If you paid attention, you'll find a note directing you to a cabin at the end of a nearby trail. You're walked through setting up a basic camp, and that's it.</p><p>I'm all for minimalist tutorials, especially in a game like this; a big part of the fun of survival crafting games is figuring things out yourself. That said, the tutorial seems a little <em>too</em> bare bones for this game, and the situation only gets more disappointing from there.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Crude Crafting and Survival</h2><p>Crafting in <em>The Gold River Project</em> uses a recipe unlock system; you need to research specific items to unlock crafting recipes using a "Learn" function in your inventory. This also destroys the item. In my first attempt, I couldn't find enough cloth to make a bed and had to restart.</p><p>I managed to find everything I needed on my second attempt and set up a small campsite at a nearby cabin. This cabin had a fishing rod and some animal bones inside. I destroyed one animal bone to learn how to make bone fishing hooks, and then I used the second animal bone to make them.</p><p>Much to my displeasure, I found that fishing did not work at all. Maybe I'm missing something, but the guaranteed spawn of these items and a nearby small dock implies that this would be a good place to fish. I spent a good 10 minutes on the shoreline with nothing to show for it.</p><p>Another issue I had was the inability to unlock a crafting bench. I still don't know what you have to research to unlock it, if the item even exists or functions correctly. This locked me out of many of the more interesting items for most of my short playthrough.</p><p>I had enough supplies where I felt comfortable exploring, but night was falling. I decided to go to sleep for the night and get moving in the morning, and this is where I encountered another problem: I couldn't figure out how to sleep to pass the night. I ended up waiting until the sun came up.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Hints of a Mystery</h2><p>My first in-game day was rife with problems, but I didn't want to give up on <em>The Gold River Project</em> just yet. A map in the visitor's center at the start of the game showed what looked like a fairly large playable area, so I decided to do a bit of exploring.</p><p>There are quite a few cabins, larger buildings, and other points of interest dotting the landscape. Most of these locations have some kind of useful loot, such as food or healing items. I found many items (such as batteries and electronics) that appeared useful but didn't immediately appear to have a use; they couldn't be researched, either.</p><p>Along the way, I found a few bits of lore. A cassette tape here, a handwritten note there. For the most part, though, I found a largely empty world devoid of any kind of meaningful objective other than surviving to the next day.</p><blockquote><p>I would have loved to explore the mystery in Gold River, but the barebones (and barely functional) survival and crafting mechanics killed any desire I had to continue.</p></blockquote><p>I didn't see much in the way of wildlife, either. At one point, I came across two deer next to a building that had a crafting bench inside it. As this was the only time I saw any animals, I strongly suspect that the appearance of these deer was scripted or otherwise pre-placed.</p><p>There was one element that really piqued my curiosity. Some of the buildings have cameras and spotlights on top of them. If you travel far enough, you'll encounter a futuristic force field keeping you in the playable area.</p><p>There's clearly some kind of high-tech surveillance happening here, and whoever is manning these cameras is definitely watching you. I would have loved to explore the mystery in Gold River, but the barebones (and barely functional) survival and crafting mechanics killed any desire I had to continue.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>The Gold River Project</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>From what I've seen, <em>The Gold River Project</em> is a little undercooked. I can forgive a lack of story and a weak tutorial in an Early Access game, but I can't overlook the poorly functioning survival mechanics and crafting system.</p><p>To the credit of Fairview Games Inc., it's quite upfront that it intends for this to be a genuine Early Access experience where it can collect feedback from players and build out the game from there. It's good that this developer is being up front about that.</p><p>If you're keen on providing genuine feedback to a game that is very much still under development, you might want to check out <em>The Gold River Project</em>. If you're looking for a new survival crafting game to play and enjoy right now, though, it's probably best to wait until <em>The Gold River Project's</em> many rough edges have been smoothed out.</p><hr><p>The Gold River Project <em>was previewed over approximately 6 hours of gameplay on PC via </em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253220/The_Gold_River_Project/" rel="nofollow"><em>Steam</em></a><em> with a key provided by the publisher.

            <p>The Saudi-led acquisition of Electronic Arts is meeting with more friction in the US House of Congress. 46 lawmakers have signed a letter calling on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the debt-financed $55 billion deal for signs that it could be damaging for workers and anti-competitive to the point of breaking US anti-trust law.</p>
<p>As passed along by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/congress-members-voice-serious-concern-over-saudi-led-ea-buyout">Game Developer</a>, the letter has been organised by Labor Caucus co-chairs Steven Horsford, Debbie Dingell, Mark Pocan, and Donald Norcross – the Labor Caucus being a group of over 120 members of Congress focused on "advancing the needs of working people and the labor movement” in the USA. </p>
<p>Sent 22 January, the letter suggests that the acquisition could lead to cost-cutting measures such as layoffs, the offshoring of development, and studio closures. Which doesn't feel like a massive reach, to me: if the deal goes through, the newly private and majority Saudi-owned EA will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">owe the banks $20 billion</a>. They definitely aren’t going to balance the books by delegating all their PowerPoint presentations to ChatGPT.</p>
<p>“We are committed to preserving fair, competitive labor markets and safeguarding American jobs, and given the impact of this acquisition on workers, labor market concentration, and the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. video game industry, we urge you to thoroughly review this transaction,” the lawmakers – all of them Democrats – write. </p><p>“Workers in the video game industry are already navigating an environment marked by instability, shrinking opportunities, and repeated rounds of layoffs,” the letter continues. “EA is one of the largest employers of video game workers in the United States, and evidence suggests the company already wields significant wage-setting power.” </p>
<p>The lawmakers note that EA has experienced “a steep decline in median worker pay year-over-year” and has “eliminated more than 1,700 U.S. jobs since 2023”, which they consider indicative of “a labor market where workers already have fewer alternatives and employers can impose deteriorating conditions without consequence.” They consider the aforesaid $20 billion debt package a strong incentive “for the acquiring firms to pursue further cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, offshoring, restructuring, or studio closure.”</p>
<p>The Labor Caucus co-chairs further argue that the acquisition could be both terrible for workers and anti-competitive, in that the proposed buyers – that’s Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Saudi-backed Affinity Partners - “hold extensive ownership stakes across sports leagues, sports-betting platforms, talent management, and game-development tools”. </p>
<p>“For example, Silver Lake’s ties to WME and TKO, along with PIF’s ownership of LIV Golf, would put EA under the same umbrella as major sports and entertainment brands that its games rely on for key licenses,” the lawmakers write. They’re concerned that if the deal goes through – and given that Kushner is married to the President's daughter, it’s unlikely to have much trouble - the purchasing consortium and EA would control enough of the sports sector to “restrict worker mobility and reduce bargaining power for employees throughout the industry”. They also think it could violate anti-trust laws.</p><p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">Unveiled in September last year</a>, the EA deal has already attracted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-ea-workers-slam-billion-dollar-buyout-for-risking-layoffs-to-pad-investor-pockets-while-senators-worry-about-saudi-arabia-rewriting-us-history">strong criticism from American unions and senators</a>. The unions argue, amongst other things, that EA is “not a struggling company” right now, making hundreds of millions in profit. As such, they think plunging the company into debt is an exercise in padding investor pockets at the expense of worker livelihoods. Can’t really disagree!</p>
<p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, are worried that selling EA to Saudi Arabia is a national security risk, commenting that the country might use EA consumer data for surveillance and propaganda. As ever, I can see the logic of this, but it’s worth noting that EA among other North American companies routinely publish games that are very flattering to the US military, and that US companies <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cybersecurity-microsoft-idUSBRE96A11R20130711/">have participated in government surveillance operations</a>.</p>
<p>A broader concern is that Saudi Arabia are buying up overseas brands, including a number of eSports organisations, to distract attention from their <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/saudi-arabia-human-rights-raif-badawi-king-salman">terrible human rights record</a>. There's also anxiety that the country’s authoritarian rulers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-eas-buyout-and-creator-exodus-the-sims-team-wants-you-to-know-their-values-and-commitment-remain-the-same">might impose their values on EA games like The Sims</a> that embrace diversity. One former BioWare executive has suggested that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> studio are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-exec-thinks-eas-new-owners-might-sell-bioware-and-use-other-studios-for-saudi-arabian-pr">particularly at risk of either co-option or closure</a>.</p>

That'll mean you can use it with the Steam Machine and Steam Deck, if you fancy a modded playthrough on the go or via a smaller package.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/after-killing-its-multiplatform-mod-manager-nexus-revives-its-spirit-with-an-announcement-that-its-windows-only-app-will-support-steamos-in-future/">Parliament Candidate Gamer</a>, the modding site have slipped this confirmation into a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15433">post</a> about their focuses for this year. Upon opting to stop developing the multiplatform Nexus Mods App <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-latest-modathon-isnt-a-typical-modathon-its-a-first-go-at-the-same-for-multi-mod-collections">earlier this month</a>, the Nexus folks hadn't ruled out potentially working the Linux support that was planned to include into what's now their one and only mod manager - the Windows-only Vortex.</p>
<p>Now, they've announced that they're committed to delivering Steam OS support to Vortex at some point in the future. "We’ll be targeting vanilla Steam hardware like the Steam Deck and Steam Machine," product manager Iluviel wrote. "We won’t be officially supporting any other configurations, but as Vortex is an open source project community developers will be free to extend support for their preferred Linux distros as they please."</p>
<p>I can only imagine how chuffed our dedicated treehouse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Machine</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-steam-deck-performance-settings">Deck</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-search-of-soul-with-the-steam-machine">enthusiast</a> James is about the idea of possibly having to have even more conversations with me on a weekly basis as a result of this. I can see his stoic expression now, as I gently poke him and declare: "That Thomas dragons mod for Skyrim runs great, you should analyse exactly how many frames per train carriage it's averaging". I can see his eyes rolling as I arrive at morning meetings wondering aloud whether I should shove a Steam Machine into a fairly titchy space just to get 40 minutes into a modded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> playthrough for the millionth time before giving up.</p>
<p>Actually, I can see him aiming his liquid-cooled 4090 blunderbuss at me from across the virtual office as we speak. Hey man, what it it that you w-</p>
<p>Well, that was unpleasant, but I've dusted myself off so I can relay the other stuff Nexus Mods said about their future plans for Vortex here. "Our plans for the year include a steady, iterative modernisation of the Vortex user experience," they wrote. "We’ll be investing in the developer experience, which will allow us to focus on quality-of-life improvements, specifically streamlining navigation, simplifying game management, and introducing more intuitive controls for load orders. You can expect the interface to become cleaner and more responsive as we integrate the design lessons learned from our recent projects."</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to pick large metal balls out of my face.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/palworld-pocketpair-steam-mhw-patch-pc-performance-2000662592</link>
            <guid>1414435</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Do you want to work on <em>Palworld</em>? Do you have an embarrassingly long Steam history to prove it? Will BioWare use a similar test to hire its new production director for <em>Mass Effect 5</em>? And can the next <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> patch finally fix performance on PC? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. This is my new favorite <a href="https://x.com/tct_adventures">behind the scenes game tease</a>. Game companies should spend less time firing people and more time being silly.</p> <h2>Gamers without Steam achievements need not apply</h2> <p>What makes a good game designer? For<em> Palworld</em> maker Pocketpair it’s people who play a lot of Steam games and can explain why their favorite ones are good. Don’t have a Steam game history? Don’t even bother applying. CEO Takuro Mizobe says people have to submit screenshots of their playtime and those without any are screened out.</p>

 <p>“In the interview, we ask them to explain the game mechanics of the titles that rank high in their Steam playtime, why they think those specific mechanics were adopted, and what makes that title stand out when compared to other games in the same genre,” Mizobe <a href="https://x.com/urokuta_ja/status/2014593734827246006">wrote on X</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-requires-game-designer-candidates-to-provide-screenshots-of-their-steam-libraries-and-playtime-according-to-ceo/"><em>Automaton</em></a>). “Pocketpair is recruiting game creators who are true Steam gamers!”</p> <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ next big performance patch arrives next week</h2> <p>“This patch will include optimization improvements for Steam-specific processes and options to reduce processing load,” reads an <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/2011732622435557475?s=20">announcement on the server status account</a> for an outage starting January 27. “It will also include a review of presets.” Another update will follow quickly after on February 18. Fans are hoping this is the one that finally makes a big difference with how the game runs on PC, especially after one modder apparently discovered <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">a weird DLC check bug</a> that was killing framerates.</p>

 <h2>BioWare is hiring for <em>Mass Effect 5</em></h2> <p>“We are looking for a Production Director&nbsp;with a passion for the&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>&nbsp;universe to serve as a high-impact leader on our next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em> title,” reads a new job posting. “You will partner closely with creative leadership, studio teams, and internal and external partners to champion the game’s vision and ensure its execution at the highest quality bar.” That person will report directly to project lead Michael Gamble. “It’s gonna be awesome,” he <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/2014438853273387358?s=20">wrote on X</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Vampire Crawlers</em> will have a free demo next month</h2> <p>The <em>Vampire Survivors-</em>turned-3D-deckbuilder dungeon crawler spin-off will be free-to-try starting on February 23 on Steam and Xbox Game Pass. The 3D pixel-art genre mash-up has been looking very neat and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ael4oMaKQM">has a new trailer</a> explaining more of how its gameplay will work.</p> <h2>Epic has a secret $800 million deal with Google</h2> <p>“Epic’s technology is used by many companies in the space Google is operating in to train their products, so the ability for Google to use the Unreal Engine more fulsome…sorry, I’m blowing this confidentiality,” CEO Tim Sweeney told a court questioning its settlement with the search giant, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/866140/epic-google-fortnite-android-unreal-deal-antitrust-settlement"><em>The Verge</em> reports</a>. The deal, which is for Epic buying Google’s services, is apparently related to “the metaverse” and will include both companies marketing one another’s products. It’s definitely not part of some sweetheart arrangement of the kind that Sweeney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23996474/epic-tim-sweeney-interview-win-google-antitrust-lawsuit-district-court">previously railed against</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169">Ubisoft’s stock is on life support&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-3-remake-ugly-alleyway-has-fans-concerned-graphics-downgrade-fix-mod-2000662269">Fans can’t figure out why one of the<em> Yakuza 3</em> remake’s back alleys is so ugly</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-steam-epic-games-publishing-deal-tim-sweeney-2000662259">Remedy defends Tim Sweeney’s honor over <em>Alan Wake 2</em> not being on Steam</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <p>The creator of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> VR mod, as well as a variety of other R.E.A.L VR mods, has taken his works down from Patreon after receiving another DMCA strike. This time, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> developer 505 Games.</p>
<p>Luke Ross, the creator of many VR mods for games including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> and others, issued a post on his Patreon explaining the situation to his supporters.</p>
<p>It reads: "DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they 'believe' their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don't like -- and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process."</p>

<p>The post continues: "In light of the above facts, I'm being forced to take immediate action. I'm making unavailable all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years, so that there will be no ground for further claims."

"And since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I'm making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time." Ross also stated his Patreon account is at risk of termination due to repeated DMCA strikes, resulting in his decision to strip his account of all of his VR mods."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-removed-by-cd-projekt-after-its-creator-wouldnt-release-it-for-free">This comes following a previous DMCA strike from CD Projekt Red</a>, which claimed Ross' Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod broke its fan works guidelines and as such was a breach of its intellectual property. Ross kicked back at the claim, but nonetheless took the mod down. He then felt he was being punished by pirates, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-vr-creator-says-hes-being-punished-by-pirates-after-mod-take-down">who were sharing around his work without contributing to his Patreon account to "punish" him</a>, according to Ross.</p>

<p>Vampire Crawlers fans can check out the game through a demo arriving for Steam and Xbox in February 2026. </p>



<p>A dungeon-crawling, roguelike deckbuilder spin-off of Vampire Survivors, Vampire Crawlers, was announced during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vampire-crawlers-revealed-at-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Partner Preview</a> event last year, with a Day One release set for Game Pass Premium and Ultimate. The title is scheduled to arrive in 2026, but could be delayed if the devs think it isn’t ready. However, whether it is ready or not, players can try out the game next month on Xbox and Steam through a new demo. </p>







<h2 id="h-vampire-crawlers-demo-announced-for-steam-and-xbox">Vampire Crawlers Demo Announced for Steam and Xbox</h2>



<p>As revealed through Episode 1 of “Let’s Explore Vampire Crawlers” on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ael4oMaKQM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, the demo for Vampire Crawlers will release on February 23 for Steam and Xbox. The video also talks more about the upcoming title, with the devs revealing the main focus this time is “fast turn-based combat”. The devs have recognised that one of the main complaints about some of the most popular turn-based games is that they can be slow and repetitive, and that’s what they want to change.</p>



<p>To circumvent this issue, many devs offer ways to speed up the gameplay by introducing “fast-forward” or “skip-animation” features. However, animations in the games are where all the fun lies, which is why in Vampire Crawlers, players don’t need to wait for the animation to complete to trigger the next abilities. What’s more, the game will not just attack enemies in the front, but will spread to all targets. </p>



<p>The new feature, called Turbo Turn, enables players to perform rapid attacks on enemies without requiring excessive resource management. This feature is particularly beneficial for beginners. However, there’s also something for veterans of the genre. As you play and progress, you can find relics and treasures that unlock new gameplay options involving the cards. Additionally, there’s a gem customization mechanic that allows players to enhance their cards with various effects.</p>

            <guid>1414396</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The creator of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-hits-paid-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-with-dmca-strike-after-creator-refused-request-to-make-it-free-for-everyone"><u>the Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod CD Projekt recently hit with a DMCA strike</u></a> has paused his Patreon page and pulled access to all his mods after receiving another strike from a different publisher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luke Ross, creator of the R.E.A.L. VR mods for games such as Elden Ring, Days Gone, and Far Cry, reportedly earns $20,000 a month through Patreon, which acts as a paywall for his work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He ditched work on his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod following CD Projekt’s DMCA strike, and has now said he received another strike from publisher 505 Games for his VR conversion of 2020 first-person cyberpunk action game Ghostrunner. IGN has asked 505 Games for comment. Ross declined to comment further when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross’ Patreon page now carries a warning, telling potential subscribers that “for the moment there will be no benefits available.” That means that even if you subscribe to his Patreon, you won’t get access to any of the more than 40 mods he has locked behind it. Ross said he’ll keep his Patreon locked down “until the legal situation clears out.” Existing subscriptions will have their access extended for one month without further payments, Ross said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross hit the headlines this month when Jan Rosner, VP, Business Development at CD Projekt Red, <a href="https://x.com/jan_rosner/status/2013219892405604457" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a> to say the company issued its DMCA strike because the Cyberpunk VR was a paid mod, which violates its fan content guidelines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We never allow monetization of our IP without our direct permission and/or an agreement in place,” Rosner said. “We were in touch with Luke last week and informed him that he needs to make it free for everyone (with optional donations) or remove it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are big fans of mods to our games — some of the work out there has been nothing short of amazing, including Luke’s mod for Cyberpunk 2077. We’d be happy to see it return as a free release. However, making a profit from our IP, in any form, always requires permission from CD Projekt Red.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross <a href="https://x.com/LukeRoss_00/status/2013321528679473503" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>responded to Rosner’s tweet</u></a> to take issue with his work being characterized as fan content. Rather, Ross insisted, it is independent software and thus does not infringe on CD Projekt’s IP rights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm sorry but I don't believe you are within your rights in demanding that my software needs to be free,” Ross said. “It is not ‘derivative work’ or ‘fan content’: it supports a large number of games which were built upon different engines, and it contains absolutely zero code or assets from your IP. Saying that it infringes your IP rights is equivalent to maintaining for example that RivaTuner violates game publishers' copyrights because it intercepts the images the game is drawing on screen and it processes them in order to overlay its statistics.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Ross told IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">people were now pirating his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod to “punish” him for breaking CD Projekt's terms of service</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Over 50 Ghostrunner Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qkavjg/luke_ross_removes_access_to_all_mods/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new post to subscribers</a>, Ross said Patreon automatically complied with 505 Games’ alleged DMCA takedown notice for his Ghostrunner mod.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't blame them,” he continued. “DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they ‘believe’ their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don't like — and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross said his Patreon is now under threat of termination because of repeated DMCA strikes, and must “avoid posting material that will subject your account to further claims of copyright infringement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In light of the above facts, I'm being forced to take immediate action,” Ross explained. “I'm making unavailable all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years, so that there will be no ground for further claims. And since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I'm making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time.”</p><span data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><div id="rank-cd-projekt-reds-games" data-cy="rank-cd-projekt-reds-games"><p><span><span><span><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank CD Projekt Red's Games</h3><h3>Rank CD Projekt Red's Games</h3></span></span><span></span></span></p></div></span><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN had asked Ross if he planned to make the Cyberpunk VR mod free, thus complying with CD Projekt’s terms of service. Responding, Ross said that while he wouldn’t rule out doing so, it would be a lot of work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do not rule out releasing the mod free for everyone,” he said. “But it would take time, because my software supports 40+ games and various completely different engines, which makes creating a version that specifically supports only Cyberpunk 2077 a non-trivial task. Also, the people who have voluntarily given their money to me in order to support my development efforts for the framework might not be happy about seeing the mod being given away all of a sudden to everyone just because I've been bullied into it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross told subscribers that “people on the web are thirsty for blood because back in the GTA 5 and RDR 2 era, an article came out stating that I was raising $20,000 a month.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Is that ‘reasonable’? Assuming that overall the work I poured into making my software support Cyberpunk, turning it into the ‘most immersive gaming experience’ some people had in their lives, amounted to a few months, say $50,000: is that ‘reasonable’ according to the arbitrary criteria of Cyberpunk's publisher? Something tells me it wouldn't be considered reasonable, despite being a tiny fraction of the many millions they would have to invest for porting CP2077 to VR themselves, and despite the fact that the cost was entirely financed by passionate gamers and none of it was incurred by CD Projekt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hopefully we'll find a way together, in the next few weeks. But if we can't, we'll always have the memories of the wonderful times we spent in those beautiful virtual worlds. Oh and by the way: if you have existing copies of the mods that you downloaded here before all this drama, you will of course be able to use them indefinitely and without restrictions, just like people have been doing for years with the RDR2 mod, as long as the games do not get breaking updates from the publishers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Nintendo </strong>has officially announced the first <strong>Nintendo Direct</strong> event for 2026, and it's kicking off the year by showcasing what could be its best-selling product: <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>. The sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-illumination-announce-a-new-super-mario-bros-film-due-in-april-2026/">the billion-dollar box-office hit</a> is due to hit theatres this coming <strong>April 3, 2026,</strong> and we're going to get another look at it this coming <strong>Sunday, January 25,</strong> when Nintendo debuts the second <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct</strong> at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT</strong>.</p>



<p>The announcement was first made through the <strong>Nintendo Today!</strong> app, before hitting all of Nintendo's official social media channels. As per usual, the news also came with an obligatory notice telling fans to "<em>Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation</em>." </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This will be our third look at the film, going back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">its initial teaser in <strong>September 2025</strong></a> and its first dedicated direct back in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-shows-new-trailer-brie-larson-benny-safdie/">November 2025</a></strong>. In the last direct, we got a look at two characters joining the film franchise: Rosalina, who will be played by <strong>Brie Larson</strong>, and Bowser Jr., who will be played by <strong>Benny Safdie</strong>.</p>



<p>For Sunday's direct, while nothing is necessarily guaranteed, we will almost certainly get a look a <strong>Yoshi</strong> and the actor behind the green dinosaur. In the run-up to the last direct, just two days before it officially premiered, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/"><strong>a collaboration with Pilsbury</strong> spoiled our first look at Yoshi's design for the film</a>, and spoiled the confirmation of Bowser Jr. as one of the new characters being introduced.</p>



<p>We've known that Yoshi was going to be involved in this sequel since the first movie came out, thanks to a cliffhanger tease at the end of the Super Mario Bros. Movie, so seeing the character as part of a promotional collaboration wasn't the biggest surprise, but we've yet to see him in motion in the film. Now that we're nearly a full month into 2026, and the film's April premiere date is fast approaching, it feels like this Sunday will be when we get to see the green dinosaur in action in the film for the first time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-appearance-morality-good-evil-horns-halo-2000662597</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>During yesterday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-2000662291"><span>Xbox Developer Direct</span></a><span>, we got the most expansive look at the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-open-world-release-date-fall-xbox-ps5-2000662295"><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>reboot</span></a><span> we’ve seen yet. Playground Games is picking up the series after original developer Lionhead Studios shut down in 2016, and it definitely feels like the studio is modernizing the action RPG series with an open world and a new morality system. With that new morality system, </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>is changing what was one of the core pillars of the series: your appearance will no longer be determined by whether or not you’re making good or evil decisions. In fact, it’s abandoning the idea that any of your actions are objectively good or evil altogether.</span></p> <p><span>For those that didn’t play any of Lionhead’s </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>games, like many games of the early 2000s they have a binary “hero or villain” morality system where doing things like helping people in need would move you toward the “good” side of the spectrum while doing things like skinning people alive in front of their weeping mother would move you toward the “evil” side. </span></p>

 <p><span>In the </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>games, the decisions you made would gradually alter your character’s look, with good characters appearing pristine and almost angelic, and evil players growing horns and turning into a monster. I tended to play evil characters in these games and wasn’t thrilled that my characters were turning into uggos, but that’s the contract you sign when you play these games. Playground Games’ </span><i><span>Fable</span></i><span>, however, is approaching morality differently, and so this mechanic is going out the window.</span></p> <p><span>As illustrated in the showcase, </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>is trying to handle morality in a more “subjective” way, which essentially means the game won’t treat your actions as simply “good” or “evil,” but rather that NPCs will react to the things you do based on their own proclivities. So you can kick people out of their homes as their landlord, and some rich idiot who lives for that shit might still think you’re a standup guy. Since things aren’t so black and white this time around, Playground’s Ralph Fulton tells </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> it’s abandoning the morality-based appearance-changing system of previous games because there is no “objective” morality system to attach them to.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>That sort of character morphing feature, obviously a really central part of the original games. It’s not in ours. And I’ll tell you why. There’s probably a couple of reasons. One, I guess it’s about that high level principle I was talking about, that there is no objective good and evil. And the original games were predicated on there being an objective good and an objective evil, and you were somewhere along that scale, and that’s what determined how your appearance changed.</span></p> <p><span>But for us, that doesn’t really work. The way I’ve described our morality system working, you’re never that thing, absolutely. You’re different things to different people based on what they like or what they choose to value. So, that’s one reason that it didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span>There’s another reason, which is in our game, you build reputation based on the settlement, the town, the city that you’re in, the part of the world that you’re in. But when you go to a new place, a place you’ve never been to before, you walk in without any reputation and thus nobody knows what to think about you. And you can almost, through your behavior, through your choices, form completely different reputations, a completely different identity, if you like, in that place from the place that you were last time. And you can do that across all the locations in the game.</span></p> <p><span>Now, you couldn’t do that if you walked in with horns and a trident. Your reputation would precede you in that instance. And honestly, that ability to be completely in control of your identity and thus what people think of you felt more important to us than that legacy feature. So, it worked great in those games. It didn’t seem to fit in ours, so we don’t have it.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>From a roleplaying perspective, I get why this decision was made, and I’ll be glad that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-cyberpunk-mass-effect-character-creator-1851422575"><span>my future bald, bearded gay</span></a><span> won’t have to look like a demon while I’m trying to woo the men of Albion. But it is leaving behind what was a core pillar of the </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>series back in the day, and long-time fans who have been waiting over a decade for a new </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>are reacting accordingly.</span></p>

   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">they've confirmed in an IGN interview that your actions will not transform your appearance. 😠 That's a core part of why I love Fable and I'll miss that.</p> <p>Everything else looks fantastic, though. Smart evolutions, faithful vibe, incredible environments. I'm happy to be excited. <a href="https://t.co/aqiDTHLR2o">https://t.co/aqiDTHLR2o</a></p> <p>— Jake Baldino (@JakeBaldino) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeBaldino/status/2014445728001630593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">wait what?? that's like Fable's whole deal! <a href="https://t.co/E9mzl8OvZO">https://t.co/E9mzl8OvZO</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/2014470703605584029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“NPC’s and how your character looked reflecting your actions was pretty important for me,” Disastrous_Fig5609 wrote on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fable/comments/1qk9zj3/rip_to_the_main_feature_that_set_fable_games_apart/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span>. “You watch the character grow up from childhood, then you watch them grow into a hero or a villain. You might not be able to plant an acorn and watch it grow into a tree as you play the game, but that element of shaping the world around you with your actions still somewhat persisted with shaping your character with your actions.”</span></p> <p><span>“The location based reputation is cool, but it absolutely could have just been a dual system,”&nbsp; ForestBrah01209 wrote in the same thread. “One town will see you one way, another town will see you a different way. However, if I’m absolutely evil and move to another town, I’m still absolutely evil, even if my new neighbors think I’m just another stranger or even a nice guy. Shame that I won’t be able to rock the devil horns anymore.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>is the first game in the series to have a character creator, so at least it’s not like everyone’s characters are going to look the same. We’ll see if there are enough character customization options to let players at least manually emulate some of those old </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>transformations when the game launches in the fall. </span></p>

              <p>The Roku Smart Home Wired Video Doorbell &amp; Chime features an ultrawide-angle lens with a 180° horizontal field of view, letting you capture what’s happening at your front door. Night vision keeps you seeing a high-quality image regardless of the time of day. Motion and sound detection automatically send notifications to your mobile device, tablet, and compatible Roku devices when someone approaches your door. In addition to receiving notifications, you can communicate with visitors using two-way audio from your mobile device or tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6850/">You can now purchase the Roku Smart Home Wired Video Doorbell &amp; Chime for $50, down from its regular price of $70, saving you $20 or 28% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6850/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A reliable security method to see everyone who darkens your doorstep</h2>
<p>This hardwired Roku Smart Home Wired Video Doorbell &amp; Chime uses your existing wiring for continuous power, eliminating the need to replace batteries. After installation, you can check the live feed of your front door and review past events on your mobile device or tablet using the Roku Smart Home app. You can also receive notifications on your compatible Roku TV or streaming player, so you know who is approaching your front door, whether your phone is nearby or across the house.</p>
<p>Videos captured by the camera are recorded in 1080p HD. The lens covers a wide area of your front porch with an ultrawide-angle 180° horizontal view, so you don’t need to adjust the camera angle to see both items on the mat and a visitor’s face when they are standing near the door. Night vision lets you capture clear images at night, showing details such as clothing and purses rather than obscuring them in shadows.</p>



<p>Beyond basic motion and sound detection, the built-in smart features notify you as soon as motion or sound is detected at your door. This means you’ll know right away when someone approaches, and if they press the doorbell, you’ll be notified immediately of who pressed it.</p>
<p>The included plug-in chime alerts you when the doorbell is rung, or motion is detected, regardless of your phone’s status. You can choose from 20 available sounds to play when the doorbell is activated and place the chime anywhere in your home to maximize volume. The chime carries an IP65 rating for durability and includes both corner and flat mounting plates to improve stability in inclement weather.</p>
<p>The Roku Smart Home Wired Video Doorbell &amp; Chime includes everything you need for a successful installation, such as a complete hardware kit, guided setup through the Roku Smart Home app, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6850/">and is on sale now for $50, down from the typical $70 retail price.</a></p>

<p>All Gearheads and Petrolheads are eyeing up Forza Horizon 6’s car list like a hawk. For many, the gameplay and content are irrelevant unless you have a carefully curated roster of amazing automobiles, which is where this guide comes to your aid.</p>



<p>Driving around in a pretty car is a perk of the Forza trade. Pulling off an insane drift sequence is cool, and breaking event records is nice for a short time, but everyone wants to know what stick you’re driving!</p>



<p>Luckily, Playground Games is delivering on the car list front in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-forza-horizon-6-gameplay-footage-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>, and it’s going to be one of the best line-ups ever.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-cars-in-forza-horizon-6">How Many Cars In Forza Horizon 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No matter how big or small, they all count. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 will have over 550 cars at launch, with developer Playground Games sure to add many more to the range as post-launch content.</strong></p>



<p>So far, 93 cars have been revealed for Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<p>In comparison, Forza Horizon 5 capped at 902 cars when the game’s content line was finished. Many cars were added as DLC and seasonal updates throughout the game’s lifespan. FH6 is sure to be the same, and you should expect Forza Horizon to easily get near the 900 mark again, if not 1,000.</p>

<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6’s car range includes Alfa Romeos, BMWs, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Nissans, and virtually every other major car manufacturer you’ve ever heard of.</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-6-cover-car-explained">Forza Horizon 6 Cover Car, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The Toyota GR GT is a new 2027 car that is debuting early in Forza Horizon 6, even gracing the game’s front cover art.</strong></p>



<p>It’a beauty. The GR GT is described as Toyota’s “Most advanced vehicle,” and it’s more than likely a huge honor for Playground Games and FH6 to get first dibs on the supercar.</p>



<p>Check out the car in action during FH6 gameplay.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s a more general question than usual, but what’s your favorite car? Is it a vintage car from the 1960’s? Or are you a sucker for a premium, modern, top-of-the-line supercar? The place to leave your top pick is the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270763/anbernic-rg-p01-wireless-controller-switch-pc-android-ios-steam">company’s first gamepad</a>, the RG P01, offered features like <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg-p01?variant=45681067426049">Hall effect triggers and joysticks</a> for just $18. Pricing for the new Anbernic RG G01 hasn’t been revealed, but it may be more expensive due to several upgrades, including a curved color display on the front and a heart rate sensor.</p></div><p>The RG G01 won’t be the first controller with a built-in screen. Companies like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Wireless-Controller-Officially-Licensed-PC/dp/B0DJTJDN73/ref=sr_1_11??tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Turtle Beach already offer them</a>. While a display adds to the cost, it lets gamers adjust settings, program macros that automatically trigger a series of button presses, and remap controls, without having to leave a game and connect to a mobile or desktop app. The RG G01 has four customizable buttons on the back that can be reconfigured using the display.</p><p>As for the heart rate sensor that appears to be integrated into the RG G01’s grips? Its functionality is questionable. Nintendo announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/5/4496818/nintendo-president-iwata-wii-vitality-sensor-shelved">heart rate-tracking accessory for the Wii at E3 2009</a> called the Vitality Sensor that could have potentially incorporated a player’s pulse into games, but it was cancelled. Anbernic’s RG G01 will display your heart rate on the controller’s screen and it has a pulse alarm, but there’s no details on what exactly it will warn you about.</p><p>The RG G01 will include both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, and the option to tether to a device with a USB-C cable. It’s fully compatible with systems running Steam, Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, and Nintendo’s various Switch consoles. There’s a six-axis gyroscope for playing games with motion controls, “electro-inductive capacitive joysticks,” and dual-mode triggers with switches that limit their travel for faster response times – a feature that was noticeably missing from the Anbernic RG P01.</p><p>Anbernic only says the controller is “Coming Soon!”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/866600/anbernic-rg-g01-smart-wireless-gaming-controller-heart-rate-sensor-display]]></content:encoded>

            <p>After having the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> bit of their R.E.A.L VR mod/framework <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-flatlines-after-cd-projekt-file-dmca-strike-and-request-its-creator-drop-their-paywall">taken down via a DMCA from CD Projekt</a>, modder Luke Ross claims to have had another stike filed against their work. This time, the strike has come from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> publishers 505 Games, according to a post from Ross in which they say they've been "forced to temporarily pause" their Patreon page.</p>
<p>While Ross' Cyberpunk VR mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-modder-doesnt-rule-out-releasing-it-for-free-after-dmca-claims-there-was-no-negotiation-with-cd-projekt">being behind a paywall</a> was at the centre of CD Projekt's decision to file a takedown, there appears to have been no indication so far as to whether the same is true of the alleged strike from 505.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.patreon.com/realvr/about?">'About' section of the modder's Patreon page</a> now hosts the following message:</p>
<blockquote>Beware! Due to DMCA notices received from CD PROJEKT S.A. (see https://www.patreon.com/posts/148437771) and 505 Games, I am forced to temporarily pause the Patreon page. You can still subscribe if you want to support me, but be advised that for the moment there will be no benefits available. No access to the 40+ mods or detailed information about my VR conversions, until the legal situation clears out. Existing subscriptions will have their access extended for one month without further payments.</blockquote>
<p>An <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qkavjg/luke_ross_removes_access_to_all_mods/">alleged email</a> from Ross to their subscibers expanding on the situation has been posted to r/virtualreality, as spotted by <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-vr-modder-luke-ross-patreon-suspended-following-new-dmca-from-ghostruner-devs/">FRVR</a>.</p>
<p>"Fast forward to today, and another publisher just sent a DMCA takedown notice to Patreon: namely 505 Games, for my VR conversion of Ghostrunner," the email reads, following a recap of the Cyberpunk situation. "No mention of any terms of service violation this time. Again Patreon automatically complied. I don't blame them; DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they "believe" their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don't like—and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process."</p>
<p>I've reached out to 505 Games for comment.</p>
<p>As a result of this alleged second strike, Ross wrote in the email that they've opted to make "all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years" unavailable, citing the need to avoid incurring any more DMCA strikes in the near future.</p><p>Since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I'm making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time," the modder added. "You don't need to unsubscribe: I paused the billing cycle for one month so that your pledges will NOT be renewed automatically, and those of you who are already subscribed will have their access extended for one month without further payments. I hope one month will be enough for the fog to clear up, and to understand what is going to happen to our collective attempt to make VR available for AAA games."</p>
<p>Ross was previously the subject of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-v-and-rdr2-vr-modder-receives-dmca-takedown-from-take-two-interactive">DMCA strike from Rockstar Games</a> over VR mods for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> back in 2022. For now, it seems the modder's plan is to lock things down and see if this storm can be waited out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-on-anc-headphone-clearance-new-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-crash-to-an-all-time-low-2000662534</link>
            <guid>1414327</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds feature an Active Noise Control system and an immersive audio system, and they fit well for extended periods. They also include soft ear tips that seal against the ear to eliminate ambient noise, but do not feel too tight. These earbuds feature Bluetooth compatibility for phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices. Additionally, the earbuds have a white smoke finish, have touch controls, and a compact charging case that is small enough to carry in a pocket. They were made to be portable while keeping the audio front and center.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/">You can find the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for $249 at Amazon.</a> This is a $50 discount from their normal price of $299. So this represents a 17% discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Earbuds with the style, comfort, and quality of Bose headphones</h2>
<p>The noise-cancellation on the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds works to cancel out engine noise, conversations, and other background noise. If you would rather hear some outside noise, then the Aware Mode provides an alternative. It allows you to hear what is happening outside and smooths out sudden spikes in decibel levels caused by loud noises, such as clanging dishes and slamming doors. In addition to providing awareness of your surroundings, if you prefer more isolation, Quiet Mode reduces ambient noise so you can enjoy your playlists, calls, podcasts, etc., at a lower volume.</p>
<p>CustomTune technology in the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds determines how sound behaves in your ears and adjusts noise cancellation and equalization accordingly. The earbuds produce a test tone when you insert them and measure the response. Then it sets the bass, midrange, and treble to match your ear shape. Bose Immersive Audio provides a spatial effect that creates the illusion that music and video are coming from in front of you rather than inside your head.</p>



<p>The fit and comfort of the earbuds are due to the combination of the soft silicone eartips and the flexible stability bands. There are multiple sizes of each component, and they can be combined in 9 ways. The umbrella-shaped tips provide additional blockage of ambient noise. Plus, they are rated IPX4, so they are suitable for use during sweating or light rain.</p>
<p>The call quality of the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds depends on the noise-rejecting microphones and processing specifically tailored to ensure your voice is heard clearly. The microphones are focused on capturing your voice while rejecting wind and background noise; therefore, the caller hears you, not the surrounding noise.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, battery life and charging capabilities are configured to provide you with enough time to listen to whatever content you desire. Battery life is approximately 6 hours in Quiet, Aware, or Immersive Modes, and about 4 hours in Immersive Mode. The case supports 3 charging cycles and can be charged via a USB-C port or a wireless charging pad. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/">These are great headphones, and you’ll want to take advantage of the $249 sale price instead of the regular list price of $299 now.</a></p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass members will have to pay almost the price of a standard edition for Forza Horizon 6’s 4-day early access. </p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct finally gave fans what they were asking for: a release date and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-forza-horizon-6-gameplay-footage-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay deep dive</a> for the highly anticipated racing title, Forza Horizon 6. Along with that, we also received details on the pricing and editions for the upcoming title, and it seems Game Pass players will have to put forth some extra cash for early access, more than the usual price. </p>



<h2 id="h-game-pass-members-have-to-pay-almost-the-price-of-a-standard-edition-to-get-forza-horizon-6-early-access">Game Pass Members Have to Pay Almost the Price of a Standard Edition to Get Forza Horizon 6 Early Access</h2>



<p>So, Forza Horizon 6 is available for free for Game Pass Ultimate and PC members; however, that only includes the Standard Edition. To get the 4-day early access, players will need to grab the Premium Edition, priced at $119.99/£109.99 GBP/€119.99 EUR. Game Pass members can get their hands on the Premium Edition by purchasing an <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/forza-horizon-6#purchaseoptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">upgrade</a> worth $59.99, and that’s where the problem lies. </p>



<p>Players on social media have been calling out the increase in the price of the Forza Horizon 6 Premium Edition upgrade for Game Pass members. For the previous title, FH5, players would only need to pay $50; however, that has now been increased to $60, which is almost the price of a standard edition, $69.99. In the UK, the price for this upgrade is £59.99, the same as the standard edition costs in the region. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those wondering about the Forza Horizon 6 deluxe edition, that has been priced at $99.99/£89.99 GBP/€99.99 EUR. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[What Time Does Highguard Release? Highguard Times & Release Date, Explained]]></title>

<p>Highguard is looking to claim the FPS crown in 2026 and is trying to do so under a cloak of absolute secrecy. Details about Highguard are few and far between, but release time info is available, and the release date is locked in.</p>



<p>So far, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> looks like a mix of first-person shooters rolled into one. It has Hero Shooter elements, you can ride huge beasts, there’s a free-flowing speed and nimbleness to traversal: It seems to do it all. People have been wondering when Highguard is coming out and what time you can start playing it, so let’s try to clear some of this up.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-time-does-highguard-release">What Time Does Highguard Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fire away. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to Steam, it will be a universal 6 PM UTC launch for Highguard.</strong></p>



<p>This could easily be subject to change, so take the information with a trusty pinch of salt. If you look at the SteamDB page for Highguard (It might have changed by the time you read this), it clearly says: “<strong>18:00:00 UTC.</strong>“</p>



<p>Given how little we know about Highguard and the lack of promotion, some people are doubting it’ll even release when it claims—let alone hit a specific launch time outed by Steam. Does Steam even know?</p>



<p>Keep checking back, as this information has huge potential to turn around. Or, we can all see what the fuss is all about come 6 PM UTC on release day.</p>



<h2 id="h-highguard-release-date-confirmed">Highguard Release Date, Confirmed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stop the presses. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Wildgate’s Highguard is slated for a January 26 release date.</strong></p>



<p>Whether it does or doesn’t happen is anyone’s guess. It’s one of the most bizarre games and releases in recent memory. Everyone may end up looking back on the confusion as a stroke of brilliance, or wondering how Highguard was ever going to work.</p>



<p>It could be telling that the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-trophy-list-has-revealed-more-details-than-the-devs-have/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard Trophy List revealed more details than the devs did</a>. Check your PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam stores on January 26 at 6 PM UTC to see if the Highguard prophecy actually came true.</p>



<p>There’s been an extraordinary amount of criticism and backlash for a game everyone pretty much knows nothing about.
