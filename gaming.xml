<p dir="ltr">Nobody is quite sure what the reason for the bug is. Some players report it happening while in a full party, while others said it happened to them playing solo. A few players theorize that the bug could be coming as a result of player's dealing too much damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Even before her Season 8 rework, Lilith has always been a hard fight (despite her <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hardest-boss-in-diablo-4-has-already-been-defeated/1100-6515043/" data-ref-id="1100-6515043">being defeated for the first time</a> less than a week after Diablo 4 came out). Her various phases made her a significant challenge unless players could deal enough damage to largely ignore the fight's oppressive mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, in Season 8, players are now forced to deal with those mechanics even more than before. Even if a player can deal an incredible amount of damage, it's impossible to "brute force" through the phases, as attacks that would previously transition her into the next phase will instead only drop her health to a specific percentage. This makes for extended periods of time during where Lilith is entirely immune to damage, forcing players to dodge her various projectiles and spike waves which inflict a stacking debuff that will eventually one-shot players for a mistake.</p><p dir="ltr">A bug making Lilith unkillable wouldn't be the biggest deal if Blizzard hadn't tied an important reward, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-how-to-get-resplendent-sparks-for-uber-unique-crafting/1100-6523718/" data-ref-id="1100-6523718">Resplendent Spark</a> used to create Mythic Uniques, to the first time players kill her each season. Despite the annoying nature of the boss fight, players almost always want to defeat her at least once to claim the Spark before ignoring the boss for the rest of the season. That, however, isn't exactly possible when she can't be killed.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard hasn't issued a response to the thread on Reddit or offered an ETA on when players can expect a fix. Broken boss fights aren't the only issue Diablo 4 players are contending with, as the game's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-new-reliquary-battle-pass-system-is-even-worse-than-players-originally-thought/1100-6532514/" data-ref-id="1100-6532514">Reliquary battle pass has also drawn criticism for its poor design</a>. Blizzard has stated its looking to make changes to Diablo 4's Reliquary system in the future, partially out of response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-berserk-crossover-is-a-huge-wasted-opportunity/1100-6531373/" data-ref-id="1100-6531373">Diablo 4's disappointing Berserk crossover</a>, but that those changes won't be arriving as part of its upcoming Season 9. Diablo 4 Season 9, Sins of the Horadrim, is set to arrive on July 1 and will let <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">players craft their own spells</a>.</p>

			<p>Mafia: The Old Country has gone gold ahead of its August 8, 2025, release date, developer Hangar 13 has announced.</p>
<p>The studio posted a short video clip on the <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1936076608135172440">official Mafia X account</a> announcing the news, as the team now shifts to focusing on polish and making sure Mafia: The Old Country is ready for prime-time when it releases in August.</p>
<p>The Old Country is a prequel and a return for the series after the last brand-new Mafia game came out in 2016. Since then, we've had a remake of the first game and remasters for the second and third games, but nothing brand new until now.</p>
<p>Hangar 13 has claimed that this will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-says-mafia-the-old-country-will-be-the-best-looking-mafia-game-thanks-to-unreal-engine-5/">"<em>the best looking Mafia game</em>"</a> in the series, and, through the studio's work with Italian developer Stormind Games, has put in the effort to make everything about players' journey in Italy <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-in-mafia-the-old-country-feels-authentic-says-co-developer/">an "<em>authentic</em>" experience</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Our priority has always been to ensure that everything in the game feels authentic</em>," said senior project manager at Stormind Games, Salvo Fallica. "<em>The details are absolutely key in keeping the immersion of the player</em>," added Hangar 13's lead writer Matthew Aitken.</p>
<p>We've seen plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-digs-into-mafia-the-old-country-gameplay-narrative-and-more-at-pax-east/">gameplay footage</a> and heard a lot from Hangar 13 about how much work they've put in to this release. We'll see in August if this is a strong return for the series or not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> fans believe they've now worked out the truth behind recent teases that suggested something was going on with Rockstar's beloved cowboy franchise — but it's not what many fans had been hoping for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, John Marston actor Rob Wiethoff teased that he had "exciting news" to share that was "absolutely killing" him to keep quiet, while chatting with fans during a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lbextu/i_wonder_what_this_could_mean" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestream</a>. Wiethoff suggested that, whatever the news was, fans would hear about it by the end of this week — and that he wouldn't be the only one sharing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mystery deepened when Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan actor Roger Clark subsequently confirmed that he was also aware of the news, but couldn't yet say more. Immediately, fans began to speculate that the pair were involved in some kind of announcement regarding the future of the franchise, such as the reveal of an upgraded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> — something that has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-reportedly-set-for-nintendo-switch-2-by-end-of-2025-and-theres-a-rumored-next-gen-upgrade-patch-too">previously been reported as in development for Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With fan hopes at fever pitch, Wiethoff released a statement earlier this week clearly designed to manage expectations. In it, John Marston's voice actor said he "possibly misled some people" in regards to how exciting the announcement was, and said he did "not make announcements for Rockstar games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I do have something I'm really excited about, I truly am, and I think you will be too," Wiethoff said. "I really do think so, but I possibly misled some people when I announced that I have something to announce that I can't talk about right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just please recognize – and I know that you know this, but let me remind you, I guess – I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. We all know that, I'm just reminding you I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games makes announcements for Rockstar Games, and they don't use me to do that."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/cyberboiuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@cyberboiuk</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Mctannen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Mctannen</a> <br>Rob Wiethoff has clarified that his announcement has nothing to do with rockstar. <a href="https://t.co/WmlWJD1GSQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WmlWJD1GSQ</a></p>— jon🚬 (@jonbranham_) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonbranham_/status/1935043619754250697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So what is the big mystery announcement? Well, fans have now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lg4jz3/was_this_the_announcement_rob_was_so_excited_for/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted</a> confirmation of a Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2 cast reunion, which is set to take place at the National Gaming Expo in Tampa, Florida from August 8 to August 10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Was this the announcement [Wiethoff] was so excited for?" wrote one fan on reddit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think so," added replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It would be great if they waited for this convention to reveal there's going to be SOME kind of update, remastering, DLC, a next chapter etc," said a third. "It's definitely wishful thinking on my part."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2 originally launched for PS4 and Xbox One back in October 2018, and arrived on PC a year later. Fans have long hoped for a revamped version designed to take advantage of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, but, more than five years after those consoles launched, a re-release or remaster is yet to arrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Rockstar has been busy during this time building Grand Theft Auto 6, which after its recent delay will now launch on May 26, 2026. Surely there's time to pop out a Red Dead Redemption 2 patch before then?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>In the 12 years since the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, two of the three main characters, Franklin Clinton and Trevor Philips, have reappeared in Grand Theft Auto Online, while Michael De Santa has only been mentioned. But if the actors behind these iconic characters get their way, they'd reunite GTA 5's trio for one last heist. </p><p>Earlier this month, Steven Ogg (Trevor), Ned Luke (Michael), and Shawn Fonteno (Franklin) made a joint appearance together at Comic Con Brussels (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-5s-michael-trevor-franklin-want-gta-6-return-in-final-score-story-dlc-3216565/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>). At the 12:40 mark in the video below, the actors spoke about their desire to reunite in a DLC for GTA Online called The Final Score, which was named by Luke. The trio stressed that Rockstar doesn't currently have any plans to bring them back together, and urged fans to campaign for it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkGCcdAhJUM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KkGCcdAhJUM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Rockstar has yet to shed light on whether GTA Online will continue following the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 next year. Take-Two executives have suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-suggests-that-current-gta-online-could-continue-after-gta-6-releases/1100-6529517/" data-ref-id="1100-6529517">that GTA Online may be unaffected</a>, but they've stopped short of confirming that. If the actors manage to convince Rockstar to bring them back one more time, it seems more likely to be for GTA 6 than GTA 5. </p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-latest-major-update-is-live-with-a-money-laundering-theme/1100-6532494/" data-ref-id="1100-6532494">GTA Online rolled out another large update</a> that lets players assume control of their own money laundering operation. One of the developers of GTA 3 recently disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-dev-wanted-online-mode-as-far-back-as-2001/1100-6532533/" data-ref-id="1100-6532533">the team wanted an online GTA game</a> as far back as 2001.

                <p>Since its release on Thursday, Rematch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-a-soccer-game-from-the-developers-of-sifu-is-off-to-a-hot-start/1100-6532582/" data-ref-id="1100-6532582">has pulled in some solid numbers</a> and is picking up steam. With its relatively simple gameplay, Rematch is an enjoyable game to watch and play. play. Of course, with a growing player-base comes questions about what's next for the game, and the developers found time to address them. </p><p>Over on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/534353549843235107" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, the team behind Rematch went through a laundry list of updates, how they're working to prevent lag that affects gameplay, and addressed the potential of crossplay down the line. However, they also assured players they're taking one thing at a time.</p><p>"We want to extend a huge thank you to everyone who joined us during the Early Access launch and shared valuable feedback," the statement read. "Seeing players from all over the world enjoying Rematch and expressing their excitement online has been incredibly rewarding."</p><p>The team had initially wanted to implement a crossplay feature, but "unforeseen technical complexities" prevented it from being ready on time. They added that they understand players' frustration and are going to get it working soon.</p><p>"It's very important for us that our players are able to enjoy Rematch with their friends, so along with bugfixes, crossplay is our absolute highest priority. We're committed to delivering this feature swiftly, and we'll share a more precise deadline as soon as possible."</p><p>Here are also issues they're looking into for the game:</p><ul><li><strong>Core gameplay:</strong> Simple fixes like improving the sliding tackle, tweaks to goalkeeper mechanics, to the dribbling system and wall contact. All the while taking into account community feedback. The idea would be that as they move forward, test servers will be at work so they can try out new features and improvements in a live environment.</li><li><strong>Competitive features:</strong> They are currently designing a tournament system with a leaderboard system for players above Elite ranking. There's also a club creation system in the works that will be aiming to provide more variety for competitive players.</li><li><strong>Social components:</strong> While crossplay is their top priority, other features are also being worked on such as being able to spectate your squad’s game when you join a squad. This will allow players to team up and rematch with teammates they enjoyed playing with, and more.</li><li><strong>Casual play features:</strong> Aside from a new quick play game mode and a rotating game mode queue, AI-controlled bots will be used so that players are able to train with and against the computer in both workshops or in dedicated game modes.</li></ul><p>"Please remember that we are not a huge team, and that these features take time, so don't expect all this by the end of the year! We will communicate on a more precise roadmap for upcoming seasons as soon as we have better visibility on when we can deliver on these intentions."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a> is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It is part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate game catalog, but can also be purchased for $30.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s major 11.2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh update</a> will add a highly-requested feature fans have been waiting years for–the ability to lean.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, as spotted by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-lean-emote-on-patch-11-2-ptr-377340" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, the /lean emote is finally being added to Blizzard's MMORPG. It's the first major emote addition since 2008, when a large list of emotes were added as part of the game's Wrath of the Lich King expansion.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CE8zcDHcMA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CE8zcDHcMA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Lean is something players, and particularly roleplayers, have wanted for quite some time, as the ability for NPC characters to lean against terrain was added during 2018's Battle for Azeroth expansion. In 11.2, characters can use the lean emote to prop up against a wall and give off that oh-so-important mysterious adventurer vibe or practice being a mime and just lean in mid-air against nothing at all.</p><p dir="ltr">When compared to all the major new content coming with the Ghosts of K'aresh update, including a new upgradeable artifact cloak, the Ecological Succession world activity, and an encounter against a Stormwind city-sized raid boss (the biggest boss in WoW's history, according to Blizzard), the addition of a new emote doesn't sound like a big deal. It is, however, a major win for the game's roleplayers, a community within WoW that Blizzard has stated (like in this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-at-20-is-the-same-and-increasingly-unrecognizable-and-thats-by-design/1100-6527983/" data-ref-id="1100-6527983">interview about WoW's 20th anniversary</a>) it is looking to do more for. Maybe players will get fully-animated hugs or high-fives next?</p><p dir="ltr">While it's the first time in a long time Blizzard has added an emote, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-patch-9-1-5-will-remove-or-change-a-long-list-of-crude-emotes/1100-6496685/" data-ref-id="1100-6496685">changed or removed some emotes entirely in 2021</a> in the wake of a state of California lawsuit that was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-will-pay-54-million-to-california-after-settling-lawsuit/1100-6520018/" data-ref-id="1100-6520018">later settled</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard, however, took various steps in its games while the lawsuit was still ongoing to make its communities more welcoming, including in WoW. Emotes like /kick, /moan, /rear, /smell and others were removed entirely, while some, like /drool and /whistle, were made so they could no longer target specific players.</p><p dir="ltr">The new lean emote is just one of Ghosts of K'aresh's new social features, as the update will also add <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">Dark Souls'-like asynchronous multiplayer functions</a> to WoW's endgame Delves. WoW's 11.2 update does not yet have a release date and isn't yet available for testing on the game's public test realm, but players are already theorizing based on datamining that a new Void-themed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-are-convinced-a-new-way-to-play-demon-hunter-is-coming-soon/1100-6532569/" data-ref-id="1100-6532569">Demon Hunter specialization</a> could be coming soon.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I'm here to tell you that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>'s free-roam mode is great when there isn't someone yapping in your ear about how "bad" and "empty" it is.</p><p dir="ltr">Since its release a few weeks ago alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the latest installment in the vaunted kart-racing series has had a few more ups and downs than expected. For all the praise the game has accrued--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/">it received a 9 from GameSpot's Steve Watts</a>--Mario Kart World has also gotten its fair share of knocks and detractors, and a great deal of the criticism that's been aimed at it recently has centered on its free-roam mode. Those criticisms claim that the mode (and the world it makes available to players) is largely barren and what activities do fill it are lackluster.</p><p dir="ltr">For the uninitiated, Mario Kart World's free-roam mode drops players onto the large interconnected roadways of the newest game. If a player wanted to, they could drive from Acorn Heights, the northernmost track in the game, all the way down to Dino Dino Jungle at the southern tip of the continent. All the while, they can zoom past Toads in cars, buses, and trucks on the highways that connect these courses to one another. Along the way, there are even P-Switches that toggle challenges and races, warp pipes that transport players to hidden rooms, collectable Peach medallions in out-of-the-way spots, and stickers to collect to garnish your player profile. It's simple, uncomplicated, and nice. The mode is exactly what it's been billed as, and I cannot really understand the heat it's getting.</p><p dir="ltr">While I've been basking in all free-roam has to offer, I'll be the first to admit that there isn't much else going on here. Challenges can often be pretty mindless, and while some can exasperate, most are over in a flash. The rewards for finding Peach medallions and question block panels are trivial and insignificant in the grand scheme of the game. Roaming around freely can feel like the gaming equivalent of consuming empty calories, and I recognize how this chafes against the expectations of players being dropped into a huge in-game world in 2025. But I think the fact that Mario Kart World's free-roam does away with the excess and frills is precisely the point of the mode, and it does my head in that there is an audience out there that isn't connecting with it because they want something else. This isn't the next Forza Horizon game, whose map will be dotted with countless side activities and missions for the player to do. It's Mario Kart World, and it's doing things its own way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518313-img_1392.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518313" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518313-img_1392.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518313"></a><figcaption>Mario Kart World's free-roam mode features Rosalina's tour bus company and more.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518313-img_1392.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I think there's a clear distinction between the notion of a video game with a "free-roam" mode, which is what's on offer in Mario Kart World, and an "open-world" game, a phrase that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-is-not-an-open-world-game-nintendo-says/1100-6532034/">Nintendo has explicitly stated it avoided</a> invoking throughout the game's development. The latter is a game like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Cyberpunk 2077, which are entirely different experiences you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6618/">also get on the Switch 2</a>. Hell, if we want to pit Mario Kart World against a proper open-world racing game, look no further than Forza Horizon 5. There are hundreds of other examples that you could find to fit that mold across gaming's history, but that won't change the core argument here: Mario Kart World is not an open-world game, and we're better off leaving it that way than arguing for it to become something it was never meant to be.</p><p dir="ltr">I say this because I've relished the quiet nights that I've squeezed out of Mario Kart World's free-roam mode. I've never taken a proper road trip, but I imagine the ability to make that space for peace and quiet is what it's all about. I've been conjuring those very vibes on the regular by aimlessly hitting the open road in World, going wherever it may take me, and taking pictures of the charming little world Nintendo has spun from this historic franchise. This is a place where I can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/">play as a cow</a>, pick up a burger from a fast-food restaurant operated by Yoshi, and park next to a Shy Guy seated on a bench. It's a world with hitchhiking Toads, random campsites, and a tour bus company apparently run by Rosalina. Some guy on the internet <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/04/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2/" rel="nofollow ">claims there are UFOs</a> to be found in free-roam, and others are taking over semi-trucks and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tahk0_/video/7516248904929725727?q=mario%20kart%20world%20area%2051&amp;t=1750311855590" rel="nofollow ">storming the gates of an in-game Area 51</a>. Sometimes, enjoying games means taking it on its own terms and appreciating the tiniest of moments and details, or just making your own fun, rather than expecting it to deliver some huge creative swings.</p><p dir="ltr">To that end, free-roam also allows me to sidestep the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-mario-kart-world-tips-could-help-you-win-more-races/1100-6532281/">frankly ridiculously competitive nature</a> of Mario Kart World--which is more intense than it has ever been, thanks to a slew of new advanced maneuvers--and explore the sights of magnificent locales like I've never been able to before. Go to the Great ? Block Ruins in free-roam and really take in the view of the dilapidated skyscraper-sized block. Try to make sense of it, and if you can't, just bask in it. I know I sure did.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518315-img_1393.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518315" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518315-img_1393.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518315"></a><figcaption>Sometimes, free-roam mode is perfect for a chill, late night drive.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518315-img_1393.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm sure I'll be called a mark or some kind of Nintendo apologist, but the simple truth is this: Mario Kart World fully delivers on a vibes-based free-roam mode, and I prefer that to any of the half-dozen overstuffed open-world titles available at any given moment. And hey, I love some of those games quite a lot, but a break from them is just as welcome as having more of them to play. Games that big can feel grand and adventurous to start before devolving into laborious trudges and when everything is an open-world RPG, it begins to feel like nothing is special. It's rare then to get a marquee title from a major developer and publisher like Nintendo that does away with the excess and cuts right to the chase, making Mario Kart World a breath of fresh air. Y'know, through the scent of exhaust fumes and Yoshi burgers.</p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, what else might you possibly want or need from an open-world Mario Kart game that you can't already get in the larger package of World? If you want to race, hit a grand prix or Knockout match. Want some challenges? Well, free-roam's already got those in spades, but there's an additional set of Time Trials that have long been a staple in the series. Want some competition? Go online and do some good ol' fashioned versus battles. If you want collectibles, the game's already got 'em!</p><p dir="ltr">When you really think about it, what's an actionable feature that could tangibly make Mario Kart's free-roam a richer experience? Side quests? Possible interactions with roaming NPCs? One-on-one races with rivals? I can see some of that working in this game, but by and large, I don't think any of it is the silver-bullet fix that'll enrich Mario Kart World for the players disgruntled by its implementation of free-roam. I think what they might be looking for is simply a different kind of game.</p><p>So yes, Mario Kart World's free-roam mode is not the most robust offering. If you come to it expecting the next great open-world title, you're likely to be sorely disappointed. What you get instead is so much better though, so much more <em>freeing</em>, and in a field awash with overstuffed and overstimulating titles around every corner, I'm grateful that Mario Kart World eschews those trends and stays in its own lane where it (and I) remain unbothered.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve seen enough: In the race between <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/26/cuomo-sexual-harassment-doj-00138140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a sexual harasser</a> who <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/cuomo-deranged-parking-job-speeding-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parks bad</a> (and is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/05/landlord-lobby-will-boost-cuomo-with-2-5m-spend-00389886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in bed with the landlord lobby</a>), a guy who smiles maybe a little too much but wants to <a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/05/mamdani-affordable-new-york-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make NYC cheaper</a>, and some other people, we – a video game website mysteriously and perhaps ominously followed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Bluesky – are officially endorsing Zohran Mamdani for mayor.</p><p>You might find this to be unusual; after all, has any other video game publication ever endorsed a political candidate? But I assure you, it makes a certain kind of sense considering that a) four of Aftermath’s five founders are based in New York City, and b) the office of current <a href="https://defector.com/the-most-unbelievable-bits-from-nyc-mayor-eric-adamss-indictment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgraced clown mayor Eric Adams</a> has actually made an effort where video games are concerned, alongside <a href="https://esd.ny.gov/industries/digital-game-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a push from New York state</a> that includes $25 million in tax credits for projects made in New York.</p><p>In 2022, the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/306-22/mayor-adams-takes-steps-transform-new-york-city-global-hub-digital-games-industry#/0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">established</a> a Game Development Industry Council that included figures from Microsoft, Take-Two, Avalanche Studios, Games for Change, Game Developers of Color Expo, NYU Game Center, and Zynga. It also funded a $2 million bachelor’s game design degree program with the goal of, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-city-nyc-eric-adams-bachelor-s-degree-game-dev-1848933337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Adams put it</a>, helping NYC “level up and finally become a leader in the digital gaming space.” There have been <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/mome/news/12032024-minecraft-battle-of-the-boroughs.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/mome/news/02082024-battle-of-the-boroughs.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mayoral <em>Minecraft </em>tournaments</a> for students with the goal of “addressing climate change while continuing to make our city the digital gaming capital of the world.” </p><p>This year, the Mayor’s Office also <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/mome/news/05282025-nyc-video-game-festival.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted an inaugural NYC Video Game Festival</a> in May to kick off “NYC Summer of Games,” a series of gaming-related expos, tournaments, exhibits, workshops and programs across the city. A lot of them are events that happen every summer anyway, but now there’s an umbrella over them.&nbsp;</p><p>Of the NYC Video Game Festival, our own Riley MacLeod, who was in attendance, says: “I caught the high school finals for the <em>Minecraft</em> tournament, where teams from a school in each of the boroughs had to build an environmentally-friendly version of Ellis Island and then give a presentation on it. As someone who’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/writing-tests-math" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worked in education and on educational games</a>, I thought it was actually really cool; it was fascinating to see what each team did and how they presented their design. Also, the emcee kept shushing the audience <em>just</em> like a teacher, which I found hilarious.”</p><p>Neither Mamdani nor Cuomo have spent much time outlining their plans in this regard (Aftermath reached out to the campaigns of both to learn more, but did not receive a reply as of this publishing), but Mamdani <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7ThzwqHprA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborated with leftist Twitch politics king Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker</a> earlier this year – and hilariously kept doxxing the duo because he couldn’t stop enthusing about specific NYC locations – while Cuomo, back in 2016 when he was governor of New York, <a href="https://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/local/new-york/2016/11/29/cuomo-music-video-games/94625582/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocked a bill</a> that would have created $50 million a year in tax credits for those who produce music or video games.</p><p>What really cinches it, though, is simple economics: If, per <a href="https://www.zohranfornyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mamdani’s plan</a>, rent is frozen, buses and childcare are free, and city-owned grocery stores bring down the price of food, New Yorkers will have more money left over to buy video games. Potentially a lot more. That makes him The Gamer Mayor, as far as I’m concerned. Given whose pocket Cuomo is in, the city will likely become more expensive on his watch, not less. And with <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/video-game-prices-might-increase-this-year-heres-why-i-dont-mind-paying-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game prices going up</a>, that's the last thing New Yorkers need. </p><p>Oh, and on top of landlords, Cuomo is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/18/bloomberg-donation-cuomo-super-pac-00413966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being bankrolled</a> by billionaires, real estate and finance execs, and Donald Trump supporters – to the tune of over $8 million, which he's spending on smear ads. At this point, we're almost more in the territory of a Cuomo anti-endorsement than anything else, but <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/new-york-times-leads-the-movement-to-stop-zohran-mamdani.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if the New York Times can do it</a>, so can we. Also, I don’t think Cuomo even knows what Twitch is.</p><p>This does not, however, mean that Mamdani has Aftermath’s unilateral support in perpetuity. Even with a winning grin and the miraculous ability to, for example, talk with their hands endlessly and somehow not annoy me, politicians are not our friends. The second they take office, it is our job to hold them accountable. If they step out of line – if they go against the will of the people who elected them – they should not know a moment’s peace. Inevitably, because our political system is little more than a series of corrupt backroom handshakes, Mamdani will fail us one day. Maybe it will be over something relatively small, or maybe he’ll reveal himself to be a different person than we all thought he was. Regardless, while it will be tempting to parasocially leap to the defense of the nice man from all the videos, that won’t help anybody. Politics is neither a game nor a popularity contest; it’s a fight.

Sure, you can use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-minecraft-cheats-and-console-commands/1100-6531935/" data-ref-id="1100-6531935">Minecraft console commands</a> to change the spawn point if you're the Minecraft server owner, or have admin permissions, but if that does not apply to you, you'll want to learn about how lodestones can alter the direction a compass points. That's where we come in.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4517822-lodestones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4517822-lodestones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517822"></a><figcaption>A lodestone in the overworld</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4517822-lodestones.jpg"></figure><p>Lodestones alter the place that your compass points to. It can also be used in the Nether, the End, and the overworld, whereas compasses only usually work in the overworld. Lodestones in the real world are naturally-occurring magnets, and rare to find.</p><h2>How to find a lodestone</h2><p>You can find lodestones in chests in bastion remnants, but you can also craft them. To create your own, place one iron ingot in the center of your crafting table, surrounded by chiseled stone bricks. It used to be more expensive to craft a lodestone, as instead of one iron ingot, a netherite ingot was required.</p><h2>How to use a lodestone</h2><p>Once you have your lodestone block, place it on the ground where you want the compass to point towards, take out your compass, and use it on the block. The compass will get the same sheen as enchanted armor gets, so you'll know whether it's worked or not.</p><p>If the lodestone is broken or in a different dimension than the compass, the compass will randomly spin. If the lodestone is destroyed while its paired compass is in a chest or storage item, then the compass will not register that the lodestone is destroyed until it is retrieved. Placing a lodestone back in the exact place as the original lodestone will prevent unpairing in this situation.</p><p>For more tips and hints, visit our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/" data-ref-id="1100-6526408">Minecraft guides hub</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak – Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Remedy released a patch today that including UI fixes and changes to how much unlockables costs. The studio re-organized unlockables into two categories: operational requisitions and essentials. Operational requisitions now include only cosmetics like sprays and armor sets while essentials includes gear and weapons. Essentials are now easier to unlock, according to the studio.</p><p>Remedy also detailed how they plan to change the "games' first hours" by better communicating how the crisis kits work and giving players better information on what to do within each mission. In addition, Remedy is giving new players deeper access to each job right off the bat, instead of limiting them to lower difficulties at the start.</p><p>The studio said it had been breaking down data and have more ideas on how to improve the overall experience but will need more time to execute.</p><p>"Today’s patch is just the beginning," the studio wrote. "These are some of the most immediate changes, but we are actively discussing and planning broader improvements to the game based on what we are hearing and seeing."</p><p>FBC: Firebreak was highly anticipated by fans of the Finnish studio, especially after strong showings with single-player adventures like Control and Alan Wake 2. While the gameplay is enjoyable, the number of problems quickly piled up. Many are still hopeful that Remedy can turn FBC: Firebreak into a fun and satisfying experience.</p><p>"As the game has launched on two different subscription services, I expect some players will likely try it, only to be quickly turned away by a subpar first impression and write Firebreak off without the lack of investment that might keep them around for longer," Mark Delaney wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/#:~:text=Firebreak%20is%20a%20first-person,distance%2C%20and%20a%20lot%20more." data-ref-id="1900-6418376">GameSpot FBC:Firebreak review</a>. "Hopefully, those who enjoy co-op PvE games do stick around past the early roughness, because there's something really fun to uncover. Sometimes the game gets in its own way by not tutorializing key points, like how to best deal with status effects and play roles dependably. But once you've gained that institutional knowledge, FBC: Firebreak is an enjoyably chaotic power fantasy, and an interesting experiment for Remedy between its bigger, weirder projects."</p>

            <p>
If you've been considering taking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> for another spin (or even a first spin) but want to do it on device small enough you could feasibly play it while, say, spelunking, there's some good news: the "reimagined" mobile version of developer ZA/UM Studio's acclaimed RPG comes to Android devices on 5th August. And if you still need some convincing it'll work on a smaller device, there's even more good news, as the first two chapters are free.
</p>
<p>
Disco Elysium - a sort of hard-boiled noir mystery presented using the conventions of a CRPG - tells the story of an amnesiac, alcoholic detective attempting to solve a murder while in the throes of existential crisis. And Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirwell enjoyed its verbose, improbably deep psychodrama enough that he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-the-year-2019-disco-elysium-is-about-outliving-history">named it one of his faves of 2019</a>.
</p>
<p>
And Edwin is far from its only fan. But ZA/UM - a troubled studio that's been involved an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">absolute mess of litigation and finger-pointing</a> since Disco Elysium's release - didn't exactly impress when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-is-being-reimagined-for-mobile-devices-to-captivate-the-tiktok-user">announced a "reimagined" mobile adaptation earlier this year</a>. "We intend to captivate the TikTok user with quick hits of compelling story, art, and audio, ultimately creating an all new, deeply engaging form of entertainment," is how studio head Denis Havel put it.
</p>

<p>
In truth, though, the reality doesn't seem anywhere near as dubious; essentially, ZA/UM has ditched the original's isometric gameplay in favour of an approach somewhat closer to a visual novel, where players swipe through dialogue options presented against bold 2D artwork. The idea, the studio says, is to create an experience specifically tailored toward "short play sessions that should easily fit into your life". Such as, say, when you're spelunking.
</p>
<p>
When Disco Elysium's mobile version "debuts" for Android on 5th August (suggesting an iOS release may follow), it'll <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZAUM.M0_stable&amp;pli=1">cost £9.99/€9.99/$9.99 USD</a>. But if you're not entirely sold on the idea of ZA/UM's reimagining, you'll be able to play the first two chapters for free.
</p>
<p>
As to what ZA/UM is doing next, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-zaums-new-rpg-c4-is-part-espionage-thriller-part-psychedelic-sci-fi">that'll be C4</a>, a new RPG described as being "part espionage thriller, part psychedelic sci-fi". Meanwhile, a whole bunch of former staff (many who split acrimoniously) have announced new projects in a similar vein to Disco Elysium.
</p>
<p>
Over in the UK, there's Dark Math Games and Longdue - two studios comprised of former ZA/UM developers that both announced Disco Elysium spiritual successors last year. Longdue is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-disco-elysium-alumni-join-former-staff-at-longdue-working-on-spiritual-successor">working on a "psychogeographic RPG" it's now unveiled as Hopetown</a>, while Dark Math is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">developing a detective RPG called XXX Nightshift</a>. Additionally, former Disco Elysium writer Argo Tuulik has also announced a new RPG, being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">made at his Summer Eternal studio</a>. And finally, Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov have also set up their own studio, and were previously said to be making a game with backing from NetEase.

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy Producer Naoki Yoshida And Creative Director Kazutoyo Maehiro Seem To Drop A Hint At Final Fantasy XVI Coming To Nintendo Switch 2]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy XVI just recently arrived on <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-series-x-720p-performance/">Xbox Series consoles</a>, which means that it's now available to play on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, with Nintendo still left out of the equation. At least, for now, as series producer at Square Enix, Naoki Yoshida and creative director Kazutoyo Maehiro seem to have just dropped a hint that FFXVI could be coming to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Spotted and translated by a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-port-of-ffxvi-hinted-at-by-naoki-yoshida-and-kazutoyo-maehiro.1224171/">ResetEra</a>, in the most recent 'Letter from the Producer' live stream video for Final Fantasy XIV, towards the end of the stream, as Yoshida and Maehiro are discussing what players can look forward to in the world of Final Fantasy, such as FFXVI coming to Xbox, they joke that Nintendo is the only platform left out, to which Maehiro says he "<em>will do his best</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV Letter from the Producer LIVE Part LXXXVII" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zg-LRoukGVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At face value, this is a joke between friends and co-workers, and is in no way an official confirmation that Final Fantasy XVI is coming to Switch 2. But it's not the first time a Switch 2 port of Final Fantasy XVI has been brought up.</p>
<p>There were rumblings about <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/much-requested-square-enix-ports-will-finally-be-announced-for-xbox-and-switch-2-its-claimed/">XVI coming to Switch 2 at the beginning of this year</a>, and now that we know Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is coming to Switch 2, there have <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-hints-the-entire-remake-trilogy-could-be-coming-to-switch-2/">been hints that the rest of that trilogy is coming to Switch 2 as well</a>.</p>
<p>Seeing Final Fantasy XVI on the Nintendo Switch is a pipe dream that was probably never going to happen, but if Final Fantasy VII Remake can work on the Switch 2, and maybe even the rest of the series, than so could Final Fantasy XVI.</p>
<p>Of course, if it won't look like it does on your PC, PS5, or Xbox Series device, but seeing a successful port of the game would be another example of how much more is possible on the Nintendo Switch 2 than its predecessor.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dune: Awakening — The Trooper Mentor Class Gameplay Trailer | Schools of the Imperium</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Junior additionally mentioned Dune: Awakening will receive new PvE maps for players to explore in the future, though it's unclear if these would be included for free as a major update or come in the form of a paid expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the more immediate future, Junior said an update is coming in early July that will contain "too many" quality-of-life changes to list. Junior didn't go into detail on what those changes would be, but said to expect the patch notes when the patch is closer to being ready for testing.</p><p dir="ltr">Funcom dove into plenty of other topics as part of the AMA, ranging from plans to make it so players can name storage containers and vehicles to its thoughts on potential changes to Dune: Awakening's PvP-focused endgame. Many of players' complaints are focused around the heavy reliance on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-craft-and-repair-all-dune-awakening-vehicles/1100-6532312/" data-ref-id="1100-6532312">vehicles</a> in the game's endgame Deep Desert zone, so much so that PvP encounters are largely between flying Ornithopters rather than on-foot encounters where the game's melee and firearms can come into play. When asked about the potential of a Deep Desert zone where only ground vehicles would be allowed, creative director Joel Bylos shot down the idea but did say Funcom is looking to make some changes.</p><p dir="ltr">"The current balance between vehicles and on-foot is not tuned to our liking and there are multiple changes in the pipeline to address this," Bylos said.</p><p dir="ltr">Other additions players can expect in Dune: Awakening's future based on Funcom's Reddit answers include an option to duel other players, a deposit all option for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ways-to-get-blood-and-water-in-dune-awakening/1100-6532157/" data-ref-id="1100-6532157">water</a>, changes to the endgame PvE Landsraad system, additional contracts to complete, and a third faction that "will change the entire dynamic" of the Landsraad, according to Bylos.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening is finding major success on Steam, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-the-lisan-al-gaib-of-dune-games-as-steam-concurrents-top-140000/1100-6532344/" data-ref-id="1100-6532344">surpassed 140,000 concurrent players</a>. Its most recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-patch-notes-fix-frustrating-endgame-pvp-problems/1100-6532538/" data-ref-id="1100-6532538">update addressed some of its endgame PvP problems</a> by making it so vehicles no longer deal damage when colliding with other players, as well as increased respawn timers in PvP zones. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/" data-ref-id="1100-6532326">Dune: Awakening is still slated to launch on consoles</a>, but not until 2026.</p>

World has been pulling in a peak of at least 25,000 players each day this week while Wilds has not broken the 23,000 player mark in that same period. Fans of the series are going back to World after being disappointed by the endgame content and performance issues in Wilds.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Monster Hunter Wilds Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Players have been sounding off about Monster Hunter Wilds' performance issues and other problems via Steam's review system. Many of the reviews cite frame rate issues, an unsatisfactory story, not enough endgame content, and a few go as far to say the game will no longer start on their computers.</p><p>Capcom brought new content to Monster Hunter World for two years after it was released. While it did have some performance issues, players never criticized the game as harshly on Steam. Monster Hunter Wilds is scheduled to be part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-will-show-off-more-of-resident-evil-requiem-in-a-showcase-next-week/1100-6532567/" data-ref-id="1100-6532567">Capcom Spotlight</a> showcase stream next week where the publisher will show off an upcoming update. Players are hoping for some big additions to endgame content and upgrades to how the game runs on PC.</p><p>"Capcom understands the value of throwing you into one climactic battle after another in what would be a set-piece boss fight in almost any other game," Richard Wakeling wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">GameSpots Monster Hunter Wilds review</a> at the beginning of 2024. "Monster Hunter Wilds suffers from some performance issues, the environments are often bland, and the story feels superfluous, but when you're face-to-face with a fearsome monster, few situations are quite as riveting. Monster Hunter Wilds may only make iterative improvements to further refine the formula, but that's all it really needed to do."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It’s summer gaming showcase season, and the minds behind Little Nightmares are getting in on the fun by announcing a dedicated presentation for the franchise. The Little Nightmares Showcase has been revealed for next week and will likely have an update on the upcoming third entry.</p><p>All we know about the showcase for now is that it airs on June 24 at 12 p.m. PT/3 p.m. ET. The news was shared by the Little Nightmares III <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1935729464823976221">X account</a>, with a post stating,</p><p>Something unsettling is coming. It's closer than you think.</p><p>Are you ready to face it, little ones?&nbsp;</p><p>One would imagine the presentation will heavily revolve around Little Nightmares III, which was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamescom-2023/2023/08/23/little-nightmares-3-announced-for-2024-release-developed-by-until-dawn">first announced</a> at Gamescom 2023. Supermassive Games is developing the title, replacing the original creators, Tarsier Studios, which is currently working on a new horror platformer, <a href="https://youtu.be/mUymvhAXOnM?si=8nr9ft1tikkJkT9t">Reanimal</a>. Little Nightmares III was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/31/little-nightmares-iii-moves-into-2025">delayed to 2025</a> last year and has no concrete release date.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFO9Z_0wrKE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFO9Z_0wrKE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It’s also plausible we’ll learn concrete details for the long-rumored Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition. Though technically unannounced, the game’s existence <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/12/esrb-rates-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc">first came to light</a> in late 2023 after it received a rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in South Africa. Much like the Enhanced Edition for Little Nightmares II that released in 2021 (also developed by Supermassive), this would presumably be a new-gen remaster of the 2017 original game.</p><p>Whether we get a Little Nightmares III release date or confirmation for the Enhanced Edition of the first title, we don’t have to wait long to find out either way. &nbsp;Until then, you can brush up on Little Nightmares III by checking out 18 minutes of gameplay <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/10/27/check-out-18-minutes-of-unsettling-little-nightmares-3-co-op-gameplay">here.</a>&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope or expect to see during the Little Nightmares Showcase? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/20/little-nightmares-showcase-announced-for-next-week]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Indie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game developer Ruled are onto a nice little spree with their shortform Itch.io releases - seemingly, they are skipping from phobia to phobia. First there was <a href="https://ruleddev.itch.io/automatonophobia">Automatonophobia</a>, a game that navigated the fear of subterranean golems, then there was <a href="https://ruleddev.itch.io/chrometophobia">Chrometophobia</a>, a game dedicated to the fear of spending money, and also to the act of finding "grimbo" gibs for a delicious pie. What's next on the menu? Ah yes, scarecrows. </p><!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://ruleddev.itch.io/formidophobia">Formidophobia</a>, which can be downloaded for free, you are a farmer trying to make it across a hazy lofi cornfield. Your dad told you never to go in that field. His dad told him never to go in that field. Neither of them are around anymore, however, and your wife needs medical attention, so off you trot with your bolt-action rifle and exactly one shell. With luck, you'll find more shells along the way.</p>
<p>The rifle is a stubborn, slothful broomhandle of a weapon that wobbles drunkenly at stomach level and often gets caught on other objects, dragging behind you in a way that makes me empathise for the weary arms of my character. The principal challenge and source of dread in Formidophobia is reloading it in a punctual fashion.</p>
<p>The starting area is a ring of scrawly signposts that illustrate the process of pulling back the lever, tugging a shell from the holder, and closing the gun up again. The utility of those signposts isn't that they tell you how to wield your gun, in my experience - it's that other things can't walk through them.</p>
<p>I enjoy the grubbiness, stodginess and overall inhospitability of this game. Don't come expecting "polish", do come expecting a briskly unpleasant meditation on the rasp of stems and the crickle-crackle of bones, deep in the mist.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-fun-failing-to-reload-your-gun-fast-enough-in-this-cornfield-creepfest]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been roughly three weeks since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> dropped on May 30, and players have started to get their heads around all the different tools and abilities available to them in Limveld. What some are starting to do with those abilities, though, is pretty fascinating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the top posts on the r/Nightreign subreddit this morning <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lg0on3/new_strategy_for_getting_to_noklateo_quicker/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was from user u/Quantam-Law</a>, who was playing with a Raider under the username "BRO....". BRO had a pretty great idea: the trio of Nightfarers had the Noklateo Shifting Earth event, and rather than storm the front gate of the city, BRO popped Raider's ultimate to provide a new platform for entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Noklateo, and other Shifting Earth events, are random, map-changing alterations that can appear, adding new encounters and areas to explore in the process. But while this usage of Totem Stela is good for that, it gets the gears turning on other places and ways you could use the massive brick to get up and around designed obstacles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raider's not the only one with tricks, either. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lfvzuf/crater_wylder_skip/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">u/Mockz_ also had a recent skip posted</a> up on the Elden Ring Nightreign subreddit, this time for the Crater Shifting Earth event. In this one, Mockz uses their abilities, and a little bit of good ol' fashioned gravity to get where they need to go, at the bottom of the Crater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another user, u/ninjabladeJr, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lfox8v/consistent_crater_skip/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a feasible</a>—albeit challenging and dangerous—skip of their own to the bottom of the Crater, using a spectral hawk and specific line-ups. Are these Crater skips dangerous? Absolutely. Is it awesome to see someone breeze past the many, many encounters of the dungeon and straight to the big boss, the ultimate goal and prize of the Shifting Earth event? You betcha.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heck, there are people <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l691iv/mountaintop_event_skip_to_save_you_some_time/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even finding ways to the top of the Mountaintop event</a> by just Skyrim-jumping their way up the side of the cliffs like an ibex. Shifting Earth events are a fun, fascinating part of Nightreign's construction and layout, and it's amazing how players are already finding ways to navigate them faster and smarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual usability of these is absolutely up-in-the-air. I could see popping the Noklateo totem-skip in a random lobby, but I think attempting the spectral hawk Crater skip in a room with two random players who don't know what I'm doing is a fast path to two, if not three, Nightfarers down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the fact players are getting so creative with their abilities and finding such interesting uses for them bodes well for the long-term health of Elden Ring Nightreign. As of this writing, the speedrun leaderboards for Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/Elden_Ring_Nightreign/news/mxl4856p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still aren't live</a>, but these community-discovered skips already have me intrigued to see what speedrunners can showcase with the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/three-weeks-in-elden-ring-nightreign-players-are-inventing-some-creative-ways-to-skip-around-the-map]]></content:encoded>

Chapter 5 is currently set for a 2026 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This information was revealed in the end credits of Deltarune Chapter 4, which released alongside Chapter 3 earlier this month. No further specificity about dates or windows was given.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/20/deltarune-ch-5-1750433683939.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune is a "sequel" of sorts to beloved indie RPG Undertale, and has released chapter by chapter starting in 2018, with Chapter 2 releasing in 2021 and the two most recent chapters <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-out-now-and-its-already-exploding-on-steam">dropping alongside the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 earlier this month</a>. The game follows a human named Kris who lives in a peaceful town of monsters familiar to those who played Undertale. Together with the school bully Suzie, they fall into a mysterious "Dark World" and meet a prince named Ralsei, who charges them with saving both the dark and light world by sealing dark fountains. Each chapter tackles a different dark fountain in something like a "monster of the week" format, though Chapter 4 goes off the rails a bit in exploring the game's overarching meta-plot that fans speculate may eventually tie the game back to Undertale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chapters 1 and 2 are available on all major platforms for free, while the full game including Chapters 3, 4, and all future chapters (up to at least seven) costs $25. With the paid release, we reviewed all of Deltarune so far, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">giving it a 9/10</a> and saying that "its incredible and well-refined culmination of captivating characters, hilarious and earnest writing, and stellar music has already left one hell of a lasting impact I’m not likely to forget."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Those who've played <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/now-pac-man-can-run-into-the-ghosts-behold-the-new-championship-edition-2/">the excellent <em>Pac-Man Championship Edition</em> series</a> will be familiar with the high-speed vibe here, but <em>Pac-Man Superfast</em> remains focused on the game's original maze and selection of just four ghosts. That means old-school strategies for grouping ghosts together and running successful patterns through the narrow corridors work in similar ways here. Successfully executing those patterns becomes a tense battle of nerves here, though, requiring multiple direction changes every second at the highest speeds. While the game will technically work with swipe controls on a smartphone or tablet, high-level play really requires the precision of a keyboard via a desktop/laptop web browser (we couldn't get the game to recognize a USB controller, unfortunately).</p>

      Collecting those high-value items at the bottom is your ticket to a lot of extra lives.

<p>As exciting as the high-speed maze gameplay gets, though, <em>Pac-Man Superfast</em> is hampered by a few odd design decisions. The game ends abruptly after just 13 levels, for instance, making it impossible to even attempt the high-endurance 256-level runs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/billy-mitchell-says-hes-not-going-to-stop-now-after-scoreboard-ban/">that <em>Pac-Man</em> is known for</a>. The game also throws an extra life at you every 5,000 points, making it relatively easy to brute force your way to the end as long as you focus on the three increasingly high-point-value items that appear periodically on each stage.</p>
<p>Despite this, the game doesn't give any point reward for unused extra lives or long-term survival at high speeds, limiting the rewards for high-level play. And the lack of a built-in leaderboard makes it hard to directly compare your performance to friends and/or strangers anyway.</p>

<p>Those issues aside, I've had a blast coming back to <em>Pac-Man Supefast</em> over and over again in the past few days, slowly raising my high score above the 162,000 point mark during coffee breaks (consider the gauntlet thrown, Ars readers). If you're a fan of classic arcade games, <em>Pac-Man Superfast</em> is worth a try before the "YouTube Playables" initiative inevitably joins <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/google-kills-product/">the growing graveyard of discontinued Google products</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="GameCube 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/132905828a6e7/gamecube-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I still remember the day I got my GameCube. It wasn’t the launch day, because I remember getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> alongside it, which to my knowledge released a few weeks after the console itself in the UK.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, I was so excited though! I poured over early issues of <a href="https://www.nintendomags.com/magazines/ngc-magazine/">NGC</a> in the weeks leading up to The Big Day (somehow, there were already about six or seven issues before the console even released), perhaps most notably while on a family holiday in Cyprus, clutching the magazine while my Mum tried to get me to focus on the sights and sounds of the Limassol coastline. <em>No Mum… I’m reading about Link’s Melee moveset for the hundredth time, thanks.</em></p><p><figure data-videoid="QmxeKH0YIR0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QmxeKH0YIR0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxeKH0YIR0"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmxeKH0YIR0">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The day I actually got the GameCube felt so magical; previously, my brother’s Mega Drive and PS1 had been passed down to me while he moved onto the next big thing, and I had already owned a Game Boy Color by this point thanks to the <strong>Pokémon</strong> boom, but the GameCube was the first home console that I could truly call my own. It was <em>mine</em>. My precious.</p>
<p>The three or four years following were some of the most memorable of my life; really up until the release of the Wii, if I’m honest. And it’s because the GameCube launched right when I was starting to find my feet at high school, and so the friendships I cultivated during that time linked directly with my experience with the console.</p>
<figure><a title="GameCube 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db266839ba078/gamecube-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I had two ‘best friends’, I guess you could call them, and they both owned their own GameCubes and were just about as passionate as I was about Nintendo’s adorable little purple box – perhaps more so, actually. So we played multiplayer as often as we could, and when we weren’t playing together, we’d be talking about our own experiences in between classes (and yes, probably during classes too).</p>
<p><em>“How does Link control?”</em> is an actual question I specifically remember asking one of my friends after he’d got his hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Wind Waker</a> six or seven hours before me. He got his delivery before school started that day, and I had to wait until I got home the same evening. Ridiculous! But it was these kinds of conversations that really got me through high school. I’ll never forget it.</p>
<p>Life goes on, of course, and for reasons I can’t quite recall, I had to get rid of my GameCube and accompanying games. High school and college ended, and so my friends and I went our separate ways when university hit, chasing our own visions of what adulthood might look like. Outside of a few brief chance encounters in the years since, we’d pretty much remained apart for nearly 20 years.</p>

<p>However, after another encounter a couple of years back, I’ve reconnected with those same two friends I’d spent so much time with during high school. Now, on a near-weekly basis, we get together at a local micro pub, knock back a couple of pints, munch on some pork scratchings, and spend each Saturday evening enjoying rousing discussions about current affairs, gaming, and of course, our time together at high school.</p>
<p>The best thing about these little get-togethers is the joint realisation that none of us has really changed. Sure, we’ve changed in the obvious sense that we’re now grown up with lots of different responsibilities and whatnot, but we still all love gaming, and it genuinely felt like our time apart after high school just never happened. It was like we were right back in 2002, albeit without the constant threat of bullies and the monotonous homework. I had a real rough time in 2023 for reasons I won’t go into here, and honestly, reconnecting with my two best friends again saved me.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2025, and our conversations frequently involve the Switch 2. We’d go over our hopes for the console, rumours and speculation, along with any information that Nintendo itself had officially announced. Naturally, when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-direct-april-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">the big Direct</a> happened at the start of April and included confirmation that GameCube games would be making a comeback, this became a hot topic for the three of us. Not only was the console that effectively cemented our friendships back in 2002 suddenly a thing again, but the fact that it was happening <em>now</em>, after so many years of us being apart, felt remarkably significant.</p>

<p>So I have to admit, booting up the GameCube app on Switch 2 for the first time, official wireless GameCube controller at hand, I felt a little bit emotional. I've had that nostalgic feeling plenty of times – haven't we all?-- but nothing quite like this. Hauling myself down that ladder and taking my first steps across Outset Island in The Wind Waker immediately brought back memories of that ridiculous question I'd asked my friend all those years back.</p>
<p>But instead of it festering in the back of my mind, I know I can bring it up with the exact same friend at the pub, and I know it'll lead to a dozen other GameCube memories and unrestrained belly laughs. That's just how it is. And it's the same with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a>: all three games played a huge part in our teenage years, and so they all hold their own respective treasure troves of memories within.</p>
<p>There is, however, one thing missing right now. The game that started it all, the one I poured over for countless hours in NGC magazines, and the one I played the first time I booted up my GameCube in 2002: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>.</p>
<p>It's yet to be confirmed for Nintendo Switch Online, but if/when it does, I imagine our nights out at the pub will turn into impromptu Melee tournaments. And I can't wait.</p>

			<p>Sloclap's new football game, Rematch, is officially out, and in just the game's first 24 hours of being live for everyone, not just those who paid for early access a few days ahead of launch, <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1936061475447013553">Sloclap announced</a> that Rematch had&nbsp;<strong>1 million unique players</strong> running on to the pitch.</p>
<p>It's great news for Sloclap, but what was better news for players was Sloclap pushing a new hotfix for Rematch, which can be downloaded now on all platforms. Patch 0.5 adds a bug fix for the ball hitting the post and going out of sync with other players, though still notes that ball sync issues "<em>might still happen under other circumstances</em>."</p>
<p>And most importantly, this new hotfix includes fixes for stability issues, netcode improvements, and matchmaking updates to improve queue times.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it's been a great launch for Rematch, with more than 1 million unique players, and on Steam alone, hitting <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2138720/charts/">92,841 concurrent players</a>. On the other hand, it's been fraught with bugs, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lg6j0f/please_consolidate_all_na_servers/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">long queue times</a>, and Sloclap has already <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">talked about its priorities</a> when it comes to making more fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Crossplay support is at the top of the list, as it was just hours before the game released in its early access launch for the players who paid extra, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">crossplay support would not be in the game at launch</a>.</p>
<p>Sloclap has apologized for not telling players that crossplay would be missing sooner, and hopefully, it's not too long of a wait for the feature to be added.</p>

If you’re like me and initially did everything at 100cc because you were intimidated by all the new courses, it’ll be a little annoying to go through all of them again right away. Luckily, you don’t need to win or even place in these races—if you’re not up for the challenge, even just standing still in the Knockout Tour rallies so you get eliminated in the first round works! (Just make sure to check for the tiny green checkmarks below the 150cc buttons to confirm you’ve done every cup and rally). </p><p>Activating Mirror Mode isn’t without some mystery, however. <strong>Players are also theorizing that you need to meet some requirements in Free Roam.</strong> I had these covered already when I unlocked Mirror Mode, but we’re not positive if they really make a difference yet. These requirements include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>10 P Switches</li><li>10 ? Panels</li><li>10 Peach Medallions</li></ul><p>Once you’ve met these requirements, head back to the Grand Prix menu and do the Special Cup (you also don’t need to win or place here). If you’ve succeeded, after the usual credits roll, you’ll get to see a charming little cutscene and a popup that lets you know you’ve unlocked Mirror Mode. After that, head to VS mode—you’ll now find Mirror Mode listed under the Class setting alongside its new 50, 100, and 150cc pals.</p><figure id="" data-id="7dbfc31d8997fc37211a90bda5670ec5" data-recommend-id="image://7dbfc31d8997fc37211a90bda5670ec5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the option for Mirror Mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the option for Mirror Mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku / Amelia Zollner</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7dbfc31d8997fc37211a90bda5670ec5" data-recommend-id="image://7dbfc31d8997fc37211a90bda5670ec5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the option for Mirror Mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>If Mirror Mode somehow <em>doesn’t </em>unlock after you complete these tasks, check to make sure that you’ve really done all the cups and rallies in 150cc</strong>. After that, if you still don’t unlock it through the Special Cup, we’d recommend just driving around in free roam to scrounge around for coins and rack up some extra distance before trying the Special Cup again—it’s possible that these might also factor into Mirror Mode.</p><h2 id="h278373"><a id=""></a><strong>How to unlock Mirror Mode in Free Roam</strong></h2><p>Mirror Mode is a VS classic, but <em>Mario Kart World</em> lets Free Roam fans in on the fun, too. If you want to flip your Free Roam map, you’ll need to first have unlocked the regular Mirror Mode through the steps above. After that, head to Peach Stadium in Free Roam. Begin driving along the course from the start and climb the usual floating platforms, but once you’re high enough, jump off the course down onto the castle’s large red roof (reminder that you can rewind if you miss!). From there, you’ll want to find the castle’s tower and then drive straight into the Peach stained glass a-la <em>Mario 64</em>. You’ll get another little cutscene, and then the entire world will be flipped! </p><figure id="" data-id="36ec148a4e52a97c88f90589fc94c6a6" data-recommend-id="image://36ec148a4e52a97c88f90589fc94c6a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach sits on a motorcycle on a backwards course." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Peach sits on a motorcycle on a backwards course." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku / Amelia Zollner</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36ec148a4e52a97c88f90589fc94c6a6" data-recommend-id="image://36ec148a4e52a97c88f90589fc94c6a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach sits on a motorcycle on a backwards course." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once you’re done with Mirror Mode, just drive back into the same stained glass to restore the world to its original layout.
