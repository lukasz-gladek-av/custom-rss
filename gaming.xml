			<p>Yellow paint to indicate the way to players is among the controversial features of modern video games, but no matter how heated the debate gets, some developers, like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, feel there's definitely a need for it.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/oh-no-the-yellow-paint-debate-is-back-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-says-there-is-definitely-a-need-for-that-kind-of-thing-and-the-only-real-question-is-about-how-its-done/">GamesRadar+</a>, Hamaguchi-san acknowledged the debate among players while also saying that there's definitely a need for yellow paint in games in many ways. The difference, however, is in how it is implemented.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"The need to guide players around from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there are definitely times where that is needed," </em>Hamaguchi-san explained. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it's done, what level and what works. And there'll still be people who say, 'no, that doesn't fit at all. We don't like that.' That's fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it's something that is definitely worth looking at."</em></p>



<p>As there are all sorts of players, the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director's stance on the yellow paint discussion is entirely understandable, as it aims to make complex games with sprawling worlds more accessible to all. </p>



<p>Still, having the option to turn these indicators in some way would be welcome. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/92">While PC users can sometimes resort to mods</a>, offering similar toggles on consoles would likely satisfy the concerns of the community. <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">As the third and final entry in the Remake trilogy is expected to be even larger</a>, it will be interesting to see how Hamaguchi and his team manage the balance between guidance and player freedom.</p>

            <p>Brethren! Cease your prattling and pick up your GameCube controllers. It is time to start playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eternal-darkness">Eternal Darkness</a>: Sanity's Requiem at an unhealthy velocity, while funding lawyers to uphold the legal rights of LGBTQ+ people in the USA.</p>
<p>Today marks the beginning of Games Done Queer, a new weekend-long streaming event from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/speedrunning">speedrunning</a> organisation Games Done Quick. It's raising money for the <a href="https://lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal and Education Fund</a>, which aims "to achieve full recognition of the civil rights of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and everyone living with HIV, through impact litigation, education and public policy work."</p>
<p>The event runs from today October 31st to Monday November 3rd, and sees canny streamers undertaking creatively accelerated playthroughs of games from all across the ages - Diddy Kong Racing, Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rift-of-the-necrodancer">Rift Of The Necrodancer</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, Kiosk, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>, to name a few. The full schedule is <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/61">here</a>.</p>
<p>I confess, I don't watch a lot of speedruns, but I'm fascinated by the ways in which players <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queering">queer</a> the machinery and build on each other's strategies - particularly when it comes to horror games, which may punish you more severely for being hasty. I've never played Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, but going by scattered internet chatter, it's a tough candidate for a speedrun. If you're familiar with the game, <a href="https://speeddemosarchive.com/EternalDarkness.html">this speedrunner breakdown from way back in 2011</a> may interest, as may <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/913957-eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem/80052151">this GameFAQ post</a> in which somebody tries to crack the game's occluded stamina system.</p><p>There's also Steve Messner's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-tool-assisted-speedrunning-works">old feature on "tool-assisted" speedrunning from 2016</a>, in which Super Mario 64 is prised apart like a broken pocketwatch and reassembled into some kind of warp drive. Anyway, best of luck to all the Games Done Queer speedrunners this weekend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO’s great, ain’t it? It’s a toy that appeals not just to children but folks of all ages. You don’t need to be a kid to enjoy a good LEGO set, just a kid at heart. It helps that there is a LEGO set for practically every fandom in the world. One of the most popular of which has got to be the many, many Marvel collaborations the brand has made. This set here that happens to be on sale depicts perhaps the most iconic set pieces from Sam Raimi’s original <em>Spider-Man&nbsp;</em>trilogy. I’m of course talking about the train scene from&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>.</p>
<p>Normally, the LEGO Marvel <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/">Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock subway train scene set goes for $55, but right now it’s on sale for 20% off</a>: That shaves off a nice $11 from the price, bringing it to just $44.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>If you were in middle school or high school in the mid 2000s, chances are you loved these films. Critical consensus (highest Rotten Tomatoes score) indicates the best of Tobey Maguire’s best of the bunch is&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em> and I’d personally credit that to it having more heart than the other.</p>
<p>The most memorable scene from the Marvel sequel (spoilers, I guess) has got to be when a maskless Spider-Man saves the subway train, slowing it down on the tracks by webbing the nearby buildings, then for the passengers to warmly agree to keep his identify secret. That’s New York, baby.</p>



<h2>Runaway LEGO Action</h2>
<p>The 393-piece LEGO set includes builds into the front train care and includes four minifigures. It comes with Doc Ock, J. Jonah Jameson, Aunt May, and Spider-Man, who comes with swappable masked and unmasked heads.</p>
<p>Use Spider-Man’s attachable web to recreate the iconic scene. Doc Ock comes with his four adjustable mechanical arms. Two of them are equipped with laser beams while the other two can attach themselves to the train, holding on. And J. Jonah and May are just there too I guess.</p>
<p>The set measures in at over 3 inches high, 9 inches long, and 2 inches wide. The roof of the train can lift off to give access to the interior.</p>
<p>Use the LEGO Builder app to help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet. You can zoom in and rotate the model around even bookmark your progress so you can walkaway and come back later to complete your build.</p>

<p>Bloober Team’s epic Silent Hill 2 remake smashed it out of the park on PS5 and PC. The title was a console exclusive for the PS5, but a new ESRB rating has revealed that the Silent Hill 2 remake is coming to Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p>



<p>It seems the Silent Hill 2 remake was potentially on a timed exclusivity agreement. This is the feeling as the horror remake has been rated by the ESRB for the “Xbox Series.” There’s still no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-switch-2-xbox-rumor-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch port</a> in the open, but the game’s console presence is about to become wider and more terrifying.</p>



<h2 id="h-esrb-rates-silent-hill-2-for-xbox-series-x-s">ESRB Rates Silent Hill 2 For Xbox Series X|S</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Happy Halloween! Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Poor James Sunderland, he has to relive his own personal trauma all over again on Xbox. On the plus side, it’s a nice Halloween treat for Xbox players who’ve upgraded to modern-gen hardware.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ESRB</a> website was updated on October 31 (of all dates) to show Silent Hill 2 being certified. The key difference this time is that it’s for “Xbox Series” platforms, and the news comes nearly a year after the PS5 and PC launches.</p>



<p>From what we can tell, nothing’s changed on the rating summary front. It’s still the same Mature 17+ rating, and features the same depraved content, the same gruesome and gory gameplay, and the same “Enemies with body parts sewn together.”</p>



<p>It doesn’t clarify when Silent Hill 2’s remake is coming to Xbox. We’ll have to wait for an official announcement in the future—maybe closer to The Game Awards?</p>



<p>For now, if you’re on Xbox and you haven’t played the second game’s exquisite remake, we advise you to get the sick bags on standby and have a nice supply of light bulbs at the ready, as playing this in the dark will mentally put you in Silent Hill while you’re trying to sleep!</p>



<p>Have you played the Silent Hill 2 remake? What do Xbox players have to look forward to? Let them know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, which is getting many new members by the day.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Amid Nintendo's ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a>, the company's initial efforts to patent a variety of Pokémon-style monster capture and throwing mechanics in Japan have been rejected.</p>
<p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">launched its controversial lawsuit against Palworld maker Pocketpair</a> last year following the game's<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-reaches-25m-players-in-first-month"> wildly successful launch</a>, accusing the studio of infringing  "multiple" patents. At the time, it said it was seeking an injunction and compensation for damages. In response, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">vowed to fight the legal action</a>, saying it wanted to ensure small studios could not be "hindered or discouraged from pursuing creative ideas".</p>
<p>Throughout all this, it remained unclear exactly what patents Nintendo was accusing Palworld of infringing, although evidence unearthed by legal observers suggested the lawsuit primarily<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent"> hinged on Pokémon's ball-throwing and creature catching mechanics</a>. Notably, one of the patents Nintendo appeared to be pinning its legal hopes on wasn't filed until <em>after</em> PalWorld's release - albeit appended to a pre-existing "parent" patent filed in December 2021. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exceedingly-plausible-nintendo-crafted-patent-claims-to-specifically-target-palworld-says-ip-expert">one IP expert observed</a> at the time, it was "exceedingly plausible" Nintendo had crafted the patent application to specifically target Palworld.</p>
<p>Speculation Pokémon's Pokéball mechanics lay at the heart of Nintendo's lawsuit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">appeared to be confirmed last December</a> when Pocketpair released an update to remove Palworld's Pokéball-style summoning mechanic. It later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">removed a gliding mechanic</a>, saying it had to make "yet another compromise" due to the lawsuit. Since then, Palworld lawyers have argued, among other things, that the continued existence of games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> - which all feature similar mechanics to those Nintendo wishes to patent - invalidates the company's efforts, and Pocketpair has continued to assert the "invalidity of the patents in question". And it now appears Japan's patent office agrees - in part and for now at least - with that stance.</p><p>As <a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/">reported by GamesFray</a>, the Japan Patent Office has now rejected an application (specifically application no. 2024-031879) filed by Nintendo in March last year which attempts to patent certain capture and item-throwing mechanics. According to the machine translated rejection notice, the patent will not be granted in its current form as the "claimed invention(s) could have easily been made by persons who have common knowledge in the technical field to which the claimed invention(s) pertains", given evidence the "invention(s)" already existed "in Japan or other foreign countries prior to the filing of the patent application".</p>
<p>The rejection notice then highlights documentation provided by an unnamed third-party pointing to instances of similar mechanics existing prior to the filing in games such as Monster Hunter 4, Ark: Survival Evolved, Pocketpair's own Craftopia, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>. However, as GamesFray notes, the rejection isn't final, and Nintendo may still choose to amend its application in order to sway the patent examiner. It also stresses a final rejection of the application would have no "direct impact" on the Palworld lawsuit given patent office decisions are non-binding. That doesn't necessarily leave Nintendo in the clear, however; GamesFray says Japanese judges "tend to have respect for the determinations made by patent examiners".</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo finds itself in an entirely different position in the US, where it was recently granted a patent covering gameplay mechanics relating to the summoning of a sub-character to let it fight another. Eurogamer spoke to legal experts at the time to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">find out how enforceable that patent actually is</a>.</p>

			<p>Last year's Silent Hill 2 remake is finally coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, as this new version of the game has been rated by the ESRB ahead of its official announcement.</p>



<p>As the yet-to-be officially announced new version of the survival horror game developed by Bloober Team, which returned the series to the spotlight after years of absence, will be identical to the PC and PlayStation 5 releases, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/">the Mature 17+ rating and its summary</a> don't reveal anything that wasn't already known about the game. Still, it's great to know that more players will soon be able to play one of the best survival horror games released in recent times.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S is hardly a surprise. Earlier this month, known leaker Dusk Golem commented on the matter, saying not only that the game will be coming soon to Xbox consoles, but also that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-dlc-xbox-versions-announcement-rumored-to-be-tied-with-movies-release/">the Born of a Wish DLC campaign is getting remade, and that a new PlayStation 5 Pro patch will also be released</a> to solve some of the remaining issues the game has on the premium Sony console. All this should be announced soon, as the announcements should coincide with the marketing cycle of the Return to Silent Hill movie, which is set to hit theaters on January 23, 2026.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, the Silent Hill 2 remake is not only a great remake of a now-classic survival horror game, but a great game in its own right.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re still a solid month away from the big holiday sales of the season. I’m of course talking about Black Friday and Cyber Monday. During this several day span following Thanksgiving, you’ll be able to find tons of deals on tech, home goods, and more. However, even though we’re not quite there yet, you can find some pretty steep discounts right now if you know where to look. At this moment, Amazon has its Wi-Fi 7 mesh router, the Eero Pro 7, on sale for about 20% off.</p>
<p>The router is available either on its own or in a pack of two or three. The standalone <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5196/">Eero Pro 7 mesh router typically sells for $300, but for a limited time, you can save $60 — bringing the price down to just $240</a>. Though the advantage of a mesh Wi-Fi router is using it to make a mesh Wi-Fi network, using more than one node. The Eero Pro 7 two-pack is normally set at $550, but has come down by $100 to just $450 during this sale. Likewise, the three-pack has dropped from $700 to just $550, making for a savings of $150.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5196/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Eero Pro 7 is Amazon’s flagship router for taking advantage of the speeds and range of Wi-Fi 7. Each router in your Eero network will be able to cover up to 2,000 square feet, or up to 6,000 square feet if you go with the set of three. Each node covers a 25-foot radius and supports over 200 networked devices each (600 total).</p>



<h2>Internet in Every Corner</h2>
<p>What’s great about a mesh network is you can expand it to your needs at any time. If you just start with the one, you can later on add any single Eero to extend your Wi-Fi coverage further. The Eero Pro 7 is backward compatible with all previous generations of Eero as well as Amazon Echo devices that have Eero capabilities built in. Having multiple Eero routers on your network can help to eliminate dead spots throughout your home, ensuring you can maintain a fast and stable connection wherever you are in your house.</p>



<p>With a Eero Pro 7, you can achieve fast upload and download speeds, supporting internet plans of up to 5 Gbps when using either of the two auto-sensing 5 GbE ports. Wireless connections can reach speeds of up to 3.9 Gbps.</p>
<p>You can choose on the item page an option that comes with one free month of Eero Plus. This subscription grans you a slew of online security, privacy, and parental controls. After that first month, the price becomes $9.99 when using auto-renew.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s Sidekicks, the adorable little pets that accompany you on your Fortnite adventures, have caused quite a stir with Fortnite fans — and not necessarily for all the right reasons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As described by Epic Games, Sidekicks are new pals in Fortnite that join your adventures in Battle Royale, Fortnite Save the World, Fortnite Festival (your Sidekick will stay backstage), LEGO Fortnite, and developer-made experiences (Sidekicks can only tag along with you if the Island Developer has enabled Sidekicks in their island). They let you "enjoy their company as they react to the world around you." You can design them yourself, including their personality and physical traits, all of which will be locked in as "permanent" details, but you'll be able to change their name and accessories — think hats, hoodies, that kind of thing — at any time. And no, they do not offer a gameplay advantage of any kind, nor can be hurt or killed in combat. (Phew!)</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/31/fortnite-sidekicks-1761909420805.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite Sidekicks are here. Image credit: Epic Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first is Peels, the super sweet pup made of bananas, who'll unlock with tomorrow's (November 1) Battle Pass. More, including Bonesy, Spike, and Lil' Raptor, are set to drop on November 7, with something for cat lovers coming "not long after." Bonesy will be granted to players who own the Bonesy Back Bling on the same date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, so cute, right? The bit that's really raising eyebrows, however, is the cost. As shared on the Fortnite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1okk24y/sidekick_prices_have_been_revealed_and/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>subreddit</u></a>, prices will differ, with Lil' Raptor and Spike costing 1,200 V-Bucks, and Flopsticks and Cuddle Team Jr. a little more expensive at 1,500. As some are <a href="https://x.com/FortnitePV2/status/1984116283064119765" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointing out</u></a>, this is a pretty steep price for the new feature, with the Fishstick-themed Sidekick, Flopstick, costing more than the original 1,200 skin.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Bro… The Sidekick costs more than the original skin. <a href="https://t.co/HUi9oqa9N4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/HUi9oqa9N4</a></p>— Fortnite Leaks | Pluto V2 (@FortnitePV2) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortnitePV2/status/1984116283064119765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It gets even worse, though. Epic has cofirmed you can customize the appearance of your Sidekick one time and it's permanent (you can unlock clothes for them, though and can change those whenever you want). This means that if you want to change your pet's colors after making that initial, permanent one-time change, you have to buy the same pet again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can customize the Appearance of your Sidekick <strong>one time</strong> after obtaining it," <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/gameplay-c-202300000001721/how-do-i-customize-the-appearance-of-my-sidekick-a202300000021343" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epic said</a>. "You can purchase a Sidekick multiple times and give them different Appearances; however, each Sidekick customization you own in your Locker must be unique.

                <p>Akira Yamaoka, best known for his decades-spanning contributions to the Silent Hill series, is bringing his talents to an upcoming horror game from the creators of Turbo Overkill. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/total-chaos/" data-ref-id="5000-626760">Total Chaos</a> is scheduled to arrive later this year, and GameSpot can exclusively reveal both Yamaoka's involvement and his theme song for the game, "Catharsis." Listen to the song's world premiere below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guO_QkSFOTE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/guO_QkSFOTE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Total Chaos was born as a mod for Doom 2, <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/total-chaos" rel="nofollow ">originally released</a> in 2018. The forthcoming adaptation from Trigger Happy Interactive and Apogee Entertainment is a complete reimagining of that source material on a new engine. Yamaoka is working with the mod's original composer, Jason Dagenet, to bring the game's music to life. As any Silent Hill fan would know, the debut track definitely carries the composer's signature sound.</p><p>In the first-person horror game, players can expect to find the touchstones of the survival-horror genre, such as resource management, crafting survival equipment, and a parade of monsters that bring their own behaviors and attacks to worry about.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208350/Total_Chaos/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game's Steam page</a>, mysterious radio transmissions will guide the protagonist across the shifting locale of Fort Oasis, as the character sets out to confront his own "fractured past." It sounds like more than just the music will appeal to Silent Hill fans.</p><p>There's no announced release date for Total Chaos just yet, but players can expect to learn about that soon, as the game remains on track for a 2025 launch.</p>

            <p>Arc Raiders has surpassed a peak concurrent player count of 250,000 on Steam, only a day after its release. This makes it the most popular Steam release for a PvP extraction shooter to date.</p>
<p>The game in its opening hour<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-online-connection-error-launch-server-problem"> attracted over 130,000+ concurrent players yesterday</a>, itself an impressive figure for a new IP. It beats out the Steam release of games like <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2016590/charts/">Dark and Darker</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2507950/charts/">Delta Force</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2073620/charts/">Arena Breakout: Infinite</a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/594650/charts/">Hunt: Showdown 1886</a>. It is of course worth noting this doesn't take into account console users, nor games like Dark and Darker that released first on different PC clients.</p>
<p>This figure nonetheless sets the bar high for the upcoming Steam release of Escape from Tarkov, arguably the most popular extraction shooter, which is set to arrive as a major competitor to Arc Raiders on the 15th November.</p>

<p>With players flocking to the game, some interesting quirks are being discovered as of writing. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-arc-raiders-one-of-the-most-pleasant-multiplayer-shooter-experiences-on-the-market-early-adopters-seem-to-think-so">This includes the surprising level of kindness on display from random players found out in the world</a>, something that has caught many players off-guard.</p>
<p>If you've not had a chance to check out Arc Raiders yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">why not read Eurogamer's preview</a>, in which the game is described as: "Arc Raiders is, simply put, a third-person extraction shooter. It is a factory that mass produces tense moments, by its own nature a source of intense anxiety: high stakes, devastating losses, rapturous victories. Pulling back, it's a game of gradual self-refinement, both of your inventory full of resources and your characters abilities, and likewise your own know-how."</p>

            <p>
A question I often ask game developers when I've run out of real questions is: what was the hardest part of making your game? Which is a terrible line of inquiry, because it's like asking somebody with their foot in a hornet's nest which individual hornet they dislike the most. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> executive producer Aleksander Grøndal told me in a chat last week, "I can probably sit here and talk to you about all the problems we've had for hours on end, but yeah, game development is always tricky. That's what I can say. There's nothing that comes for free - everything is a constant struggle." 
</p>
<p>
Still, the question often gets an interesting response, because as readers of Alex Wiltshire's old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-mechanic">The Mechanic series</a> will know, big problems may necessitate inventive solutions. So, what has been the hardest part of making Arc Raiders? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-out-now-and-the-best-thing-about-it-so-far-is-bumsliding-through-a-buried-desert-city">Perfecting the slides</a>? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-wont-force-you-to-give-up-all-of-your-progression-via-mandatory-wipes-at-least-for-now">Avoiding mandatory player progression resets</a> from season to season? Dealing with reports about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">the game's generative AI usage</a>? According to Grøndal, it was trying to create an economy of loot and crafting materials - ranging from all-purpose Mechanical Components to rare or uncommon ingredients for specific guns, sometimes found in special <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-locations">field depots</a> - that isn't too "punishing" and which doesn't just feel like accumulating "cash value".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"The thing that we've probably spent the most time on was the meta game," he told me, in an interview last week shortly before the new shooter's release. "So like, the game economy, where all the different items that are available, what type of crafting you can do, and recipes, and making sure that we strike the right balance [so that] you don't feel too forced to doing crafting, but also giving items enough value so you want to seek out items in the world. Because if they just represent some sort of cash value to you, then everything just boils down to 'oh, I have this amount of cash value'. 
</p>
<p>
"Whereas when you start recognising items, that represents utility value for you," Grøndal went on. "If I collect these two items, I can actually go and craft the thing I want or need. Then, items in the world start getting more context value, and you start caring about collecting these items. 
</p><p>
"Striking the right balance between it feeling overly punishing, and getting it right where every item has a purpose, and if you choose to, you can, you can use that purpose over time - that was probably the thing we spent the absolute longest on," he added. "Multiple tests and rounds of feedback to strike that balance, until we feel like we have found, at least, a great starting point for it now, because these are economies that will continue to evolve over time, and we will keep adding things."
</p>
<p>
As a more specific example of how your relationship with items might change, Grøndal pointed to certain choicer, colour-coded objects you might discover during your initial forays. "In the beginning, you're finding fancy items that look expensive, but might actually have better utility if you break them down, to craft things that are more useful to you in the moment," he commented. "But eventually those items start having their own value, because there's other items that are dependent on them that you can start crafting. 
</p>
<p>
"And then I at least feel - and at least, that's the feedback we're hearing so far - that it changes and every item becomes interesting in its own way. It doesn't mean that you have to collect every single type of item - that's not the purpose, but at least you can be more deliberate about what items you choose to hunt for."
</p>
<p>
I'm frequently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dire-comedy-bloodsport-king-of-meat-should-have-been-called-king-of-meme">contemptuous</a> of games that hinge on the thrill of collecting stuff in order to enhance a character or loadout. I think that games driven by material acquisition and progression tend to be either worryingly compulsive - to the point that players are conditioned to bypass more intriguing parts of the game, as they strive to optimise their gear - or extremely boring (or both, as in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>). The restive, rummaging tedium of it all is worsened when the game in question is also a live service operation that profits by keeping you churning away at the gear or level-up treadmill.
</p><p>
At the same time, I think my apathy for such things lacks nuance. I sometimes disregard the cleverness of in-game economies and how they can be tuned to create specific moods, or support particular stories. To reach for an overfamiliar example of Doing It Right, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> games ravel together a whole mythology through their kit, and their levels are more fascinating for the cunning arrangement of trinkets, including what we might otherwise dismissively call "farming" opportunities. 
</p>
<p>
Arc Raiders is a very different kind of game, but Grøndal's remarks make me hopeful that it might conjure a similar mystique, perhaps in concert with Embark's unfolding of the game's backstory via narrative quests and codex entries, and specifically the origins of the marauding ARC robots.
</p>
<p>
"For the person who is willing to look, there's a lot of things in the world to observe, so there's a lot of environmental storytelling that you start puzzle things together and what's happening," Grøndal told me. "And again, this is just the start of the game - we have a pretty ambitious plan about how we want to continue telling the narrative, and evolving the game over time through different means."

              <p>Drone prices can really be all over the place, and that makes sense. If you’re just looking to have some fun in the park or your backyard, you can find a drone for under $50. They’re pretty much toys. For a few hundred, you can get a real hobbyist drone that gives you more range, durability, flight time, recording resolution, etc. Then there’s the professional tier, and that’s where this drone falls (or lands safely): The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5195/">DJI Air 3S drone combo pack (including a RC2 remote controller and three batteries)&nbsp; normally goes for $2,499 but following a 20% discount, it comes down by an even $500</a>. That brings the drone down to just $1,999 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5195/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This drone doesn’t just rely on you using your phone screen: It comes with its own <strong>dedicated controller featuring its own screen</strong> to view what your drone is seeing. The drone utilizes a dual-camera system which consists of a 1-inch CMOS 24mm 50MP wide angle camera along with a 1/1.3-inch CMOS 70mm 48MP medium telephoto camera. Between to tow of them, you can capture everything from beautiful, scenic landscapes to cinematic close-ups all from the skies. Video is capable of recording in up to 4K resolution at 60fps with HDR. You’re footage with be breathtaking.</p>
<p>The six-antenna array system is able to transmit the video down from the drone to your control panel, maintaining a live feed in 1080p at 60fps at up to a staggering 20 km away. The DJI Air 3S drone can keep up in the <strong>air for a long flight time of 45 minutes (and there are 3 batteries included)</strong>. That’s about a 48% increase over the previous model drone — the DJI Air 2S — so you can record stunning shots without worrying too much about battery life.</p>



<h2>Worry-Free Flying</h2>
<p>You can fly with confidence, staying in control, thanks to the drones omnidirectional obstacle sensing. The DJI Air 3S drone is able to intelligently navigate on its own back to it’s launch point passing through challenged environments like a tree-filled forest. Even if it’s dark outside, the forward-facing LiDAR can help maintain a clear path on its way back. Heck, even if access to GPS is lost, the drone memorizes it’s flight path so it can follow it back to its starting point without the need for GPS.</p>
<p>This bundle comes with a number of bonus gifts included with your DJI Air 3S drone. It comes with a 128GB microSD card, three flight batteries (allowing for up to 135 minutes total), a battery charging hub, a shoulder bag, photography backpack, three extra pairs of low-noise propellers, a gimbal protector, a cleaning kit, and even a drone landing pad</p>

		<p>I hope you’ve got a bowl of sweets ready to go by the front door and fend off sugar seeking children tonight, because the final (un)death throes of October are here for Halloween. If you’re expecting small, spookily dressed guests to come knocking, it’s going to make any concerted gaming sessions tonight a bit tricky to get into until they’ve all gone home.</p>
<p>To get into the mood, my gaming this week has been dominated by the dense Grand Strategy of Europa Universalis V, with a review for that later today, but there’s also been the odd game of Battlefield 6 in there as well. I’m not as vociferous about it, but having a battle pass, battle royale and more shoved into it has taken a little bit of the shine off. I can generally just go and play the modes I want and be unbothered by it.</p>

<p>As for everyone else, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played some Sweet Surrender and Painkiller for review, and returned to Atomfall for its second DLC and “complete edition” patch, which you’ll read about in a little while. There was also as some Alan Wake 2 and Ball x Pit for the sake of enjoyment.</p>
<p>The most football-y lad among us, <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Football Manager 26 and Umami for review. He has some good news and some bad news about the former of these, already sharing his thoughts on the game’s early access beta, which is laying the foundations for a bright new era, but maybe isn’t quite there yet.</p>


<p><strong>Miguel</strong> burst into the chat with a boisterous “oy whots all this then!!!” before more calmly informing us that he’s been playing Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, plus a new online shooter RPG called Duet Night Abyss. Then he’s also been dabbling in a little bit of Silent Hill f and Tekken 3.</p>
<p>While Miguel loved Ninja Gaiden 4, <strong>Ade’s</strong> found that “it’s good but the combat gets oddly grindy and repetitive after a while, so I’ve discovered I enjoy the game more in short doses. Shows you really can have too much of a good thing!”</p>
<p>While his opinions of Pokémon Legends: Z-A have remained “controversial” through his continued playtime – as in, he really likes it, and won’t apologise – Nic has broken out the Ring Fit Adventure ring to help get a little cardio in.</p>

<p><strong>Steven</strong> made what he claims to be a fatal mistake by installing PowerWash Simulator 2, “which has consumed my life much as the first one did, leaving a pile of recent purchases and other games struggling to get a look in…” Doesn’t sound particularly fatal to me, especially as he’s started playing Tormented Souls 2, and has plans for a bunch more indie horror games thihs weekend, “although a large part of it will see me meditatively soaping the filth from a range of imaginative objects and locations.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been playing Battlefield 6, having finally put the turgid single player campaign behind him, and been enjoying Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks “which, despite the 40K shenanigans, could be the best car combat I’ve played in many long years.”</p>
<p>And with <strong>Dom</strong> swanning off on holiday for half term, he remembered to pack his Switch 2, so he’s been playing&nbsp;Mario Kart World, Hyrule Warriors, Plants vs. Zombies, and Lumines Arise!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you all played?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sword-of-justice-platforms-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-sword-of-justice-on-playstation-5-or-xbox-series-x-s-all-sword-of-justice-platforms-explained.1340131/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sword of Justice is gearing up for a big global launch after achieving huge success in China, and we’ve got all the platform details for the game ahead of release.</p>



<p>The MMORPG offers an in-depth story to enjoy, alongside PvP access and in-depth NPCs powered by AI, and is looking to build on its success in China, where it achieved over four million players in its first month.</p>



<p>If you want to know what platforms you can play Sword of Justice on, we’ve got all the important details.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-sword-of-justice-on-playstation-5">Is Sword of Justice on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No console yet. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Sword of Justice is not available on PlayStation 5 and is exclusive to PC and mobile devices.</strong></p>



<p>Sword of Justice was initially released in China on PC and mobile devices, and the doors are now opening to the rest of the world. However, console players will not be able to jump into the adventure as there is no upcoming PlayStation 5 release or any news about a port.</p>



<p>Given MMO games are much more popular on PC than they are on console, this shouldn’t be too surprising.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-sword-of-justice-on-xbox-series-x-s">Is Sword of Justice on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Sword of Justice is not available on Xbox Series X|S as it is a title exclusive to PC and mobile devices.</strong></p>



<p>Initially released in China on those platforms, Sword of Justice is now launching for the rest of the world, but the door remains shut for those on console, including Xbox Series X|S, as there is no details on any release on the platform.</p>



<p>While that could change in future, it’s unlikely to be on the immediate agenda.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-sword-of-justice-come-to-ps5-or-xbox-series-x-s">Will Sword of Justice Come to PS5 or Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Sword of Justice could release on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S in the future, but this is not guaranteed, and any release will likely be a long way off.</strong></p>



<p>Opening the doors to the rest of the world in Sword of Justice is a big step and will require ongoing support to sustain the player base and ensure there are no major server issues. Perfecting the experience will be top of the agenda.</p>



<p>Whether the door opens to a console release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later down the line remains to be seen but, in truth, there isn’t too much of a need for the title to make the move, as it should achieve huge success on its current platform.</p>



<p>Games like Wuthering Waves have shown you don’t need to release on console, with PC and mobile both offering more than enough access to players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> players are trading theories about Easter Eggs and future updates after one fan discovered a mysterious hidden room in the firing range.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speculation about EA and Battlefield Studios’ secret room began after Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/hidden_room_in_the_shooting_range/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobile_Cyberdemon_as shared footage</a> of their character clipping into a previously undiscovered, hidden area. The unlit space is tucked behind the cramped weapon testing room, with only a sealed door — which features a red “keep door closed” sign — hinting at its existence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a few minutes of trying (and lots of awkward crouching) on PlayStation 5, we were able to recreate the moment seen in the clip and confirm the hidden Battlefield 6 room exists. We can also confirm this mysterious hiding spot is, unfortunately, pretty boring, as it only features little more than a workbench and an empty gun rack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s easy enough to see areas like this and assume they are simply unfinished assets left on the cutting room floor, but fans have other ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched just weeks ago, so there’s no telling what BF Studios could have had planned for this room when sneaking it behind the firing range. However, some details have given players more than enough ammunition to start crafting theories about what the hidden room was — and what it could be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Judging by the gates, it's a vehicle hangar in the works,” one <a href="https://x.com/youfi_7/status/1983986648217248180" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>fan theorized</u></a>. “I hope they eventually add a real shooting range, not just one room.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Battlefield 6 fans have also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/comment/nm7oq32/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>proposed theories related to a firing range expansion</u></a>, hoping that, if the hidden room wasn’t an official vehicle testing area, it could become one in the future. It’s an add-on the community has shown interest in for some time, as players spent the weeks since launch using precious helicopter and jet spawns just learning how to leave the ground.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another <a href="https://x.com/GhostofMahvel/status/1984023775466418583" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular theory suggests</a> the room could could have served as a slightly smaller firing range upgrade that allows players to quickly experiment with different weapons and attachments. Commenters have even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/comment/nm7pr1q/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toyed with the idea of bringing the flashlight attachment into the hidden room</a> to look for any Battlefield Easter Eggs BF Studios might have secretly placed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the ideas related to the Battlefield 6 mystery stem from desires players would like to see fulfilled. The firing range enigma could absolutely be an Easter Egg, unfinished feature, or future content update, but there’s also the possibility that players have been looking at the room long before Mobile_Cyberdemon_as made their discovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can see that stripey background in that customize weapon screen,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/comment/nm7ri9z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>popular fan theory said</u></a>. “I guess that's why the firing range loads so fast, because you're actually in it the whole time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's my assumption is when you're in the menus you're actually just in that room with your view locked to a UI and with different walls or areas serving as backdrops for certain screens in the menu system,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/comment/nm89lb1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player added</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">i think i did wrong <a href="https://t.co/RCoynmuMoM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/RCoynmuMoM</a></p>— Twenty (@TwentyFPS1) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwentyFPS1/status/1984001301789937936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">For now, the hidden firing range room doesn’t seem to be much more than an extra space to run around in.

<p>We may be into the final few months of 2025 already, but there is still a host of big releases coming up, including the global launch of the Chinese hit Sword of Justice—and we have all the release date details you need.</p>



<p>After achieving staggering success in China, where it became one of the highest-selling games, Sword of Justice is bringing the adventure to the rest of the world with a global launch across PC and mobile.</p>



<p>If you’ve got your eyes on Sword of Justice and want to know exactly when you can start playing, this guide has all the release date details.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-sword-of-justice-coming-out">When is Sword of Justice Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A new world awaits. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Sword of Justice is coming to PC and mobile devices on Friday, November 7, and is available for free, with monetization coming from optional cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>The game has already been a huge success in China, surpassing over 40 million players in the first month and more than 1.1 million pre-registrations on it’s first day, and anticipation for the global release is similarly high, with pre-registrations for the global launch being vast.</p>



<p>Offering over 100 hours of single-player story-driven content, with the outcome changing with your playstyle, a big lure of the game is AI-driven NPCs, expanding the dialogue options you will receive.</p>



<p>As ever, though, the exact time you can jump in depends on your location in the world, but we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-sword-of-justice-start-time">Do We Know The Sword of Justice Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Sword of Justice has a staggered release globally, releasing in the United States from 7:30 AM PT, and later in the morning elsewhere in the world.</strong></p>



<p>Theoretically, at least, this means that players in some locations, like Japan and Australia, will be able to jump into the game before others, but the game will launch for everyone in the morning of November 7 local time.</p>

            <p>Arc Raiders came out yesterday, and as such hordes of players have been jumping in and discovering the mysteries of this new extraction shooter. However, it turns out something truly special has been uncovered by Topside raiders: the literal power of friendship.</p>
<p>You see, Arc Raiders <em>is </em>a high-stakes game in which dying up on the surface will result in the loss of most of your inventory. As such, players have been busting out the emote wheel and microphone to talk down other raiders. There's nothing stopping you from extracting from a match together, after all. Why shoot someone if you don't need to?</p>
<p>These collaborators have been heading online and spreading the word on how nice people tend to be in Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1okh357/solos_has_been_very_friendly/">such as music streamer asymmetricalsoul</a> who managed to strike up a whole conversation with half a dozen solo players without a single hostile shot fired. Players have reported <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oklbo5/solo_playerbase_so_far_is_extremely_nice/">apologising for shooting at someone <em>actually works</em></a>, as does a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1okebnq/solo_experience_on_day1_was_incredibly_positive/">sking to team up for quests</a> out in the harsher environments of Arc Raiders.</p>

<p>In my own experience playing Arc Raiders… yeah people seem to be incredibly kind for the most part. I was looting the hospital in Buried City and found three other players hanging around just chatting. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">During the preview period</a>, I was able to bust out the flute and play a little song for a squad of enemy players without losing my head. So if you're in need of a reminder that human kindness does exist, strangely enough Arc Raiders may be a good place to find it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Horror fans are truly spoiled at the moment. Hot on the heels of the fantastic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/cronos-the-new-dawn-review/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/22/silent-hill-f-review/">Silent Hill f</a> we are now excitedly waiting for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/">the latest in Capcom’s legendary Resident Evil</a> series. But the wait shouldn’t be bereft of awesome horror games as indie developers are producing titles of superb quality. Recent classics like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/03/crow-country-review-scream-park-fun/">Crow Country</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">Hollowbody</a>, The Mute House, and Dead of Darkness are all great choices if you’ve not played them yet, but with Halloween tonight, we’re right in the middle of a flourish of horrifying highlights. So many games are coming out that I’m not going to be able to fully cover them with reviews so here’s what’s going to be keeping me busy in my personal gaming time over the next few weeks and months.</p>
<h2>Tormented Souls 2</h2>
<p>I’m working on a review for this sequel to the cult classic original, which launched last week. That game really captured the feel and challenge of survival horror whilst also adding some unique twists of its own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tormented Souls 2 - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4qstF5gZ-Zc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The second game continues this and adds an extra layer of polish on top. The combat remains refreshingly hard and the puzzles often require some lateral thinking whilst the narrative is dark and full of mystery. This is an easy recommend but my full review should be up next week.</p>

<h2>Painted in Blood</h2>
<p>Out now in Early Access, Painted in Blood offers a more action packed first person perspective and feels like the fusion of classic survival horror atmosphere and the Painkiller series. The clear Boomer Shooter influence makes this title stand out amongst the more traditional fixed camera games that populate this list and the look and feel of the game only cement this as a stand out title</p>
<p><iframe title="Painted In Blood - Early Access Launch Trailer (Steam)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XmSk5OtKHPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Silly Polly Beast</h2>
<p>Strange name aside, this recently released title has a striking visual style and unique identity, taking part through multiple camera perspective and playstyles. The titular Polly escapes from her orphanage prison and finds herself trapped in Hell. As she makes her way through she encounters many demons and otherworldy creatures who can be friend or foe whilst learning magic spells to unleash her full strength and potential.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Silly Polly Beast ► Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lBwVIzD5t40?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Flesh Made Fear</h2>
<p>One of two classic fixed camera angle survival horror games scheduled to release today, on Halloween itself, Flesh Made Fear brings grindhouse visuals and sensibilities to the genre.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Flesh Made Fear - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AxDBVgIlp44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The atmosphere reminds me of horror films like Night of the Living Dead as your group of special forces operatives find themselves stranded in the nightmarish Rotwood Forest in search of the sinister Victor Ripper, a mad scientist whose experiments have turned the town into a horrific mix of mutations and occult rituals. The demo for this showed a real understanding of the genre whilst promising some new twists and I’m excited to start it as soon as I can.</p>
<h2>Echoes of the Living</h2>
<p>The other Halloween release is a game I’ve been following for years since the first announcement and early demos. Echoes of the Living is a ridiculously polished looking project from a husband and wife dev team that absolutely nails the Resident Evil 2 vibe with alternating characters and routes through a city at the mercy of a zombie virus. This has been up there with the new Silent Hills and Resident Evils in my most wanted list and its upcoming release is a testament to the passion of indie developers in this genre.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Echoes Of The Living | Early Access Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ZYvJvttIG8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<hr>
<p>If this isn’t enough horror to tide you over, then the releases keep coming. While dates aren’t yet confirmed, the following games have demos or playtests to try out before adding them to your wishlist.</p>
<h2>Becrowned</h2>
<p>Becrowned is another game that I have been following closely for a while now, with each demo showcasing the progression of a title that promises a fusion of Silent Hill and Resident Evil. The most recent demo features the beginning of the game and offers a glimpse of the psychological horror it contains. The surreal and dream-like atmosphere sees your player character, Richard Torrance, venture through a range of locations in a purgatorial quest to unravel the nature of his imprisonment in such a nightmare.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="BECROWNED ► New Demo Release Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/19qxr_XnEJE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Pinnacle Point</h2>
<p>Like many other games in this list, Pinnacle Point takes clear inspiration from the two main survival horror juggernauts but also adds in some Alan Wake to the equation. You play as Aron, a troubled scientist returning to the location of a world changing experiment to find his brother who he left behind.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pinnacle Point - Gameplay Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RpaEkjQtcQQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The island of Pinnacle Point stays in Aron’s dreams and calls out to him, leading him into a world of twisted mutations and cosmic horror. Shadowy foes are protected by a radiation field that must be disrupted before they can be hurt, with the mechanic playing out similarly to the torch and gun approach of Alan Wake.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even this list isn’t exhaustive, with promising titles such as Kingdom of Night, SSR Wives: The Murder of My Winter Crush, Welcome to Doll Town, Wicked Seed, Shutter Story, Project Songbird, Withering Realms, and the recently announced Darkwood 2 all due over the next year or so. There’s almost certainly more titles that I’ve forgotten as the new golden age of indie horror continues to offer terrifying delights.</p>

            <p>Existing PC vampires of Seattle, you should now have access to the expanded wardrobe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> devs Paradox and The Chinese Room have rolled out for Halloween. The free update's fresh hairstyles, makeup styles, and eye colours were only on offer to folks who started fresh saves initially, something that it turns out wasn't intentional.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We apologise to our players that the new cosmetics in our Halloween Update only applied to new save files," reads an update from Paradox posted to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/532790/view/686362177252098193?l=english">Steam</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/554580174864384001/1115895131573342279/1433494423551086715">Discord</a>. "We have now fixed this, and you're free to see and apply all the new cosmetics in your current playthrough. This hotfix is now live for PC players. We will update our console version as soon as it passes all checks. Thank you."</p>
<p>The free Halloween update, deployed earlier this week, expands the base game's customisation options with 24 fresh ways to spice up your look. Eight new hairdos, eight new makeup styles (including the one below which makes you look like a superhero who's gotten really into My Chemical Romance), and eight new eye colours. You can also make your eyes bleed. It looks cool, but given a vampire's diet is also a bit like a regular person gluing sandwiches just below their eyebrows.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Outside of unlocking these cosmetics for all characters, the hotfix Paradox have delivered includes fixes for issues like save games incorrectly bypassing Steam's Cloud Sync via a quirk of running with admin privileges and some missing collision which could see you plummet out of the world.</p><p>In their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/532790/view/586156994614788155?l=english">initial post</a> upon releasing these Halloween cosmetics, the publisher confirmed they and developers The Chinese Room are looking into adding more appearance customisation options in future update. An FOV slider, "new save game options", and custom difficulty settings that'll include letting you only play Phyre’s side of the story during your second playthrough are also on the to-do list. </p>
<p>If you've not already done so, check out Dominic Tarason's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">Bloodlines 2 review</a>, and pour one out for Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt ahead of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-losing-a-drinking-buddy-as-spinoff-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-plans-server-shutdown">server shutdown in April next year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite announced that Sidekicks are coming next season, with the first drop in the upcoming Battle Pass followed by new additions to the Item Shop, but it appears they will have a heavy price.</p>



<p>Peels the banana dog will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured in The Simpsons-themed Battle Pass</a> from November 1, with subsequent releases including Lil’ Raptor, Spike, Flopsticks, Cuddle Team Jr, and Bonesy in the Item Shop from November 7.</p>



<p>Ahead of that launch, leakers have uncovered the prices for those in the Item Shop, and the hefty price point is causing a stir in the community.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-sidekicks-have-similar-prices-to-collab-skins">Fortnite Sidekicks Have Similar Prices to Collab Skins</h2>



<figure><figcaption>High price. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>As <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1984097137723109799/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked by ShiinaBR</a>, the prices for Sidekick in the Item Shop will range from 1,200 V-Bucks to 1,500 V-Bucks, the same price range that collab skins have in the shop.</p>



<p>Flopsticks, for example, is priced at 1,500 V-Bucks, a higher price than the 1,200 V-Bucks it costs for the original outfit, and the same price as the new Alien Xenomorph skin that released today.</p>



<p>The prices for the Sidekicks have attracted more controversy amid customization rules, which make some choices, like the color of a dog, permanent, and the same Sidekick will need to be purchased again to choose a different appearance. Styles, meanwhile, include clothing and similar items, which can be adjusted.</p>



<p>While Sidekicks could be included in the Battle Pass regularly moving forward, there is no guarantee this will happen, as the release of Kicks last year has been oriented around them being purchasable in the Item Shop and not as an earnable reward.</p>



<p>Prices could still be adjusted before release too, though usually leaks of this nature are accurate when it comes to upcoming releases.</p>

		<p>Chief Rebel has announced a small patch for its multiplayer online PvE dungeon game Fellowship, which addresses some issues raised in a previous patch and introduces some rebalances and fixes. The game will be down while the patch is applied. Fellowship is currently in early access on Steam, which the development team expect to last for around six months. The early access version of Fellowship has nine heroes to choose from and a selection of dungeons to fight through.</p>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/leaks_infinite/status/1983941972311339311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to leaker leaks_infinite</a>, Halo: Campaign Evolved is just the beginning of a series of remakes already in the works. Allegedly, the campaigns of the second and third game are also being remade and will support optional sprint, just like the remake of the first installment.</p>



<p>The reason for all these games to cut multiplayer from their respective remakes is that Halo Studios does not want to split the fan base across several multiplayer experiences. Because of this, Halo 7, which is also reportedly in development, will be the only one to offer multiplayer. The leaker wrote:</p>



<p><em>Halo Studios wants everyone to play Halo 7's MP, they don't want to create separate multiplayer experiences competing with each other. Which is why they aren't being remade individually. This is a big factor, especially because all these games will be launching on Playstation.</em></p>



<p>The leaker also clarified that the seventh mainline entry will have its own campaign, a sort of sequel to Infinite, but it's possible the multiplayer and campaign won't launch at the same time. They may even be separate, as already seen with Infinite, which offered a premium campaign and a free-to-play multiplayer.</p>



<p>Later, leaks_infinite wrote that it is unlikely Halo 7 will be the actual title, as it doesn't appear that the developers are inclined to return to numbered games. Allegedly, the development team formerly known as 343 Industries has more than four projects currently in the works.</p>



<p>It all starts with <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Campaign Evolved</a>, though. Due next year on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5 for the first time, it'll offer an Unreal Engine 5-powered remake of the series debut, not to mention optional sprint mechanics, new weapons, updated mechanics taken from the later games, and three new missions that will take place before the beginning of the original Halo: Combat Evolved.</p>



<p>A former designer of the 2001 original, Jaime Griesemer, has since <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-designer-likens-remake-to-dance-remix-classic-song-straight-to-chorus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavily criticized some of the planned</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-designer-likens-remake-to-dance-remix-classic-song-straight-to-chorus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders is the Latest Game to Turn Its Back on ‘Call of Duty Skins’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-call-of-duty-skins/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-is-the-latest-game-to-turn-its-back-on-%E2%80%98call-of-duty-skins%E2%80%99.1340092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has been released and is being enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of gamers worldwide. It’s a gritty, post-apocalyptic extraction shooter with a beautiful aesthetic, rooted in retro-futurism and boasting sumptuous, semi-open-world environments. It also has extensive customization options, including skin bundles and outfits.</p>



<p>That opens the door to potentially introducing some bizarre costumes, but Embark Studios has firmly shut down that suggestion. Following the reluctance of EA DICE to add kooky skins to Battlefield 6, Embark has stressed that ‘Call of Duty’ style skins won’t find their way into ARC Raiders.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-ridiculous-skin-packs-for-arc-raiders">No Ridiculous Skin Packs for ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>Call of Duty faces regular ridicule for the skins and outfit bundles it offers players everywhere. From Nicki Minaj to a literal pigeon, and from Beavis and Butthead to Wubz, Call of Duty has featured some borderline bizarre skins over the years.</p>



<p>One of the leading concerns from fans of Battlefield 6 was that EA DICE (and associated studios) would follow a similar monetization path in the newly released first-person shooter. For now, the team is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-skins-are-being-adjusted-after-community-backlash/">keeping the creativity confined</a> to mostly realistic outfits, but fans are skeptical whether it’ll stay that way forever.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/skins-cosmetics-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent interview</a>, Embark Studios confirmed that ARC Raiders will follow a similar operating model, with the team avoiding the addition of inane skins that don’t match the game’s vibe.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have. It will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction.</p>



<p>I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting that we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit, but we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes a Santa Claus. That’s not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that’s kind of the line you can draw.</p>



<p>I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don’t know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly – <strong>I don’t think the novelty is worth the trade</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Black Ops 7 will be released in just two weeks, and the stranger skins have already started stacking up for the game. It’s part and parcel of the Call of Duty ecosystem these days, but that doesn’t mean fans aren’t actively complaining about all the silly skins being added to the games.</p>



<p>Hopefully, games like Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders will steer clear of irrelevant crossovers and celebrity skins.</p>



<p>Do you want ARC Raiders to have any insane skin collaborations? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Triarchy Is an Open World Co-Op Action RPG with a Focus on Boss Fights and Sailing, and It’s Out in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/triarchy-open-world-coop-action-rpg-boss-fights-sailing-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/triarchy-is-an-open-world-co-op-action-rpg-with-a-focus-on-boss-fights-and-sailing-and-it%E2%80%99s-out-in-2026.1340089/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Independent studio Digital Confectioners has unveiled Triarchy, an upcoming open world co-op (up to three players) action RPG. Like most games in the genre, it will focus on boss fights, but it also supports sailing.</p>



<p>That makes sense after learning that the setting is a 'drowned world'. Players will hunt deadly bosses across the Isles, and the developers promise that each boss fight will feature unique attack patterns, multiple phases, and arena hazards that require precise timing, positioning, and teamwork to overcome.</p>



<p>Upon defeating a boss, you'll get rewards such as unique upgrade materials and boss-exclusive gear. Moreover, Triarchy not only allows boss 'rematches'; players may also find secret triggers to unlock more challenging difficulties. Challenge Mode bosses feature new abilities, attack patterns, and balance tuning. As you would expect, killing these bosses will provide even better rewards.</p>



<p>Defeating foes will also yield experience to level up and then unlock powerful abilities in the talent tree. That way, players can define their own unique playstyle. Triarchy does concentrate mostly on 'intentional' melee combat, at any rate. Fights hinge on stamina, poise breaks, and carefully timed dodges. Parry windows reward precision, but over-committing leaves the character vulnerable to counterattacks. A vast array of weapons, each with its own unique style and feel, will be available. Players can even mix them thanks to the freeform dual-wield system.</p>

Co-Op Action RPG — Triarchy" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jktHoTDguW8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The ship will function as a fully customizable and upgradeable floating base. Over time, players can upgrade their ship's hulls, sails, and other components to enhance speed and durability. The ship also houses the workbench and supplies for crafting, and there's even a map table to help with navigation.</p>



<p>The co-op functionality supports no tethering (players aren't forced to be close to one another), shared progress, scaling, and drop-in/drop-out. Triarchy is targeting a 2026 launch, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708040/Triarchy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Steam page</a> already includes the minimum requirements:</p>



<ul>
<li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>



<li>OS: Windows 10</li>



<li>Processor: Intel Core i3 8100 / AMD Ryzen 3 2300X</li>



<li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li>Graphics: Nvidia GTX1060 6GB / AMD Radeon RX580 8GB</li>



<li>DirectX: Version 12</li>



<li>Storage: 25 GB available space</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Halo 2 and 3 Campaign Remakes in Development, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/halo-2-and-3-campaign-remakes-development-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-2-and-3-campaign-remakes-in-development-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1340080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by a Halo leaker that both Halo 2 and Halo 3 are getting the remake treatment after Halo: Campaign Evolved drops. In a post on social media, ‘leaks_infinite’ claimed that a source informed them that both games are being remade and that they ‘will have sprint’.</p>



<p>It was also noted that the next Halo game to feature multiplayer will be Halo 7, but nothing more was shared on that front, aside from a note that the campaign and multiplayer will launch separately, as they did in Halo Infinite.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-halo-remakes-could-be-coming">More Halo Remakes Could Be Coming</h2>



<p>It was recently revealed by Halo Studios that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> is on the way. The news dropped as the Halo Championship Series came to a close for 2025, marking the end of Halo Infinite’s competitive lifecycle.</p>



<p>The team also revealed that, for the first time, Halo will come to PlayStation, with Campaign Evolved being released on PS5.</p>



<p>In a new post on social media, a Halo leaker has made a fresh claim that both Halo 2 and Halo 3 are being remade, but neither will have multiplayer. It’s a claim that has been met with disappointment by some, as Halo 3’s multiplayer is where many gamers were introduced to the series, being as it was one of the most popular games on Xbox 360.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Halo 2 &amp; Halo 3 are being remade, yes they will have sprint. No multiplayer, only campaign. Full remakes.<br>Multiplayer is going to be Halo 7. <a href="https://t.co/gD8DNKLT3V">pic.twitter.com/gD8DNKLT3V</a></p>— Halo Leaks (@leaks_infinite) <a href="https://twitter.com/leaks_infinite/status/1983941972311339311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The leaker then threw in a little conjecture, suggesting that Halo Studios will use the performance of Halo: Campaign Evolved to ‘judge whether a Halo 2 and 3 remake would be viable’, which is a fair comment.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that all planned remakes will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>



<p>Do you think Halo 2 and Halo 3 should be remade <strong>with </strong>multiplayer? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
