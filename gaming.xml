<section><p>I'm enjoying Death Stranding 2 so much more since I started skipping the plot.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I tried to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" data-ref-id="5000-577622">Death Stranding 2</a> the "right" way. For 12 hours, I had Sam hike all over Mexico and Australia delivering packages and battling brigands, and I watched every cutscene as I went. And despite being once again enamored with the moment-to-moment experience of being a porter in Death Stranding--it genuinely may be my favorite gameplay loop ever--I was having a bad time because I couldn't find any rhythm to the experience. The problem, as it was with the first game, is that Death Stranding 2 is full of cutscenes that are unnecessarily long, very poorly written, and don't fit together into any legitimate greater context.</p><p dir="ltr">And there are a lot of them. So many that I wasn't able to get into the flow of the gameplay experience. I'd have a great time walking around delivering stuff for an hour, then watch a 15-minute cutscene that sucked out all my energy, and then turn the game off because I needed a nap. Since I'd <em>really</em> been looking forward to playing Death Stranding 2, I was starting to find it disappointing, even though I was actually massively enjoying the "play" side of it.</p><p dir="ltr">My last straw was the introduction of the character called Rainy. Her first scene is a lengthy dance number in the rain that Sam watches. Her second scene is a tearful reunion with Sam's friends, who all apparently know Rainy very well even though none of them had ever mentioned her before. It isn't until her third scene that anyone tells Sam who Rainy is. But even then, her introduction doesn't matter--nothing about the gameplay experience changes at all as a result of meeting her, even though she's another magic person. These scenes look nice--very "cinematic," as it were--but they're completely devoid of substance or content. I was being forced to take breaks from the parts of the game I actually enjoyed so that I could watch some self-indulgent nonsense that I found incredibly grating.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4524513-deathstranding2_onthebeach-finaltrailer_ps5games4-10screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524513" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4524513-deathstranding2_onthebeach-finaltrailer_ps5games4-10screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524513"></a><figcaption>Our first look at Rainy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4524513-deathstranding2_onthebeach-finaltrailer_ps5games4-10screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">So I tried something radical, something I have never done on my first playthroughs of any of the previous games designed by Hideo Kojima: I started skipping the cutscenes. I did it hesitantly at first, concerned that I might miss out on some important piece of lore or plot. I figured I'd use this power sparingly, only when a scene was overly long and not apparently going anywhere. But that cautious approach didn't last long. Within an hour of making that decision, I was skipping every cutscene as soon as it started.</p><p dir="ltr">Something funny happened after that: I played Death Stranding 2 for six straight hours. I was suddenly free to enjoy the parts I like without having to sit through the noise of the story. I no longer had to devote any brainpower toward trying to figure out how the latest nonsensical plot point makes sense next to the previous one. I could get back to the simple pleasures of walking around delivering packages and building infrastructure.</p><p dir="ltr">The goofy thing is that I knew it would go this way. I won't pretend that I expected Death Stranding 2's storytelling to be anything better than abysmal, but when I first booted it up, I did plan to watch all the cutscenes anyway. It was more for the sake of fairness than anything else--maybe this would be the one where Kojima's writing finally clicked for me. I had to give it a fair shot.</p><p dir="ltr">Up to now, I'd always been able to power through his games. I sat through every post-credits scene in MGS4, trudged all the way to the "we ran out of money" twist ending of MGSV, and I made it through the movie-length final cutscenes of the first Death Stranding in one sitting. I hated every second of it, but I did my due diligence. But I'm 38 years old now, and I no longer have the patience for all that.</p><p dir="ltr">And, to be completely honest, this is a lesson I should have already learned from the first Death Stranding. While I did watch all the cutscenes in the first game when I ran through it the first time, I later came back and played it through twice while skipping them all, saving <a href="https://youtu.be/HfrCcKDzOow?si=m0rXyVRkNhDmRydV" rel="nofollow ">11 hours</a> of my time in the process. I already had the blueprint to happiness, but I didn't want to take for granted that Death Stranding 2's story would be just as irritating and nonsensical as its predecessor's. I wanted to believe in Kojima the writer as much as I believe in Kojima the designer.</p><p dir="ltr">That hope is completely gone now, though, and that honestly makes me glad. Now that I'm free from any obligation to care about the cutscenes, I'm going to have the best possible time with the rest of Death Stranding 2.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tag-team-board-game-brings-co-op-arcade-brawler-fun-to-table</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hachette Boardgames USA has announced its <em>Tag Team</em> board game. This nostalgic board game, which will be featured at this year's Gen Con, is all about capturing the atmosphere and thrill of an old-school arcade brawler.</p>

<h2>The Tag Team Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a report <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/59938/hachette-boardgames-announces-tag-team" rel="nofollow">from ICV2</a>, the <em>Tag Team</em> board game is designed by Gricha German and Corentin Labrat. German's design credits include <em>Biomos</em>, the cozy puzzle game about biodiversity, and the bus route party game, <em>City Tour</em>. Labrat's body of work includes <em>Arkeis</em>, a story-driven narrative game set in a steampunk take on Ancient Egypt.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tag-team-board-game-card-artwork.jpg?itok=TdkhN_jV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tag-team-board-game-card-artwork.jpg?itok=fsvnimc8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the game, two players create a team of two fighters, represented by a deck of cards. Each deck starts with two cards, but as the game progresses, players will build the deck. These cards synergize with each fighter's special attacks and techniques for powerful combo attacks.</p>

<p>The <em>Tag Team</em> board game is an autobattler. Players select cards and flip them face-up one at a time, applying the card's effect. At the end of each round, you can reprogram your deck by strategically adding new cards without changing the order. If you can outthink your opponent by playing around, or perhaps doubling down, on your prior strategy, you can win.</p>

<p>Hachette Boardgames USA has a solid catalog of titles under its umbrella. Its work includes the Ancient Greek tile placement game, <em>Akropolis</em>, the party deduction game, <em>Decrypto</em>, and some acclaimed licensed work, including an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-cells" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dead Cells</em></a> board game, based on the indie game by Motion Twin, and an adaptation of <em>Gwent</em> from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/witcher" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you are attending this year's Gen Con, you can pick up a copy of the <em>Tag Team</em> board game at Hachette Boardgames USA's booth. Otherwise, the game is available for pre-order. The game is being sold at an MSRP of $24.99 and is set for a retail release this September.</p>

                <p>Steam Deck, Windows handheld, and Nintendo Switch users have no shortage of USB-C docks to choose from, but one of the coolest options we've seen is currently <strong>on sale for only $25 (was $50)</strong> at Amazon. If you love retro Nintendo games, check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GuliKit-Docking-Station-Switch-Charging/dp/B0D12N6PGK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GuliKit's 7-in-1 Docking Station</a> that pays homage to the Super Nintendo. Unsurprisingly, this SNES-inspired USB-C dock isn't officially licensed by Nintendo, but it captures the style and color scheme of the legendary 16-bit console rather well.</p><p>To get this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">early Prime Day deal</a>, you need to <strong>check the 50% off coupon box below the price</strong> on the store page or click "clip coupon" after adding it to your cart.

Along with the USB-C port for power delivery, you'll find three USB 3.0 ports on the back. The included USB-C adapter can deliver up to 100 watts of power to your handheld and tablet devices.</p><p>Naturally, the dock is smaller than an actual SNES console. At 6.4 x 5.1 x 2 inches, GuliKit's docking station is slightly larger than the SNES Mini.</p><p>As shown in the image above, the dock has a removable cover designed to resemble the Super Nintendo's cartridge deck. You can slide the cover to adjust the dock's angle and the width of the stand. GuliKit says the stand is thick enough for most grip cases. If you remove the cover and flip it over, you'll find four microSD storage slots.</p><p>This is a versatile, multiplatform dock with support for Steam Deck OLED and LCD models, Nintendo Switch consoles, and Windows handheld PCs like the Asus ROG Ally and Ayaneo devices. It's not compatible with Switch 2, but it's worth noting that virtually every notable docking station for handheld gaming is incompatible with Switch 2. This is because the console needs to draw 20 volts of power to switch to TV mode, and 15 volts has been the standard.</p><p>It's also worth noting that like many docks, this one is designed to connect to a USB-C port on the top of the handheld. The original Switch and Switch OLED only have a single USB-C port on the bottom. This means you'll need to flip the console upside down to dock it, if you choose to use it as a Switch dock.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4524477-gulikitsnes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524477" data-ratio="0.62098138747885" data-width="1182" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4524477-gulikitsnes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524477"></a><figcaption>GuliKit's USB-C dock has three USB ports on the back for peripherals.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4524477-gulikitsnes.png"></figure><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-criterion-collection-best-movie-deals-amazon-blu-ray-sale/1100-6532794/">The Criterion Collection 50% Off Movie Sale - Here Are The Best Deals</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-preorder-guide-amazon-exclusive-edition-bonuses-release-date/1100-6532712/">Little Nightmares 3 Amazon-Exclusive Mirror Edition Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legos-first-visual-history-for-adults-is-60-off-in-early-prime-day-deal/1100-6532717/">Lego's First Visual History For Adults Is 60% Off In Early Prime Day Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-earth-dancer-limited-edition-nintendo-switch-2-restock/1100-6526172/">Amazon Restocks Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma Earth Dancer Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-four-discontinued-donkey-kong-lego-sets-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6532560/">All Four Discontinued Donkey Kong Lego Sets Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-collector-edition-launch-buying-guide/1100-6530003/">Death Stranding 2 Collector's Edition Is In Stock Ahead Of Tomorrow's Launch</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530595/">Donkey Kong Bananza Game &amp; Amiibo Bundle Available At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>Mintrocket "didn't apply" for controversial Best Independent Game nom</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Dave the Diver" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30cf0aaf5317d/dave-the-diver.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDhhP5MwL6Q&amp;ab_channel=MINTROCKET">Nexon</a></em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> is undoubtedly one of the best games of 2023, but it found itself caught in a bit of a storm during awards season as at The Game Awards of that year, the fantastic diving game and restaurant management sim <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/11/is-dave-the-diver-an-indie-game-the-game-awards-host-weighs-in">was nominated for Best Independent Game</a>, despite it being created by a subsidiary of the huge South Korean developer and publisher Nexon.</p>
<p>Now Mintrocket CEO and writer and director on the game, Jaeho Hwang, has directly addressed the controversy in an interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/">4Gamer</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dave-the-diver-director-addresses-controversial-best-indie-game-nomination-from-2023-theres-nothing-indie-about-us-we-didnt-apply-for-it/">Automaton Media</a>), stating that "it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves."</p>
<p>Hwang emphasises that the nominees for Best Independent Game are picked based on nomination system that developers cannot nominate themselves for. <a href="https://thegameawards.com/faq">The Game Awards</a> website states that all nominees, regardless of categories, are "chosen by an international jury of over 100 global media and influencer outlets, selected for their history of critical video game evaluation", with specialised juries set up for particular categories.</p>
<p>"We did not intend for it to have an indie game feel" Hwang tells the publication, saying that "it's made by Nexon, so there's nothing indie about it".</p>
<p>"I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique." It is, admittedly, pretty hard to put Dave The Diver in a labelled box like many other games, but just because something uses pixel art and has a completely unique premise and gameplay loop, doesn't mean it's independent.</p>

<p>Back when the discussion was rumbling, The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/11/is-dave-the-diver-an-indie-game-the-game-awards-host-weighs-in">shared his thoughts on the controversy</a> during a Twitch stream, where he said "independent can mean different things to different people," and that "we defer to our jury" on making those judgments. He did acknowledge that the studio itself comes from a "larger entity" but was (probably) created with a "relatively small budget".</p>
<p>All we'll say is that Dave The Diver is a fantastic game, and we loved it back on Switch. And we may well be revisiting it again soon as Mintrocket has confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/dave-the-diver-is-getting-a-free-switch-2-upgrade-soon-says-mintrocket">the game is getting a free Switch 2 update "soon"</a>. It's also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-dlc-swims-onto-switch-in-late-2025">getting some DLC</a>, but that's recently been delayed to 2026.</p>

The publisher was believed to be Square Enix, and fans speculated that the project in question was a sequel to <em>Outriders</em>, a surprisingly good 2021 loot shooter. According to new reporting, Gemini was indeed<em> Outriders 2</em> and the recording of motion capture for the game’s sci-fi story was underway when it was canned. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196452,195905" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>News first came by way of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thethumbwars.com/outriders-2-revealed-to-be-one-of-people-can-flys-two-canceled-games-exclusive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thethumbwars.com/outriders-2-revealed-to-be-one-of-people-can-flys-two-canceled-games-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>TheThumbWars</em></a></span> which reported that the sequel was “nearly finished” before it was put on ice over disputes with Square Enix.

According to <em>TheThumbWars</em>, the project’s developers didn’t really know about the publisher’s issues until it was being shelved. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/outriders-the-kotaku-review-1846651042&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/outriders-the-kotaku-review-1846651042">The first <em>Outriders</em></a></span><em> </em>was a grim shooter about settlers on an alien planet who develop mysterious mutations and go to war with one another. It was a bit like <em>Borderlands</em> through the lens of <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, with third-person combat that revolved around gear drops and magic powers. It had the whiff of a live-service grind which repelled some players at launch and left others feeling like its endgame was a bit light on repayable content, but it offered a decent multiplayer story campaign elevated by some of the most fun I’ve had with third-person shooting in a long time. </p><p>It was the type of AA-going-on-AAA franchise that deserved a second shot to see how it could grow and where the developers might take the formula next, especially if it was free of having to disguise itself as a live-service shooter to convince a publisher to greenlight it in the heyday of <em>Destiny 2</em>. It’s unclear if there’s still an outside chance <em>Outriders 2</em> could eventually see the light of day under a new publisher, but that seems unlikely. Square Enix is currently in the midst of a three-year plan to double down on its biggest franchises and pull back from riskier outside bets.

            <title><![CDATA[An In-Depth Examination Of Death Stranding 2’s Shower Handles]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-shower-handles</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/an-in-depth-examination-of-death-stranding-2%E2%80%99s-shower-handles.1233345/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To play a Hideo Kojima game is to be assaulted by “design” at every moment. Often, this expresses itself in an unparalleled love and commitment to some of the sickest mechanical design you have ever seen. Intermittently, it feels superfluous and impractical, a bit like a Hypebeast-y affect. Both of these realities are contained within <em>Death Stranding</em>’s shower handles, which look sick as hell and which I am almost positive would suck to use.&nbsp;</p><p>Before I continue I would like to stress that I am aware of the absurdity of critiquing the shower handles in a game haunted by oil ghosts. That said, I have an immense love for a good shower handle. Finding the perfect water temperature is important, and doing it with a bad shower handle can feel like cracking a safe. It may seem frivolous, but I’m the kind of person who loves a durable, sleek, solid-feeling physical interface, be it a knob, lever, potentiometer, slider, or switch.</p><p>To Kojima Productions’ credit, the shower handles in <em>Death Stranding 1</em> and <em>2</em> look fun to switch. They appear to be rocker switches: long, binary on/off switches labeled H and C. This has not changed between the two games as far as I can tell, but the gusto with which Sam slams the H handle in <em>2</em> (<em>UPDATE: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1loag6o/cool_detail_i_found_sam_will_have_hot_or_cold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to a poster on Reddit</a> Sam sometimes hits the cold switch depending on your location</em>) is far more robust. The camera locks in on it, and it hits with a satisfying “ker-chunk.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="DEATH STRANDING DIRECTOR'S CUT All Cutscenes (Full Game Movie) 4K Ultra HD" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HfrCcKDzOow?start=4087&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>(The shower in<em> Death Stranding</em> is seen here for the first time at 1:08:18)</strong></p><p>This is sick as fuck and would drive me insane if I ever encountered it. This is because its design appears to be binary. There are precisely four settings for the shower: off, cold, warm, and hot. This is less than ideal as far as showering is concerned. It’s possible that finer adjustments are feasible and Sam just likes using scalding hot water, which would be in keeping with his character. But these temperature settings are not ideal for everyone in this world.</p><figure><figcaption>Tough day. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>I attempted to find out if there were extended lore conversations in either game about the nature of the handles or the shower itself, but could find nothing save for explanations about how the combination shower/toilet ambiently extracts Chiral crystals. If such a conversation does exist, I imagine it sounds like this:</p><p>Deadman: “[Bedeleebeep] Sam, your shower is equipped with Chiral empathy sensors that preemptively scan your α brain waves to maximize aquatic relaxation while cleaning. No need to make finite adjustments. Just keep that in mind when getting squeaky clean.”</p><p>But I would like to give Kojima Productions credit for a massive quality of life improvement, by moving the combination shower/toilet out of Sam’s room. I don’t agree with combining them to begin with, but having the shower in the bedroom was clearly having negative consequences on Sam’s mental state, as is evidenced by the sheer number of traumatic cutscenes that occurred in that shower.&nbsp;</p><p>The graver sin, however, was that its placement was kind of corny. If you’ve ever been in an upscale hotel, there’s a chance you have stumbled on one of the worst fancy hotel tropes: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/10/27/hotels-bathrooms-doors-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the shower with a window that lets you see your roommate bathe</a>. This has always felt bizarrely intrusive while masquerading as cool, a solution to a problem that nobody had. Thankfully, Sam’s accommodations have been upgraded, but the shower handles still feel indebted to this impulse. It’s a design that you’d see in a high end hotel that would initially seem cool but would be wildly impractical if you actually had to use it.</p><figure><figcaption>This thing looks sick as hell to drive and if you crashed you would break every bone in your body. <strong>Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment</strong></figcaption></figure><p>A big part of designing a sci-fi world that’s engaging is novelty. Often this leads to making machines that are wildly impractical. <em>Death Stranding 2</em>’s three-wheeled Tricruiser is sick as hell but realistically looks like if you redesigned a slingshot to kill its driver instantly in any collision. A sky monorail where the driver hangs on the front is not a practical way to move freight, and yet I’m amused by it. But occasionally you’ll hit a choice that feels too tony, a future cobbled together from products found in fancy hotels and boutiques. It is in these moments where the universe of <em>Death Stranding</em> feels less like a realized world and more like a collection of influential friends and products that would look beautiful on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>A reward for one of your missions is a pair of Gentle Monster sunglasses, a Korean eyewear brand. Kojima loves brands. <strong>Credit: <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a></strong></figcaption></figure><p>In the grand scheme of things, there are more important things to focus on in these games than the shower handles. But that said, if I came home from a long day Portering, I’d prefer the tried and tested practicality of some knobs.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-battlefront-2-kyber-resurgence-day"><h3>Star Wars Battlefront 2 Is More Popular Than Ever Thanks To A Dedicated Fan Community</h3></a><p>How Star Wars Battlefront 2’s custom server and mod community supported the game’s player surge</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-dot-esports-escapist-sale"><h3>Gamurs Has Been Selling Off Sites</h3></a><p>In June, the network sold both Dot Esports and The Escapist</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-season-3-hwang-jun-ho"><h3>Squid Game Season 3’s Hwang Jun-ho Storyline Sucked</h3></a><p>I’m just happy I don’t have to see actor Wi Ha-joon putz around on that damn boat anymore

<p>"Bump to the bump to the Bumble"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="Buck Bumble" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5128cf7379ad5/buck-bumble.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Argonaut Games may be basking in the aftermath of the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos">Croc</a>, but the British-based developer isn't done revisiting its back-catalogue just yet. The newly-revived studio, who returned last year after being dissolved in 2007, are particularly keen to revisit an N64 cult classic: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/buck_bumble">Buck Bumble</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking in the latest issue of the <a href="https://mcvuk.com/">MCV Develop</a> magazine (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/croc-studio-argonaut-wants-to-remaster-cult-n64-shooter-buck-bumble/">VGC</a>), CEO and co-founder Jez San and Mike Arkin listed off a handful of titles the team, originally called Argonaut Software, worked on during its initial stint — Starglider ("it's my ‘first-born’" San explains) and I-Ninja both came up, but a certain third-person shooter stuck out to us, and others, the most.</p>
<p>“I-Ninja is a really well-regarded and underappreciated game and we’d love to revisit it. Buck Bumble too, but that was N64-only so less people know about it." San continues, reminiscing about the studio's output.</p>
<p>The reason Croc was chosen first was pretty obvious — it sold over 3 million copies when it launched on PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1997 as it was "the first big platformer on the original <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/playstation/" title="Platforms > PlayStation [10,845 articles]">PlayStation</a> console".</p>
<p>"It’s also got broad appeal, both to men and women. Croc really appealed to everyone. It was the obvious choice." Concludes San, before Arkin jumps in to add yet another mention of the gun-wielding bee: "But we also hope that Buck Bumble will also have his day in the sun, eventually."</p>
<p>Buck Bumble is a curious little game that launched in 1998 on the N64 only. Taking place in the surrounding area of a then-futuristic London (2010... yes, really), you play a bee who has voluntarily been implanted with cyborg technology.</p>

<p>You need to save the world from a group of genetically-enhanced insects called the Herd using various weapons such as a laser, a stun gun, and a guided missile. With 19 missions to blast your way through, a multiplayer mode, and gameplay designed with the Rumble Pak in mind, it's a unique game from the N64's life.</p>
<p>Oh, and the music is fantastic — it's all speed garage, and all composed by Justin Scharvona, who posted the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/033jTd9jqRN9mwuiJsKwwg">soundtrack on streaming services last year</a>. Ahh, memories...</p>
<p>But we might be waiting for a while to see the return of Buck Bumble, as it sounds like the next obvious step for Argonaut Games is, well, <em>extremely</em> obvious: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/croc_2">Croc 2</a>.</p>
<p>"We’ve made no secret of the fact that if Croc does well in the market that the obvious next project is to remaster Croc 2," Arkin states, revealing that the team is already in the early stages of bringing the sequel back. Bear in mind, though, that the team has only done some early R&amp;D to "validate our approach" and it still needs the greenlight from the financial side.</p>
<p>So, we'll have to wait and see. You'll need to pick up a copy of the MVC Develop magazine yourself to check out the whole interview, but Buck Bumble is remembered fondly in Argonaut's mind.</p>

                <p>Jean Grey aka Phoenix has been rumored to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a> bound for a while, and now it's official. NetEase has confirmed that Phoenix will arrive in Marvel Rivals Season 3 alongside Blade, the popular vampire hunter. But their mutual enemy won't be Dracula or any of the undead. Instead, the heroes of Marvel Rivals will be going up against one of Venom's deadliest foes: Knull, the King in Black and the God of Symbiotes.</p><p>Season 3 is subtitled "The Abyss Awakens," and it's going to launch on July 11. Phoenix will be joining the roster right away, and she will be classified as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-duelist-dps-heroes/2900-6105/" data-ref-id="2900-6105">Duelist</a>. Even without the Phoenix Force, Jean is an immensely powerful telepath and telekinetic mutant. With the Phoenix at her command, Jean is fire and life incarnate, and imbued with the power of creation itself.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals - Season 3: The Abyss Awakens Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Marvel Rivals' new map, Klyntar: Celestial Husk, as a link to the Guardians of the Galaxy's favorite hangout, Knowhere. The entirety of Knowhere was constructed inside the severed head of a dead Celestial. The Celestial Husk is the rest of that Celestial's body.</p><p>In the Marvel Universe, Klyntar was believed to be the homeworld of the Symbiotes. Instead, it turned out to be the place where they imprisoned Knull eons ago. Once Knull is free, he can reclaim control of the Symbiotes and unleash mayhem in the universe.</p><p>Blade is being held back for the second half of Season 3 alongside a new competitive mode, but in the meantime there will be new features, a battle pass, system updates, and four new Team-ups. NetEase is overhauling Marvel Rivals' mission system and adding a new layer of customization to the accessories system.</p><p>NetEase is also offering verified university students free access to costume trials that will rotate each season. For now, this offer is limited to the US, the UK, and a few other places, but more regions will be added later. And going forward, Marvel Rivals will launch a new season every two months.</p><p>Fans heading to San Diego Comic-Con later this month will be able to visit the Marvel Rivals experience at the Marriott Marquis from Thursday, July 24 to Sunday, July 27. On Friday, July 25, Comic-Con will host the Marvel Rivals: Hero Creation from Concept to Showcase panel, with guests, start time, and location to be announced.</p><p>This fall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-a-deeper-look-marvel-rivals-visual-style-with-this-new-art-book/1100-6531342/" data-ref-id="1100-6531342">The Art of Marvel Rivals</a> will give fans a behind-the-scenes peak at the creation of the game's character designs and locations. One of the most recent additions to the game's lineup, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-adds-ultron-to-the-lineup-in-season-2-5/1100-6531758/" data-ref-id="1100-6531758">Ultron</a>, wasn't announced when Season 2 began. It stands to reason there may be more surprise characters in Season 3 as well.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s new expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-release-date-revealed/1100-6531335/" data-ref-id="1100-6531335">The Edge of Fate</a>, is bringing a whole lot of new gear and activities, along with quality-of-life improvements to how you'll actually play and earn all that stuff. One big change is coming to how you'll earn the new Exotic armors coming to the expansion, at least for a little while, thanks to a new destination activity coming with the expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">During its Edge of Fate livestream on July 1, Destiny 2 assistant game director Robbie Stevens mentioned--in pretty vague terms--a new three-player, matchmade destination activity that'll be available in the game's new location, Kepler. Stevens didn't name the activity, instead saying Bungie had hoped its arrival would "surprise and delight" players, but did give a few details about what it'll be like and how it'll work. Most notably, the new activity will offer an opportunity to earn new versions of the new Exotic armor items you can get from completing the expansion's Legendary campaign.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That makes the Kepler activity a reliable way to get specific Exotics, something that has been rare in Destiny 2. Earning the Exotics from the destination activity will give you a chance to grab copies with different distributions of stats, which can be necessary for players looking to perfect their character loadouts. It sounds like you'll still need to complete the expansion's Legendary campaign to get the chance at these additional copies, however.</p><p dir="ltr">Stevens shared a few other details about the new activity as well. While he said it'll be a unique activity, he also likened it to multi-stage destination activities like Wellspring in Savathun's Throne World and Vex Incursion in Neomuna. Both those activities see players fighting hordes at different points around the destination map. According to Stevens, the Kepler activity is "horde mode-inspired," but it'll also have mechanical elements and boss encounters. The activity will also make use of Kepler's new destination abilities. Those include Matterspark, which lets you turn into a ball of Arc energy, Mattermorph, which allows you to use dark matter to move certain objects around, creating pathways and platforms, and Relocator, a big gun that lets you take over Fallen teleporters for your own ends.</p><p dir="ltr">Notably, the Kepler activity is also "technically time-limited," Stevens said. A node will appear on the Kepler destination map to inform players of when the activity will be available so they can farm it, which makes it sound like it'll potentially run for short periods of time before going away, and then coming back again. Stevens said the activity is connected to the story campaign that takes place on Kepler--specifically toward its end--which gives the impression that it won't be available until sometime after the launch of The Edge of Fate, so that players have time to work through the story before jumping into it.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out other details from the Edge of Fate livestream, including info about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-raid-race-start-date-duration-and-epic-raid-details/1100-6532888/" data-ref-id="1100-6532888">Destiny 2's next raid race</a> and a look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-break-the-new-destiny-2-expansion-but-bungie-wants-you-to/1100-6532890/" data-ref-id="1100-6532890">how Matterspark will let you sequence break puzzles</a>.</p>

The only thing that could make the Bramble Blast sighting even better is if <em>DKC2</em>'s other brambly stages, Bramble Scramble and Screech’s Sprint, have secret homages tucked away in the game as well.</p><p>The <em>DKC2</em> levels were magical but also got progressively more punishing, with extended sections where players have to navigate between hazardous brush by hanging onto the parrot Squawks, whose fluttering can feel imprecise and hard to control. It was sort of like a precursor to <em>Flappy Bird</em>, though with mixes of enemies and barrels thrown in, and a soundtrack that helped players keep their sanity no matter how many times they died. The original <em>Donkey Kong Country </em>had nothing like it, and it turns out that none of the subsequent <em>Donkey Kong</em> games would either, though the song did appear in <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em>. </p><p>While the “Stickerbush Symphony”/Bramble Blast mashup carried over to <em>Donkey Kong Land 2 </em>on Game Boy and <em>Donkey Kong Country 2</em>'s<em>&nbsp;</em>GBA port, the Bramble motifs didn’t return in <em>Donkey Kong 64 </em>or the character’s subsequent 2D spin-off, <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>. That game’s follow-up, <em>Tropical Freeze</em>, did have a remix of “Stickerbrush Symphony” and a level called Bramble Scramble, but the two elements were separated from each other. The song appeared in the beginning of the level  Twilight Terror instead, with a jazz version buried in the end credits. Now they’re back together, and the new cover sounds great.</p><p>“Not to bash the <em>Brawl </em>and <em>Tropical Freeze </em>versions, but it’s nice we are finally getting a remix of the song that sounds like the original,” wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1lp2xla/the_bramble_scramble_inspired_challenge_level_in/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1lp2xla/the_bramble_scramble_inspired_challenge_level_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan on Reddit</a></span>. “<em>Tropical Freeze</em>’s biggest miss,” wrote another. “Had a bramble level, had Stickerbush Symphony, didn’t put the thing in the thing.” At long last, <em>Bananza</em> does. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-stickerbush-symphony-bramble-blast-1851785457]]></content:encoded>

But this isn’t just any old mansion. Something terrible happened here, and the only way to find out more is to solve escape-room-style puzzles and sift through videos and footage you find within its walls. As you make your way through the mansion, you’ll find videos of actors Vinny Monroe (Starr) and Chase Lowry (Newbon), who are both shown portraying a character named Willie in the footage. These videos will be broken up and out of order, so a key part of solving the game’s many mysteries is finding them on flash drives throughout the mansion and splicing them together.

                <p>The difference between real and generated frames is a hotly contested topic, especially when it comes to their prevalence in PC gaming. Nvidia and AMD have made big improvements to their own solutions for predicting and simulating frames that can be inserted in-between real ones spat out by your GPU, and now Steam is making it a little easier to determine the difference between the two.</p><p>In an update to its in-game performance tools, Valve has added the ability to differentiate between frames generated by your hardware, and ones generated by your pick for frame generation, whether it's Nvidia's DLSS suite or AMD's FSR toolset. A new frames-per-second counter can show you what frame rate you're currently seeing with frame generation on, and what is actually being rendered by the game, which can be useful to determine issues with the technology.</p>

<p>Usually, issues arise with frame generation when your base frame rate isn't high enough, creating a mismatch between the responsiveness of the game and the fluidity you see on-screen. Valve's approach lets you determine if your settings are still a bit too demanding for your hardware by letting you see the true frame rate at a glance, so that you can make adjustments to fine-tune this balance.</p><p>The update also adds more information to the overlay, including additional GPU and CPU utilization information, maximum and minimum frame rates, a frame rate graph, and more. You can choose between four display levels in the in-game overlay settings, as well as the color and opacity of the display to suit the game they're being layered onto.</p><p>Valve says this update is specifically for Windows users now, and for modern GPU hardware. Additional support will come at a later, undetermined date. You can find out more about how Valve calculates all of its performance metrics in the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3462-CD4C-36BD-5767" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">detailed breakdown here</a>.</p>

                <p>During a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> livestream for The Edge of Fate, which is set for release on July 15, Bungie developers explained how they expect players to sequence break the new planet of Kepler--and that's intentional.</p><p>The new destination of Kepler is described as being similar in depth to the Rise of Iron content from the original game in 2016. It was complex with many puzzles and mysteries to solve. The Edge of Fate's content has been designed so that the campaign missions "slowly" lead players into unlocking different abilities and the varying levels of them, as well as uncovering more of Kepler's explorable areas.</p><p>There are puzzles to figure out, secrets to unlock, and particular routes that will be inaccessible without using abilities, such as Matterspark, to shrink down and traverse through vents or hidden paths. During the stream, Bungie developers explained that this was done in order to teach players that it's necessary to look at and think about the world around them in a different way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After the main campaign story missions are complete, you can unlock abilities anywhere, but this means that you can sequence break puzzles and missions. Bungie says that this is "entirely intentional" and that it is looking forward to seeing what players can do beyond the limits of its own playtesting processes.</p><p>"We're not 100% sure where players might sequence break," said Destiny 2 assistant game director, Robbie Stevens, "but that's intentional."</p><p>With the news that players breaking Destiny 2 is finally intended by Bungie, it'll be interesting to watch the varied combinations and broken builds created by players in action.</p><p>Where Bungie draws a stricter line though is its raids, with many items and abilities being disabled for the Contest Mode versions of its raid races. During the stream, Bungie also announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-raid-race-start-date-duration-and-epic-raid-details/1100-6532888/" data-ref-id="1100-6532888">The Edge of Fate raid race start date</a>, and detailed the new Epic raid system that will be available shortly after its release.</p>

<p>"Unleash your inner Kong"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If a day of previews and impressions aren't enough <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> for you, how about a commercial? It's time to unleash your inner Kong.</p>
<p>Nintendo has dropped a brand new ad for the upcoming 3D platformer, incorporating the games central premises of music and smashing things up. You won't be able to stop yourself from humming the tune — or even chanting along with the actors.</p>
<p>The gameplay itself isn't anything new, but we're not complaining; there's plenty of smashing, running, and even a glimpse of DK's Bananza Transformation. This is the most love we've seen Donkey Kong get in a long while, and the wait over the next few weeks is going to be excruciating.</p>
<p>Fans in the comments are, of course, posting the lyrics to the DK Rap — that song <em>isn't</em> in this ad, but the "DK" chanting is certainly evocative of it. Also... is that a Lanky Kong reference at the end?</p>
<p>Anyway, if you missed it, we actually went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip">hands-on with the game very recently</a>, and even after only a few hours, we might be in love. Nintendo also confirmed to us that the team behind the game is indeed "the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> team", so those comparisons are apt.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Marvel and NetEase revealed the launch date and details for Marvel Rivals Season 3: The Abyss Awakens. The new season is going live on July 11, with the cosmic-powered Phoenix joining the roster as a new playable hero and the Klyntar: Celestial Husk map being added to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">popular</a> hero shooter game. Season 3 will also introduce new features, special events, and Team-Ups between characters. Going forward, the developers have announced that Marvel Rivals will launch a new season every two months.</p>



<p>On this Mosaic (Space) Timeline, the Phoenix and Jean Grey have fully accepted each other, traveling through the universe while helping residents across the galaxy. However, when the Timestream Entanglement took place, the Phoenix sensed a terrible darkness awakening at the edge of the known universe. The Phoenix could feel that this darkness had already corrupted many gods, and even she, who was so far away, felt a sharp pain in her mind. To annihilate it in its slumber, the Phoenix and Jean decided to venture into the abyss where this darkness resided, using their flames to completely burn down the root of this universe's problem. The Phoenix will be a Duelist-type character in Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>As for the new map, lore-wise, Knull has slaughtered multiple Celestials. The severed head of the first Celestial he decapitated drifted away from the planet Klyntar over the eons, morphing into Knowhere. Meanwhile, the body has remained in orbit above Klyntar, slowly corroded by Knull's power within and the forces of the cosmos outside. The Celestial Remains fall from the sky, becoming a part of the Klyntar landscape.</p>



<p>For Season 3, the Marvel Rivals team is adding new features, battle pass and system updates and four new Team-Ups. The game's mission system will see a complete overhaul and a new layer of customization to the accessories system will be introduced. A brand-new competitive mode will be released in the latter half of Season 3, and Blade will join the roster. Also, beginning in Season 3, verified university students will enjoy costume trials. University students can access 10 costumes and MVPs upon completing verification. These costumes will rotate each season. The Marvel Rivals team is rolling out email verification for students in the US, UK, and more, with more regions to come.</p>

Think <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>, but with more sticky notes, missions, and a full progression system.

Perks are a key part of the game’s progression, letting players unlock new abilities—like being able to get rid of status effects by jumping—and changing how you play the game. Previously, they were hard to unlock as you had to collect resources, some of which the game did a poor job of highlighting. But now some lower-level perks are cheaper to unlock while some higher-level ones cost more resources. The idea, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605983645893033&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605983645893033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Remedy explained in a blog post</a></span>, is to get people using more perks, more quickly, and then making it easier to unlock higher-level options as they play more. </p><p>It sounds good to me, someone who is still playing<em> FBC: Firebreak </em>on and off between other games.

He also pushed back on people using <em>FBC’s </em>low Steam player count as evidence that the new shooter has flopped. </p><p>“Steam is a very important part of the business of <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>,” said Puha. “The Steam [active player count] is a very easy statistic to dig up, but it isn’t everything.”</p><p>As for the future of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/fbc-firebreak&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/fbc-firebreak"><em>FBC</em></a></span>, Puha reiterated Remedy’s plans to add two new missions to the game later this year as well as some new, undisclosed features. But he also acknowledged that some plans have changed based on the rough launch. </p><p>“We’ve rearranged some of our development plans, prioritized certain features, and deprioritized others already during the week of the game being live,” said Puha. “The game is live, players’ feedback comes in, things will change, that’s what we expected.”</p><p>“It’s exciting that the game starts evolving now that it’s live,” continued Puha, “Remedy is fully committed to <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.

It is simultaneously an adventure with a defined end goal and an open world (or I guess open house?) mystery, so the question of “how long <em>Blue Prince </em>is” will depend entirely on what you want to get out of it. This ambiguity has also led to some discourse among the game’s fans that I <em>personally </em>take umbrage with, even if said discourse was well-intentioned. Let’s break it down.</p><h2 id="h208627"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat Blue Prince?</h2><figure id="" data-id="c431f5f48995253c284bff360d75b3e5" data-recommend-id="image://c431f5f48995253c284bff360d75b3e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

Three gems are shown on a shelf in front of a crest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the outset of <em>Blue Prince</em>, you have a clear objective: reach the 46th room of the randomized 45 room house you’ve inherited from your uncle Herbert Sinclair. While it is <em>technically </em>possible to accomplish this task in one in-game day (there’s a trophy for it, even), 99.999999999% of players will need to aimlessly stumble throughout the house while they gather clues and unlock permanent upgrades first. <strong>The game’s credits will play after finding Room 46</strong>, so you could consider this “beating” <em>Blue Prince</em>.</p><p><strong>While you can finish <em>Blue Prince</em> in 15 to 20 hours</strong>, this estimate can swing wildly. If you’re really good at puzzle games and luck is on your side, you could find your way to the end of <em>Blue Prince </em>in under ten hours. However, if you aren’t accustomed to roguelikes or puzzle games (or both), you could easily spend 25 or 30 hours to reach the credits. Frankly, there’s nothing wrong with that! <strong><em>Blue Prince </em>leaves a lot up to chance by design</strong>, so you could go hours without seeing clues that other players might find incredibly early on their journey.</p><p><strong>That said, <em>Blue Prince </em>has a <em>ton </em>of mysteries to solve after the credits</strong>. These relate directly to the main story and include some pretty big discoveries, but uncovering these will take <em>a lot</em> more notetaking and out-of-the-box thinking. <strong>Peeling back every layer of <em>Blue Prince </em>and seeing every challenge to the end can absolutely take you over 100 hours</strong>. Again, that estimate should be taken with a grain of salt, as many secrets will depend on whether a lot of random events line up just right for you on a given in-game day. Your completion time will also change if you use guides or want to solve absolutely everything yourself.</p><p>This massive postgame is why many fans have taken to calling the quest for Room 46 “the tutorial.” That said, if you haven’t played <em>Blue Prince </em>yet, I’d strongly advise <em>against</em> looking at the opening act as an appetizer to overcome before you get to the game’s main course.</p><h2 id="h208628"><a id=""></a>Why I don’t think you should call getting to Room 46 in <em>Blue Prince </em>“the tutorial”</h2><figure id="" data-id="dc6ffa5d5c5d5ad960f91a6462108af2" data-recommend-id="image://dc6ffa5d5c5d5ad960f91a6462108af2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

Before I could even press play, I was barraged with tips and facts about <em>Blue Prince </em>that I <em>had </em>to know if I wanted to play it the <em>right </em>way. You gotta take notes about everything! You haven’t <em>really</em> started <em>Blue Prince </em>until you reach a certain point! You’re just a <em>noob</em> if you complain about the Billiards room! You won’t believe how many layers there are to <em>Blue Prince</em> and you have to <em>see them all</em>!</p><p>I’ll be frank; this discourse damn near ruined <em>Blue Prince </em>for me. I was <em>so </em>stressed out in the opening hours of the game that I obsessively noted every observation I had about every room, worried about all these intricate and complex puzzles that would await me when the game <em>really </em>started. I wasn’t even sure <em>what </em>I was looking for, I just <em>had </em>to get through this “tutorial” fast so I could understand why everyone’s losing their mind about this game. What spectacular secret will I find once I enter Room 46? What will <em>Blue Prince</em> be like once I finally get to the “real” part of the game?</p><p>Without outright spoiling, I’ll say this: <strong>there’s no reality-shifting moment in Room 46</strong>. There is no “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-deserves-to-be-replayed-1847202498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-deserves-to-be-replayed-1847202498">Just Monika</a></span>” or “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/portal-the-companion-collection-switch-valve-nintendo-1849117877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/portal-the-companion-collection-switch-valve-nintendo-1849117877">The Cake is a lie</a></span>” twist that will force you to make that shocked face you see in 90% of YouTube thumbnails. The only big reveal is—as mentioned above— there are several extra puzzles in <em>Blue Prince </em>that involve more obsessive note taking and riddle-decoding to solve. When people call the first act of <em>Blue Prince</em> “the tutorial,” they just mean there’s a lot more game remaining.</p><p>By focusing so much on what was next in <em>Blue Prince</em>, I wasn’t able to enjoy those opening hours of the game. I nearly put it down for good until I started playing it alongside my girlfriend, which finally helped me ignore the sky-high expectations put in my brain from internet commentators. I really regret that my first hours with the game were tainted by focusing on what came next, so my advice is to take <em>Blue Prince </em>slowly and enjoy every phase of the game however you’d like.</p><h2 id="h208629"><a id=""></a>Play as much of <em>Blue Prince </em>as you want, even if you don’t “beat” it</h2><figure id="" data-id="470f8c61ae4f9b067b2bc6694705b371" data-recommend-id="image://470f8c61ae4f9b067b2bc6694705b371" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

At best, it’s redundant: You’ll inevitably find bread crumbs for extra puzzles and objectives on your journey to Room 46. <em>Blue Prince </em>naturally does a good job of prodding your curiosity, so you’ll know which threads to pull next if you’re ready for more after the credits. </p><p>At worst, the tutorial framing is patronizing. It undermines the accomplishment of getting to Room 46, as if to say the player shouldn’t feel proud because the puzzles that lie ahead are just so much harder. Even if there’s no ill intention involved, it’s the same vibe as telling someone they haven’t <em>really </em>played an MMORPG until they’ve participated in high-end raid content, or you haven’t played <em>Elden Ring</em> unless you use a strength build and never use Spirit Ashes and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-missmikkaa-erdtree-boss-fight-dance-pad-1851606332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-missmikkaa-erdtree-boss-fight-dance-pad-1851606332">play exclusively with a dance pad</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/skip-boss-fights-elden-ring-metroid-prime-argument-1851781231&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/skip-boss-fights-elden-ring-metroid-prime-argument-1851781231">Not everyone enjoys video games the same way</a></span>, and that’s okay! Reaching Room 46 is worth celebrating, whether it took you five or fifty hours to pull off.</p><p><strong><em>Blue Prince </em>is about the journey, not the destination</strong>. So if you aren’t enjoying the journey, there’s no big moment at the end that’ll make it all worthwhile. The post-credits puzzles in <em>Blue Prince </em>are way more intricate and cryptic than everything that came before, and you might not enjoy those challenges as much as the straightforward quest to find Room 46. Others may say that the endgame challenges of <em>Blue Prince </em>are the best part. It’s up to you to decide whether or not you want to dive so deep into the game that you become a walking wiki for it.</p><p><br>All of this is to say, don’t worry too much about what the “true end” of <em>Blue Prince </em>is. It is, indeed, a quick adventure if you want it to be. But if you want to dig deeper into it, you’ll be pleased by just how deep this rabbit hole goes. For best results, <strong>I recommend going slowly with the game and taking breaks if you get stuck, as a good night’s sleep can make all the difference between a puzzle being fun or frustrating</strong>. And most importantly, enjoy your time in Mt. Holly manor!</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-how-long-to-beat-room-46-tutorial-puzzles-1851785424]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2 </a>developer livestream, Bungie has detailed the start date for The Edge of Fate raid race, and it may signal some changes to the traditional raid race experience that players are used to.</p><p>For the past few expansions, Guardians have had 48 hours to complete the raid race on Contest Mode. Contest Mode is a time-limited version of the race that is available as soon as the raid is released. It has inflated difficulty in the form of reduced outgoing damage, higher combatant health, and a reliance on flawless team communication and strategy. These traditionally began on the Friday following the release of the expansion on Tuesday, but this time around that's changing.</p><p><strong>The Edge of Fate raid race will begin on Saturday, July 19</strong>.</p><p>We assume that it will still begin at the daily reset time, but this has not been confirmed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Secondly, several weeks after the raid's initial release, a new version of the raid will become available. This is known as an Epic version of the raid and will expand the story, adding new content. Bungie emphasized that it is not holding anything back in the base version of the raid to enable the Epic version to exist, but rather that the Epic raid will "enhance" the raid experience.</p><p>For those wondering about how to prepare for the race in the four short days between the expansion's release and the launch of the raid, Bungie recommends completing the campaign's main story on Legendary difficulty to reach the recommended Power level.</p><p>Guardians can further enhance their preparation by grinding for more powerful gear, which can drop at higher tiers with more benefits when completing difficult activities. With the arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-destiny-2-edge-of-fate-expansions-new-exotic-armor-does/1100-6532685/" data-ref-id="1100-6532685">new Exotics</a>, armor, and modifiers, this raid race will be one to watch.</p>

		<p>Formula Legends is a racing game full of on-track drama, tight racing action and very silly names. Luis Hammerton cruises round the final corner in Belgium to secure top step on the podium, though not without controversy after nudging Mark Peerstallen and Osvald Pastry out of the way while going down the straight. Sad faces all round, meanwhile, for Petrul Tassly, Charlie Lacreme and Hans Troll, who were nowhere near the top three, and who are probably pretty disappointed to find that their special abilities aren’t as good as those guys.</p>

<p>Formula Legends takes the sport of F1 and gives it an arcade racing makeover, with hyper-deformed cars, giant racer helmets and oversized tyres, giving this a look that’s more cute than it is couture. It immediately feels fun, welcoming and kind of adorable, and if you’re a fan of the real-life sport, it’s an exceedingly light and fun take on it.</p>


<p>Our hands-on with the demo gave us a look at a single track, and the different racers and cars you can choose from, but there’s a lovely feature here that amplified our time with the game, and helps to push Formula Legends into essential territory for motorsport fans.</p>


<p>Formula Legends features three different eras of premier open-wheel racing, with track layouts, cars and racers that match each time period. That means we’re heading back to the 70s, with a sepia filter applied to the puddle-strewn track, the blue-ish tinged tarmac of the 90s, through to the more readily recognizable names and designs of the modern day sport. It’s a great idea – one it shares with Retro GP – but it feels like the team at 3DClouds have made a little more of it, beyond just the differing car designs.</p>
<p>Our hands-on took us to Belgium, racing around three iterations of Spa-Francorchamps; it’s a clear homage to the real-life track, even if they’re not allowed to use the proper circuit name and instead has a legally distinct equivalent branded as the Ardennes GP. That means you get to experience the iconic climb through Eau Rouge, the tricky combination of Les Combes and Malmedy and the blast of speed out of Stavelot, all presented in Formula Legends’ simple but effective art style.</p>
<p>I love the ability to see how they’ve mimicked the evolution of the track design, and to note what’s been retained through fifty years of racing there. Even if this is a lighter, more arcade-orientated title, it’s clear that the development team have a genuine passion for the real-life sport, and for its history.</p>

<p>On-track, this is old-school arcade racing, with a zoomed-out overhead camera, giving you a tucked-in view, and more emphasis placed on memorising the different nuances of the track rather than being able to see all the way to the horizon. It reminds me of classics like Super Off-Road and their more recent brethren Super Woden GP, but with a bit more immediacy thanks to the camera tracking behind your car.</p>
<p>These little race cars feel incredibly planted on the track, with grip for days – at least in the 90s and modern era cars – but this is an arcade racer that needs some tactical and thoughtful driving to get you through.</p>
<p>You need to be aware of your braking zones, and you need to make sure you’re following the circuit, as Formula Legends isn’t afraid to fire off a bevy of penalties for exceeding track limits. It’s a slightly odd juxtaposition at first, with the arcade handling and appearance seeming at odds with the more precise needs of the handling and rules, but once you’ve settled into the rhythm of racing you’ll find it comes together beautifully.</p>
<p>The pitstops add a further wrinkle to the action, with a minigame that tasks you with first selecting your tyre type, before changing each wheel by matching the correct QTE button press. It keeps you on your toes through an integral part of the race that many racing games simply ignore.</p>

<p>Few things are better than the sweep of your race car flying through a series of corners, hitting that point of zen that you find with the best racers, where you feel utterly in control and locked in. I wasn’t expecting Formula Legends to feel as good as it does on track, but it’s been a delight from start to finish. I love that the different eras boast their own handling too – you’re almost experiencing a different game, with unique tracks, appearance and racers.</p>
<p>Formula Legends is set to delight any fan of Formula 1, with an irreverent but loving nod to the different drivers that’s backed up with genuinely engaging racing. I can’t wait to experience more of it when it launches later this year.</p>
