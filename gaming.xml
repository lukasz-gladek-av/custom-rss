			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> dropped a bombshell of an announcement today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">cancelling six projects, including the long-awaited <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>, delaying seven more</a>, and restructuring the entire company into five separate <strong>Creative Houses</strong>. Those are the basic facts of what's changed for Ubisoft. As to how it'll execute and drive this new structure, the answer for Ubisoft appears to lie within <strong>more layoffs</strong>, a <strong>return-to-office mandate,</strong> and increased investments in what it deems to be "<em>cutting-edge technology,</em>" namely investing further in "<em>player-facing <strong>Generative AI</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, the basic structure of Ubisoft as a company is changing. It's moving to a decentralized model, with five Creative Houses that will sit under Ubisoft headquarters, each with its own financial responsibilities and total creative ownership of the brands and IPs held within each Creative House. Supporting each Creative House is a <strong>Creative Network</strong> of studios to help with production, and supporting everything will be its <strong>Core Services</strong>. You can see the basic breakdown of it all in the image below, from a press release. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ubisoft-Creative-Houses-Restructure.png"></a><figcaption><em>Ubisoft's new Creative Houses structure. Image credit: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not included in the basic breakdown above are some of the key internal changes that Ubisoft is undergoing that it believes are necessary for the restructure to work. It's already started one of those changes, which is simply <strong>more layoffs</strong>. </p>



<p>"<em>As part of this effort to streamline operations and adapt to evolving market conditions, the Group has already taken decisive actions to adjust its studio footprint</em>," the press release reads. "<em>This includes the closure of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">Halifax</a></strong> mobile studio earlier this month and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/">Stockholm</a></strong> studio, as well as restructurings at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">Abu Dhabi</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">RedLynx</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/">Massive</a></strong></em>."</p>



<p>Unfortunately, these layoffs that we've already seen, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">closure of the <strong>Leamington</strong> studio,</a> which isn't mentioned here but does fall within the restructure timeline previously put out by Ubisoft, are not the end. The third and "<em>final phase</em>" of the restructure is still to come, with more set to be announced on <strong>February 12, 2026.</strong> That said, the third phase of this restructure is "<em>expected to be fully achieved by <strong>March 2026</strong></em>," so there could even be more layoffs announced after the February date. The company is looking to these cuts to drive <strong>€200</strong> <strong>million</strong> in savings. </p>



<p>Along with more organizational cuts, another key part of how it'll execute this new structure is a <strong>return-to-office mandate</strong>. Remote work is being killed off as an option across the company, and instead, employees will have a limited number of days allocated to them to work from home each year, basically equating work-from-home days to vacation or sick days for employees. </p>



<p>"<em>To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to <strong>five days per week on site for all teams</strong></em>, <em>complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days. This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams. In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity, and success in a persistently more selective AAA market</em>."</p>



<p>After the world spent the better part of two years locked in their homes and finding ways to make their jobs and lives work without leaving their dwellings, it's difficult to read claims that in-person collaboration and work are "<em>key</em>" to any process. Sure, being in the same room with others can often be the best way for a team to work, but after we had a slew of stellar titles released in recent years, several of which were made by entirely remote teams, we know that developers don't need to move across the world or commute for hours a day to make a good game. </p>



<p>If these mandates accelerate anything, it's company turnover, as many employees are unable to move to new locations if they suddenly need to be in the office five days a week. It's easier to see them as disguised or soft layoffs, instead of changes meant to better employee collaboration. </p>



<p>"<em>We really want to strengthen onsite collaboration, the collective dynamic across teams</em>," added Ubisoft's senior vice president of studio operations, <strong>Marie Sophie de Waubert</strong>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-asking-all-staff-to-return-to-office-full-time-to-boost-the-collective-performance-for-aaa">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "<em>We know that in-person collaboration and interactions are key enablers of efficiency, creativity, and collective success in this persistently selective market. It's one enabler among others, but it's really one we believe in.</em>"</p>



<p>When pressed by GI.Biz about how this mandate will impact staff turnover, de Waubert said, "<em>the one and only objective is to enhance collective efficiency, to drive the dynamics, the creativity, the sense of belonging.</em>" De Waubert also adds, "<em>We will, of course, discuss in due time with the different countries the modus operandi, and the flexibility linked to that evolution of our model. But the objective is really linked to the quality of our games and the quality of our creativity. And it's one enabler among others for the Creative Houses to reconnect with success and team engagement</em>."</p>



<p>Speaking of things not needed to make a good game, one of the final ways in which Ubisoft will try to execute its new structure comes from its new <strong>Core Services</strong> branch, which the company describes as "<em>the backbone of Ubisoft's ecosystem</em>." The teams under the Core Services branch will "<em>focus on delivering scalable technology, production capabilities and operational excellence across the Group</em>."</p>



<p>Among their responsibilities will be production services, i.e quality assurance, localization, playtests and game analytics. Also under the Core Services umbrella is the company's technological infrastructure, including its game engines, online services, IT infrastructure, and most notably, <strong>Generative AI</strong>.</p>



<p>In fact, the press release specifies "<em>player-facing Generative AI</em>," though it's short on what exactly that means. It could result in nothing, as GenAI is still far from <a href="https://wccftech.com/razer-ceo-speaks-for-gamers-says-we-dont-want-genai-slop-we-want-ai-tools-that-help-game-devs/">establishing a place in game development</a>, even as major publishers like Ubisoft continue to push for it.</p>



<p>All of these changes, including the new structure, are due to be implemented as of <strong>April 2026</strong>, which means we'll know more about how these changes go as early as the end of this year, as we continue to monitor and cover Ubisoft as it goes through this massive shift.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Will Bring Back A Classic Big Map But Not For Season 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-announce-classic-big-map-returning-season-two-details-2000661857</link>
            <guid>1412398</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/every-battlefield-6-map-ranked-from-worst-to-best-2000647370"><em>Battlefield 6′</em></a>s delayed season two arrives in February, and we finally know more about what to expect in the upcoming season. But EA also teased more of what’s to come beyond season two in a new update on <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s future.</p> <p>On January 21, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2014005415114310024">EA and Battlefield Studios shared a new and lengthy update</a> confirming some key details about season two. The biggest news is that EA confirmed season two will include at least two new maps, and it shared a few more details about one of those battlegrounds. Contaminated is one of the new maps arriving sometime in season two, and EA will soon be letting some players hop into the map early via a new round of Battlefield Labs playtesting. Interestingly, EA says it wants to test how the map’s “unique gameplay mechanics function” in a live match. As for how big Contaminated is, EA says its total size lands somewhere between <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-review-good-eastwood-big-large-ps5-pc-2000645547">Eastwood and Mirak Valley</a>&nbsp;and says it is comparable in size to classic maps such as Arras from <em>Battlefield V.</em></p>

 <p>While that sounds like a decent-sized map, I suspect EA knew some fans wouldn’t be satisfied with that announcement, which probably explains the publisher teasing the return of a massive classic map in Wednesday’s post. Golmud Railway, a map first seen in <em>Battlefield 4,</em> will be added to <em>BF6</em> in a “future season.”</p> <p>“Golmud Railway is being rebuilt for today’s <em>Battlefield</em>, not simply ported forward,” explained the devs. “Our goal is to preserve what made the map so memorable in <em>Battlefield 4</em>, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports<em> Battlefield 6</em> systems. Golmud Railway is planned to be the largest <em>Battlefield 6</em> map to date, giving us the opportunity to expand gameplay on a larger scale.”</p>

 <p>Since before <em>Battlefield 6</em> launched, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803">fans have been asking for bigger maps</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-big-large-conquest-map-battle-royale-redsec-golf-course-2000641083">even creating their own using <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s battle royale map and in-game creation tools</a>. So it’s great to hear that EA and Battlefield Studios are working on a map that will be bigger than any of the current battlegrounds. Hopefully, fans won’t have to wait too long to get to play it. Maybe season three? We’ll have to wait and find out.</p>

 <h2><em>Redsec</em> solo mode update</h2> <p>Meanwhile, <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs confirmed that the Little Bird heli, which was featured in past <em>BF</em> games, will be added in season two. The devs also confirmed they are continuing to work on a solo queue for <em>Redsec</em>, <em>BF6</em>‘s battle royale mode. No release date was shared, and it seems like it could end up never happening if testing doesn’t work out. But for now, it seems like the studios involved in making <em>BF6</em> and <em>Redsec</em> are still working on the fan-requested feature.</p> <p>Here’s the dev’s full update:</p> <blockquote><p>We’re also continuing internal and exploratory testing around Battle Royale Solo play, as we evaluate how different player configurations impact pacing, balance, and the overall Battle Royale experience.</p> <p>This work is focused on understanding where Solo play can best fit within the broader Battle Royale roster, including how it affects match flow, survivability, and long-term engagement when featured alongside other Battle Royale experiences. These tests are part of our ongoing effort to make informed decisions about how Battle Royale is structured and presented over time, rather than committing to a single permanent configuration.</p></blockquote> <p><em>Battlefield 6′</em>s second free season arrives on all platforms on February 17, bringing new maps and, like season one, likely adding more content like new weapons, modes, cosmetics, and more.</p>

            <p>
I am going to level with you. My awareness of Lort up until this point has been non-existent. Never heard of it before today, it's early access release day! But when you see a game called Lort, well, you at least need to take a little look. And as astronomically silly as the name is, it looks like a pretty neat, silly time, so, my predilection towards the inane has clearly worked out in my favour this time.
</p>
<p>
Lort is one of those trendy affordable co-op games, specifically of the action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> variety. Think something along the lines of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a>, but with a fantasy setting, alongside some other key differences. While there are different adventurers to choose from, the bigger focus is on the weapons you can pick up, which range from what I think is a squid on a staff, to some fancy looking swords, to quite simply a gun. Or three guns taped to a stick! The Risk of Raininess of it comes back with different powerups you can pick up to help you take down waves of enemies.

<p>
You can play it solo if you like, but the main draw is eight-player co-op, though I can't tell you how enemy difficulty might scale depending on how many people are playing. I do wish that it was maybe a touch less memey on the whole, using words like swole, and chad, and muscle mommy, a lot of which is already pretty dated, but if I ignore the language the gameplay looks goofy in an entertaining way.
</p><p>
Anyway, currently the game is in early access, but it is apparently playable from start to finish. The game's first big update will introduce things like a new, froggish adventurer, a dagger weapon type, and more, with bigger plans for more playable adventures, an endless mode, biomes, and quest types. You can pick it up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2956680/LORT/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There will be no more remote work—or at least very limited opportunities—for Ubisoft employees moving forward. Instead, Ubisoft employees will be required to be in office on a full time basis.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the French-based publisher announced major restructuring plans that including a number of games, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>, being canceled. While the announcement also spoke about plans to focus more on<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Games-As-A-Service (GAAS) and open world experiences</a>, they also revealed a policy change that will impact all employees within the company. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-wants-all-employees-in-the-office">Ubisoft Wants All Employees In The Office</h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official press release</a>, Ubisoft will return to a full five days on site “for all teams”. Staff will then receive an “annual allowance of working-from-home days.”</p>



<p>“This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams,” they said “In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market.”</p>



<p>SVP of Studio Operations Marie Sophie de Waubert&nbsp;told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-reveals-new-creative-house-structure-cancels-games-and-announces-final-round-of-cost-cutting-and-studio-closures-to-drive-200m-savings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that the company is still working with “a hybrid model, but spread differently”.</p>







<p>After the news broke, one source reached out to Insider Gaming’s Mike Straw to say that they’d expect the eventual layoffs to be “in the hundreds”. During its conference call to discuss the moves, Ubisoft wouldn’t discuss how many more layoffs would be coming as part of this restructure within the company. </p>



<p>Recently, the company has held layoffs at its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-to-layoff-55-employees-across-the-division-developers-and-stockholm-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Massive Entertainment</a> as well as at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cut-nearly-30-jobs-abu-dhabi-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</a>, the closure of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Halifax</a>, and more. </p>

It’s a lengthy message from the EA team that comes with a few highlights as it attempts to win back fans who may have been turned off by the recent delay of Season 2.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/21/battlefield-6-contaminated-1769016546557.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Contaminated Map First Look. Image courtesy of EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players want new maps, and BF Studios wants to deliver. We don’t know how many new maps will be included in Season 2, but the Labs blog post confirms the name of one of the new locations: Contaminated. The studio says that, in terms of size, it falls between Season 1 map Eastwood and launch map Mirak Valley, while also comparing it to Battlefield 1’s St. Quentin Scar and Battlefield V’s Arras.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ll be evaluating how vehicle gameplay and aerial presence interact with infantry combat, alongside cover and asset placement, and objective boundaries,” the post says of upcoming pre-release tests. “We’ll also be testing how the map’s unique gameplay mechanics function in live matches, as well as the tools available to players to interact with them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A first-look, work-in-progress image of the map (above) shows a rocky mountain battleground. Fog and forest both overlook what appears to be a small aircraft runway, with snipers perched between the trees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to pick out one defining feature from the new map with such a limited look, but BF Studios has something a little more familiar planned for the future. Buried in the “On the Horizon” section of the Labs blog post is the announcement that a “fan-favorite” Battlefield 4 map is set to arrive “in a future season.” That location is none other than launch map <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-4/Golmud_Railway"><u>Golmud Railway</u></a>, which, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more"><u>a few dedicated Reddit users let us know last year</u></a>, stands as not only one of the larger Battlefield 4 maps but one of the bigger Battlefield maps ever.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It is worth noting that Battlefield 6 has brought back maps before, with Operation Firestorm launching alongside the game itself in October. The wide-open desert area featured in the latest installment is actually a smaller version of the same map from Battlefield 3, so it’s unclear if Golmud Railway will receive the same treatment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, BF Studios says this fully rebuilt version of the Battlefield 4 map will be the biggest Battlefield 6 multiplayer map yet, promising to “preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re bringing Golmud into Battlefield Labs early as this will be a multi-session project,” the developer says. “Through Labs, we want to test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of a recent tweak to jet gameplay, fans of air combat have also been hoping to see more love in Battlefield 6. To help meet their desires, BF Studios used the Labs post to confirm upcoming tests will include the rumored return of the AH-6 Little Bird.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect to see the compact helicopter back in Season 2 at an unspecified point in time, with things like the previously promised air radar also set for Labs testing soon. Also still in the cards is a solo queue for REDSEC battle royale, though BF Studios says the long-desired option is continuing as “internal and exploratory” testing. There’s no word on when the mode could come to Labs or if it will ever make its way to the public version of Battlefield 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield global community manager Kevin Johnson <a href="https://x.com/T0TALfps/status/2014006687280091437?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to X/Twitter</u></a> with more information about how BF Studios will continue to roll out testing for new content. Much of what was detailed today has no firm release date, but Labs players can go hands-on with at least some of the new content, including Contaminated, “as soon as this Friday.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Battlefield (@Battlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/2011106206014685329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 13, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Alongside that, we want to ensure more ongoing and meaningful action is taken on your feedback - Battlefield Labs will be the conduit for that,” Johnson said. “Things may take time, and we appreciate your patience, but what is in store is going to be a great collaboration moment!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. It’s found itself in a bit of a bind heading into 2026, with players taking to social media to beg for new content as BF Studios works to deliver its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1"><u>delayed Season 2 come February 17</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

The hook is that your mech is your deck, meaning you can swap out parts as desired using your cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More intriguingly, Turtle Juice says that "every card played is immediately replaced, forcing players to think ahead, position cards strategically, and chain pilot abilities to forge mech-pilot synergies and unleash attack combos that can turn the tide of battle." Lead designer Ernani Rocha said, “With MECHBORN, we wanted to rethink what moment-to-moment strategy feels like in a roguelike deckbuilder. The conveyor-belt card system fundamentally changes how players plan, adapt, and position themselves every turn.” Check out the reveal trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MECHBORN - First Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are 12 mech pilots with unique skills and backgrounds, allowing you to create all kinds of builds during your runs.

It turns out, a lot can change in four years. And here I am again, back on my tropical island paradise, playing through another big free addition – and a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of one of my favourite Switch games.</p>
<p>But wait, what does this mean for Animal Crossing’s future? We’re almost six years into New Horizons’ life with no sign of a new game in the series to come. The announcement <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">back in October 2025</a> filled me with a mix of excitement and worry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-animal-crossing-on-switch-2-has-me-equal-parts-buzzing-and-baffled">just like Jim</a>, because, yay, more Animal Crossing to lose my life to! But also, oh no, when is the <em>next</em> Animal Crossing coming?</p><div><figure data-videoid="CiNQNWrXoic" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytCiNQNWrXoic" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed82b568svwqgi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Months later, and after a week of decorating hotel rooms, putting together a LEGO-themed nook in my basement, and contemplating terraforming part of my island all over again, I’m a lot less conflicted. In fact, I’m happy to wait for a brand new Animal Crossing, because in a few years' time, it might be the perfect game to experience with my daughter.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7518f7e26c2ea"><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Quinn's birthday" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7518f7e26c2ea/animal-crossing-new-horizons-quinns-birthday.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, in 2026, I’m going to become a parent. This has added a whole new layer to how I think about video games. Both my husband and I had parents or relatives who were also into games, who encouraged us to pick up and play and experience the magic of the medium. Now the two of us are talking hypotheticals about which <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> our child should play first, or how we can use video games to teach her about life and love and empathy.</p>
<p>I knew I was expecting a child when the 3.0 update and Switch 2 Edition were announced, and I was hit with this strange realisation: New Horizons just seems to be there whenever my life is changing.</p>
<p>I don’t need to remind people of 2020, but I’ve found myself slipping back into the familiar rhythms of island life multiple times: when the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/animal_crossing_new_horizons_-_happy_home_paradise_dlc">DLC</a> dropped in 2021, I was looking for a new job; in 2023, I started a brand new island as I was packing up my life to move across the Atlantic. And now I’m back again ahead of parenthood.</p>
<p>It’s still the perfect reprieve from everything going on in the outside world, but with our impending new addition, it’s made me rethink how I play Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I couldn’t help but recall <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_6_things_my_three-year-old_taught_me_about_video_games_via_animal_crossing">Roland’s experience with the beginnings of New Horizon with his own child</a>, and the prospect of getting to see my daughter’s face as she helps me play through a completely new game is wonderful.</p>

<p>I’m so used to the mechanics and the way Animal Crossing rolls, but New Horizons is easily the most complex entry so far, even with the handful of QoL updates 3.0 brought with it. There’s no way I could imagine throwing a young child into the game, <em>especially</em> on an island I’ve poured hundreds of hours into. Does she really want me to explain why the museum is surrounded by Japanese-themed decorations, or why I live next to the Able Sisters?</p>
<p>The next game is unlikely to scale back that much, but what it does offer is a chance for a fresh start on an experience that both parent and child will be jumping into, together, for the first time. I can’t really think of anything better than that.</p>
<p>Usually when I play Animal Crossing, I’m a bit of a min-maxer. I like making money, so I’ll spend hours upon hours fishing, catching bugs, trying to farm scorpions and tropical bugs on Mystery Islands. I’ve also been playing this series for 23 years, importing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">the original</a> from North America because I desperately wanted to experience this cosy little life as a kid. I’ve never looked back.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7a11a7c3235da"><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition 3.0 Update aurora" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a11a7c3235da/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-3-0-update-aurora.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a result of this feverish love of the series, the slow-life aspect has been somewhat compounded in recent years, so a new game is the chance for me to reset the way I play. I'm guilty of time-travelling and scouring the internet for turnip prices, but now I'm side-eyeing those decisions. I don’t want to do this with my kid. I want to play the game the way <em>she</em> wants me to, and she’ll be the one calling the shots. She will be the reason I’m playing – if that’s what she wants.</p>
<p>I know this isn’t the <em>most</em> child-friendly series given how much there is to do and how much text there is, but my aim would be to act as a guide for my daughter while she delights in designing her own characters or she giggles at the animalese voices. It’ll be a safe haven she gets to design with the help of her parents, not just a digital world she can watch enviously as I mow my way through progression.</p>
<p>Hypothetical thinking is dangerous, I know, and there are many things I can’t predict: for one, she might not like video games at all. She might get bored or frustrated, or she might simply prefer other activities. The world is her oyster. Plus, we might get a new Animal Crossing game in a year — you never know! — and I don’t think a baby would understand what’s going on.</p>

<p>But I’m no longer clamouring for the future, or a faster release schedule. New Marios, Zeldas, and Animal Crossings are nice and all, but you know what’s better? Sharing those experiences with someone you love unconditionally and watching them form their own loves, thoughts, and opinions of those experiences.</p>

Given its lengthy, troubled development period, it will probably not come as any surprise to you that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> have announced today that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> has been cancelled.

Alongside the Prince of Persia remake, Ubisoft have also cancelled development on five other games, three of them apparently being completely new, and one being a mobile title. Seven other games they have in the works have been internally delayed as well. Details about these games are next to none, but the general idea behind this move is that Ubisoft want to focus on open world and live service games.
</p>
<p>
It also appears that more layoffs may be in Ubisoft's future too. We already knew that their Halifax studio is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-close-the-studio-behind-assassins-creed-rebellion-days-after-the-developers-vote-to-unionise">being shuttered</a>, but according to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-details-major-company-reset-6-games-canned-7-delayed-and-2-studios-closed/">VGC</a>, the company is also considering the sale of other assets. On top of this, CFO Frederick Duguet said, "There are some people who will be refocused on other big projects, and some may leave the company." An exact figure wasn't specified in terms of staff members being moved or laid off.
</p>
<p>
In terms of these five new "creative houses," one of them is Vantage Studios, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">the subsidiary partially owned by Tencent</a>, which will focus on Ubisoft's tentpole series like Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six. Others will handle series like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, Rayman, Beyond Good &amp; Evil (which suggests it's somehow still in development), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-dance">Just Dance</a>, and even Prince of Persia, so clearly Ubisoft still intends to do something with the series.
</p><p>
The official Prince of Persia Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/2014018590396105121">shared a statement</a> with this to say of the cancellation: "While the project had real potential, we weren’t able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit. And, we didn’t want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents. Prince of Persia as a universe and a legacy continues to matter deeply to us, and this decision does not mean we’re stepping away from the franchise. Thank you for your passion, patience, and love for Prince of Persia."
</p>
<p>
Solidarity with all those affected by the restructuring.

              <p><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span>, Riot Games’ free-to-play </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span> fighting game, released on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series consoles yesterday after roughly 18 months of closed beta tests. While it’s too early to comment on the overall quality of </span><i><span>2XKO’s</span></i><span> gameplay, PlayStation 5 players aren’t too impressed with its performance.</span></p> <p><span>After roughly 18 months of closed betas and “Alpha Lab” playtests, Riot Games has finally released its beginner-friendly, free-to-play (but microtransaction-heavy) fighting game </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>in full. There’s no critical consensus regarding </span><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span> yet. At launch there aren’t even <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/2xko/">any reviews of the console version</a>.&nbsp; B</span><span>ut I sunk a couple of hours into it this morning and can confirm that it’s still just as good as it was during the last closed beta.</span></p>

 <p><span>Little caveat there: I played on PC. </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>has technically been available on PC in early access since October 7, 2025, but only officially launched on Xbox Series S/X and PS5 on January 20. This is relevant because, according to the numerous posts that have popped up on the r/2XKO subreddit over the past 24 hours, the PS5 version of the game has a few performance-related issues.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2XKO on PS5 might be the roughest I’ve ever seen a fighting game launch. Extreme screen tearing in fights, lags in matches and in lobbies, horrible monetization.</p> <p>There’s a great fighting game here but it’s dying by 1000 cuts. <a href="https://t.co/w4jT0pyN5m">pic.twitter.com/w4jT0pyN5m</a></p> <p>— reyna cervantes (@Jfcdoomblade) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jfcdoomblade/status/2013843486512947644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>As detailed in the most active PS5-related </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/game_runs_like_total_ass_on_the_ps5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>thread</span></a><span> on the subreddit, titled “Game runs like total ass on the ps5,” PlayStation players have reported that they’re experiencing crashes, frequent FPS drops and, most commonly, heavy screen tearing.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I’m not having FPS drops (though I’m on PS5 Pro), but the screen tearing is horrendous,” writes user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/comment/o0t6r6l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>trugay</span></a><span>. “It’s the worst I’ve ever seen on a console title. It makes this a fairly disappointing release. I’m enjoying the game and its mechanics, but this is really dampening the experience.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Over on Twitter, user </span><a href="https://x.com/Jfcdoomblade/status/2013843486512947644"><span>Jfcdoomblade</span></a><span> uploaded a clip of the FPS drops in action and stated that “2XKO on PS5 might be the roughest I’ve ever seen a fighting game launch.”</span></p> <p><span>Oddly enough, I was unable to find any similar complaints from Xbox Series users. In fact, the only Xbox-related </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qir40k/having_a_blast_on_xbox_so_fun/"><span>thread</span></a><span> I could find was from one user gushing about how much fun they’re having.</span></p> <p><span>It’s important to note here that the screen tearing issue can’t be properly replicated through recorded footage, as screen tearing occurs through the monitor used to display the image. PS5 owners have theorized that the screen tearing issue in </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>may only occur when the game is played on a 120hz screen.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re confused as to why the same issue isn’t popping up for PC players who are using 120hz monitors, PS5 users have </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/comment/o0tfyys/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>further theorized</span></a><span> that this may be due to an issue with how v-sync has been implemented on the PlayStation 5 version of </span><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 will be pitting two space marine chapters – the Blood Ravens and the Dark Angels – against the terrifying Necrons, with an assist from their cyborg compatriots in the Adeptus Mechanicus. But while they all brood and scheme and recite litanies, the Orks will be literally crash-landing into the middle of it all in search of good fights and making gory memories. We got to try out a swathe of units and new campaign mechanics, and if there's one idea that seems to define the faction in this new RTS, it's this: "Make it bigger!"</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The WAAAGH!</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Orks wouldn't really be the Orks without the Waaagh! mechanic, representing their entire culture and warfare ethos of enthusiastic mayhem. It's been represented in various ways across many 40K games, but in Dawn of War 4, it's about as straightforward as the Orks themselves. Waaagh! is a bar that fills up from having lots of units on the field and, of course, from killing lots of humies and Necrons. Or even other Orks! Filling the bar will unlock tactical abilities, but also higher-tier units and upgrades.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 – Ork Faction Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Orks are very much a snowball faction, King Art Games told us. You kind of want to throw everything at the wall, sometimes literally, and let that chaos fuel your war machine. An Ork boy who's not mixing it up with the enemy is one who isn't earning his keep. And Ork units tend to be pretty cheap to replace, so you might as well box select them and send them to the front if they're just standing around.</p><p>Waaagh! is a bar that fills up from having lots of units on the field and, of course, from killing lots of humies and Necrons.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ork squads gain veterancy pretty quick, so even losing experienced squads isn't the end of the world. They're usually not as potent on a one-for-one basis as a fully veteran Space Marine squad, but they can reach peak performance sooner. And one of my favorite parts of the whole faction is that some of the Orks have veterancy upgrades that actually add more models to a squad. So a fresh batch of Boyz might only consist of a handful, but once the Waaagh! really gets rolling, it'll look like a proper horde.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you have enough violent fervor saved up, you can Unleash the Waaagh!, which gives all of your units a frantic offensive power increase for a limited time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Scrap 'em!</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Ork buildings are very much an extension of this playstyle. They're relatively cheap and fast to construct, any Ork unit can build them, and every single one has some kind of little grot with a machine gun on it at least. There are no zoning laws here. Even Ork grocery stores and kindergartens are designed to be defensive turrets, apparently. So basically, you want to more or less barf buildings out across the entire map as you advance. Most of them aren't very durable, but if your opponent has to navigate through a valley of scrap piles that are all shooting at them, that's going to wear them down at the very least.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The core of an Ork army is still the melee Slugga Boyz and the ranged Shoota Boyz, filling out the front with durable but mostly expendable troops that want to outnumber the enemy if possible. When I really needed to hold the line, though, I opted for Beast Snagga Boyz, an even meaner, and slightly more expensive, melee option who can be equipped with mid-range shotguns. I guess you could think of these as the unhinged hillbillies to the Sluggas' rowdy football hooligans.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The key to a lot of my Orky triumphs, though, actually turned out to be cavalry. Squighog Boyz charge into the fight on the backs of terrifying, sharp-toothed squighogs that are great at finding an opening in an Imperial Guard defensive line. And once they're stuck into the trenches, well, those poor humies don't stand much of a chance. For a faction that is best known for mass frontal assaults, I quite enjoyed the more tactical playstyle that these mounted boyz enable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wurrboys add a caster option to the roster, while extra-expendable Gretchen and the slightly bulkier Mekboy keep your smoke-belching war machines in working order. The Stormboyz are another option for dealing with hardened defenses, using what is really more of a rocket with some straps on it than a proper jetpack to leap over the top of bunkers and sandbags.</p><p>It would be hard to imagine Dawn of War without the Orks.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of other, more specialized tools in the Ork arsenal, too. Flash Gitz are great at punching through the armor on hapless Space Marines or the various vehicles and mechanical monstrosities the other factions field. The stompy Deff Dread can mix it up with melee superunits that would tear the average ork to shreds. And when you really just need to make a hole in something at whatever cost, Bomb Squigs seem more than happy to sacrifice themselves to take out harder targets and enemy structures.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Orks have never been my main faction in 40K, but it would be hard to imagine Dawn of War without them. They love a challenge, and rejoice in the idea of finding the biggest and strongest foes to test their mettle against, and I can respect that. And I had a lot of fun messing around with them, even if they won't be my first choice on your average day. Especially seeing my squads of Boyz swell in numbers as they levelled up felt thematically appropriate and fantastically satisfying.And of course, we can't forget the centerpiece of every Ork incursion: the Warboss. Dawn of War 4 has two of them, actually, with fairly different playstyles and campaign goals. You can learn more about them in our hands-on Ork campaign preview coming later in the month. Until then, you can get a look at the boyz in all their glory in the Ork faction CGI trailer, and learn more about the development of Dawn of War 4 with our developer interviews, all part of this month's IGN First.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-hands-on-deep-dive-with-the-ork-faction-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Remake looks to have been delayed.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has announced a sweeping company restructure that will result in the cancelation of six games including its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake</a>, and a delay to a further seven titles. Two Ubisoft studios will be closed completely as a result of the changes, while others are subject to further layoffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the half dozen games that have been fully scrapped, Ubisoft is only publicly naming one today — its long-awaited Sands of Time remake that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-remake-ubisoft-montreal">rebooted once already</a>. Three of the canceled games were new IPs, while one was a mobile game. Ubisoft's core focus going forward, the company has said, will be on open-world games and live-services.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No specific detail has been given of the seven titles that Ubisoft has delayed, either, though this number does include the unannounced game once set for launch before March 31 that is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">widely expected to be the company's Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remaster</a>. This will now launch in the coming financial year — so before March 31, 2027.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft Stockholm will fully close as a result of the changes, having previously collaborated on Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, alongside mobile studio Ubisoft Halifax (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shuts-down-assassins-creed-rebellion-developer-halifax-studio-just-weeks-after-it-unionized">news of which first broke last week</a>). "Restructurings" have also taken place at Ubisoft offices in Abu Dhabi, at Trials studio RedLynx and at Massive, home to The Division. In addition, all teams will be required to return to in-office working five days a week, albeit with an annual allowance of remote-working days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We went through a thorough review of projects across December [and] January, with the current market evolution in mind — which is consistently more selective," Ubisoft's chief financial officer Frederick Duguet told IGN today. "You've seen the last quarter showing a never-before-seen level of competition. Competition and selection is here to stay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you are coming in number one, number two, with great content quality in a given segment, then you can have a very strong reward in terms of player reception and financial performance. That's what really informed our pipeline review. We selected what would be the best projects to put the Creative Houses in the best position to succeed in that market."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a sign of how vast an impact Ubisoft expects this restructure to have, as well as how badly it feels it is needed, the company has scrapped its previous guidance for the full financial year and now expects net bookings of around €1.5 billion ($1.75 billion), down by €330 million ($386 million).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Via a statement shared with IGN, Ubisoft said this huge reduction reflected changes to the company's upcoming release pipeline following the implementation of its updated development roadmap, and the decision to "postpone negations on certain partnerships" in the context of its new operating model.</p><p>"Competition is here to stay..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, the shakeup comes as Ubisoft finally lays out how its global development might is to be split into five "Creative Houses" that will operate as independent business units — the first of which was detailed last year. The previously-established Vantage Studios now encompasses the development of Ubisoft's three biggest brands (Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six) and soon the remaining divisions will take on themed groups that cover the company's remaining franchises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative House 2 will be dedicated to shooters, and look after The Division, Ghost Recon, and Splinter Cell. Creative House 3 will focus on live experiences, including For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, and Skull &amp; Bones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative House 4 will feature narrative driven and fantasy-orientated series including Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil (yes, seemingly Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 still lives). Finally, Creative House 5 will center on family and casual gaming, including Just Dance, Uno, Hasbro, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, and Invincible: Guarding the Globe.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Prince of Persia: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Here's the entire Prince of Persia gameography, from Mechner/Broderbund's original to Ubisoft's many sequels.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="6b57afb47ef56"><a title="AC Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b57afb47ef56/ac-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft has announced a major organisational restructure to refocus its initiatives and improve efficiency.</p>
<p>In a press release, the company confirmed that it plans to "close several studios" and "continue restructuring throughout the Group" in order to achieve its goals. It reconfirmed the closure of its Halifax studio, along with restructuring at Abu Dhabi, RedLynx and Massive. It will also reinforce a working structure of five days in office environments, which will be supported by yearly allowances to work from home.</p>
<p>Naturally, news of studio closures also means that several games – six, to be precise – have been discontinued. This includes <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/prince_of_persia_the_sands_of_time_remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> along with three brand new IPs and a mobile game. Yes, we know that totals five, so who knows what the sixth is.</p>
<p>On the flip side, seven unspecified titles will be granted additional development time to ensure they meet the quality standards set by Ubisoft. One of these games, originally scheduled to launch in fiscal year 2026, has been pushed to fiscal year 2027.</p>
<p>Ubisoft will primarily focus on open-world games and 'Games as a Service' titles, which it says will be supported by "targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, including accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI." Good lord...</p>
<p>Starting from April, Ubisoft's operating model will centre around five "creative houses", each of which will be wholly responsible for the games it creates, including development and marketing. Each house will focus on specific genres, and the general outline looks a little like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>CH1 - Flagship (<strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong>, <strong>Far Cry,</strong> <strong>Rainbow Six</strong>)</li>
<li>CH2 - Shooters/Competitive titles (<strong>The Division</strong>, <strong>Ghost Recon</strong>, <strong>Splinter Cell</strong>)</li>
<li>CH3 - Live Service Games (<strong>For Honor</strong>, <strong>The Crew</strong>, <strong>Riders Republic</strong>, <strong>Brawlhalla</strong>, <strong>Skull &amp; Bones</strong>)</li>
<li>CH4 - Narrative Adventures (<strong>Anno</strong>, <strong>Might &amp; Magic</strong>, <strong>Rayman</strong>, <strong>Prince of Persia</strong>, <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</strong>)</li>
<li>CH5 - Family Friendly Games (<strong>Just Dance</strong>, <strong>Idle Miner Tycoon</strong>, <strong>Ketchapp</strong>, <strong>Hungry Shark</strong>, <strong>Invincible: Guarding the Globe</strong>, <strong>Uno</strong>, <strong>Hasbro</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, Ubisoft will be taking the next three years or so to completely refocus its portfolio and effectively reallocate its resources.</p>
<p>It's likely that we'll see the effects of this major announcement come to fruition over the coming days and weeks, so we'll be sure to let you know of any future developments. Ubisoft itself will be sharing additional information on <strong>12th February 2026</strong>.</p>

              <p>The very first design for Pokémon mascot Pikachu was a delightfully chubby little fellow. Chunkachu, as it’s lovingly known, was Mitsuhiro Arita’s original drawing for the 1996 Japanese Pokémon card, and it gave the yellow mouse a lot more to love than he has in most modern renditions. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of <em>Pokémon</em> this year, Takara Tomy is releasing a proper chungus of a plushie in that original design.</p> <p>It’s going to be a very busy year for&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>. 2026 is the 30th anniversary of not only the release of the very first&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> games, Japan’s <em>Pocket Monsters </em><em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em> on February 27 of 1996, but also the very first Japanese <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards with October 20, 1996’s 1st Starter &amp; Expansion Pack, meaning the celebrations are going to last the whole year. And that’s a very good excuse to remember how Pikachu used to look, both in the game and on the cards, before he got the Mounjaro.</p>

The extremely cuddle-able stuffed toy is 7,480 yen, or about $47, which isn’t too bad for a 40 cm tall cuddly.

But for the most part, the far more slimmed-down rendition of Pikachu is the recognizable emblem of the entire franchise.

<p>Ubisoft has announced that its new operating model features 5 Creative Houses, supported by a Creative Network. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Ubisoft has just announced a major restructure to the organization, with the new model focusing on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures and GaaS-native experiences</a>. This has led to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of the Prince of Persia Remake</a> and several other titles. Moreover, several studios will be closed, and layoffs are expected across the company. Check out how the new model will function below. </p>

<p>As revealed in the latest <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, the new operating model for Ubisoft features 5 Creative Houses and will start from April 2026. It is supported by a Creative Network that will provide development resources, shared Core Services, and a reshaped HQ. The new decentralized model will lead to 3 significant changes: </p>



<ul>
<li>Firstly, the game development and go-to-market functions will be combined for a gamer-centric approach, and they will be fully responsible for brand development, content strategy, and editorial direction. </li>



<li>The new Creative Houses have been shaped by distinctive genres, which are led by “high-profile, incentivized teams with a unique set of expertise in those genres.”</li>



<li>Lastly, the teams will have full financial ownership and account for economic performance.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-creative-houses-have-been-divided-by-genre">Ubisoft’s Creative Houses Have Been Divided by Genre</h2>



<ul>
<li>The first Creative House is the newly formed Vantage Studios, which will work on Ubisoft’s largest established franchises, aiming to turn them into “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual billionaire brands</a>“: Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. </li>



<li>Creative House 2 will focus on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences: The Division, Ghost Recon, and Splinter Cell. </li>



<li>The third Creative House will be centered around live experiences: For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, and Skull &amp; Bones. </li>



<li>Creative House 4 will feature immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes: Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil. </li>



<li>The last and final Creative House will be dedicated to casual and family-friendly titles: Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Globe, Uno, and Hasbro. </li>
</ul>



<p>On top of these, Ubisoft is working on 4 new IPs, including March of Giants. The division of these IPs across the Creative Houses will be revealed at a later stage. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ubisoft is canceling six games in development, including its troubled remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. The publisher is also delaying seven other games in its development pipeline.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-cancelled-6-games-including-the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/"><em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a>, Ubisoft held a call with select media to announce it is undergoing a “major organisational, operational and portfolio reset.” It plans to accomplish this via three pillars: new operating model, a “refocused portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap," and “the rightsizing of the organization.”</p><p>A <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">press release</a> states:</p><p>“Ubisoft's strategic decision to undertake this major reset is driven by the continued shift toward a persistently more selective AAA market and an increasingly competitive shooter landscape, combined with the growing challenge for publishers to create brands in a context of higher costs. Nevertheless, when successful, exceptional AAA content has more financial potential than ever. While last years’ progress with its production processes translated into improved levels of quality for Ubisoft games in 2025, today’s market environment requires that the Group step-changes how it is organized and operates with a view to delivering exceptional games quality at more competitive costs.”</p><p>This new operating model will center on five creative houses, each responsible for various Ubisoft IPs and possessing expertise in distinct genres (including its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-creates-new-subsidiary-for-its-biggest-franchises-with-tencent-as-minority-owner">new subsidiary Vantage Studios</a>). This simplified structure is designed to facilitate execution of the company’s strategy to focus more on “Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences, supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, including accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.” This new organizational structure will begin in early April.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>After conducting a thorough portfolio review, it was decided that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake will be canceled. The game was<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2020/09/10/ubisoft-remakes-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time"> first announced</a> in September 2020 with a 2021 launch date and was originally helmed by Ubisoft's Indian studios in Mumbai and Pune. After suffering <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/02/05/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-indefinitely">a pair of delays</a>, development shifted to Ubisoft Montreal in 2022. During Ubisoft Forward in 2024, The Sands of Time remake <a href="https://gameinformer.com/ubisoft-forward/2024/06/10/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-is-coming-in-2026">resurfaced with a 2026 launch window</a>. Its most recent update came in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/16/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-shows-signs-of-life-with-small-update">June 2025</a> with a social media post reconfirming the game's continued development.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft has also ceased development of four unannounced games, which consisted of three new IPs and a mobile title, stating these titles, along with Prince of Persia, “do not meet the new enhanced quality as well as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria”.</p><p>Additionally, Ubisoft is delaying seven unannounced games “in order to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation.” One of the games was slated to launch in Fiscal Year (FY) 26 and will now arrive during FY 27. While we don’t know what these projects are yet, one of them is reportedly the heavily rumored (but not officially confirmed) remake of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, which appeared on PEGI’s website in December as<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-has-been-listed-on-pegis-website/"> Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced</a>. Ubisoft also states it has four new IPs in development, including March of Giants, an upcoming MOBA it <a href="https://www.amazongamestudios.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-march-of-giants">acquired from Amazon Games</a> last month.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft has been undergoing a restructuring over the past year following disappointing launch performances for some of its recent AAA titles, such as Star Wars Outlaws. It created its Vantage Studios subsidiary in 2025 to oversee the Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry franchises. Earlier this month, it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/07/ubisoft-shuts-down-recently-unionized-halifax-studio">shuttered Ubisoft Halifax</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/ubisoft-proposes-to-lay-off-55-employees-at-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-developer">proposed layoffs to The Division developer Massive Entertainment</a> after conducting similar restructurings at its <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-redlynx-says-up-to-60-positions-could-be-cut-in-restructuring-proposal">RedLynx</a> and Abu Dhabi studios.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/21/ubisoft-cancels-prince-of-persia-remake-and-5-other-games-as-part-of-major]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft has closed two studios and cancelled six projects - including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake - as part of a major restructuring effort that will also see delays for seven games.
</p>
<p>
The moves are part of what Ubisoft calls a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset" as it looks to respond to a "persistently more selective AAA market and an increasingly competitive shooter landscape". The restructuring will see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", respectively focused on "scaling and extending" its biggest properties (including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six); on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences (The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell); on live experiences (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, The Crew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a>, Brawlhalla, Skull &amp; Bones); on immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes (Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good &amp; Evil), and on casual and family games.
</p>
<p>
The first major impact of this significant organisational shift is the closure of Ubisoft's Halifax mobile studio and Stockholm studio, with "restructuring" also confirmed for the publisher's Abu Dhabi, RedLynx, and Massive teams. It's unclear how many employees will lose their jobs as result of these changes, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">IGN reports</a> the move is also being accompanied by a mandate for all remaining staff to return to in-office work five days a week, albeit with an annual allowance of remote-working days.
</p>
<p>
Amid this major shake-up, Ubisoft has confirmed the cancellation of six in-development games it says "do not meet the new enhanced quality [and] more selective portfolio prioritisation criteria". Four of these titles have never been announced (three being new IPs and one a mobile game), and the only cancelled title it has explicitly named is its embattled Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">unveiled in 2020</a>, and which has suffered multiple delays in the years since then. When last we heard of the remake, Ubisoft had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">narrowed its release window</a> down to between 1st January and 31st March 2026. As such, its cancellation is unexpected.
</p><p>
Alongside these cancellations, Ubisoft is delaying seven  unspecified games "to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met" and to "maximise long-term value creation". Notably, this includes the unannounced game widely believed to be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">much-rumoured Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a> - which will now launch in Ubisoft's next financial year, starting April 2026, rather than the current one it was previously announced for. All this has lead Ubisoft to revise its guidance for the full financial year, saying it now expects net bookings of around €1.5bn - a reduction of €330m.
</p>
<p>
"These measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wrote in a statement accompanying today's announcement. "The portfolio refocus will have a significant impact on the Group's short term financial trajectory, particularly in fiscal years 2026 and 2027, but this reset will strengthen the Group and enable it to renew with sustainable growth and robust cash generation. Ubisoft is entering a new phase – one designed to reclaim creative leadership and build value for players and stakeholders over the long term."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Every new season of anime always asks the beleagured adult anime fan to sort the wheat from the chaff, or the new josei from the glut of shonen isekai slop. As the most <a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love/"><u><em>Nana</em>-pilled blogger</u></a> you’ll ever have the pleasure to read, this is my burden each season.&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josei_manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Josei</u></a> is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Djo_manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shojo </u></a>what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinen_manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>seinen </u></a>is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dnen_manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shonen</u></a>; it's an adult-oriented genre marketed primarily toward older women rather than men. Likewise, their narratives leave a helluva lot more to stew on with their heavier themes than your ragamuffin anime. While I don’t often get my josei prayers answered, this <a href="https://gizmodo.com/there-is-almost-too-much-anime-to-watch-this-month-2000704345?ref=aftermath.site"><u>year's crop of anime</u></a> has yielded promising fruits through a new Crunchyroll show I’ve been digging called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_with_Witch?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Journal With Witch</u></em></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DX6mmkoByyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Journal with Witch | Official Trailer | Crunchyroll"></iframe></figure><p><em>Journal With Witch</em>, originally created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoko_Yamashita?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Tomoko Yamashita</u></a> and animated by studio Shuka, is a drama set at a deeply emotional point in the lives of two women. The first is Makio, a relatively successful 35-year-old author whose relationship with her sister, Minori, was so toxic that they cut off all ties. That decision rears its ugly head in the worst possible way when Makio is called in to identify the bodies of her sister and her husband, who died in a car accident. Although Makio doesn’t appear at any stage of the grieving cycle after identifying her sister, that act leads to a sudden reunion with the other woman at the center of this story: Asa, her 15-year-old niece, whom she hasn’t seen in years. Their tragic meeting triggers a new relationship between the two, as they wrestle with mourning the loss and figuring out how to continue together, making up for what the other lacks to get there.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s got me so geeked about <em>Journal With Witch</em> isn’t the big sads in store from its premise but how it showcases its two heroines’ mourning without ever letting the story collapse into agonizing wallowing. This tonal balance is lampshaded with pretty stark clarity from its opening scene.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than opening with their first meeting, the show jumps to some unknown point in the future of their relationship. Here, we see Makio clanking away at her littered desk, writing, while Asa hums a tune nearby as she does the dishes. Makio interrupts Asa with a deadpan request for her to sing a different Justin Bieber bop, prompting Asa to belt out the first syllables of “Baby” before the story abruptly snaps back to the beginning. It’s a cute, disarming moment that makes the show’s thesis plain. This anime is just as much about the relationship these two forge together as it is about how they cope with the death that inadvertently casts them into each other’s orbit.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Shuko</span></figcaption></figure><p>This framing also clarifies who these women are at the outset by giving viewers a peek at where they’ll ultimately wind up in their relationship. Asa, for instance,&nbsp; is a girl who just wants to graduate middle school without being labeled as “the girl whose parents died.” Makio, on the other hand, is an isolated writer who—at least as far as she’ll admit—feels nothing upon hearing that her sister and brother‑in‑law passed away, on account of their relationship having been FUBAR for years. Yet Makio never projects her own hard feelings toward her sister onto Asa. Instead, she allows her niece to feel her emotions, however big or small they may be, treating them as wholly her own and never something to be ashamed of.</p><p>Throughout the show, <em>Journal With Witch</em> traces how Makio and Asa gradually become a safe harbor for each other, even though both arrive in this new arrangement carrying their own emotional baggage. Makio, for instance, routinely offers Asa blunt, matter‑of‑fact guidance—an unexpected role for someone who’s otherwise shy and who never loved Asa’s mother. Makio suggests that Asa journal her feelings in a diary with full confidence that Makio will never read what she writes. <em>Journal With Witch</em> also grounds their collective healing in the mundanity of routine as they re-establish a new normal: low‑effort meals, slow walks, and long conversations about the finer points of literary techniques can work as a way to cope with loss.&nbsp;</p><p>While it's too early to see what impact Asa has on Makio, who is still guarded around her toxic sister’s child, it’ll surely be a watershed moment for both of them whenever they grow close enough to cross that bridge.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLZhRSC1gjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Jaadugar: A Witch in Mongolia Teaser PV |July 2026"></iframe></figure><p>My only wish is that the rest of the anime seasons in 2026, save for Science Saru’s<a href="https://x.com/sciencesaru/status/2006380076749734037?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u> <em>Jaadugar: A Witch in Mongolia</em></u></a>, bring about a resurgence of josei in the anime landscape. Lord knows we could use a few fewer stories about bombast and more about pensive reflections on the human condition and the relationships we make and leave behind. And from the few episodes I’ve seen of <em>Journal With Witch</em>, it's starting to feel like the josei era is so back. </p>
