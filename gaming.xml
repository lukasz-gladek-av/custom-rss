			<p>Today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-game-ready-572-16-driver-available-rtx-5090-rtx-5080-dlss-4-support/">NVIDIA app and GeForce Game Ready driver update</a> had a lot of big stuff, like the release of DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation for 75 games and apps, the new Override functionality, and more. However, NVIDIA has also sneaked in a brand new feature they hadn't previously disclosed: Smooth Motion. Essentially, this is driver-based frame generation that owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards can toggle globally or per game.</p>
<p>Here's what NVIDIA said about it:</p>
<p><em>NVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new driver-based AI model that delivers smoother gameplay by inferring an additional frame between two rendered frames. For games without DLSS Frame Generation, Smooth Motion is a new option for enhancing your experience on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.</em></p>
<p><em>To enable Smooth Motion, select a compatible DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 game in Graphics &gt; Program settings of NVIDIA app. Scroll down the list of options on the right to reach “Driver Settings”, and switch Smooth Motion on.</em></p>
<p><em>Smooth Motion can be applied to games running at native resolution, with super resolution technologies, or other scaling techniques, typically doubling the perceived frame rate.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This sounds like the NVIDIA equivalent of <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fluid-motion-frames-2-ai-optimization-performance-enhancements-low-latency-frame-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's Fluid Motion Frames 2</a>, although, in this case, it's a full-fledged AI model, which is not surprising given the company's focus on artificial intelligence. Sure, there are already ways to inject frame generation in games that do not support it natively, like Lossless Scaling. However, we're definitely eager to check out Smooth Motion and see how well it handles frame generation across several older games. Stay tuned for our impressions.</p>
<p>Today's Game Ready driver is also optimized for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, which launches in a few days with DLSS Super Resolution support, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, which is out today on PC with DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, Reflex, and Ray Tracing for ambient occlusion, shadows, and reflections. DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will be added in a future update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel's Spider-Man 2 - Announce Trailer | PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOJaeD0Si04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>By the way, there are improvements to <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-video-super-resolution-out-now-testing-shows-significantly-sharper-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Video Super Resolution</a> as well, thanks to a more efficient AI model that NVIDIA says uses up to 30% fewer GPU resources at its highest quality setting. RTX Video Super Resolution now also upscales HDR videos, so when viewing HDR videos below your display's resolution in the browser, they will be automatically upscaled to your native display resolution.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also added a GPU Utilisation feature for RTX video when Quality is set to Auto. Setting GPU Utilization to High will use as much GPU power as necessary to provide the best quality super resolution available on the installed graphics card.</p>

			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard developers and writers have been laid off, while BioWare continues working on the next entry in the Mass Effect series under the leadership of veterans from the original trilogy.</p>
<p>In a blog post shared <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/">yesterday</a>, BioWare provided an update on the studio, saying that, now that Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been released, a core team is working under the leadership of veterans including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, Parrish Ley, on the next Mass Effect game. At the current stage of development, BioWare doesn't need the support from the full studio, and has <em>"worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit."</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this restructuring, in reality, meant layoffs. According to posts on LinkedIn and Bluesky, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1idp2wt/various_developers_and_writers_have_been/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks subreddit</a>, writers and developers who worked on Dragon Age: The Veilguard at BioWare no longer work at the studio. These include Lead Writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lgw2zbjhfc2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trick Weekes</a>, Lead Editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/karinww.bsky.social/post/3lgw2z5u3js2z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karin West-Weekes</a>, Narrative Editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryancorm.bsky.social/post/3lgw7ga2li22x">Ryan Cormier</a>, Producer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jencheverie.bsky.social/post/3lgw5mb2srs27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jennifer Cheverie Cott</a>, Associate Game Producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7290469609919389696-Nh1q/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Steed</a>, Senior Product Manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lina-a-14642294_ill-write-up-a-proper-open-to-work-post-activity-7290515415674327040-ZOC6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lina Anderson</a>, and Senior Systems Designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kaieta.bsky.social/post/3lgvksfm67k2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michelle Flamm</a>. Insider Gaming's Mike Straw also confirmed that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1idp2wt/comment/ma0v0qx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few dozen developers</a> were also laid off. Since Dragon Age: The Veilguard only reached 1.5 million players, missing expectations by nearly 50%, it's not too surprising that BioWare is being impacted by the game's underperformance. However, it's still disingenuous to hide these layoffs behind restructuring claims.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/">review.</a></p>

Just as he was leading the charge close to the control room where everyone in the game is monitored, he has to watch his close friend Park Jung-bae (Lee Seo-hwan)—Player 390—murdered for participating in the revolt. Oh Young-il (Lee Byung-hun), originally the masked overseer of the game and known as The Front Man, ends his puzzling charade as Player 001 by killing the revolting contestants who believed him to be an ally. And now, we know a little of what happened after all of that.</p><p>In one photo, we see Gi-hun handcuffed to a bed, angrily looking up at a figure. Since The Front Man inexplicably decided to not kill Gi-hun for leading the revolt, some form of imprisonment had to be the next course of action. Another newly released photo shows Oh Young-il, whose actual name in the show is Hwang In-ho, pensively staring at The Front Man’s mask inside the cozy confines of his decadent lair. Even though he successfully stopped an insurgency, perhaps his despondence  is tied to complicated feelings with a competition he’s won in the past that still didn’t buy him the peace he sought. </p><figure id="" data-id="92733b45291c34befbf00c4a90dbda50" data-recommend-id="image://92733b45291c34befbf00c4a90dbda50" data-format="png" data-width="695" data-height="484" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Front Man looking angry" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Front Man looking angry" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Noh Ju-han/Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="92733b45291c34befbf00c4a90dbda50" data-recommend-id="image://92733b45291c34befbf00c4a90dbda50" data-format="png" data-width="695" data-height="484" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Front Man looking angry" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Although splitting the final story into two seasons hurt the momentum of season 2, these small glimpses into the final episodes of <em>Squid Game</em> hint at all loose ends being tied up (or killed) by the time we’re done with our final binge.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Classic Themes, released on the PS5s for PlayStation’s 30th Anniversary, will be gone on January 30, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, you read that right. Today might be the last time you will see and hear the classic tune and appearance you experienced every time you booted up your PlayStation 5. However, everything is not lost, as the console maker revealed they are working “behind the scenes to bring these special designs back in the months ahead.” However, that doesn’t mean that there are “plans to create additional themes in the future.” They are just celebrating the legacy of PlayStation hardware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering, for a limited time, players could choose between multiple different themes for their PlayStation 5: 30th Anniversary, PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, or PlayStation 4. These themes add special effects inspired by the console generation to the homepage and during the boot-up process, creating a nostalgic impact every time you switch on your console or scroll through the games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Themes were introduced on PlayStation consoles during the PS3 and PS4 eras, and players could change the backgrounds, sounds, and icon appearances for their home screens on the fly. However, since the PS5, PlayStation has decided to use dynamic game images as backgrounds and completely dropped the idea of themes. It was nice to have them back for some time, and players hope they return soon.</p>



<p>In other news, PlayStation has announced that the future of PS Plus games will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-focus-on-ps5-games-for-future-ps-plus-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focus on PS5 Games</a>. PC users have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-will-incentive-users-with-psn-accounts-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incentivised to use PSN accounts</a>. Also, here are this month’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-2025-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free PS Plus games</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-review-an-action-packed-paranormal-portal/1900-6417278/" data-ref-id="1900-6417278">Control</a> may want to take note that there's a new third-person action-RPG that blends magic and gunplay. Nesting Games has announced The Directorate: Novitiate, a game that puts players in control of Kana Luna. By day, Kana is just a normal young woman living in Los Angeles in 2006. But by night, Kana goes by the codename Mercury while working as a magical assassin for the criminal underworld. In the first-look trailer below, Mercury uses her innate fighting and magic skills to take on human foes and otherworldly threats.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lfQXCis_qI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9lfQXCis_qI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As Mercury, Kana can upgrade her magical abilities to further refine her combat options. Mercury isn't limited to only using guns in battle, and she can incorporate spells into her offense as well. Additionally, the game will be divided between Mercury's activities after dark--including her hunt for a supernatural serial killer--and her normal life as Kana during the day.</p><p>Outside of her working hours, Kana can pursue friendships or romance with the people she meets. However, those choices may endanger Kana's loved ones when the two sides of her life collide. According to Nesting Games, players will ultimately have the option of deciding whether Mercury will stay loyal to "the Edicts of the Directorate" or if she will decide to retain her humanity as Kana. Those choices will define Mercury's portrayal in the game.</p><p>The Directorate: Novitiate can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883830/The_Directorate_Novitiate/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlisted on Steam</a>, and early access is expected to debut later this year. For now, there's no word about whether The Directorate: Novitiate will also be available on consoles.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has confirmed the title, setting, and release window of the next piece of DLC for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2/" data-ref-id="5000-479459">Tom Clancy's The Division 2.</a> It's titled Battle for Brooklyn and will be released before the end of 2025.</p><p>The Division 2 was released in 2019 and has seen a healthy amount of post-launch support from Ubisoft since then. 2020's Warlords of New York DLC brought the series back to Manhattan, the setting of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division/" data-ref-id="5000-184123">first game in the series</a>. Ubisoft had previously teased that a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/72VfO2i8dx7NAhQ2DAHNJ5/year-6-the-division-2-the-road-ahead" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC set in Brooklyn</a> was in the works for Year 6 of support, but it faced a series of delays as Ubisoft focused on other aspects of the game.</p><p>As recently as January 28, <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884255116636705006" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft told players</a> that the DLC would not ship during the Year 6 series of seasonal updates "to ensure we deliver the best possible experience." While that caused worry that the DLC could slip out of 2025 as well, Ubisoft took to X today, January 30, to share the first piece of key art and the title of the DLC.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884982710440993240" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Agents!

			<p>NC America has officially revealed today that Blade &amp; Soul NEO, the remaster of Blade &amp; Soul, will be available for free on February 25 on PC in North America and Europe. Those who are excited to dive into the iconic fantasy universe will be able to download the game ahead of time, with it being available to download on February 11. Then, to prepare for the full release of Blade &amp; Soul NEO, you'll be able to create and customize your character on February 18.</p>
<p>This remaster will be completely free-to-play and provides a visually elevated experience, as well as the beloved original storyline, along with new gameplay features. This includes combat upgrades, Infinite Windwalk, and more.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>To be able to jump into Blade &amp; Soul NEO early and create your character, you will need to use NCSOFT's PURPLE platform, which is where you will also pre-load the game on February 11. Then, the Character Creator will unlock on February 18, which will allow you to reserve the name of your character and then customize and style your character to your liking before jumping in on February 25.</p>
<p>For those who want to get in touch with their artistic side, there will be two competitions for Blade &amp; Soul NEO, where you can create Loading Screen art and potentially win, allowing your art to be featured as an in-game loading screen. Additionally, there is the Costume Design contest, which allows the winner to have their personally designed costume available in-game. The contests will last 30 days and will be hosted via the <a href="https://discord.gg/bladeandsoulofficial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blade &amp; Soul Discord</a>.</p>
<p>For those who want to get a little extra cosmetic package in the game, you can pre-register for free on the <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/opt-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>. Additionally, there is also the option to purchase an <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/news/article/14645/bns-neo-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive pre-order package</a>, which is currently available. To purchase the Master Package, it will set you back $59.99, giving you a full Haran Outfit and Haran Weapon Skin. You'll also get Chromatic Thread, 6,000 NCoin, and more. Alternatively, there is also the Ascendant Package, which is $29.99, and the Trainee Package, which is $9.99.</p>
<p>They all offer different rewards, which you can find out more about on the official Blade &amp; Soul website, which provides images of the rewards you will get for purchasing the packages.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/date-everything-delayed-will-no-longer-launch-on-perfect-release-date.1096095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sassy Chap Games and publisher Team17 have announced that upcoming dating sim&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, meaning it'll no longer hit what would have been its perfect release date.</p>

<p>Announced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim" rel="nofollow">July last year</a>, the game was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">delayed to Valentine's Day</a>, but it's been pushed back once again. It'll now launch in June, although the two studios haven't announced a new fixed date for&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>yet, ironically.</p>

<p>In a press release, lead designer Ray Chase says that while&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has reached the point at which the game is complete without the studio compromising its "bonkers artistic vision", he and Sassy Chap got "too confident" that they could test all of the game's pathways and outcomes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-delayed-again-keyes.jpg?itok=jgbO_Q73 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-delayed-again-keyes.jpg?itok=AjvTviz6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>sadly won't meet its perfect release date of February 14th.</figcaption></figure><p>Chase goes on to say that&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>'s "bug list is finally starting to dwindle down", but that it would have been a "disservice" to release the game with "so many outstanding glitches", hence the new June release window.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, by the way, it is indeed apparently possible to date the glitches in question. Chase says "their name is Daemon" and that he's "currently in a love/hate relationship with them". I, for one, hope he's being serious.</p>

<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is an upcoming dating sim in which the stated aim is to allow you to, well, date everything.</p>

<p>That claim may not be entirely true, but you certainly can date a wide range of suddenly-animate objects, including your piano, your vacuum cleaner, and your overwhelming sense of existential dread.</p>




<p>The game promises 100 dateable objects, full voice acting, and branching narratives. With that many characters, I'm not surprised extra development time was needed to make sure they all made sense.</p>

<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>launches sometime in June for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends: Takeover Anthem Animated Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The trailer mainly focuses on Octane as he battles his way through a match, but we also see what Legends like Alter and Loba get up to between matches: Loba steals stuff, and Alter terrorizes her interdimensional enemies. But a crowd of spectators and fans are also featured in the trailer, with many of them cosplaying as their favorite Legend.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Octane nearly bites the dust, but comes out on top with a narrow victory. The crowd goes wild, and the trailer cuts to a shot of Titanfall 2 big bad Kuben Blisk, who also serves as the official Apex Games commissioner. Blisk looks especially pleased with himself, as if Octane's win might be something he was hoping for.</p><p dir="ltr">One thing that's notably missing from the trailer is a new Legend. The trailer shows off plenty of familiar faces, but so far, it doesn't look like Season 24 will come with a new playable Legend.</p><p>Although the trailer does provide the name of Season 24 (Takeover), it doesn't provide any details on when the season will launch. The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/takeover" rel="nofollow ">Season 24 page</a> on the official Apex Legends website simply reads, "We live to fight," followed by a promise that more details are coming next week. The end of the animated trailer says that a gameplay trailer is coming soon, but doesn't provide a specific date for the trailer or the launch of Season 24, though the new season is likely set to launch in early February.</p>

Summer Game Fest, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>-front heir apparent to E3, will return once again this year from Friday 6th to Monday 9th June.
</p>
<p>
The event will kick off with the annual Summer Game Fest livestream on Friday 6th June at 10pm UK time (that's 5pm Eastern or 2pm Pacific). 
</p>
<p>
Whether you're watching at home or in the audience at the YouTube Theatre in Los Angeles, you should expect "video game announcements, surprises and reveals" lasting two hours.

<p>
The following days will then once again see journalists and content creators report back from Summer Game Fest: Play Days, the event's hands-on portion for those invited. 
</p>
<p>
A new component this year is a business-to-business portion featuring top brass from gaming and entertainment companies discussing "the key changes, challenges and opportunities facing the global video game industry" and celebrating the medium's cultural impact. This is being co-run by Chris Dring, former boss of Eurogamer sister site GamesIndustry.biz.
</p><p>
Separate to all of that, you should expect this period to also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/summer-game-fest-2024">contain the usual mix of platform holder and publisher updates</a>. Last year brought livestreams and media briefings from Xbox, Ubisoft and Nintendo, plus the PC Gaming Show, the consumer-focused IGN Live event, the indie-focused Day of the Devs show and the annual summer update from Devolver.

<p>In an <a href="https://gamehistory.org/vghf-library-launch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on its website, VGHF says it's been building, cataloging, processing, and digitizing its collections since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-game-history-foundation-officially-launches" rel="nofollow">it started in 2017</a>, and that the library is now "ready to open [its] (virtual) doors to the public for the first time", albeit in Early Access.</p>

<p>As for what the library contains, it'll give you access to "a curated selection of materials" from the wider VGHF library, including unseen game development materials, iconic games' press kits and promos, and "over 1500 full-text searchable out-of-print video game magazines".</p>

<p>His collection includes work he did for companies like Konami, Acclaim, and Midway during the 90s and 2000s, and it's all available right now for you to view online, along with tons of other materials.</p>

<p>The library also includes "over 100 hours of footage" from developer Cyan's work on the&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>series, including never-before-seen interviews with the development team behind the likes of&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Riven</em>.</p>

<p>You can access all of this material via an interface that allows you to search for the material you want, view digital items directly in your browser, and even search for text within articles, making this one of the biggest online repositories of gaming information available right now.</p>




<p>As you might expect, the library will also be adding new materials to its archive over the coming years, so even if you don't find what you're looking for now, you may well do in the future.</p>

<p>It's the Video Game History Foundation's self-proclaimed mission to preserve, celebrate, and teach gaming history, and it's doing so through initiatives like the new online library, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/simcity-nes-prototype-digitized-and-dissected-by-video-game-history-foundation" rel="nofollow">digitizing rare game prototypes</a> and more.</p>

<p>VGHF is one of several organizations currently aiming to bring game preservation to the forefront of conversations within the industry; it joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">GOG and its Preservation Program</a> on that front.

<p>The voice cast for Sniper Elite Resistance isn’t massive, but one voice sticks out above the rest, and that’s Harry Hawker. His name has drawn attention and it’s time to reveal who has lent their talents to the 2025 Sniper Elite protagonist.</p>



<p>I covered a lot of juicy details in my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance review</a>. It was a fair assessment of a series I’m quite fond of, and one I will continue to play. I’ve predominantly been accustomed to the presence of Karl Fairburne over the years, but it’s the part-time persona of Harry Hawker who takes the lead in Sniper Elite Resistance.</p>



<p>His performance is headline-grabbing, and it’s time to remove the hood from the voice actor—kind of.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-harry-hawker-s-voice-actor-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Who is Harry Hawker’s Voice Actor in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Harry Hawker, the man who sniped. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The available information tells us it’s likely Klemens Koehring reprising his role as Harry Hawker for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>I say “likely,” because I have scoured the internet and gone to the furthest reaches of the Earth to find conclusive proof it’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2182668/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Klemens Koehring</a>. There’s nothing definitive, but all signs point to the talented voice actor—a multi-lingual extraordinaire who’s given his talents to various video games, TV, and movies.</p>



<p>Crucially, <strong>Klemens Koehring voiced Harry Hawker in Sniper Elite 4</strong>—confirmed by the game’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6528142/?ref_=nm_flmg_knf_c_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDB page</a>. I can certify Klemens is a voice actor in Sniper Elite Resistance (more on this soon) and Harry Hawker would make the most sense.</p>



<p>I’ve said the performance has garnered attention, and that’s because of the character’s distinctness and uncanny resemblance to Jason Statham. It’s been a topic of discussion for Resistance, but any press is better than none!</p>



<p>If it turns out Klemens Koehring isn’t the voice actor for Harry Hawker and is simply part of the project, we’ll be sure to update this guide and correct it.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-voice-actors-in-sniper-elite-resistance">All Voice Actors in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Voice actors in Sniper Elite Resistance. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The voice actor pool is a small one for Sniper Elite Resistance, and it includes <strong>Klemens Koehring</strong>, along with other talents such as <strong>Atilla Akinci</strong> and <strong>James Goode</strong>.</p>



<p>Atilla Akinci has voiced characters in Greedfall 2, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty. Whereas James Goode has provided voiceover work for Diablo 4, Final Fantasy 14, and also Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty.</p>



<p>There’s a wealth of talent in Sniper Elite Resistance, and it deserves to be recognized. As you can see, only names are listed, not their roles, making it slightly more difficult to declare Klemens’ role.</p>

			<p>The Lunar Awakening event has made a return to Diablo IV and will be starting on February 4 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT and will end on February 18 at the same time. Players on either the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-witchcraft-adds-the-armory-witchy-powers-and-a-new-storyline-on-the-tree-of-whispers/">Seasonal</a> or Eternal Realms will be able to take place in this event. To participate, activate any Shrine found in Sanctuary (including Nahantu) to earn 100% bonus experience (multiplicative) for two minutes and an enhanced power while earning Ancestral Favor Reputation.</p>
<p>To fully immerse yourself in the Lunar Awakening event, make sure to take a trip to Ked Bardu and go to the Northern part of town. There, you'll find Ying-Yue, who is the leader of the Lunar Night Market. This area will serve as the central hub for the Lunar Awakening event in Diablo IV. Here, you can redeem your Ancestral Favor Reputation for Unceasing Gifts from Ancestors caches. You can also get decorative Lunar Renewal-themed rewards.</p>
<p>There are Lunar Shrines spread out throughout Sanctuary, where you will have to fight off monsters in dungeons and the overworld to be able to activate the Lunar Shrines. By activating the Shrines and killing monsters, you will be able to net a significant amount of Ancestral Favor Reputation.</p>
<p>The shrines that are typically placed in the world have now been replaced with Lunar Shrines, granting you a 100% experience bonus when activated. You will be able to recognize the shrines thanks to their updated appearance to honor the year of the snake. The shrines also have a unique Map icon, so you will be able to find them with ease and won't have to spend an age exploring trying to find a lunar Shrine.</p>
<p>On the official<a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24174392/pursue-celestial-fortune-in-lunar-awakening" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Blizzard website</a>, you can find all of the Augmented Lunar Shrine effects, which have been adjusted to be in line with the Lunar Awakening event. As well as activating Shrines, Miserly Spirits spawn immediately, which will allow you to capitalize on the Shrine's augmentation.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of rewards you can get for the Lunar Awakening event in Diablo IV, including the Dragon of the Lonely Moon mount armor, Trag'Oul's Consort Mount, and more, which is also listed on the Blizzard website.</p>
<p>Will you be playing the Lunar Awakening event in Diablo IV?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-updates-paused-as-grinding-gear-focuses-on-path-of-exile-2.1096002/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-updates-paused-poe-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has announced that it's pausing updates for the first game while it works on&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>.</p>

<p>In a video message to fans, game director Jonathan Rogers says that Grinding Gear "can't really work on [upcoming update]&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>3.26 before&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>0.2.0 has shipped", and that the studio "probably need[s] to support that for a couple of weeks" after launch, too.</p>

<p>While the studio will be working on "a bunch of preproduction" for <i>Path of Exile&nbsp;</i>update 3.26, it'll be dragging across staff from the first game in order to work on the second, which Rogers says still has "major issues", making it the priority for Grinding Gear at the moment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-updates-paused-path-of-exile-2-lightning.jpg?itok=BPMhx2Ys 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-updates-paused-path-of-exile-2-lightning.jpg?itok=j17ztKKC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Updates for the first&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>are being paused while Grinding Gear works on the second game.</figcaption></figure><p>Rogers goes on to say that it's "hard to even think about" what the team might create for&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>when the sequel has "really obvious problems that need fixing".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that once&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>0.2.0 has been launched, the team will "devote as many resources as are needed" to get&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>update 3.26 finished "as soon as possible".</p>

<p>Previously, Rogers had said that dedicating resources to both&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>and its sequel "shouldn't be an issue", and that Grinding Gear Games is "set up" in a way that allows it to do so. Evidently, however, that's not the case, at least not this time.</p>

<p>You can see Rogers' full video message, which contains a little more information regarding the shift in focus, right here.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>originally started life as a major update for the first game, but eventually, its scope expanded to the point that Grinding Gear Games decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-will-be-standalone-game-closed-beta-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">make it its own title instead</a>.</p>

<p>The game was released to a broadly positive reception from players, although several issues were identified, leading Grinding Gear to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access" rel="nofollow">promise fixes for those issues</a> in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2-game-preview/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The first game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/path-of-exile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile/bwc95bzpfbs7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and you can play that one for free, too.</p>

                <p>Tomb Raider fans have been eagerly awaiting a new game in the series since 2018's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review-guerilla-girl/1900-6416982/" data-ref-id="1900-6416982">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>. But since it's anyone's guess when Lara Croft's next adventure will arrive, players may have to be satisfied by the return of one of her spin-off games.
