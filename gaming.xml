Analysts estimate Sony spent around $250m on the game, only for it to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">sell so poorly</a> that Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-wave-goodbye-to-playstation-flop-concord-as-it-goes-dark-maybe-forever">shut it down two weeks after launch</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">shuttered its developer</a>, Firewalk Studios, not long after. By contrast, Astro Bot also launched last year to universal acclaim, winning multiple awards and <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/astro-bot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selling 2.3 million copies as of March 2025</a>, one of the best-selling games on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The differences between the two games are myriad, certainly, and their development stories are quite different as well. But what Hulst has taken away from this is that there needs to be more supervision of Sony's owned studios to ensure that games veering in the direction of Concord are spotted before they become expensive failures, so they can be canceled or corrected in time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in very many different ways,” Hulst said. “The advantage of every failure . . . is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial Times spoke to multiple Sony studio heads, who said that this oversight means more focus on group testing, more communication between internal Sony studios, and closer relationships between the studios' top executives. “If we’re heading towards a giant landmine, like there’s another studio making exactly the same game, that’s good information,” said Jason Connell, art director at Ghost of Yōtei studio Sucker Punch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That comment rings especially poignant in light of Concord's failure, which analysts say occurred for a number of reasons, including an oversaturation of multiplayer, live service shooters. Hulst suggests in the interview that PlayStation isn't as intent on churning out live service games as it used to be. That said, PlayStation does have Bungie's Marathon coming up before March 2026, a game that has<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-concords-failure-and-marathons-delay-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly"> a number of Bungie fans concerned</a> amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">delays</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">staff layoffs</a>, and a general lack of information as to what the game entails.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there's another strategy Hulst also wants to pursue: he wants more, massive Sony IP. Astro Bot's success has come about over the course of multiple games, with the little robot icon growing in popularity each time. According to Financial Times, Hulst wants studios to be thinking about how their IP can be turned into bigger and bigger franchises over time, following in the footsteps of The Last of Us and Uncharted. “We take a very intentional approach to IP creation . . . understanding how a new concept can turn into an iconic franchise for PlayStation, that can then again become a franchise for people beyond gaming,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently on the docket, PlayStation has Ghost of Yōtei and Lost Soul Aside coming this year, with Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls and Housemarque's Saros for 2026. Other games such as Fairgames, Marvel's Wolverine, Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Marathon, and more remain in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Fans of cooperative climbing game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> know that ticks aren't the only bug in the game, and for the last week they've been subject to a particularly frustrating one that developers are now aware of and working to resolve: the brand new biome, the Mesa, has been missing for the last week, with only the original Alpine biome showing up in the game's seed-generated maps.</p><p>"For the last 7 days, every map has had the ALPINE," developer Team Peak wrote in a post on the game's Steam page. "Players are starting to wonder if the MESA was a dream all along. A mirage."</p><p>The developers chalk this up to one of two potential causes. One is that "[the game's map generator] randomly rolled ALPINE 7 days in a row which has a 0.78% chance of happening." While that's possible, they submit another potential cause: "Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr its (<em>sic)</em> a bug."</p><p>For the last week, climbers have been subjected to the bitter, whipping cold of the Alpine biome. But sometimes you'd rather free solo El Capitan than the north face of the Eiger. To give us all a break from the cold, the team is forcing Mesa as the game's third biome "until further notice," which they specify will be later this week.</p><p>On the beta side of the game, the developers are working on reenabling rising lava in the final level, the Kiln, and testing a photosensitive mode.</p><p>Previously, the team has been working to quickly update the game with new features, with the most recent being getting the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-is-now-steam-deck-verified-and-the-cannon-glitch-is-fixed/1100-6534220/" data-ref-id="1100-6534220">Steam Deck Verified checkmark</a> on their game, as well as adding optional cannibalism to the game in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/" data-ref-id="1100-6533552">Totally Normal Update</a> and adding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">aforementioned Mesa biome</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of Gamescom 2025, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-blackwell-rtx-5080-pc-like-latency-image-quality-install-to-play-new-games-same-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> what it has been calling the largest upgrade ever made to its GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform. The backbone is, of course, the advent of the Blackwell architecture previously seen in the GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>The Ultimate tier will be updated with RTX 5080-class (a server equivalent to the desktop GPU) GPU hardware and AMD Zen 5 CPUs. The new server hardware will deliver 62 teraflops of compute performance and a 48GB frame buffer, not to mention a performance uplift of up to 2.8x compared to the previous generation, partly thanks to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>



<p>While important, though, this hardware upgrade is just a portion of the enhancements coming to GeForce NOW that NVIDIA showed off to press, Wccftech included, at a dedicated Gamescom 2025 event. One of the new features, Cinematic Quality Streaming or CQS, is actually a set of features that includes additions like YUV 4:4:4 chroma sampling and 10-bit HDR, AV1 support with RPR (Reference Picture Resampling), new AI-based sharpness filters to reduce noise and artifacts and make games' heads-up display (HUD) clearer, and DPI awareness. The latter is important, NVIDIA Product Marketing Manager Michael McSorley explained, because sometimes GeForce NOW didn't quite catch the correct native resolution of a user device (especially laptops) and started the streaming at a lower resolution. As a result, the user got a blurrier image that certainly didn't impress them with sharpness.</p>



<p>Overall, Cinematic Quality Streaming makes quite a bit of a difference when viewed in person side-by-side, especially in a highly detailed game like Game Science's Black Myth: Wukong, which supports full path tracing. The finer details, such as vegetation and the main character's hair, were a lot sharper with CQS enabled, reducing one of the long-standing visual downsides of cloud gaming when compared to local gaming: image compression. Of course, the difference will likely be better appreciated on a large 4K display. It should be noted that, barring the first two CQS features, the rest will also be available on non-Blackwell servers.</p>



<p>NVIDIA then flexed the power of the Blackwell-enhanced GeForce NOW experience directly against the most powerful console on the market, Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro. The game selected was CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, which the new Ultimate tier can handle easily with path tracing enabled and 4K@120FPS streaming. By comparison, the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game was set to the Ray Tracing mode, which, however, locks the frame rate to 40FPS, and is also much inferior visually compared to the PC version's path tracing. With three times as powerful hardware as the PS5 Pro, NVIDIA boasts that the best console-like experience can be streamed via its upgraded cloud gaming service.</p>

<iframe title="GeForce NOW Gamescom 2025 Demo Tour" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K1kk8coHbg0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>GeForce NOW is also evolving when it comes to latency, another inherent problem with cloud gaming. The NVIDIA servers already supported Reflex, but they are now being updated with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/networking/rivermax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivermax</a> hardware packet pacing, an NVIDIA technology that enables direct data transfers to and from the GPU, delivering 'best-in-class throughput and latency with minimal CPU utilization for streaming workloads', according to the GeForce company. </p>



<p>In addition to that, NVIDIA has been working in the last couple of years with various ISPs to persuade them to add L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput). This network protocol has the potential to reduce latency when sending and receiving packets. Unfortunately, L4S has to be adopted by the ISPs; so far, Comcast, T-Mobile, and BT Group have done it, but there's many more to go across all the countries supported by GeForce NOW. Moreover, the router you're using must support L4S, too, which means even if your ISP has added L4S to its network, you may have to change the router if you've got an old one. It is, of course, far from guaranteed that ISPs will issue everyone a new compatible router for free.</p>



<p>On the local devices, NVIDIA is adding support for 90FPS streaming on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-native-steam-deck-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">native Steam Deck app</a>, 120FPS streaming on the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-soc-priced-lower-than-legion-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, 4K@120FPS streaming on LG TVs via the native GFN app, 5K@120FPS on LG OLED monitors, and 1080P@360FPS or 1440P@240FPS. At 360FPS streaming, NVIDIA showed an end-to-end latency (not just network latency) of less than 30ms, with peaks of 15-17ms, making it more than viable to play competitive shooters via GeForce NOW. Of course, there's always room for improvement, and we asked Michael McSorley whether NVIDIA would ever try to shelve a few more milliseconds of latency by creating a direct connection from the wireless gamepad to the GeForce NOW servers, like Stadia did. The Product Marketing Manager said it could happen, though they'd have to find a suitable partner on the gamepad side.</p>



<p>There's more, as NVIDIA is also extending the GFN support of racing wheel devices as well as expanding accessibility through the 2200 new Steam games that will benefit from the new Install-to-Play feature, not to mention a limited-time GFN trial available to stream Fortnite directly via Discord.</p>



<p>One thing is clear: NVIDIA already offers the best cloud gaming experience, and all these improvements can only bring it closer to the experience of playing locally. We'll need to do private testing of the new Blackwell-architecture GeForce NOW servers to say exactly how much. The rollout will gradually begin next month with only 20 games supported, though that list is expected to grow rapidly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After nearly 50 years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-cracker-barrel-logo-woke-trump-cooperate-greed-2000619204">Cracker Barrel</a> changed its logo last week. You probably heard or read something about it, as news of the change and the reaction to it became one of the biggest topics on the internet. And so, somehow, that leads us to a person online replacing the Cracker Barrel logo with the entirety of <em>Robocop</em> from 1987.</p> <p>On August 23, a few days after the Cracker Barrel news had swept the internet and sparked countless blogs and articles (<a href="https://kotaku.com/new-cracker-barrel-logo-woke-trump-cooperate-greed-2000619204">even we wrote about it</a>), Twitter user Kodiak posted to the dying social media site the “full 1987 film <em>RoboCop</em> rendered as the Cracker Barrel logo.” You might be wondering a few things, namely: Why? Well, don’t worry, Kodiak doesn’t want to leave you with a mystery. Why did they re-render <em>RoboCop</em> as the Cracker Barrel logo?&nbsp; “Because nothing matters,” <a href="https://x.com/thisiskodiak/status/1959402871939862841">posted Kodiak</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The full 1987 film RoboCop rendered as the Cracker Barrel logo. Because nothing matters. <a href="https://t.co/0e1UjAezJY">pic.twitter.com/0e1UjAezJY</a></p> <p>— Kodiak (@ThisIsKodiak) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThisIsKodiak/status/1959402871939862841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Is this the ideal way to watch <em>RoboCop</em>? Some might say yes. <a href="https://x.com/jenny____r/status/1959668520452862246">At least one person has seemingly watched the film on their big screen TV</a>, which is fun to think about. Another question you might be pondering—between never-ending thoughts about Cracker Barrel’s new, boring logo and what it means in relation to modern-day society—is a simple one: Is this legal? I’m not a lawyer. I’d probably say no, but these days it really does seem like law and order is out the window, and the rich and powerful can do whatever they want. Ohhh….wait, now I get why they picked <em>RoboCop</em> for this joke. Funny! (Shout out to <em><a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/a-b-testing-your-anti-woke-meltdown-e1a04224ffbb38b6">Garbage Day</a></em> for spotting this.)</p> <p>Anyway, go ahead and watch <em>RoboCop</em> until Twitter kills the video. At the moment, it has over 550k views, so it seems like Elon Musk and whoever still works at Twitter don’t care. Or they forgot the password to the account that lets them delete stuff. Either way, enjoy <em>RoboCop</em>. Or you can go buy and play that <a href="https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-new-game-2023-review-shooter-rpg-pc-1851000568">awesome <em>RoboCop</em> game from a few years back</a>. Do both at the same time? What do I care? I’m not your dad.</p>

                <p>Sony recently announced a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NBA 2K26 PS5 Slim Bundle</a> is set to arrive on September 5. As the name implies, this will include the PS5 Slim model with a disc drive, a DualSense controller, and the upcoming NBA 2K26. It's arriving on September 5, the same day NBA 2K26 launches on PS5, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch. We're still waiting on pricing details for the new bundle, but considering Sony <strong>increased the PS5's price on August 21</strong>, we're expecting it to be more expensive than previous bundles. Still, bundles like this are always popular, so set a reminder for September 5 if you're thinking about picking one up.</p><div title="6534210 - PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4175" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534210 - PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2025\/08\/22\/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/">PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2025\/08\/22\/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/">Pricing TBA</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle pulls together a PlayStation 5 console, DualSense Controller, and a digital voucher for NBA 2K26.

The base PS5 Slim now costs $550 (was $500) and PS5 Slim Digital costs $500 (was $450--and before that was $400 at launch), we're expecting this to be pricier than previous bundles. For example, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-this-ps5-slim-digital-console-bundle-for-400-before-hardware-price-increases/1100-6534138/" data-ref-id="1100-6534138">PS5 Slim Digital Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Bundle</a> was previously available for just $400, offering a value of $570. The bundle didn't last long at that promotional price, and we'd expect this upcoming NBA 2K26 bundle to be much more expensive. At the very least, we're hoping the bundle ends up being cheaper than buying everything individually. Expect to learn more as we quickly approach its September 5 release date. Availability of the bundle will vary by region. Most markets should find it on PlayStation Direct, though other local retailers may also have inventory.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you're worried about pricing--or don't need NBA 2K26, consider grabbing a PS5 at Amazon.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Besides creating many iconic cult movies like Halloween, The Thing, and Escape From New York, you may also be aware that filmmaker John Carpenter is an ardent fan of video games. Has he then finally decided to make one? Well, yes and no. Toxic Commando may bear his name in the title, but the real credit goes to developer and publisher Saber Interactive. Still, after playing this apocalyptic co-op first-person shooter for the first time at Gamescom 2025, I see how it bears his influence. This isn't just a cynical marketing stunt to put his name on the box.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to kind of tap into those '80s horror and over-the-top action films like Big Trouble in Little China, so we reached out to Carpenter, who was like, 'Yeah, this is great,'" said Saber's chief creative officer, Tim Willits. "He's played the game with us, he's helped with some concepts, he's been good about saying, 'Focus on these types of things when you tell this type of story.'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahDfS-wDsmM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ahDfS-wDsmM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It may be more accurate to describe Carpenter as having more of a consulting role rather than being deeply involved in development. But his role is also more hands-on at least in some areas: The director famously composed some of the themes for his own influential movies, and has written music that will be incorporated into the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While not directly referencing Carpenter's back catalog, the story of Toxic Commando, about a corporation seeking a new limitless power source that unwittingly awakens an evil entity, is totally the kind of idea I can imagine he might have conceived of in the peak of his filmmaking career--this evil is even named the Sludge God, which is as unapologetically B-movie as it gets.</p><p dir="ltr">Our four-player session was less focused on the story than it was on just diving into the gameplay itself. Willits recommends the best way to catch up on the backstory is through the comic book prequels Saber has produced in partnership with Dark Horse Comics.</p><p dir="ltr">"The story is very fun and quirky, but it does not get in the way," he said, though those who do want to get immersed in the story can also opt to solo the game with computer-controlled bots as teammates. That should provide a better way to appreciate the moment-to-moment chatter with the other titular commandos--the laid-back Walter, the nihilistic Ruby, the empathetic Cato, and the natural leader Astrid--each played by small-screen actors whose likenesses have also been faithfully rendered in-game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556049" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556049"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Although a session cannot have everyone picking the same character, they're not bound to specific roles on the team like in, say, a hero shooter. Every player gets to have their own personal journey in terms of loadout and classes. The latter mostly refers to the mutant abilities you have equipped from a device strapped to your chest that's keeping you from being corrupted by the Sludge God's infection. Usually, this means being able to drop area-of-effect fields that your buddies can stay in to improve their defense or offense, the kind of boost you'd want when facing down hordes of undead. There's also no restriction if everyone in your party decides to play a support class, for example.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, when it's a co-op FPS that involves blasting zombies, thoughts of Left 4 Dead aren't far behind. However, the shooter I ended up thinking about as we took on our demo mission was actually Halo, Saber having also had a hand in that game's anniversary edition remaster. Not only was the map we roamed a pretty large sandbox, with plenty of optional areas to explore and also mark with pins, we could also get around in vehicles. These are randomized in each session, so you might come across a pick-up truck or an ambulance van, or find an armored vehicle where someone can get onto the gun turret while the camera pulls back in third person for the driver. It has the same joy as piling onto a Warthog with your buddies.</p><p dir="ltr">There are some considerations to keep in mind with the vehicles you drive, though--they need gas to run, so you might need to find fuel to top up the tank. A turret also has limited ammo, so you won't be able to use it indefinitely. Some vehicles might not have the tires to handle going up some steep and muddy slopes, and it's impressive how Toxic Commando essentially makes use of the tech seen in Saber's off-road driving sims like Mudrunner and Snowrunner to give vehicles different capabilities in a variety of situations. Again, the armored vehicles are the most capable for getting around, and come with a very handy winch that can be used for pulling down barriers in the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556051" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556051"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The real technical star of the show, however, is Saber's proprietary Swarm Engine. Originally created for World War Z's huge zombie hordes, and impressively utilized for the swarm of Tyranids in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, Willits said the engine has evolved to even greater heights in Toxic Commando.</p><p dir="ltr">"The environments are much larger than they were in World War Z, so the swarms come in all sorts of different directions," he explained. "We have more super creatures, special monsters, but just like our upgrade progression system in World War Z and Space Marine 2, you have different classes and you can upgrade your abilities, loadouts, even some of your passives."</p><p dir="ltr">That also ensures there's never a dull moment. When following the objective of destroying specific tendril nodes so that we could reach a church, we encountered a swarm of undead. But even when exploring other points of interest, the engine keeps the map populated with enemies so that there's always something to shoot or contend with while trying to find loot and stock up on supplies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556054" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556054"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At times, the non-stop hordes can get overwhelming. Case in point: Toward the end of the mission, we reached the church and had to endure a siege of undead coming from all directions. Willits said Toxic Commando is probably the most difficult game the studio has made in years, given how much the action can ramp up. But that difficulty is managed in real-time by the Swarm Engine's AI director that's designed to also make you feel like the odds are against you.</p><p dir="ltr">"It keeps track of who you're fighting and balances the difficulty," he explained. "When you're playing and feel like, 'My god, I'm not going to survive,' and then you just pull through at the last second, a lot of that is the AI director."</p><p dir="ltr">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando is coming soon to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Turok knows a thing or two about rebirth. The original character debuted in a 1950s comic book but came to wider attention after Valiant Comics revived him as Turok: Dinosaur Hunter in the early '90s. It was this comic that became the basis for the game series that began on the N64, which was arguably the most influential console-based shooter of the time after GoldenEye. Following 17 years of dormancy after the mixed reception of its 2008 self-titled reboot (while it wasn't actually a commercial flop, a sequel was nonetheless canned), Saber Interactive has stepped up to the plate to make the cycle begin anew with Turok: Origins.</p><p dir="ltr">I was admittedly skeptical when it was first announced at last year's Game Awards, as it seemed to be a third-person co-op shooter. The good news from my first hands-on at Gamescom 2025 is that the game can be played in both first- and third-person, and while this preview session was about getting a feel for the co-op PvE gameplay for up to three players, members of Saber Interactive's Madrid-based team assured us that it will also be possible to play the game solo without AI allies, so as to stay true to the original single-player experience of the series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUPvMp_s5nc" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SUPvMp_s5nc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But most importantly, Turok: Origins gets back to the fundamental core of what you want from a Turok game: killing dinosaurs with big guns.</span></p><p dir="ltr">There are, of course, some twists to that formula. As the subtitle suggests, this is a revival that goes back in the timeline, to well before the original game. Turok isn't the name of a character but rather a tribe of hunters, while still very much taking its inspiration from tribes indigenous to North America. As you would expect from a team-based game, you have a choice of different classes to play as, each inspired by different spirit animals--Raven, Cougar, and Bison--which dictate the loadout and abilities you have, though you're free to change classes before each mission starts.</p><p dir="ltr">The dinos are actually referred to as Xenia, a hostile reptilian force that's predominantly made up of familiar four-legged lizards, though this also gives license to introduce some more humanoid enemies, as well as what could be best described as a troll with scales. But wisely, the first mission in this demo gave me what I wanted from the outset, which was to drop us into a prehistoric-looking jungle while being jumped by waves of raptors. They were a blast to dispatch, whether I was playing with a first- or third-person perspective, which is something that you can seamlessly switch between. The third-person option also lets you toggle which shoulder the camera is behind.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556040" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556040"></a><figcaption>Turok: Origins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The reason behind the controls feeling so good may be down to the developer confirming that the pipelines for first-person and third-person are actually separate, so they do feel distinct. You can also see some differences such as how, when hitting crouch while sprinting, you'll perform a slide in first-person but roll forward when in third-person. Melee is also an option, and even when playing in first-person, the camera will always pull back to third-person. I can see how this is more ideal for performing a variety of brutal cinematic finishers; when you've weakened a dino to the point they're glowing yellow, your prompt to move in as your hunter rips them apart from their long jaw.</p><p dir="ltr">As cool as some of these execution animations were, I couldn't do them as often as I wanted, mostly because another teammate was still raining ammo on them and finished them off before I could press the prompt in time. In a subsequent mission inside an ancient temple, the team was able to split up to tackle threats coming from different directions, which gave me more opportunity to dispatch Xenia as I saw fit. At the same time, I was also trying out each of the available, first with the automatic-toting Cougar, and then the tankier Bison and their close-range shotgun.</p><p dir="ltr">Each class also has three unique cooldown-based abilities as well as an ultimate, typical of modern class-based shooters. After a couple of missions, I found my groove with Raven's long range bow, and I was pulling off many satisfying headshots. One downside, though, was if I didn't kill them instantly, then I'd be too far away to run in for the killing blow. Despite this, it was with this Raven class that I used their abilities with the most confidence, including one where they charged up a sort of rallying cry that instantly killed weak enemies, summoned a swarm of glowing wasps to attack a nearby target, or created a temporary barrier against projectiles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556041" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556041"></a><figcaption>Turok: Origins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I nonetheless did return to Cougar for the demo's final encounter, an arena boss fight against a huge Triceratops that almost had a whiff of Monster Hunter about it. With my medium-ranged auto-plasma shots, it was a good way of landing hits from a distance while being able to dodge when it charged at me with its horns. The Cougar's ultimate is also especially useful by temporarily granting you a very powerful bow that you can let loose an infinite supply of arrows.</p><p dir="ltr">There was quite a lot to take in, as the developer ushered us through a varied and curated experience within 30 minutes. To ensure a tight pace, the dev made everyone gather in a glowing blue circle when it was time to advance to the next part of a mission--which also meant some optional paths were deliberately walled off for the demo. Even in this more linear structure, however, I still had the opportunity to use my grapple to swing up over certain walls or jump up to higher ground to take down out-of-reach enemies. That kind of platforming traversal is another hallmark from the original Turok games that carries over here.</p><p dir="ltr">While I would still prefer to be able to get the chance to experience Turok: Origins in a single-player scenario, this first hands-on has nonetheless put aside any initial doubts I might have had. In Saber Interactive Spain's hands, a franchise many had assumed would remain a fossil looks like it's getting a revival that could actually stick around this time.</p><p dir="ltr">Turok: Origins is coming soon to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

The Corpse Party: Tetralogy Pack collects the four visual novels in the Heavenly Host saga--which includes Corpse Party, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash, and Corpse Party: Blood Drive. It also marks the first time Corpse Party: Book of Shadows and Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash will be playable on Switch. All four games in the collection are presented with their original Japanese voiceover and English subtitles and are enhanced with high-definition graphics and audio.

Physical copies for this collection are available exclusively at Amazon. Digital preorders are also available.</p></div>                      </div><p>For those unfamiliar, Corpse Party is a series of supernatural horror visual novels with branching outcomes, multiple endings, and plenty of scares and gruesome murders. The first game, Corpse Party, tells the story of a friendship ritual gone horrifically awry after it transports high school student Ayumi Shinozaki and her friends to an alternate reality. Exploring the Heavenly Host Elementary institution, the group has to risk their sanity and safety to uncover the truth behind bone-chilling murders that occurred at the location, if they ever want to return home again. The version included in the collection is the 2021 version of the game that was released for PC, which itself is actually the third remake of Corpse Party originally released for the PS Vita in 2010.</p><p>The next game, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, is an ambitious anthology series released in 2011 that served as a sequel, prequel, midquel, <em>and</em> an alternate universe tale, all in one package. It builds on the events of the first game, offering players new perspectives on several of the original game's most critical events.</p><p>2012's Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko's Hysteric Birthday Bash is billed as a midquel set that takes place during the events of Corpse Party and Corpse Party: Book of Shadows. It tells the story of the ghost of Sachiko Shinozaki’s murderous birthday party at Heavenly Host Elementary.</p><p>Finally, Corpse Party: Blood Drive was released in 2014 and is set two months after Book of Shadows. Designed to be the ultimate conclusion to the Heavenly Host story arc, the story revolves around black magic, the end of the world, and a mission to resurrect fallen friends.</p><p>While Corpse Party: Blood Drive was the final game in the Heavenly Host story arc, it's not the end of the franchise. A spiritual sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/corpse-party-2-darkness-distortion-preorder-guide/1100-6522304/" data-ref-id="1100-6522304">Corpse Party 2: Darkness Distortion</a>, is set to launch in Jun 2026--giving you enough time to catch up on the previous four games with the new collection. Darkness Distortion will once again be a visual novel, this time following three high school friends as they explore the Amare Est Vivere Hospital to see if a local urban legend is true.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During Gamescom 2025 last week in Cologne, Germany, I went hands-on with No More Heroes developer Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming action game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a>, and came away with more questions than answers (but in the best way possible). Fortunately, I immediately transitioned from my hands-on preview to a couch, where I sat across from the game's director, Goichi Suda AKA Suda51, and his interpreter, and asked him the new questions I had.&nbsp;</p><p>But first, let me set the scene of my demo: before gameplay began, I watched a quick intro you've likely seen in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/06/04/grasshopper-manufacture-announces-romeo-is-a-dead-man-an-ultra-violent-sci">game's reveal trailer</a> that shows Romeo die, then be resurrected and turned into a space cop/FBI agent/expert mercenary/cyborg hybrid. From here, I was brought to a screen with three impeccably designed chocolates. I forgot the name of the first chocolate (and unfortunately didn't write it down), but it represented the game's easy mode; the orange chocolate I chose represented normal, and the ginger-infused chocolate was the game's hard mode.

Doing so was a blast, thanks to a combat system that feels fast, fluid, and visceral, with a large selection of weaponry to use. I used a machine gun, a pistol, a grasshopper-shaped rocket launcher, and a fusion rifle, of sorts, as well as a katana-like sword, a colossal two-handed sword, and more. All of them are easily accessible with a combo of buttons tied to the d-pad. I like that each gun has a different feel, and that each melee weapon features its own moveset, all in the name of dismembering and beheading hordes of zombies and everything else that stands in the way of Romeo.&nbsp;</p><p>Romeo Is A Dead Man was, by far, the bloodiest demo I saw during Gamescom, and I previewed more than two dozen games, including Resident Evil Requiem. Despite the gallons and gallons of blood, though, it comes off comedically rather than horrifically, thanks to the game's visual flair.&nbsp;</p><p>After I mowed down enough enemies in this junkyard-like area, I warped into cyberspace, another visually distinct part of the game with its own narrative ties. There was a boss at the end of this area, but I wasn't able to reach it as my time to interview Suda51 had arrived. Before diving into what I learned from my interview, I'll close out my preview thoughts here by saying I continue to grow increasingly intrigued by what the hell Romeo Is A Dead Man is doing each time I see and play it. It's hard to explain what this game is, but that's part of its charm, and I can't wait to find out how all its seemingly disparate pieces connect when it launches next year.&nbsp;</p><h2>Discussing Romeo Is A Dead Man And Grasshopper Manufacture With Suda51</h2>

<p><em><strong>Game Informer's </strong></em><strong>Wesley LeBlanc: There is a lot going on in Romeo Is A Dead Man, but from a broad approach, what are the inspirations behind the game?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Suda51: </strong>You may have noticed playing a bit of the game, but a few of the main influences and inspirations for the game are <em>Back to the Future </em>and <em>Rick and Morty</em>, which itself was inspired by <em>Back to the Future</em>. We wanted to do something with space time and time travel, and the whole thing started off with looking to those two properties.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There are so many distinct art styles in Romeo Is A Dead Man. What are some of the inspirations behind that?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As far as the art and visual style go, that aspect of the game didn't have much to do with the [<em>Back to the Future </em>and <em>Rick and Morty</em>] influences. Where that came from was basically, I wanted to make sure all the staff members working on the game were able to do their best and what they're best at.</p><p>For the art, if we have one staff member good at Western-style comic book art, I'd say, "I want you to draw this scene, it'd look really great with your style." Somebody else is really good at a different style, and I would think of a scene for that person in particular to work on. It was about finding a proper rhythm for each scene, matching the content of the scene and what the characters are doing, and how it could be portrayed best.&nbsp;</p><p>I try to match up all the members of the staff to a scene, let them do the best at what they do, and jamming it all together.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>That's a very different director approach from what I hear about studios in the West. What's your philosophy behind that directorial style and letting people do things in their own vision?</strong></p><p>It's pretty simple, really. As far as my philosophy goes, I want it to be fun. We want to make fun games that people like playing, and we want everything about game development to be fun, too. In game development, there's a lot of heavy s*** to deal with, hard times to deal with, so I wanted not just playing the game to be fun, but the development and creation of it to be as fun as possible, too.&nbsp;</p><p>I lay out my ideas in meetings, and we might have some planning, but I let people from any department talk, tweak versions of ideas, and create a collaborative process. Anyone can cross out ideas, combine something to make new ideas, or take separate ideas and turn them into different things. We try to make it as fun as possible, and I want everyone to have as much fun as they can creating the game. We want them to know their opinions are heard and respected.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How do you factor in game balance with that approach?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A lot of game developers don't like thinking like this, because it might "ruin the balance of the game" if there are too many ideas. I don't care about that personally; I want the game to be fun and interesting. As far as balance goes, I'll take care of that in the end. If you have a good idea, let everybody know, and in the end, I'll make sure everything is as balanced as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>I think the team we've put together, they trust me to take care of that balance, which is why they feel free to put out different ideas they have. They can trust in me. Balance is probably one of the things I'm best at as a game developer – taking all these ideas that might not seem related, and balancing them.</p><p><strong>Can you talk to me about the process behind the game's combat design?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As far as the combat goes, that was actually mainly up to one of our lead programmers, Toru Hironaka, who has been at Grasshopper for years. I kind of left the combat and general action up to him because I know he knows what he's doing.&nbsp;</p><p>From the beginning, I knew there were going to be gun-type weapons and sword-type weapons, and I wanted to make both appealing. I knew we had to make them fun to use and as interesting as any other weapon, so I talked with Hironaka and said, 'These are the systems and action I want, do what you do best." I had other staff members give input, too.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as the action stuff goes, it's mainly Hironaka leading, but as a whole, [Romeo Is A Dead Man] came together the way it did through the power of teamwork. It's never just one guy doing everything by himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The time between your last release and Romeo Is A Dead Man [due out in 2026] is the longest in development history at Grasshopper Manufacture. Why?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The main reason it took so long is timing, basically. For example, right around when we started on Romeo Is A Dead Man, it was right about the time <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/10/22/netease-games-acquires-suda51s-grasshopper-manufacture">we left GungHo Entertainment and joined NetEase</a>, and we increased staff members, and it took them time to get used to how we do things and vice versa. Also, up through No More Heroes III, we worked on Unreal Engine 4, but Romeo Is A Dead Man is being developed in Unreal Engine 5, so our first year developing [Romeo Is A Dead Man], it was people learning Unreal Engine 5, learning how to work with each other, learning how the company works, and everyone getting used to each other and everything.&nbsp;</p><p>That's the biggest reason it took so long. It's not necessarily that the game is huge, and it wasn't the <em>worst </em>possible timing; everything just happened at the point in time that would result in us taking the most time to get the game done.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Romeo Is A Dead Man launches sometime next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/25/romeo-is-a-dead-man-has-so-many-art-styles-because-suda51-wanted-artists]]></content:encoded>

<p>"They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware."</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We're almost three months on from the Nintendo Switch 2's release, and while we have plenty of third-party games to come on the newer hybrid console, many developers say that they're still having issues getting hold of dev kits.</p>
<p>This comes from the folks at Digital Foundry in response to a question from a listener during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY&amp;t=500s&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">this week's DF Direct</a> (timestamped, 8:20). Part of the question focuses on Switch 2 kits, particularly pointing out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>, which runs at 30fps on the newer console (though it doesn't have a specific Switch 2 version either): "Do you think Nintendo are regretting not sharing the dev kits wider, sooner?"</p>
<p>Host John Linneman, who was at Gamescom 2025, spoke to multiple developers on the show floor where "so many of them said the same thing," and that "It's really difficult right now" to even get hold of a dev kit.</p>
<p>It sounds like the enthusiasm is there — "They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware." — but the ability to get the hardware teams need to make Switch 2 games is tough. Some were apparently told "they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility."</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Switch 2 PS5 comparsion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9f4e4d5b6dfae/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch-2-ps5-comparsion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>DF is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">full of praise for Final Fantasy VII Remake on Switch 2</a> so far — <em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY&amp;t=500s&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Co-host Oliver Mackenzie also weighed in, saying "I don't really understand the strategy" Nintendo is implementing in handing out dev kits.</p>
<p>The team reports "hearing things through the grapevine and talking to people" on some "weird exclusions" and "weird inclusions" , highlighting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a> as one of the latter games: "...Some big developers, on the other hand, who developed AAA stuff aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits.”</p>
<p>Of course, the only people who know what's actually going on with these dev kits are at Nintendo; Mouse Work, a game specifically designed to be played in Mouse Mode, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mouse-work-gets-second-trailer-but-cant-release-until-creators-get-switch-2-dev-kit">can't release on Switch 2 <em>until</em> the devs get a kit</a>. Nintendo is reportedly focusing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-prioritising-switch-2-dev-kits-for-indies-needing-extra-oomph-say-devs">on indie developers and smaller studios</a>, but that still leaves a lot of teams out.</p>
<p>When you get reports about some third-party games running better on Switch 2 than others; for example, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">impressed</a> at Gamescom while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">did not</a>.</p>

              <p>It’s&nbsp;<span>highly unlikely that we’ll see <a href="https://kotaku.com/portal-valve-erik-wolpaw-half-life-alyx-steam-counter-s-1848807049">a new&nbsp;<em>Portal</em> game</a> anytime soon from series creators </span>Valve. But now you can create your own<em> Portal 3</em> in a place I didn’t expect: <em>Minecraft</em>. Or you can play through 50 pre-made <a href="https://kotaku.com/portal-2-is-the-better-portal-but-you-better-bring-a-f-5793326"><em>Portal</em> <em>2</em></a> puzzles via a newly released <em>Minecraft</em> mod.</p> <p>On August 22, <a href="https://portaljavaedition.net/about">a group of 20+ modders and fan devs released <em>Portal: Java Edition</em></a>, a free remake of Valve’s 2011 first-person puzzler built entirely in vanilla Minecraft using resource and data packs. That <em>technically</em> means the project, which is free to download now on PC, doesn’t use any “mods,” though the creators do include extra third-party mods that help with optimization. And you’ll likely want to install those if you plan to play. This rebuilt version of<em> Portal 2</em> in <em>Minecraft</em> is pushing the Java version of the popular crafting game hard, and it can chug on even beefy PCs without the extra mods.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Portal: Java Edition | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8v7ZfuKZNis?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>According to the team behind it<em>, Portal: Java Edition</em> started development in 2020 and has taken roughly five years to complete. The mod includes all the mechanics and features from <em>Portal 2</em>, including portals (of course), lasers, light bridges, and mobility gels. The project is shipping with 50 levels spread across eight map packs. And if you burn through all of those, well, don’t worry, you can make some more, thanks to the included level editor. The level editor should be pretty easy to use for <em>Minecraft</em> vets, as it seems to function just like building anything else in Mojang’s crafting game, just with more big red buttons and companion cubes.</p> <p>To play <em>Portal: Java Edition</em>, you’ll need to own <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em> on PC and then download the project’s files from GitHub. I had to download an older version of <em>Minecraft</em> to get <em>Portal</em> working in the game, but that’s not too hard and is fully supported by the official <em>Minecraft</em> launcher. Once more people are playing this and building levels in it, I expect to replay <em>Doom’s</em>&nbsp;E1M1 and the first level of<em> Super Mario Bros</em>. in the near future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been two months since Death Stranding 2: On The Beach was released, with Hideo Kojima delivering big on yet another cinematic masterpiece that turned heads worldwide. In the short time that has followed, Kojima has busied himself promoting every angle of the game on social media and at the world tour events set up to showcase the game.</p>



<p>Many have wondered where the series goes from here, especially given the increasingly large window between releases. The first Death Stranding title dropped in 2019, and it took <strong>six years </strong>to produce a second game. Will Kojima be around for the third game? He has written a concept, but doesn’t think it’ll be him who makes Death Stranding 3.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hideo-kojima-make-another-death-stranding-game">Will Hideo Kojima Make Another Death Stranding Game?</h2>



<p>The Death Stranding series is equal parts emotional, action-packed, and bizarre. To outsiders, it represents a kind of walking or delivery guy simulator, but to those who have experienced it, Death Stranding is something phenomenal, tumultuous, and mind-bending.</p>



<p>That’s a touch of the sentiments handed down by fans over the last two months, anyway.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/AwQDoD9TK6w?t=3114s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent appearance</a> on the ‘World Strand Tour’, Hideo Kojima and his team stopped off in Saudi Arabia to further promote Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. In one segment, the interviewer asked the crowd, ‘Who wants Death Stranding 3?’</p>



<p>That prompted a telling response from Kojima:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m not planning to do that at the moment, because the ending of Death Stranding 2 was my finale of 1 and 2, but I already wrote the concept of DS3, so I have that in data.</p>



<p>I hope that someone will create it for me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/hideo-kojima-says-hes-already-written-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-he-wants-someone-else-to-make-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>Kojima went on to dive into the creation of Death Stranding 2, stressing that the COVID-19 pandemic threw a major spanner into the works, something that he has mentioned plenty of times in the past.</p>



<p>In June, Hideo Kojima spoke frankly about his health and the future of his company, Kojima Productions. He stressed that if his team tries to outright replicate his work when he has passed on, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-company-fail-replicate-work/">the company will fail</a>. For the last few years, Kojima has been stressing acute awareness of the fragility of life, showing a vulnerability that has made him more endearing, if nothing else.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cyberpunk 2077 Is A Good Showcase For The Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This has been an ongoing story surrounding Switch 2 from before launch and even as recently as last month. In April, a report surfaced stating that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smaller-game-studios-are-struggling-to-get-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-report/1100-6530621/">small developers were struggling to get their hands on dev kits for the hybrid system</a>. But it's not just indie teams, as a July report pointed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-switch-2-dev-kits-could-explain-limited-third-party-game-announcements-report/1100-6533186/">some AAA studios having a hard time acquiring them</a>, too. This could be why there haven't been a slew of major third-party releases, or announcements, for the system lately.</p><p dir="ltr">Oliver Mackenzie, a contributor at Digital Foundry, touched on AAA studios possibly still not getting Switch 2 dev kits. "But like there's that campfire game, you know the kind of camera campfire game, and they're getting kits, and some big developers on the other hand, who developed like AAA stuff, aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits," said Mackenzie. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chillin-by-the-fire-out-today-on-switch-2-allows-you-to-chill-by-a-fire/1100-6533581/">Chillin by the Fire is the game</a> that Mackenzie is referencing, and it launched right after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/#1">the Nintendo Direct in July</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">Switch 2 has broken home console sales records</a> since launching June 5. In fact, at the start of this month, Nintendo revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">Switch 2 has already sold 6 million units</a>. Looking ahead, there are rumblings about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-coming-this-september-report/1100-6534229/" data-ref-id="1100-6534229">a possible Nintendo Direct set for mid-September</a>.

              <p><em>Replaced</em> has been turning heads since it was first revealed back at E3 2021 (RIP), but actually completing the game has taken longer than anyone thought it would, including its developers at Sad Cat Studios. At long last, there’s good news, though: the team recently confirmed the gorgeous pixel art action game will arrive sometime next spring.</p> <p>That early 2026 timeframe will be a bummer to those secretly hoping <em>Replaced</em> might still sneak out onto PC and Xbox before the end of the year, but it’s better than nothing for fans who have been waiting years to finally see the cinematic cyberpunk platformer in action for themselves. After missing its original 2022 launch window, the day-and-date Game Pass game has been subject to continuous delays. A 2024 launch slipped into 2025, which has now slipped into 2026. What makes this time any different?</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Replaced: Official Development Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPoyEkQePA4?start=146&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>“This is the first time I’m addressing this personally and that’s because I can finally say it with confidence,” game director Yura Zhdanovich revealed in a new developer update. “<em>Replaced</em> will be released in spring of 2026. We will need just a little more time to get it polished. And to be more precise, our final trailer for the game with the exact release date will be shown later this year.”</p>  <p>Zhdanovich seems to be teasing a final date getting announced at The Game Awards 2025. Until then, <em>Replaced</em> has looked surprisingly good during its recent showing at Gamescom. <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">Much like<em> Silksong</em></a>, its repeated delays seem to have less to do with development woes (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">minus having to relocate because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>) than the fact that Sad Cat Studios had just been severely underestimating how much time it would take to get <em>Replaced</em> right.</p> <h2 tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="4 minutes, 55 seconds This is the first time I'm addressing"><em>Replaced</em> is more than just eye-candy</h2> <p>Sporting a <em>Batman: Arkham</em>-like, combo-based combat system and tons of vibrant, detailed pixel art backgrounds, <em>Replaced</em> is exactly the kind of “hand-crafted” indie project that deserves as much production time as it can get. Add in the cinematic mood and ambiance of puzzle-platform games like <em>Inside</em> and <em>Planet of Lana</em>, and you have the recipe for something very special if Sad Cat Studios can pull it off. The latest demo of the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c8Buktx_K0">looks as promising as ever</a>.</p>  <div tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="4 minutes, 55 seconds This is the first time I'm addressing"> <p>“We have done more than 600 clips of animation, which effectively translates to several thousands of hand painted frames of those animations blended together with beautiful VFX, amplifying the mix between retro and modern visuals,” Zhdanovich said. No AI-generated slop in sight. You love to see it.</p> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We may have gotten our first look at Noah Centineo’s Ken in the upcoming Street Fighter film. Last week, we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-photo-teases-wwe-superstar-cody-rhodes-as-guile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a shadowy glimpse</a> at Cody Rhodes’ Guile on set. While we didn’t see much outside his lore-accurate hair, it was enough for fans to go crazy. Now, a new picture, thanks to Noah Centineo’s social media, shows us what his Ken may look like.</p>



<p>Legendary’s Street Fighter, directed by Kitao Sakurai (Bad Trip, Twisted Metal), started filming earlier this month. After it announced the loaded cast, including Warrior’s Andrew Koji as Ryu, Aquaman’s Jason Momoa as Blanka, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-has-reportedly-lined-up-chun-li-balrog-actors/">50 Cent as Balrog</a>, many were cautiously optimistic about the adaptation. While no official release date is set yet, it’s not stopping some teases on set on social media, like with Noah Centineo.</p>



<h2 id="h-street-fighter-s-noah-centineo-teases-first-look-at-ken-masters">Street Fighter’s Noah Centineo Teases First Look at Ken Masters</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>In a new photo from the Black Adam actor, Noah Centineo shows off his muscles in his trailer. We can also see that his hair, unknown if real or fake, is down and dyed yellow. To further confirm it’s Ken, Centineo captioned the post “Road brawler”, which is a cheeky hint at the title Street Fighter. Considering how Ken looks in the games, he does seem to resemble the American-born rival of Ryu rather well. </p>



<p>Of course, it’s one thing to look the part and another to act it out. Though considering Centineo’s burgeoning action career with The Recruit, he may be a perfect fit for Ken Masters. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see if more set photos regarding Street Fighter will be seen as they film in Australia. The fighting franchise is no stranger to adaptations, but many are hopeful that Legendary’s take will succeed.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-unknown-event-magiccon-live-show</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-one-magic-the-gathering-designer-broke-all-the-rules-and-created-a-sensation.1280142/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Making a Magic: The Gathering card is a long process. To go from an idea to an actual piece of paper in a player’s hand takes <em>years</em>, with each one being discussed, tweaked, tested, proofread, illustrated, and so on as it passes between the many different teams at developer Wizards of the Coast. Unless, that is, it’s a card for the Unknown event that has become the star of every MagicCon live show in recent years, in which case the process is… a bit more loosey goosey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The goose is enormous. It is a goose that you have not seen the likes of, ever.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s Matt Tabak, Principal Editor at WOTC and one of the people responsible for the absurd and extremely popular Unknown event. I went to MagicCon in Las Vegas this year to finally see what Unknown was for myself, and I sat down with both Tabak and Gavin Verhey, Principal Game Designer and originator of the concept, to discuss how it got started, why it became such a hit, and how it impacts Magic as a whole. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MagicCon Las Vegas 2025 - Unknown Event and Card Photos</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, let’s cover the basics: Unknown is a way to play Magic designed specifically for the official conventions, called MagicCons, that are hosted a few times a year. It’s a Sealed event, which means you sit down, crack open some retail booster packs, and then build a deck out of whatever you happen to get. The big twist is that, alongside some special rules, you also get a little plastic bag filled with 10 random playtest cards made just for this event – they don’t have any art, their rules text is often cramped, and their faces are literally just stickers plastered over actual cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I find part of the joy of Unknown, why players enjoy it so much, is that it is not fully polished,” Verhey says. “It’s like, ‘Hey, step inside being a Magic playtester for a day.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unknown gives you a hands-on peek behind the design curtain to a degree that was previously quite rare, complete with typos, rough edges, and mechanics that don’t necessarily always <em>work </em>within Magic’s rules. They can be a little broken, hard to track, or just more powerful than anything you’d see in a real set – but the one thing they always have to be is amusing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"If you ask a Magic designer to make Magic cards in their free time, they’ll make something <em>really weird</em>.” - Gavin Verhey</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you make a Magic card that is intended to go into a booster pack that you hope people will buy, the ultimate goal is joy and entertainment, and there are many roads to get there,” Tabak explains. “On an Unknown card, there’s basically one route to joy, and that’s to make them laugh. Every Unknown card is basically just trying to get somebody to laugh.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That could be with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/CA11b/color-pie" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>inside jokes</u></a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/UW13/youre-toast!" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>goofy designs</u></a>, or even silly references to the city your specific event takes place in. For instance, I opened a card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/RR04c/at-least-its-a-dry-heat" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>At Least It’s a Dry Heat</u></a> that deals 1,000,000 damage that can’t be prevented or “compared to damage dealt by sources on the east coast,” which has been in Unknown packs for Las Vegas two years in a row now. (“It’s not any cooler, for some reason. The sun is still shining,” Tabak jokingly complains, before begrudgingly adding, “which we’re thankful for.”) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verhey can basically do whatever he wants with these cards, with fast turnaround times and way less oversight than there is while making regular sets. “I’ll be making unknown cards two-and-a-half weeks before the event happens sometimes,” he tells me, which is a far cry from the years a regular set requires. Verhey says it’s a fun creative outlet compared to the more rigid nature of making real cards, and that other members of WOTC now even randomly send him funny ideas that he’ll often drop straight into the next Unknown card pool. “If you ask a non Magic designer to make Magic cards, they’ll make Magic cards. If you ask a Magic designer to make Magic cards in their free time, they’ll make something <em>really weird</em>.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/23/stardust-deal-crop-1755907609579.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The commander for my first Unknown deck and a spell that put in a lot of work alongside it.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if one ends up clearly out of line, Verhey’s philosophy is that “everything can be fun for three rounds,” which is the most you’ll ever play with a given card in a single event. Tabak similarly emphasizes that “high impact is a priority for these Unknown cards, because [people] have to be immediately wowed and immediately inspired to build decks around them.” That’s due in part to the unique format Verhey has developed for Unknown over the dozen or so times it’s been run since its inception in 2023. It has you building a 60-card Commander deck with no color restrictions that you then play 1v1, which encourages building around a splashy legendary creature and then cramming in as many of the wildest playtest cards as you can reasonably manage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, my commander for the first of the two Las Vegas Unknown events I joined was a card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/RZ04r/the-sprinkler-of-stardust" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Sprinkler of Stardust</u></a>, which has the extremely strange ability to turn instant and sorcery cards into creatures that then cast themselves when they deal combat damage. My gameplan ended up revolving around punching my opponent with big spells like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/89/bad-deal" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bad Deal</u></a> as many times as I could manage, which was equal parts delightful, devastating, and wholly unique in my three decades of playing Magic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That commander is itself a reference to both a powerful card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/216/winota-joiner-of-forces" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Winota, Joiner of Forces</u></a> and the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/introducing-the-commander-format-panel" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Commander Format Panel</u></a> member known for championing it, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/luastardust.com" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Lua Stardust</u></a>. There have been dozens of nods to Magic community members across the history of Unknown, including <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=set%3Aunk+runner&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=set" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a whole series of “Runners”</u></a> as a shoutout to the group <a href="https://loadingreadyrun.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>LoadingReadyRun</u></a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=set%3Aunk+knight&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=set" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a round of “Knights”</u></a> as a wink to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@commandcast" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Command Zone</u></a>, both popular channels that regularly work with WOTC on collaborations. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“MagicCon, in so many ways, is about the people that come." - Gavin Verhey</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“MagicCon, in so many ways, is about the people that come,” Verhey says, “and I was like, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool to give back to the community?’” He sees these personal references as both a way to thank the creators who helped advocate for Unknown back when it was still a wild experiment, as well as a fun “quest” for fans as they then go hunting the show floor for signatures or custom doodles on the otherwise blank cards they opened. “Like everything else I did, I pitched it to one person, they’re like, ‘Sounds great,’ and I said, ‘Sold!’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, when Verhey first pitched the idea for Unknown as a whole, he was confident it would be shot down. It all started when WOTC Senior Operations Manager Scott Larabee asked him to run an event at MagicCon Philadelphia in 2023, but didn’t have any guidance as to what that should look like beyond being a “spectacle event” to excite people. Events with oddball rules were nothing new, but the idea for these playtest cards came from Verhey’s desire to do something that could only come from WOTC’s game design team. His thought before pitching it? “It is going to get killed for sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was worried about it because it’s essentially making new Magic cards that are never playtested and put out into the world, which is a thing we often don’t like to do. We like to show our high polish and our high gloss and everything. And, historically, there’s been a lot of rigor around these kind of things. Even the playtest cards for <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/mystery-booster" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mystery Booster</u></a>, there was a lot of time and scrutiny put on those cards.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But he pitched it all the same and, to his surprise, he got the blessing of both Vice President of Design Aaron Forsythe and Communications Director Blake Rasmussen, which was all he needed to be off to the races. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/22/img-6232-1755905253401.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Five Unknown cards with custom doodles done by a friend of mine.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Verhey describes the first Unknown event as his “weird little side project” (“It was just me doing it in my free time”), printing all the cards out himself and spending all day stickering them by hand in Philadelphia right before the show with the help of a few members of the event staff (“We had no idea how long it was going to take”). When they realized they still needed to make the booster packs, they dumped the “thousands upon thousands of cards” they had just assembled into Verhey’s suitcase and shook it around to randomize them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was so nervous. I was terrified,” Verhey recalls – but the stakes at the time were actually fairly low in the grand scheme of things. Not many people even knew the event was happening, and both he and Tabak agree that it wouldn’t <em>really </em>have been a big deal if it hadn’t gone well, because that would have just meant they don’t do it again. But it did go well, quickly becoming the talk of the show and immediately being put on the schedule for the next MagicCon, and then growing into one of their marquee draws ever since. They’ve even added a charity drive to part of the event each time, which Verhey admits always gets him a little teary-eyed as the amount they raise continues to go up. “Every show we add more seats, every show we do more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tabak says that WOTC does encourage individuals to take on “aspirational” projects from time to time but, even in that context, he describes the things Unknown is doing and its impressive popularity as an anomaly. “You’d be surprised [by] the number of things that were just a two-person idea or one-person idea that grew into something special – very, very few, perhaps none, are on the level of Unknown, though.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Every show we add more seats, every show we do more.” - Gavin Verhey</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unknown still operates outside of WOTC’s usual card making process, but Verhey says the quality did vastly improve when Tabak offered his assistance, as it’s the editing team’s job to make sure cards are as close to perfect as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When we first learned about these cards that Gavin had just put out into the world by himself – as a team, professionally, we were horrified,” Tabak explains as Verhey smiles alongside him. “Now, personally, I was delighted, and I knew I had to get on board with this, so I immediately hounded Gavin and said, ‘Why don’t you let me look at those cards this time before we send them out into the world?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even with a bit more oversight, Tabak tells me they still get to break the rules with these cards when it comes to things like typesetting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On real typeset cards, we have standards to maintain some measure of readability, we can only put so much text on a card,” he says. “On the playtest cards, we can be a little more <em>forgiving</em>.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tabak describes this as an advantage, but his apprehensive tone while doing so betrays the slight discomfort this clearly still causes the editor side of him. Indeed, they both laugh as Verhey teases that “sometimes Matt will be like, ‘Gavin, your card doesn’t fit,’ and I’m like, ‘I can print it out and all the text is on there; I don’t know what to tell you.’”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/23/ego-prof-crop-1755907667292.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Two Unknown cards inspired by creators in the community - Arin "Egoraptor" Hanson of Game Grumps (left) and Brian "The Professor" Lewis of Tolarian Community College (right)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The way they physically make the playtest cards has matured, too, no longer resting on the shoulders of Verhey and a very large suitcase. They are still individually stickered by hand, but that’s now handled at the offices of WOTC’s event partner, <a href="https://www.pastimesevents.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Pastimes</u></a>, over the course of multiple weeks, with Verhey saying the scale of each Unknown event is “ultimately capped, to some degree, by our ability to just sticker these cards.” (He jokes about considering giving players uncut sheets of printed stickers so they can assemble their own cards, to which Tabak replies, “What if we just give all 600 players scissors? What could go wrong?”)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The structure of the event itself has evolved as well, with player feedback being used to iterate a bit each time. The very first one was normal 40-card Limited, with all the participants split between two teams that they could win points for in a larger competition. It didn’t take long for Verhey to add a commander to the mix, but even that started with the regular color identity rules before first allowing <a href="https://mtg.wiki/page/Partner" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Partner</u></a> commanders to open things up more and then finally getting rid of color restrictions altogether. The goal behind that is to make sure people can use these wacky cards more reliably, but the variety between shows is also just part of the appeal for anyone who goes to multiple MagicCons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think one of the things about Unknown is, to some degree, it has to keep changing and it can’t be the same thing forever,” Verhey says. “So I’m running this current Commander version right now, but we could do something different at a future one, and that's the beauty of Unknown. People have so much faith in it at this point, they’re like, ‘I’m going to sign up, I’m going to come to see this thing, we’ll see what happens.’ And I might totally change the format at some point, which could be pretty fun.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s on us to evolve a ruleset based on what set is in the spotlight at the time, kind of match that and bring them something that they can’t find [in regular Sealed],” Tabak adds on. The Las Vegas event I attended was primarily tied into <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/tarkir-dragonstorm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</u></a>, with <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=set%3Aunk+devoted&amp;order=name&amp;as=full&amp;unique=cards" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>special creatures</u></a> linked to its five clans, but the card pool also had <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/UU01/dialogue-tree" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>plenty</u></a> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/RC08/new-magic-game-plus" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>of</u></a> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/RW02d/save-point" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>RPG</u></a> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/UU03d/higher-level-zone-monster" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>references</u></a> as an homage to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-2025"><u>Final Fantasy crossover set</u></a> that had just come out. Tabak is quick to point out that there are always a lot of newcomers, too – some of whom have no idea what they are getting into before they sit down at the table. “There are definitely people that are surprised when we hand them the playtest cards. They’re like, ‘I don’t know what this is, do I just put it in my backpack?’”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“The number one goal for me is just let people have fun and make them smile and delight them – and if I learn anything, that’s a nice bonus.” - Gavin Verhey</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was curious how much those playtest cards are actually “playtesting” something, and if WOTC uses Unknown as a real testing ground for ideas given how quickly they can go from concept to public feedback, but it turns out this really is mostly just them having fun. “I'd say [Unknown cards are] like 85% nonsense,” Verhey says, “5-10% ‘here’s a thing we actually tried for the set it was associated with that we didn’t end up using,’ [...] and maybe 5% are like, ‘I actually think this could be cool, let’s see what people think about this.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He wouldn’t give any indication as to which ones fall into that final category, but Verhey says he <em>has </em>used the popularity of some cards in Unknown as “ammo” to convince people internally that something similar could be a good idea for a real set. Besides, even as unofficial, stickered cards, he recognizes that some people have started to take them more seriously, using them in casual Commander decks or even their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-onlin3-vintage-cube-tournament-black-lotus-prize-pool"><u>cubes</u></a> (a collection of cards that make up a custom Draft set). “The number one goal for me is just let people have fun and make them smile and delight them – and if I learn anything, that’s a nice bonus.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard not to be at least a little bit amazed by both the almost grassroots rise of the Unknown event and the surprisingly bootstrap way it gets made within the multibillion-dollar corporation that is Wizards of the Coast. Tabak says it’s a testament to the company’s culture that this sort of thing is encouraged, but it has still grown far bigger than anyone expected it to (including its creator), going from shaking typo-filled cards in a suitcase to filling up convention floors and raising money for good causes. When I ask if it feels like they sort of got away with something here, Tabak’s response is unequivocal: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Absolutely. And we’re going to keep getting away with it, too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering it was revealed to the world with a trailer that featured four zombie-blasting soldiers singing along to Bon Jovi’s “You Give Love a Bad Name”, I expected <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-carpenters-toxic-commando">John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando</a> to be much funnier than it is. Inspired in equal measure by the supernatural horror and buddy action movies of the 1980s, it is big and dumb and goofy… yet never as batshit bananas as you’d expect for a game that’s quite literally about fighting an entity called the Sludge God. But while it may not be that <em>funny</em>, it is <em>fun</em>. You may have already forgotten about that 2023 reveal trailer, but after playing three hours of its co-op missions, I don’t think Toxic Commando is going to fade into the background thanks to its surprisingly solid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>-alike antics.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it is presented akin to a story campaign shooter with cutscenes, plot points, and a lore-dropping man-in-the-chair vaguely modelled after John Carpenter himself, Toxic Commando is clearly designed to be a regular destination for a team of four friends who can run through its missions on repeat. Each expedition takes place on a reasonably-sized open map, dotted with a handful of optional objectives and loot caches alongside the quest’s main goals. With no ticking timer or shrinking circle, you can take your time to collect everything, scour every point-of-interest, and generally mess around with your pals before pushing onwards to the mission’s finale. It’s surprisingly leisurely… at least until the horde applies the pressure. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Saber Interactive, Toxic Commando is built on the studio’s now-signature horde technology that renders hundreds of sprinting zombies simultaneously, allowing for enemies to clamber up walls like a reverse waterfall of rotting flesh. In many ways, Toxic Commando feels like a successor to the game where this tech originated, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/world-war-z">World War Z</a>, and even features near-identical mechanics – during frequent hold-the-line defence objectives, you mow down incoming enemies with the same array of emplaced machineguns, mortars, and electrified grids. It’s just that this time it’s all rendered with a gloriously gross horror aesthetic. Who wants zombies to look like humans when they can look like lamp-eyed freaks from the death dimension?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those freaks burst and break when they’re introduced to the hot lead dispensed by a very healthy arsenal. They’re all based on real-world guns (aside from the wildly powerful rail gun, which scatters foes like bowling pins) and divided up into your regular groups of shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and other formats not beginning with “S”. Saving them from feeling utterly ordinary is how they fire with the exaggerated bravado of an ultra-violent b-movie – all sputtering muzzles, wide bullet spread, and explosive impacts. Legs are severed, ribcages torn open, and brains pinwheel out of busted skulls. It’s all as squelchy and sinewey as you’d hope from a game associated with the director of The Thing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your choice of loadout defines the combat experience much more than the four character classes, which feel like minor augmentations to standard FPS action rather than crucial battlefield roles. Each is defined by a single special ability – the Operator uses a drone that automatically bombards enemies for a few seconds, the Strike can unleash a barrage of energy blasts, the Medic has an area-of-effect heal, and the Defender can put up a damage-absorbing barrier. At least during my hours of play, these abilities came in handy during a pinch but did little to direct how I played. Perhaps filling out the skill tree will give each class stronger definition, but right now it seems like the regular shooting is the main event.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s admittedly very little new or experimental in Toxic Commando, but what’s here is genuinely good fun. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mowing down a lot (<em>a lot</em>) of zombies is the crux of Toxic Commando’s objectives. Sometimes that’ll involve the genre-trademark special infected that largely work exactly as Left 4 Dead dictated (sticky ones that grab you, tanky ones that charge at you, gross ones that spit at you.) Elsewhere you’ll need to unload a belts-worth of ammunition into a tangled mess of tentacles, or use demolition charges to blow some kind of growth to smithereens. It’s mostly by-the-numbers co-op shooter fare, but across the few missions I’ve played there’s the odd one that shines brighter. One quest sees the map covered by a Fortnite-ish, life-sapping storm, and the only way to navigate between the shielded pockets of safety is to drive an ambulance that can trickle heal those sitting inside it. It’s a really coherent meshing of environment, situation, and equipment design.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of if the mission requires one or not, vehicles are as significant to Toxic Commando as its zombies and guns. The spaced-out objectives and open nature of the maps mean you’ll need some wheels to effectively cover ground, especially as that ground is so often practically carpeted by the undead. Cars like the armoured Maverick are good for both protection and doubling as a battering ram – you’ll just need to occasionally deal with the zombies who clamber aboard like particularly diseased monkeys at the safari. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All vehicles have a special ability, such as the ambulance’s healing aura or the Thunder pick-up’s flamethrower, but it's the winch attached to all but the family sedans that really makes a difference. Essentially a grapple hook that can be fired into a variety of anchor points, it can be used to rip gates off their hinges, bust open treasure containers, and pull your vehicle up slippy inclines. See, the Sludge God, in his infinite sticky wisdom, has covered each map in great big stretches of gloop, and so without a MudRunner-lite approach you’ll be spinning tires and going nowhere. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s admittedly very little new or experimental in Toxic Commando, but what’s here is genuinely good fun. It’s a more open take on Left 4 Dead’s horde-filled adventures, fuelled by the same “arcane evil” feel that’s made Call of Duty’s zombie mode feel so aesthetically solid. There are some issues that threaten that fun, though. Every mission I played felt like it had had the wind kicked out of it by the final stretch thanks to dwindling resources. Health kits are in short supply, ammunition can get a little tricky, and spare parts - a currency that unlocks special weapons and defensive structures – can only be found in a limited number of loot caches. By the end of a mission it can feel like the odds are really against you, and while I appreciate the need to ratchet tension and create a challenge spike in the final objective, in a game where zombies arrive by the truckful, restocking ammo only to find you’ve been given a single magazine does feel a bit unbalanced. I was having a lot more fun during the earlier minutes, when bullets were plentiful and the blood spilled like wine, so I’m not sure if the flow and tone really mesh with the current resource levels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The more concerning thing, though, is progression. All weapons have individual XP bars, and must be levelled up to particular milestones to unlock different modifications. When you unlock a mod, you then need to spend a currency to actually fit it to the weapon, and each one costs several thousand. I can’t help but look at the entire armoury and envision the hundreds and hundreds of hours I’d need to sink into Toxic Commando to achieve a decently functioning, varied loadout. It’s the sort of system that funnels you into picking a single favourite, rather than encouraging you to constantly switch between missions. This, combined with a trio of different currencies and palette-swap character skins, has me a little suspicious that the sludge of live-service has tainted something I’ve otherwise had a pretty good blast with. But these grindy woes can also be found in Saber’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, and they didn’t stop it from being one of my favourite games of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say I’m expecting John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando to have anywhere near the same impact Space Marine had. But, provided the full game has a solid range of missions that genuinely prove replayable, I do think the strong shooting and entertaining enemies have a decent enough chance to secure it a home among friendship groups who’d happily re-watch gloopy ‘80s horror over and over until the VHS wears out. Whether they’ll ever unlock the attachments they want for their favourite weapons… well, we’ll have to wait to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-puts-an-80s-horror-spin-on-left-4-dead]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>October 31st, 1963. The date of the most horrific night in Haddonfield, Illinois, history. The day Michael Myers escaped the asylum and became infamous with the holiday that is Halloween. I'll never forget the first time I watched John Carpenter's masterpiece 1978 horror film, <em>Halloween</em>, at far too young an age. The result? At 30 years old, Michael Myers is still the most terrifying silver-screen slasher to me – watching one of his countless appearances in media still invites nightmares of that white mask, Michael's uncanny ability to be anywhere and everywhere at once, and his endless desire to kill.&nbsp;</p><p>It's for this reason that <em>Halloween </em>is my all-time favorite horror movie. It's also a franchise I've been waiting forever for Illfonic, developer of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/friday_the_13th_the_game/b/playstation4/archive/2017/06/02/a-killer-formula-suffering-massive-casualties.aspx#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20these%20amazing%20moments%20come,of%20dedicated%20servers%20on%20consoles.">Friday the 13th</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/predator-hunting-grounds/not-quite-at-its-apex">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game">Killer Klowns From Outer Space,</a> to tackle it in its typical asymmetrical multiplayer style. I was thrilled to learn that the time has come, with IllFonic revealing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/halloween">Halloween</a> last week, and even more excited to interview the studio's chief creative officer, Jared Gerritzen, about the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gerritzen first shows me the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3QNjz1mYg&amp;pp=ygUTaWxsZm9uaWMgaGFsbG93ZWVuIA%3D%3D">Halloween reveal trailer</a>, which offers a nice cinematic appetizer of what's to come in the game when it launches sometime next year, before proclaiming Halloween is IllFonic's biggest game yet. That's not surprising, considering it features 1v4 asymmetrical multiplayer – typical for the developer – but also, a single-player campaign that puts you in the boots of Michael on the night of Halloween in 1963. That's a huge addition to this multiplayer title, and something I'm eager to ask Gerritzen at the top of my interview.&nbsp;</p><h3>Single-Player Campaign</h3>










<article data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3cebfee5-a5d1-418f-8885-4247132da826" data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:0,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-langcode="en">

<p>He says IllFonic is aware that when it and other teams announce games based on popular horror IPs like Halloween, fans get bummed when they learn it's an asymmetrical multiplayer game, and wanted to include a single-player campaign for them. But that's not the only reason. Gerritzen tells me the single-player campaign is designed to be played first as it teaches you how to be the best Michael Myers in the game's multiplayer mode.&nbsp;</p><p>You'll play through the events of the first <em>Halloween </em>film, and a little after to learn more never-before-seen story about that night, and acquire different abilities and perform different kills on the citizens of Haddonfield in this campaign. "It trains you to be an optimal Michael Myers for multiplayer," Gerritzen says. The team is working with Carpenter and longtime franchise producer Malek Akkad – he's been it's producer since 1985, taking over the reins from his father, who was the Halloween producer prior to that – to create this game, including the single-player campaign; so you can expect it to feel authentic to the original films. It will even emulate the 1970s movie vibe of the original film, with Gerritzen calling it a "period piece" game.&nbsp;</p><p>This means the visual style, the dialogue, and even the technology available to you in-game will match the time period. This applies to single-player and multiplayer content in the game, with Gerritzen explaining to me IllFonic has taken great strides to "revolutionize" this genre this time around. "We're filling out the world with NPCs and AI, and heroes can save the town now instead of the standard do XYZ and escape alone, but you can play how you want," he says. "If you're saving town people, you're slowing Michael down from killing people. On the other hand, if you're playing as Michael, you have more things to do that might be easier than killing a hero, so the power balance is a lot more interesting and different than the same old, same old of the genre."</p>

<p>Halloween will utilize the canon of the franchise heavily, but IllFonic has been given the green light to add things it needs to make it fun. For example, in the movies, Michael has the uncanny ability to appear anywhere and is seemingly inhuman in the amount of damage he can take. His gameplay abilities will reflect that.&nbsp;</p><p>He is not a man anymore after all, as Dr. Samuel Loomis declares in the reveal trailer; he is The Shape. Speaking of Loomis, IllFonic is working with the family of Loomis actor Donald Pleasence to use his likeness, as Loomis is the narrator of the game's campaign. Karma: The Dark World developer Pollard Studio is helping IllFonic develop the campaign, something Gerritzen says has "supercharged" the Unreal Engine 5-developed project.&nbsp;</p><p>Gerritzen says Jason (of Friday the 13th fame) is a "bull in a China shop," that the Predator is a "big cat, powerful and noisy," and that Michael is a "coiled-up cobra that happens to be in any bush you walk by." That will be reflected in his gameplay prowess, though IllFonic isn't ready to dive into specifics yet.&nbsp;</p><p>IllFonic is still supporting its older titles – it released new Predator: Hunting Grounds content in recent weeks – but Gerritzen says this is the first time the entire team will be focused on one project in Halloween. Partly, that's because Unreal Engine 5 allows the team to try new techniques it struggled with in the past, &nbsp;such as dynamic lighting and other technological feats.</p><h3>Why Now?</h3>

</article>
<p>After the release of Friday the 13th in 2017, IllFonic made a massive list of the IP it wanted to play around in, because "you can't just grab an IP and say, 'Okay, we're starting on it,'" Gerritzen tells me. As you might expect, copyright and other rights issues make developing in an IP like Predator or Halloween tough. Gerritzen says IllFonic developed Friday the 13th, then Predator: Hunting Grounds, then had "a couple of projects canceled," and while working on Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the Killer Klowns from Outer Space IP landed in its lap. During that game's development, Halloween arrived at its doors, and "that's when we started going, 'Let's work on the next project and focus the entire company on it.'" Despite this studio-wide focus on Halloween's development, Gerritzen says it's important that IllFonic not abandon its prior projects, which he says it hasn't.&nbsp;</p><p>"We fully believe in making a game, supporting the game, and, even when going to another game, still keeping past ones going and fostered," he adds.&nbsp;</p><p>As for developing a game around Michael Myers, Gerritzen says there hasn't been much representation for him in games. I joke about owning the Michael skin in Call of Duty. "Yeah, and that's exactly what you want for Michael, right?" Gerritzen jokes back. "No, Michael is this unknown monster, The Shape, that thing in the corner of your eye, the thing you're afraid to look out and see at night, and everyone has a different experience with him. He is the boogeyman, and that's why we're really all in on this game."&nbsp;</p><h3>Design</h3>

<p>"Fun" sits at the top of IllFonic's multiplayer priorities in Halloween, but a close second is "breaking the stigma," Gerritzen says. "We have to use this world to make it bigger. What would happen if you zoomed the camera all the way out and saw Haddonfield beyond how it was needed for a scene in the movie." IllFonic is focused on thoughtfully adding to Haddonfield; it's doing the same for Michael's set of moves.</p><p>Since this game is based on the events of the first film, it places you in the same mindset as Haddonfield citizens (and movie watchers) in that a lot about Michael Myers is obscured in mystery. "We're kind of expanding on that," Gerritzen adds. "Is he looking for [Laurie Strode] or just coming back home to write a wrong or get revenge or something else? You don't know what it is; all you know is he is Michael Myers and he killed his sister. Loomis has gone crazy in the film because he's so obsessed with this thing he cannot understand, and in our game, you will be playing the thing he and you cannot understand. I think that's definitely an interesting angle."&nbsp;</p><p>For creating Michael's moveset, Gerritzen says the team watched <em>Halloween </em>over and over again, "paid attention to the things he does in film, just kind of took that and determined what it means and what if you can XYZ. We essentially connected these things and presented it to the IP team, and said, 'Hey, this is what we feel like we can do.'" Though he's cagey about what exactly, Gerritzen says the team "cracked a mechanic I've never seen in any other game," and that players will have to experience this "holy s***" moment for themselves when Halloween launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you excited for IllFonic's Halloween?

<figure><a title="Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f795e741d72b/castlevania-dawn-of-sorrow.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Konami</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new dawn of Castlevania started 20 years ago, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/castlevania_dawn_of_sorrow">Dawn of Sorrow</a> first launched on the Nintendo DS in Japan on 25th August 2025.</p>
<p>Following on directly from the final Castlevania GBA title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_aria_of_sorrow">Aria of Sorrow</a>, Dawn of Sorrow had big shoes to fill; a shift in art direction and the implementation of the touch screen meant that it's wasn't as well loved as its predecessor, but the game ultimately kick-started another handheld trio that, arguably, is the finest era for the series.</p>
<p>Besides the Magic Seal system — where you had to memorise and draw a seal after beating a boss to defeat them — this is all very familiar Castlevania stuff. The Tactical Soul system from Aria makes its return here, but the real draw is the ability to show the castle map on the top screen so you can track your progress as you go.</p>

<p>Taking place in the year 2036, Soma Cruz returns as the protagonist, and once again he attempts to stop the resurrection of Dracula. Now, if you've played Aria, you know the big twist, so we'll keep that under wraps.</p>
<p>But this is otherwise more solid Castlevania RPG action, with a variety of weapons and enemies to tackle. Oh, and some excellent sprite work. Soul and item drop rates are absolutely busted though... oh well!</p>
<p>The game was included in last year's excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_dominus_collection">Castlevania Dominus Collection</a>, which also brings <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/castlevania_portrait_of_ruin">Portrait of Ruin</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/castlevania_order_of_ecclesia">Order of Ecclesia</a>, and a full remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/haunted_castle">Haunted Castle</a> (alongside the original arcade release). That version also mostly fixes the Magic Seal system — as in, you can use button prompts or just rewind if you mess up. We <em>totally</em> didn't do the latter. Nope.</p>

<p>Anyway, come celebrate the Dawn of Sorrow (the game, not the <em>actual</em> dawn of sorrow... we hope you're all happy) in the comments, and share your memories with the game down below. Is it your favourite DS entry? Tell us!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-gamescom-digital-foundry-2000620055</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reportedly-pushing-devs-to-release-on-switch-1-instead-of-sharing-switch-2-dev-kits.1280118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Switch 2 launched just a few months ago and was immediately a smash hit, selling more than 3.5 million devices within four days of launch. Since then, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">Nintendo’s sold nearly twice</a> that much, sitting at roughly around six million machines. Those are great numbers for Nintendo, which is why it’s strange that a recent report indicates that the console manufacturer is seemingly hesitant to get dev kits for its hybrid console into the hands of devs.</p> <p>Thanks to reporting from our comrades over at <i>Digital Foundry</i>, enthusiastic interest from developers to get their games running as best they can on Switch 2 isn’t enough. Nintendo is encouraging studios to “ship [their games] on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility,” according to John Linneman on episode 228 of <i>DF Direct Weekly</i>. He continues:</p> <blockquote><p>There are a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits. We talked to a lot of devs at <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">Gamescom this year</a> and so many of them said the same things: They want to ship on Switch 2. They would love to do Switch 2 versions [of their games]. They can’t get the hardware. It’s really difficult.</p></blockquote> <p><i>DF Direct Weekly</i> cohost Oliver Mackenzie spoke for all of us when he added that he doesn’t “understand the strategy.” He noted that for a while now, there were rumors that Nintendo was, at best, inconsistent with who it got dev kits into the hands of, and at worst, withholding. Mackenzie added that it’s <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chillin-by-the-fire-switch-2/">odd to see the devs behind <i>Chillin’ by the Fire</i></a> receive developer machines to work on while some bigger names are seemingly left out in the cold. You can check out <a href="https://youtu.be/N0SW7R5H5wY">the whole <i>DF Direct Weekly</i> episode here</a>:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DF Direct Weekly #228: Elden Ring/FF7R Switch 2! #StutterStruggle Fixed?

That’s something Nintendo should seem interested in fixing, no? It’s an odd situation for sure. Then again, just about <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">all of reality is an odd situation</a>, seeing as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220">Switch 1 literally saw its price <i>increase </i>eight years</a> after it shipped and a few months after its successor launched. Nintendo’s not alone in that, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">Sony just upped the price of the PS5, too</a>.</p> <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Nintendo for comment on this story.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/demonschool-delayed-november-silksong/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/demonschool-delayed-to-november-due-to-silksong.1280115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Demonschool, which was planned to release September 3rd, 2025, has now been delayed, due in part to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. The indie RPG from Necrosoft Games, has been hotly anticipated since 2022, and was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fazy1L9KXFQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to drop next week</a>, with codes for the title already given to press. </p>



<p>Despite that, the game won’t come out at that time for a number of reasons, including one rather large one.</p>



<p>If you haven’t heard of Demonschool, it is a strategy RPG more in line with Persona 1 and 2 than newer ones. Still, the game has been in development for quite a bit and garnered attention for its 2D graphics and fun gameplay. Unfortunately, it looks like fans won’t be able to get to play it next week as anticipated.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-s-surprise-release-gets-blame-for-demonschool-s-delay">Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Surprise Release Gets Blame for Demonschool’s Delay</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Demonschool release date trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a press release from publisher Ysbyrd Games, the team announced Demonschool’s sudden delay from September 3rd to November 19th. As to why it’s now two months out, it says that Hollow Knight: Silksong is to blame. Via the official press release, it states:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With 11 years under our belt as an indie publisher, we at Ysbryd Games are reasonably qualified to say that any point of 2025, on balance, has been or will be as brutal as market conditions can get when it comes to releasing a game. Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that&nbsp;Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;will launch just one day after our planned release for&nbsp;Demonschool.</p>



<p>We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for&nbsp;Demonschool&nbsp;is our main goal. Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red. If the September period is going to be&nbsp;Silksong’s&nbsp;moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give&nbsp;Demonschool&nbsp;its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Demonschool already gave out codes for PC reviewers, so now they’ll have plenty of time to play the title. Still, this is the fourth game to vacate its spot due to Hollow Knight: Silksong’s surprise release. While it may not all have to do with Silksong, it’s certainly proven to be an issue for some. </p>



<p>Are you sad about Demonschool’s delay to November 19th? Will more games get delayed because of Silksong? Let us know in the comments and on the forums.</p>

                <p>Ysbryd Games has officially announced the delay of Demonschool's release, shifting its launch date from September 3 to November 19. The decision, described as one made with "anguished consideration," comes in response to an unexpectedly competitive release window, headlined by the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-finally-revealed-after-years-of-waiting/1100-6534159/" data-ref-id="1100-6534159">Hollow Knight: Silksong's September 4 debut</a>--and it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">not the first game delayed because of the surprise release</a>.</p><p>This surprise timing left the indie publisher little choice but to reconsider. "Crueler still," noted the press release, written by founder Brian Kwek, "that we should find out with such short notice that Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch just one day after our planned release for Demonschool."</p><p>The publisher emphasized the difficult nature of launching a title in 2025 due to the early fall season being increasingly crowded, with other major titles such as the Final Fantasy Tactics remaster, Pokemon Legends: Z-A, and Ghost of Yotei launching within weeks of each other. For those unfamiliar, Demonschool is a new-style tactics RPG with some clear Persona influence sprinkled in.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fazy1L9KXFQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"If the September period is going to be Silksong's moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give Demonschool its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully," the statement continued, adding "there are no more delays after this point." The delay also enables the inclusion of additional content at launch, including alternate endings and minigames that were originally slated for post-release updates.</p><p>Demonschool will be available for all current major platforms, including PC via Steam. Ysbryd and developer Necrosoft Games expressed its gratitude to fans for their continued patience and enthusiasm. "We truly hope you continue to support Necrosoft Games' labor of love by showing up for Faye and her madcap band of collegiate demon hunters on November 19th," concluded Kwek.</p><p>"This was not our choice, but we understand why the choice was made. We aren't mad at Ysbryd but at the situation. Dropping the GTA of indie games with 2 weeks' notice makes everyone freak out," Necrosoft Games said in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3lxak6xi3622r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky post</a>. "Ysbryd is being a good partner and paying for the delay. We're sorry this is happening." Ironically, a release date had been anticipated for quite some time, and the original September launch date was committed to only a few weeks ago.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After years of anticipation, Team Cherry announced last week that Hollow Knight: Silksong will <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/21/hollow-knight-silksong-launches-on-september-4">finally be released on September 4</a>. This took many fans and, evidently, other studios by surprise, namely Ysbryd Games. In response to Team Cherry's announcement, the indie publisher has delayed the upcoming tactical RPG <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/07/tactical-rpg-demonschool-will-officially-open-its-doors-in-september">Demonschool</a>, which was planned to launch one day before Silksong.</p><p>In a press release, Ysbryd announces it has pushed Demonschool’s planned September 3 launch to a new release date of November 19. With Silksong arriving next week on the 4th, Ysbyrd read the tea leaves, realizing that releasing a game so close to the most anticipated indie game in recent memory is a bad idea.</p><p>“We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for Demonschool is our main goal," says Ysbryd's Brian Kwek in a statement. "Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red. If the September period is going to be Silksong's moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give Demonschool its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully.”</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Ysbyrd states that developer Necrosoft Games will spend the extra two months enhancing and polishing Demonschool. One positive of the delay, according to Ysbyrd, is that the added time allows Necrosoft time to add additional endings and minigames that were originally going to be included in a post-launch patch.</p><p>Similar to Silksong, Demonschool has been in development for some time as well, suffering several delays before this one. It centers on teenage students battling demons in turn-based tactical combat similar to titles such as Into the Breach. We were <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/07/the-coolest-games-weve-played-at-summer-game-fest-2025">impressed with the demo we played</a> at Summer Game Fest, &nbsp;and are optimistic about the full release.&nbsp;</p><p>Demonschool launches on November 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC for $24.99.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/25/demonschool-delayed-to-avoid-releasing-near-hollow-knight-silksong]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Demonschool" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c80459b665ebc/demonschool.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ysbryd Games</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-08-25T18:51:28+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Mon 25th Aug 2025, 7:51pm</time>]:</strong></p><p>Developer Necrosoft Games has followed up with a brief statement on Bluesky.</p>
<p>Clarifying the reason for the long delay, Necrosoft <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3lxak6xi3622r">confirmed that it's more than just Silksong influencing the two month slip</a>, citing Silent Hill f, Final Fantasy Tactics, and the absolutely wild release schedule for October.</p>
<p>"This was not our choice but we understand why the choice was made," the studio states. "We're sorry this is happening."</p>
<hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> can't catch a break, can it? The upcoming tactical RPG, inspired by classic Persona, SMT, and Italian cinema, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tactical-rpg-demonschool-finally-gets-a-launch-date-and-its-real-soon">was due to release on 3rd September 2025</a>, but today, publisher Ysbryd Games has announced that it's pushing Necrosoft Games' release back to <strong>19th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? One <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, which is launching <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">the day after Demonschool's previous release date</a>.</p>
<p>In a press release, Ysbryd Games' Brian Kwek says "after much anguished consideration on our part, we’ve made the decision to move the game’s release."</p>
<p>"With 11 years under our belt as an indie publisher, we at Ysbryd Games are reasonably qualified to say that any point of 2025, on balance, has been or will be as brutal as market conditions can get when it comes to releasing a game. Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch just one day after our planned release for Demonschool."</p>
<p>The publisher says that "gaining visibility" is the main goal for the game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/tactical-rpg-demonschool-has-been-delayed-yet-again">which has been delayed multiple times</a> since its reveal a few years ago — "If the September period is going to be Silksong's moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give Demonschool its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3lwx26vg5cc2r">official Demonschool Bluesky</a> shared this lovely photo of the game on a CRT in response to Silksong's release date, and in retrospect, it's a little amusing:</p>

<p>While the delay will be disappointing to many, Ysbryd Games has revealed that this will allow the developers to include more endings and minigames that they were "originally planned to patch in post-release.</p>
<p>Demonschool isn't the only game to delay itself to avoid Silksong's release window: <strong>CloverPit</strong>, a slot machine roguelike, and <strong>Aeterna Lucis</strong>, the sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/aeterna_noctis">Aeterna Noctis</a>, have both been delayed in response to Team Cherry's hand-drawn Metroidvania release.</p>
<p>September is already jam-packed, so we hope the delay gives Demonschool the breathing room the game deserves.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-riftbreaker-update-2-0-co-op-expanded-campaign/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-riftbreaker-update-2-0-adds-4-player-co-op-an-expanded-campaign-and-more.1280073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer and publisher Exor Studios has just released the latest update for The Riftbreaker, which includes a few significant features for the game. Update 2.0 introduces four-player online co-op to The Riftbreaker, along with an expanded campaign, an overhaul to the loot system, new Omega-Strain creatures, and more.</p>



<p>The update is available right now for PC players through Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG, though Windows Store players and players on console will have to wait, as the update will be available there "<em>at a later date</em>," according to the studio in a press release.</p>



<p>Exor Studios also debuted a new trailer for the update, which showcases co-op gameplay, some of the new creatures you'll face, and shots of the expanded campaign for veterans looking for more to do in the endgame.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Riftbreaker - Update 2.0 Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hPdjx2wGPb8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the expanded campaign, this update introduces a new story arc centering around Megastructures, and is fully voiced with Francesca Meaux and Ryan Laughton returning to their roles as Ashley and Mr. Riggs, respectively. </p>



<p>The Omega-Strain creatures are more powerful versions of existing creatures and enemies you've already faced, though thanks to their added punch, taking them down will score you an even bigger reward. They also feature various elemental types that will encourage you to switch up your approach depending on the situation.</p>



<p>Exor Studios has also overhauled the loot system with Update 2.0, and crafting is no longer the only way to obtain new gear. You'll now see new gear appear as loot from enemy creatures, Biocaches, and Bioanomalies. There's also a number of balance adjustments in the update, including tweaks to weapons, research, quality-of-life improvements, and even a few optimization improvements to help the game perform better on your device.</p>



<p>The Riftbreaker is a base-building action-RPG that<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-riftbreaker-an-ephemeral-paradise/"> first launched in 2021</a>, and has been updated several times since launch, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-riftbreaker-metal-terror-dlc-more-of-the-same/">new expansions</a> and balancing updates. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you follow the gaming industry at all, you know that the last few years have been rough. "Survive to 2025" was a phrase going around last year due to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" This Week in Gaming Business - 2024 Layoffs Already Higher than 2023 Total">various layoffs</a>, and the year before that was similar as waves of layoffs hit different companies across the industry. All that gets put under the microscope of satire in&nbsp;<em>AAA Simulator</em>.</p>

<p>While small studios have closed or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-torn-banner-layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Chivalry 2 Developer Torn Banner Lays Off an Unknown Number of Devs">had layoffs</a>, more persistent has been the ongoing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Latest Microsoft Layoff Wave Hits Candy Crush and Elder Scrolls Studios">waves of layoffs</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Sony Shuts Down Two Studios Including Concord Creator">cancellations</a> from AAA developers and publishers, and it is from this that the two-person team at Whitelocke Media was inspired to create a game satirizing the corporate gaming environment and industry.</p>

<p>Lead designer Nic&nbsp;Vasudeva-Barkdull was one of those people working on a game that an AAA publisher cancelled, killing the studio and leading to him being laid off at the start of 2024. This prompted plenty of job searching for him, including interviews – many of which had red flags such as requiring spec work or other problems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“At first, I had plenty of interviews, but each with a thousand red flags. Techland made me create a quest from scratch, unpaid, just to interview for a quest designer (and apparently coder and 3D artist) position. Another studio wouldn't stop going on about how they're free of all the corporate BS and I later saw them in the headlines laying people off. And a third was an Embracer studio, enough said about that.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaa-simulator-interns.jpg?itok=QJZH2akI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaa-simulator-interns.jpg?itok=ufj-SSLn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Whether it's spec work like Techland proposed, internships with no remuneration, AI replacements, or not paying contractors, many companies cut corners to save a few bucks.</figcaption></figure><p>It wasn’t his own search that served as the final impetus for him to make <em>AAA Simulator</em>. That would come from the wreckage he was seeing around the industry as a whole, though his own frustration inevitably helped fuel it, too.</p>

<p>“If I were to pinpoint an exact moment that compelled me to make <em>AAA Simulator</em>, it was when I found myself so sickened by multi-decade game veterans begging for jobs on LinkedIn, Microsoft's own corporate social media, that I couldn't even bring myself to continue my job search," he said. "I had to make a game, whether someone hired me to make one or not, and I had to do it in a way that ran opposite to everything I was seeing in the industry.”</p>

<p>Unlike most similar simulation games about the games industry, in <em>AAA Simulator </em>you aren’t picking how to make a game or what the game will do. In fact, the only direct thing you really do about the game is naming it, and your primary means of interaction is hiring or firing workers.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaa-simulator-employee-slider.jpg?itok=2YSt7GCd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaa-simulator-employee-slider.jpg?itok=HTJYpiR4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aunt Tara's general view that the only thing that matters is money and board happiness (aka stock price) is far too common in the market today.</figcaption></figure><p>It started from a comment Rod Fergusson <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/diablo-boss-rod-fergusson-don-t-treat-devs-like-knobs-and-dials-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Diablo boss Rod Fergusson: don't treat devs like 'knobs and dials'">made</a>:&nbsp;“These people aren't knobs and dials," he said in reference to developers. That had Vasudeva-Barkdull ponder that to the company executives, employees are in fact knobs and dials. The culture in the companies had evolved to treat the employees in these major companies that way, all to feed the goals of higher profits and share prices.</p>

<p>Design started with a simple slider to hire and fire people, as well as a crude profit bar that got bigger or smaller based on cost and income. Due to its status as a ubiquitous word, "hype" was quickly added as another metric that impacted sales of games.</p>

<p>“But that mechanic isn't any fun without something to react to, and that reaction needs consequences," Vasudeva-Barkdull said. "It was pretty natural to come to the conclusion that random events should be thrown at the player who can only solve them by hiring or firing people. It simulates a point of view where employees are knobs and dials that you can tweak for profit.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaa-sim-prototype-image.jpg?itok=VEg_yFSP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaa-sim-prototype-image.jpg?itok=Mr_sHomT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An early prototype of&nbsp;<em>AAA Simulator</em>&nbsp;provided by Nic, showing how the game looked when it added random events.</figcaption></figure><p>Many of those random events are inspired by things we’ve seen happen over the past few years, as Whitelocke drew upon their experience and perspective with events over that time frame.</p>

<p>“As I finish up the game, I’m already going further back to EA Spouse and things like that. I’ve thought about doing #GamerGate, maybe it’s even mandatory, but it might not fit in a satisfying way. Plus, my dissertation started with #GamerGate, and I’m kind of tired of it,"&nbsp;Vasudeva-Barkdull said.</p>

<p>It’s impacted the design process as well, as the Whitelocke team, consider things like paying contractors in other countries rather than going on Fiverr for the cheapest possible option. As Vasudeva-Barkdull shared, with a new studio, that has often meant hiring no one, and he has done most of the asset creation himself.</p>

<h2>'The Game Industry Is a Roguelite'</h2>

<p>One other aspect of <em>AAA Simulator </em>that is easy to miss at first glance is that it’s actually a roguelite, as eventually, as seems to fit the current state of capitalism, you will fail to make the line of profit go up enough to satisfy your investors. When that happens, your family bails you out, and you get to start again. When I asked Vasudeva-Barkdull about it, he had a fair bit to share with me regarding the design and how it reflects the games industry.</p>

<p>“I realized the game industry is a roguelite. Just look at the Wikipedia for someone like Lars Wingefors. It tells the story of someone failing up in cycles, rebuying, rebranding, resurrecting the name Nordic as it goes bust over and over.&nbsp;He's out at Embracer now, but they're already calling themselves something else and he just keeps getting richer," he said.</p>

<p>"In <em>AAA Simulator</em>, you're a nepobaby because the parent company, some water corporation in Europe, has just bought not one but dozens of AAA studios in an acquisition. Sound familiar? Well, any resemblance to real people or events is purely coincidental, I insist."</p>

<p>Capturing this comes with the fact that the meta progression is represented in the connections you made in the form of experts. It captures the idea of failing up, in part because every time you fail you get to start over, with no consequences other than the loss of what you built.&nbsp;</p>

Vasudeva-Barkdull's favorite of it is the Press Release card because of how it captures corporate sentiment around things like diversity. It has poor grammar, obvious insincerity, a pride flag heart, and a bit of text saying, “We support diverse!”</p>

<p>“That's a difficult question because it's not only up to me alone to decide that. But I think there are several viable solutions for studios depending on where they are and their particular situation. I've heard in Japan they have legal protections from mass layoffs, and that's a start. Or to cure the sickness rather than the symptoms, changes to the system can be made. Different corporate rules, or if the problem is that C-Level is acting only in the interest of shareholders, make the employees into shareholders," he said.</p>

<p>"It's our art, so we should own it. I can't tell anyone what to do, but I hope as we add developers to our own team, we can do it in some kind of equal partnership or co-op structure. It's not that hard to imagine a business structured less like a feudal kingdom and more like a democracy.”</p>

<p><em>AAA Simulator </em>is currently in development with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3358040/AAA_Simulator/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="AAA Simulator">demo available on Steam</a>. A release date has yet to be announced.</p>
