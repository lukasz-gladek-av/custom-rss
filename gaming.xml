		<p>Nacon and Cyanide Studios have revealed Styx: Blades of Greed, a new sequel in the sneaky goblin stealth action series. The game is set to launch across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in autumn 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="(PEGI) Styx: Blades of Greed | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mRb9E2ULlEo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A third game in the Styx series, the titular goblin assassin is returning eight years after his last stealthy self-serving mission in Styx: Shards of Darkness. Where it was all about infiltrating a “good” guy fort to access their boundless supply of Amber last time out, Styx is now after the new mystical powers provided by quartz.</p>
<p>Through the announcement trailer we see him putting this to use, in combination with returning abilities and gadgets. With the inquisition hunting for him, he can use a little mind control to turn allies against each other, use environmental objects for kills, place poison gas bomb traps for guards to trigger, and slow enemies down to make for a hasty escape. Naturally, Styx is quipping and grouching all the way throughout.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this game has advanced over the first two entries. They were both dependable, if fairly straightforward stealth action games that admittedly didn’t quite have the depth and nuance that you’d hope for from the PS4 and Xbox One era of games. With a jump to a newer game engine and the current generation of consoles, I hope that there’s also an increase in gameplay quality, and not just a spruce up of the visuals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/14/styx-shards-of-darkness-review/">Looking back at the last game</a>, I said, “Shards of Darkness could have been a big step forward for the series, giving you a more rounded set of gameplay possibilities, alongside the better looking environments and other areas. Alas it’s not as big an improvement as I’d hoped and is let down by bugs and inconsistencies. It’s a stealth game with one foot stuck in the past, and that remains both a blessing and a curse.”</p>

		<p>Nacon and ACE Team, the makes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/27/clash-artifacts-of-chaos-review/">Clash: Artifacts of Chaos</a> and Zeno Clash, have revealed The Mount: Omen of Cthulhu, a first person horror with up to four player online co-op. The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu | Reveal Trailer (UK | PEGI)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tD4pvmQPETY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Cast as a squad of conquistadors exploring an underound city in an eerie jungle setting, your search for priceless treasure becomes a fight for survival as otherworldly, Lovecraftian horrors distort your senses and threaten your sanity. Sounds could be from your mind playing tricks, you could hallucinate an ally as an enemy creature, and more. You’ll have to try and work as a team to get deeper and deeper into the jungle and somehow make it out alive.</p>
<p>Of course, you’re horribly under-equipped to deal with this kind of terror. Instead of having the machine guns and flamethrowers that you might want, you have to make do with swords, lanterns, axes and muskets. You will have voice chat to your fellow conquistadors, at least.</p>
<p>It’s a big change of pace for ACE Team, whose most recent work was a Zeno Clash revival in Clash: Artifacts of Chaos. That game was all about third person brawling, by way of the Soulslike genre, and coming with a fantastic art style. Before that, the team released a trio of Rock of Ages ball-tumbling puzzlers, and the thoroughly bizarre survival game Eternal Cylinder.</p>

<p>What seems to be a straight-up four person survival horror game might just be their most conventional game yet, but we’re looking forward to seeing the individualistic spin they will inevitably put on proceedings. the snippets of alpha gameplay footage at the end of the trailer certainly backed up the twisted, shifting nature of the slickly produced cinematic that preceded it.</p>
<p>Definitely one to keep an eye on for fans of recent co-op horrors like Phasmophobia, The Outlast Trials, and Lethal Company.</p>

		<p>The first gaming accessory from Nacon’s Racing department, the Revosim RS Pure, will launch in June 2025 and is now available for pre-order.</p>
<p><iframe title="REVOSIM | Live-Action Pre-Order Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NmDUzo6pXE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/31/nacon-announces-new-revosim-direct-drive-racing-wheels/">Announced last May</a>, the Revosim RS Pure is a 9Nm Direct Drive gaming wheel, meeting the core technological standards and expectations of what a high-end racing wheel should provide. Along with the motor, the wheel itself then features imitation leather, and there’s aluminium pedals to get a premium, high-end finish. There’s also a built-in smartphone mount to allow for app connected telemetry and a heads up display.</p>
<p>The RS Pure is the first piece of the puzzle for a broader Revosim line up, getting the foundational wheel and pedals set released first before additional peripherals arrive, which will include a handbrake, gear shifter and clutch pedal. The wheel is compatible with Windows PC only.</p>
<p>The wheel will have <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en/bundle-steering-wheel-base-dd-9nm-pedal-rs-pure">support for the following games at launch</a>, with app telemetry support “in development” across the board</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en/accessories/revosim">Preorders are now live</a> with the full package of wheelbase, wheel and pedals coming in at €799.90. The wheelbase can be had separately for €550, wheel for €200, wheelbase and wheel for €700, and pedals for €150 – I trust that you can all mentally subtract 10 cents from each price there.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/01/hands-on-the-revosim-pure-nacons-first-high-end-racing-wheel/">hands on with the Revosim RS Pure at Gamescom 2024</a>, saying that “Fundamentally, the Revosim Pure just seems to be a nice all-round basis for Nacon to build out their racing wheel range from, and a solid alternative to the big names already in the racing wheel market.”</p>

		<p>The first gameplay for French-created JRPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/teg/edge-of-memories">Edge of Memories</a> has been revealed in a new trailer during Nacon Connect. This sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/edge-of-eternity">Edge of Eternity</a> is set to launch across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC towards the end of 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Edge of Memories | Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0TiQvWIuj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Midgar Studios hopes to bring players back to the land of Heryon in Edge of Memories, building on the foundations of their first JRPG effort. there’s a new evil threatening this world and players will have to take Eline and her companions on a fresh adventure to try and defeat it. A powerful Corrosion i</p>
<p>The story synopsis tells us, “The beautiful, serene landscapes of Avaris are under the threat of a powerful corrupting influence, Corrosion, as it spreads across the land. Mutating anything in its path into horrific abominations. As a Soul Whisperer, it’s your job to travel the world, easing the people of their burdens, and fighting back against the monsters inhabiting the world. During her journey, Eline awakens to a mysterious power that may hold the answer to thwarting the oncoming apocalypse.” Sounds pretty good to me!</p>
<p>Edge of Memories will remain an action-RPG, with fast-paced real-time combat and eye-popping combo attacks. It’s also looking to build on the original artistically. If Edge of Eternity felt like a Final Fantasy game with its art direction, Edge of Memories looks to be more like recent Tales games. This is thanks to collaborating with a host of established creators including character designer Raita Kazama (Xenoblade Chronicles X), while the rest of the team includes writer Sawako Natori (NieR), singer Emi Evans (NieR / NieR: Automata), as well as composers Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger/ Xenogears) and Mariam Abounnasr (Xenoblade Chronicles 3 / ONINAKI).</p>

<p>The original Edge of Eternity launched in 2021, and went on to sell over a million copies, making a follow-up something of a no-brainer. Despite its JRPG trappings, and the various members of the team that hail from there, Midgar Studios is actually based in France, and they’re returning once more for Edge of Memories.</p>
<p>Looking back on the original, in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/08/edge-of-eternity-review/">review</a> for Edge of Eternity, Steve wrote: “Edge of Eternity is definitely a welcome addition to the JRPG pantheon, and while it clearly doesn’t have the budget of the genre giants, it is full of heart and character. I certainly enjoyed my time exploring Heryon, despite a few niggles and a crafting system that adds little. If you go into this with an open mind and have an affection for the genre, then you’ll find much to like.”</p>

			<p>The latest NACON Connect is over, delivering some big news for fans of RoboCop, Styx, Cthulhu, and more.</p>
<p>Let's start with the man of steel. Following the success of RoboCop: Rogue City, which was the publisher's biggest launch and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2023-solid-transitory-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned the vote of our community</a> for Best Shooter Game of 2023, Teyon is back with a standalone expansion titled RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business. Due to launch this Summer, it will task players to reach the top of Omni Tower, now overrun by elite mercenaries. RoboCop will have access to new weapons, brutal finishing moves, and special missions that will take players through intense flashbacks and offer the chance to play as Alex Murphy (prior to the accident) for the first time in a video game.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZxqWFQI7GY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The showcase featured another return. The sneaky goblin <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-shards-darkness-review-crafty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Styx</a> will come back in Styx: Blades of Greed, once again developed by Cyanide Studio. The few details shared by NACON point to the game keeping its formula:&nbsp;open-ended environments, a vast range of powers and tools, and<br>
multiple approaches to completing objectives. The mission is simple: stealing Quartz, a rare and magical resource. The game will be out in the Fall of 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="(ESRB) Styx: Blades of Greed | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/raQj2vqngjU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cthulhu aficionados also have plenty of reasons to rejoice today with two new game announcements. Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss is in development at Big Bad Wolf (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-council-episode-5-demons-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Council</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-swansong-vampires-make-for-excellent-investigators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong</a>). It will be a first-person thriller/investigative adventure where players are put in the shoes of Noah, an agent of Ancile, a secret division of Interpol devoted to occult cases. Ancile investigates the mysterious disappearance of miners in the depths of the Pacific Ocean, eventually leading him to the labyrinthine prison of R'lyeh, an ancient sunken city where Cthulhu itself is imprisoned. This game will launch next year.</p>

<p>The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu, on the other hand, is a first-person cooperative horror game in development at ACE Team (<a href="https://wccftech.com/clash-artifacts-of-chaos-from-zenos-ace-team-gets-november-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clash</a>, Zeno Clash) where players take the roles of Conquistadores on an expedition to discover a legendary underground city rumored to hold untold treasures. Being a Cthulhu game, they'll have to question their sanity at all times and stick together to try and make it out alive when the game launches later this year.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sRDCm5f1zxc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NACON Connect also featured extensive new footage of Rogue Factor's action/adventure game Hell Is Us. The video showed investigation mechanics in which players must rely on their powers of observation, deduction, and intuition to progress through the game and uncover the secrets of these mysterious lands. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-to-release-september-4-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is slated to debut on September 4</a>.</p>

<p>New details about Rainbow Six Siege X’s beta tests have been leaked, and it seems the game might feature a new 6v6 mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leaker responsible for accurately predicting the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal date</a> for Siege X has now provided new details about the upcoming game. According to a new <a href="https://x.com/fraxiswinning/status/1897409037849051323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) by fraxiswinning, Siege X will feature a new 6v6 mode, which the developers seemingly describe as “Experience the new Dual Front game mode featuring 6v6 non-stop action.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides the 6v6 mode, the leaker provided new information about Siege X’s <a href="https://x.com/fraxiswinning/status/1897385623570538733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">closed beta test</a>. Per their post, the closed beta test will be hosted between March 13 and 19, beginning on the same day as the Siege X <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcase</a>. They aren’t sure how players will get access to it or whether the test will be conducted on consoles, as it will be hosted on a ‘test server’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Siege X has been described as “not just another update” but a “major evolution” for the series. The developers are working to ensure the upcoming title remains “at the pinnacle of tactical PvP first-person shooters.” The new instalment will feature graphical and audio upgrades, a refined game feel, and new ways to enjoy it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An unannounced first-person shooter (FPS) multiplayer game has been canceled at Respawn Entertainment. This news comes via former production coordinator at the studio Emilee Evans.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emevans04_opentowork-activity-7303182878773846017-Y_WP?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> on Wednesday, Evans revealed that the “incubation project” she was a part of had been scrapped.</p>



<p>“The unannounced incubation project I was a part of for the past year was canceled this week, so I am joining the group of extremely talented and kind people in the games industry searching for a new role,” Evans said.</p>



<p>The incubation project, while announced, was expected to be a multiplayer FPS title if <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/game-design-director-incubation-team-at-respawn-entertainment-3789765830/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">past job postings</a> were any indication. As far as the theme, setting, or anything else about the game, that remains unknown.</p>



<p>The cancellation of this new game at Respawn follows the cancellation of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio’s Star Wars Mandalorian game</a> in early 2024. When that was canceled, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of restructuring</a> at EA that saw 5% of its staff let go.</p>

Called Unfinished Business, the new content sees RoboCop return to Omni Tower after an army of skilled mercenaries have taken over the building, and it'll be launching in the summer for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Here's the first trailer for it:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZxqWFQI7GY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HZxqWFQI7GY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While it looks like you'll have plenty of targets and challenging opponents in the expansion, it does add an interesting wrinkle in the form of flashback missions. These levels will let players step into the boots of Alex Murphy long before he had his fatal encounter with Clarence J. Boddicker and his gang in the 1987 film. Additionally, the levels featuring RoboCop will also give players access to new weapons, brutal finishers, and special missions.</p><p>RoboCop: Rogue City is admittedly a flawed game, but if you can overlook its rougher parts, you'll find that it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-captures-the-vibe-of-the-movies-and-benefits-from-rpg-inspired-gameplay/1100-6514775/" data-ref-id="1100-6514775">incredibly faithful to the source material</a> and a fun blast of '80s action.

"If you're a fan of RoboCop, then you'll find a lot to love in Rogue City. It's chock full of Easter eggs and manages to capture the look and feel of the first two RoboCop movies with excellent attention to detail, even getting Peter Weller to reprise his role as the eponymous hero."</p>

            <p>
If you love Lovecraft, publisher Nacon will be hoping you also love the two Lovecraft games it's lining up for its 2025 slate - one of which is a "thrilling investigative adventure" from the team behind The Council and Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong.
</p>
<p>
Starting with that one, it's called Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, and cast players as Noah, an agent of a secret Interpol division that specialises in occult cases. Noah's investigating the mysterious disappearance of miners in the depths of the Pacific Ocean - a quest that'll eventually lead to the labyrinthine prison of R'lyeh, where Cthulhu has been contained.
</p>
<p>
All this plays out as a mix of investigate adventure and first-person psychological thriller, with progress requiring players to solve "complex puzzles", make choices that'll shape Noah's fate, and resist the mind-corrupting influence of Cthulhu. And if that appeals, Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, from Big Bad Wolf Studio, launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S next year.

<p>
Which brings us to the second of Nacon's newly announced Lovecraft games, The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu. Developed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zeno-clash">Zeno Clash</a> studio ACE Team, it's a first-person horror game - featuring online co-op for up to four players - that, as its name suggests, draws inspiration from Lovecraft's novella The Mound.

<p>
This one casts players as a squad of conquistadors on an expedition through an eerie, oppressive jungle in search of a legendary underground city, rumoured to house priceless treasures. As they explore deeper into the unknown, they'll encounter monstrous otherworldly entities that distort their senses and threaten their sanity.
</p>
<p>
The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S later this year.

            <p>
RoboCop: Rogue City, developer Teyon's warmly received take on the iconic action movie series, is back with a standalone sequel - titled Unfinished Business - that's launching this summer on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC.
</p>
<p>
The original RoboCop: Rogue City - which melded linear shootouts and light detective work across its semi-open-world - launched to positive reviews when it released toward the tail-end of 2023. Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane, for instance, called it "an entertaining, if unadventurous RoboCop experience" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robocop-rogue-city-review">his three star review</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now Teyon is ready to do it all over again with Unfinished Business, albeit on a presumably somewhat smaller scale. This time around players - still in the role of the titular augmented law enforcer - must reach the top of Old Detroit's Omni Tower, now overrun by elite mercenaries.

<p>
To assist in that quest, players can expect to receive new weapons and "brutal" new finishing moves. Perhaps more intriguingly, though, they'll also experience "intense" flashback missions, stepping into the (normal, non-metallic) shoes of RoboCop's former self, Alex Murphy.
</p>
<p>
You can get a taste of RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business' action in the announcement trailer above. Expect Teyon and publisher Nacon to release more details as the game's "summer" release on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 draws closer.

		<p>Big Bad Wolf and Nacon have announced Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, an investigation adventure that’s inspired, as with everything cosmic tentacle horror, by the Lovecraft universe. The game is coming out in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss | Reveal Trailer (UK | PEGI)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fwtLXbt5n04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This first person psychological thriller will cast players as Noah, an agent of Interpol’s secret occult investigation department, Ancile. The case he’s got to investigate is all about the miners who have been disappearing in the deepest depths of the Pacific ocean, an investigation that will take him down to the ancient sunken city of R’lyeh where Cthulhu has been imprisoned.</p>
<p>You won’t have to go alone, though, with an AI companion called Key embedded in his eyes, presumably able to help with solving puzzles, but you will have to make choices that shape the story’s direction, trying to resist the power of Cthulhu along the way. That, going by the trailer, seems like a pretty tricky task, as it shows Noah struggling with visions, haunted by past events that saw him lose three digits from his right hand, and getting sucked under the surface to come up against big ol’ tentacle face.</p>
<p>The game is coming from the makers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/13/the-council-episode-one-the-mad-ones-review/">The Council</a> and Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong, narrative games that had a similar investigative angle, though The Cosmic Abyss will be shifting to that first person view.</p>

<p>For our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/18/vampire-the-masquerade-swansong-review/">Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong review</a>, Steve said, “Swansong is a good investigative adventure dressed up in vampire finery, but doesn’t quite live up to my expectations due to some overly restrictive design and a disconnect between the third person perspective and the largely text and table top mechanics. Once some of the bugs are patched and there are resources available to support the build choices you make, there is a solid adventure to be found here. It’s not the new Bloodlines, but it’s an authentic Vampire: The Masquerade experience nonetheless.”</p>

There are not many iconic lines in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. Rove has most of them. His big monologue comes early on when you encounter him all webbed up, Frodo-style, by a giant Nerscylla in an ice cave. It might be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibTtPWZcHDw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibTtPWZcHDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best scene</a></span> in the entire game. </p><p>“Ah, now death greets me with a new mask,” he says as he’s prepped for supper. “Or are you my salvation?

It works because the game is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ethangach/status/1897694824741863564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1897694824741863564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">always taking itself deadly seriously</a></span>, even when it’s being purposefully absurd and silly.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The best part is that Rove’s contributions to <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>aren’t limited to your initial meeting with him. You can bump into him out in the field and there are several side quests he’s involved in, including one particularly major story mission in the late game after hitting high rank. And every time you run into him he’s spouting stuff like, “Forget me. Go. If fate wills it, we shall meet again.” Same Rove, same.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>might not ultimately be most people’s 2025 GOTY, but Rove is without a doubt my current front-runner for 2025 video game character of the year. I wouldn’t take a bullet for him but I would take him to Hot Topic and we’d have a blast picking out dumb T-shirts together. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to Yoc9Official,  the man seen in the video wearing a  black hoodie, baseball hat and white pants, was waiting in his car for the restock and tried to push past Yoc9Official to access the Pokémon vending machine.

                <p>Amazon has revealed all of the free PC games that'll be coming to Prime Gaming in March, and there's a pretty solid lineup of classic open-world, fantasy, and puzzle games to grab. In total, there'll be 20 games offered this month, with four games available right now. As a reminder, all of the free games that you claim through Prime Gaming are yours to keep forever, even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and the freebies offered through it.</p><p>The month kicks off with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/saints-row-the-third/" data-ref-id="5000-40483">Saints Row: The Third Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-32858">Mafia 2: Definitive Edition</a>. Considered to be the best in the Saints Row series, the threequel is a goofy sandbox of crime and dubstep-powered weapons, and this remastered edition features enhanced graphics and all of the post-launch DLC. Mafia 2: Definitive Edition is a story-driven open-world game set in the 1940s, as war hero Vito Scaletta becomes entangled with the mob.</p><p>You can also redeem <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crime-boss-rockay-city/" data-ref-id="5000-577630">Crime Boss: Rockay City</a> if you feel like gawking at bad gameplay and want to see Chuck Norris as the bad guy, and there's also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/naheulbeuks-dungeon-master/" data-ref-id="5000-590955">Naheulbeuk's Dungeon Master</a> to round out the first batch of games. March 13 will give you five more games to choose from, with the highlight here being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/endling-extinction-is-forever/" data-ref-id="5000-484683">Endling: Extinction is Forever</a>. It's not a game for the faint-hearted, as Endling lets you take control of the last mother fox on Earth. Driven to protect all of her cubs in a merciless world that is on the brink of destruction, Endling is a stressful and emotional survival-adventure game.</p><p>Moving ahead to March 20, the Prime Gaming library will expand with five more games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mortal-shell/" data-ref-id="5000-510197">Mortal Shell</a> is a flawed but interesting souls-like, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wolfenstein-the-old-blood/" data-ref-id="5000-403573">Wolfenstein: the Old Blood</a> is a spooky spin-off from the first Wolfenstein adventure developed by MachineGames, and you can jump into 2003's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/legacy-of-kain-defiance/" data-ref-id="5000-18258">Legacy of Kain: Defiance</a> to check out the final game in the classic series.</p><p>Finally, March 27 will see six more games arrive to cap the month off with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deus-ex-invisible-war/" data-ref-id="5000-3789">Deus Ex: Invisible War</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-forgotten-city/" data-ref-id="5000-483405">The Forgotten City</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/session-skate-sim/" data-ref-id="5000-483355">Session: Skate Sim</a>.</p><h2>Prime Gaming free games for March 2025</h2><h3>Available now</h3><ul><li>Saints Row: The Third Remastered (GOG Code)</li><li>Mafia 2: Definitive Edition (GOG Code)</li><li>Crime Boss: Rockay City (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Naheulbeuk's Dungeon Master (Amazon Games App)</li></ul><h3>March 13</h3><ul><li>Wall World (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Syberia: The World Before (GOG Code)</li><li>Endling: Extinction is Forever (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Dark Deity: Complete Edition (GOG Code)</li><li>Beholder 3 (Amazon Games App)</li></ul><h3>March 20</h3><ul><li>Wolfenstein: The Old Blood (Xbox and PC via Microsoft Store Code)</li><li>Mutazione (GOG Code)</li><li>Figment 2: Creed Valley (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Legacy of Kain: Defiance (GOG Code)</li><li>Mortal Shell (Epic Games Store)</li></ul><h3>March 27</h3><ul><li>The Forgotten City (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Deus Ex: Invisible War (GOG Code)</li><li>Session: Skate Sim (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Let's Build A Zoo (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Gamedec - Definitive Edition (GOG Code)</li><li>The Wisbey Mystery (Legacy Games Code)</li></ul><p>Prime subscribers will also be able to the following games in January via the Prime Gaming Luna channel:</p><ul><li>WRC Generations: Fully Loaded Edition</li><li>Overcooked 2</li><li>Spitlings</li><li>The Jackbox Party Pack 3</li><li>Strange Horticulture</li><li>Fortnite</li><li>Fortnite Ballistic</li><li>Lego Fortnite Brick Life</li><li>Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li>Fortnite Festival</li><li>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</li><li>Rocket Racing</li><li>Fortnite</li><li>Trackmania</li><li>Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition</li><li>Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li></ul>

Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">Nuovo award nominee</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> individualism in the dead-internet age: an anti-big tech asset flip shovelware r̶a̶n̶t̶ manifesto</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a living digital museum and explorable discussion that takes the player through the developer’s thoughts on the current trajectory of tech and art.&nbsp;</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer spoke with Nathalie Lawhead, the game's creator, to discuss what drew them to take their thoughts on social media and the restriction of tech and art and turn them into a game, the unique power that interaction has to make a subject really connect with someone, and how to weave even the game’s store page into part of the game’s exploration of its subject matter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>individualism in the dead-internet age: an anti-big tech asset flip shovelware r̶a̶n̶t̶ manifesto</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm a solo-developer that makes experimental software and games. My work has been around, including one of my more popular games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Everything is going to be OK</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, making it into the permanent collection of MoMA in New York.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year I started lecturing for various events. One of the going themes in my public speaking has been the way social media privatized the internet, and how that has affected our own creative freedom on computers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a long-standing concern for me because computers started out as such egalitarian things where (simply put) anyone could make a thing and share it, steadily shifting to today's tech-vision where we have all these walled gardens and private platforms that are actually fairly restrictive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The social media layer built over the internet, and the type of internet that we use the most now, has caused positive social change, sure, but I fear that the positive is widely being overshadowed by the empowerment of far-right radicalization and fascism. There's a lot of uncertainty about the future of tech (and the place any individual human has in it) under the shadow of AI and monopolies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My hope of turning some of these talking points into an interactive essay was that maybe it would reach a different crowd that usually doesn't care about reading long articles. It did, too! The conversations it started were interesting to follow.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we challenge these things as artists, we encourage people to believe in a better vision of the future. Art is the greatest conduit to inspire social change. I believe the same to be true for games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we have these movements to "keep politics out of games" or attack marginalized voices to keep them out of games, or whatever... then you have to acknowledge the other side of the coin that there's something about games that can affect social change. Games are a type of art that is deeply meaningful in the digital landscape. I think, even if there is negative friction, that's where artists need to be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I started as a net-artist in the late 90's and eventually ended up in games because "game" became an umbrella term to encompass pretty much all interactive art on a computer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>individualism in the dead-internet age: an anti-big tech asset flip shovelware r̶a̶n̶t̶ manifesto</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interactive essays—using games for the sake of critical theory or documentarian purposes—have been a thing for a long time. There have been these beautiful experiences like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bagenzo.itch.io/madotsukis-closet">madotsuki's closet</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a digital art piece about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yume Nikki</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or experiences like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://essaygames.itch.io/the-last-survey">The Last Survey</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that are more of a narrative essay. The intersection between essays and games based on personal experiences is strong.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What fascinates me is how existing in a game can grow to encompass more than just fiction. You can use it to illustrate these impactful topics in a way that is deeply meaningful to players. The end result is much more personal to the person playing it than if they were to just read an article about what you have to say.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A while ago, someone pointed out the quote "Writing about music is like dancing about architecture" when I was talking about how making a game is an impactful way to talk about games, and I love that comparison. There's so much room for the medium to grow here. I think games criticism, critical theory, and essays being "playable" is an obvious thing to explore. It's certainly much more impactful to people when they are "in" the thing you are talking about.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I used Unreal. The itch page jokingly boasts the features of: "Pedantic views on tech feudalism with nice shader work, and good reflection captures. Overly critical views on capitalism with lumen and nanite enabled."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I wanted to use something that's usually associated with high fidelity AAA type of games, using all the latest offerings of the engine, because it's kind of punk to appropriate that type of AAA aesthetic for something completely counter to what that aesthetic represents. The mainstream has always appropriated queer, punk, and subculture aesthetics. It seemed like an interesting statement to do the opposite as a way to package criticism of capitalism.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges and/or exciting possibilities came out of the idea of presenting your thoughts on this subject as a playable experience? What felt compelling about creating an essay players could inhabit and explore instead of one out of just words?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think you can reach more people if you package what you are saying in an intriguing way. Digital art is a huge possibility space. The internet is kind of divided into these groups of text, audio, or video, but computers can take that so much further. Games are the intersection of all these things, and there's space for exploring how essays could look in context of a game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think it's interesting to point out that streamers and Youtubers have, in many ways, grown more popular than online text-based outlets. Youtubers often repackage these messages into their own videos, and people will rarely actually look into the writing being sourced. Video is just more intriguing of a delivery platform. That's a generalization, but I think it captures how people consume content online.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following that tangent, I wondered if a video game would be just as impactful. Would people be receptive to "playing" an essay about this? If it looked intriguing and high quality enough, would it draw people in?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Individualism in the dead internet age</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is built to be something you meander through while letting the environment illustrate the words. Links to different articles offer tangents, or rabbit holes, that you can fall into, all illustrating the points of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We need more playable essays. It's a wonderful format!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into structuring the experience? Into creating the museum-like environment that guides the player through history and your thoughts while also allowing them the freedom to ignore the path and follow what they desire?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've been steadily saving "free for the month" asset bundles from the Epic game store, where developers give away these expensive beautiful assets for free.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm usually, and just on a personal artistic level, against using assets from others for my own work. There's a stigma to it that I'm paranoid about. I feel like that superstitious fear of what gamers will think is something that holds me back. I decided I wanted to just go completely into that direction of what's considered "taboo" to deliver a commentary on tech culture. It turned out interesting because there's this level of self-awareness and self-parody that kind of comes through.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Things are paced out so that you are tasked with "collecting" parts of the essay, like it’s a museum tour, while stopping in front of these assets to look at them, or look at the links in the display windows.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understanding that players will be players and some will just run through the whole thing, I kept in mind to build it so it can be silly and weird to do that too. You can actually escape the "museum" and walk off into the void if you wanted to. It ends up being a very strange relic of a world to explore.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you shape the loud, colorful, chaotic varied, vibrant spaces the player would explore as they played the game? How did you choose the many, many varied visual elements in this game? Are there elements of the creative Wild West that was the early internet present in how you shaped this game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Individualism in the dead internet age</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is built to be kind of like a museum so you have these throwbacks to old internet art and old desktop elements that all illustrate how vibrant our online culture used to be. Some of it is worked into the world to be almost unsettling... Like being stalked by the giant smiley face as you suddenly find yourself exploring the old Windows 3D Maze screensaver while listening to rants about AI and social media.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The results ended up feeling kind of haunted. I think it's because these familiar old elements are used so out-of-context—like you're exploring a lost past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What unique thoughts and challenges came from creating this work? From doing so using third party assets?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was really hard pacing the audio out in a way that players would get it all, within the order they're supposed to get it, while letting the player also feel free to go where they want.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've never used third party assets before to this extent. It was beautiful to be introduced to this generous space of asset creators that put out so much of their work that kind of ends up being melted into other people's games. Even if you work alone, game development is collaborative in nature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I really wanted to highlight that work without it getting lost in the background.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The exaggerated use of third party assets plays a big part in giving the text a voice. Building this definitely made me more appreciative of asset creators, or these movements in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://itch.io/c/2861178/plundercore-not-by-me-mostly">Plundercore</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where games are made up of recognizable stolen pieces that are re-contextualized to become something else. Other media has so much of this, like sampling culture in music, or collaging for zine making.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was an intentional decision to use other people's assets—these assets then being re-contextualized into something that is criticizing the current tech culture of AI... when one of the major criticisms of AI is that learning models are populated by "stolen work." It challenges my own discomfort surrounding ownership, fairness, and copyright. How am I different as an artist using these assets? Am I being a hypocrite, or am I being "subversive"?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You also put a great deal of thought into the presentation, playfulness, and language of the game's itch.io store page (although you always put this kind of creativity into your store pages). What particular elements felt important to implement into the game's store page, and what drew you to draw from language about shovelware and visual fidelity/effects for your description of the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The title is the best explanation. It's a chaotic bundle of everything that popular culture has tried to reject about games. It's an asset flip, which is a strong insult. It's shovelware, which players complain about. The word rant is crossed out because, for the sake of self-importance, it's a manifesto!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the self-awareness on the outset is a good commentary on itself. The fact that it so heavily criticizes capitalism, while being built in Unreal Engine, bragging about using all the latest bells and whistles, is also a wonderful self-criticism. It criticizes AI while also using re-contextualized work. The comment wheel is spinning, so is this even a serious work? It's weirdly between being really super critical while also mocking itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The current culture of technofeudalism, technocapitalism, mixed with a good dose of dead-internet... all these keywords... Present day is so darkly dystopian it comes around to being almost funny, in a morbid way. I kind of hope people get the subtle ridiculousness of it all.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
