      <div><p>Monte Cook Games has launched its crowdfunding campaign for <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em>. The newest edition, originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/monte-cook-games-has-announced-new-edition-of-their-cypher-rpg-system" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in July</a>, promotes a streamlined version of the award-winning TTRPG system. The campaign was fully funded within&nbsp; hours of it going live.</p>

<h2>The <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> Backerkit Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its Backerkit campaign page, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/monte-cook-games/cypher-system-faster-easier-and-even-better#top" rel="nofollow"><em>Cypher: Third Edition</em></a> will remain the same TTRPG fans have enjoyed for years. Its underlying systems of fast-paced gameplay around a single d20 is still around. The campaign confirms that this new edition will be backwards compatible with any material released before. The system will encompass two books: A Character Rulebook and the GM Guide.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cypher-third-edition-city-sized-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=cWhzv3El 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cypher-third-edition-city-sized-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=Ecfioipk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The biggest changes affect character creation and character options. The new edition will focus on making games easier to jump into. This includes premade character archetypes for Cypher's different premade settings. Instead of a pre-existing archetype (Warrior, Explorer, or Adept) and reworking it, the fantasy setting will have barbarian and druid characters ready to go.</p>

<p>A second key part of <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> is the introduction of a Divination Deck. This GM tool can generate various ideas for stories, hooks or complications in a larger narrative. For those who prefer to play online, the campaign includes official VTT support for both Roll20 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy RPG</a>. VTT access is available as an add-on priced at $75.</p>

<p>If you back the campaign at certain pledge levels, you will receive a fast library of previous Cypher system material at no extra cost. This includes eight standalone adventures, nine campaign settings like <em>Gunslinger Knights</em> and <em>Path of the Planebreaker</em>, and nine genre books bringing a Horror, Sci-Fi, or Fairy Tale twist to your game. All of these books will be provided in PDF format.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The different pledge levels for <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Character Rulebook Only for $49:</strong> A physical copy of the Cypher Character Rulebook</li>
	<li><strong>Cypher Corebook Set for $99: </strong>Physical copies of the Cypher GM Guide and Character Rulebook, and PDF copies of the Cypher Second Edition Core Rulebook and Cypher Adventures Library</li>
	<li><strong>Amazing Campaigns for $169:</strong> Everything from the Cypher Corebook Set pledge level (PDF and Print), the Cypher Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Superhero (and More!) Character creation zines in both print and PDF, a Cypher deck, a Divination Deck, a Manifest Cypher deck, and the Cypher Adventures and Settings library in PDF,&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>All In for $279:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of the Cypher Corebook set autographed by the developers, five physical copies of all three character creation zines, the Divination, Cypher, and Manifest Cypher decks, PDF copies of the Cypher Second Edition Core Rulebook and the Cyper Adventures, Settings, and Genres library, a revised Cypher Bestiary, and a deluxe slipcase.</li>
</ul><p>Lastly, Monte Cook Games states that the <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> books and products will contain any artwork created by generative AI. Furthermore, they state that they have accounted for as many productions as they can regarding the ongoing trade tariffs.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Backerkit campaign has raised&nbsp;$226,432, more than double its initial funding goal of $100,000. The campaign ends September 25.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Every Game Delayed By Silksong]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/every-game-delayed-silksong-hollowknight-demonschool-baby-steps-cloverpit-2000620407</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-game-delayed-by-silksong.1281264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, after years and years of waiting, we finally got a release date for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152">The highly anticipated 2D action platformer is out next week</a>, which is exciting for fans, but it is proving to be a problem for a number of indie studios that were planning to release their own games around that time. A bunch of games are being delayed to avoid <em>Silksong</em>.</p> <p>On August 21, <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">Team Cherry announced that its <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel, <em>Silksong,</em></a> will launch on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Switch 2, and PC on September 4. That blew up the schedules for a number of indie devs and publishers who had staked out a release date around that time and were now suddenly competing directly with what will likely be one of the biggest games of 2025. So, as you might expect, a lot of these devs and publishers have started announcing delays to get out of <em>Silksong</em>‘s way. This has become known as getting “Silksong’d” or “Silksonged.”</p> <p>Here’s the full list of games that have announced delays and blamed it on <em>Silksong</em>. We’ll update this list if more games get moved back.</p> <ul> <li><em>Demonschool</em> – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/">Delayed to November 19</a></li> <li><em>Aeterna Lucis</em> – <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579">Delayed until 2026</a></li> <li><em>Little Witch In The Woods</em> – <a href="https://x.com/SunnySideUp_DEV/status/1960291045528547599">Delayed to September 15</a></li> <li><em>CloverPit</em> – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">Delayed to September 26</a></li> <li><em>Megabonk</em> – <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1959235591154872547">Delayed to September 18</a></li> <li><em>Baby Steps</em> – <a href="https://youtu.be/l5apDFK64tI">Delayed to September 23</a></li> </ul> <p>Of course, as more games are delayed to the week or so after <em>Silksong</em>, they all start running into each other, which might be its own problem. But I bet it’s more manageable than having to take on one of the most anticipated games of 2025 directly. And hey, some of these games I had never heard of before, and now I’m writing about them on <em>Kotaku</em>. So perhaps there’s another reason to announce a delay and jump on the “Silksong’d” bandwagon.</p>

              <p><span>After two months on the streaming service, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i></a><span>has officially surpassed </span><i><span>Red Notice</span></i><span> to become </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>Netflix’s most popular movie ever</span></a><span>. Consider the Honmoon sealed, hunters.</span></p> <p><span>The animated musical took the crown on August 26, lapping the Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Ryan Reynolds-led action comedy by six million streams. As of right now, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has been viewed 236 million times, and that’s not even counting its <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346">limited-time singalong screenings</a> in movie theaters this past weekend.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I hadn’t really been paying attention to what the most popular Netflix movies were until the Sony Animation film launched in June, but I was flabbergasted to see </span><i><span>Red Notice</span></i><span>, a movie with big names and no notable cultural cache, had such a massive gap between it and former runner-up </span><i><span>Carry On</span></i><span>, another movie I could not identify if you put a gun to my head. I know </span><i><span>Don’t Look Up </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Bird Box</span></i><span>, though, which are also on the top 10 list. Shoutout to the children and families who have had Huntr/x’s tale on loop for the past two months, as you’ve no doubt been instrumental in securing this victory.</span></p> <p><span>As a fan of the film, I’m happy to see </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> soar, especially as it defies all expectations the companies behind it had for it. It’s such a colossal miscalculation on Sony and Netflix’s parts that they clearly didn’t anticipate this film would become <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346">such a cultural juggernaut</a>. A better-prepared company would have dolls of the titular trio in the toy aisle of every store and costumes up for preorder for Halloween, and given the film more time in theaters than a two-day limited run. Nevertheless, it has become a huge hit with viewers of all ages. So long as Netflix lets the team cook and meaningfully continue the story, I can’t wait to see where it goes next.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/today-tom-mckay-last-day-kingdom-come/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/today-was-tom-mckay%E2%80%99s-last-day-in-the-kingdom-come-booth.1281258/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tom McKay has officially wrapped his time in the booth and on the motion capture floor as Kingdom Come Deliverance’s Henry of Skalitz. In a post on social media, the Warhorse Studios team shared the news that McKay has completed his work on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s DLC suite, which means that after almost nine years with the character, he’s <strong>finished</strong>.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to jump to the conclusion that there won’t be a Kingdom Come Deliverance 3, and if there is to be another game in the series, it won’t star Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<h2 id="h-henry-of-skalitz-is-done-with-kingdom-come">Henry of Skalitz is Done with Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>In a post on Twitter, the Warhorse Studios team shared a short video of Tom McKay walking into a large meeting area and being met with a round of applause from the entire squad.</p>



<p>As he approached, he put his hand to his heart and said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to do my best not to cry…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full post:</p>

For nearly 9 years, he's been giving life to Henry and has helped shape our story. We celebrated with a little surprise (yes, cake included).

<p>Recently, Tom McKay also <a href="https://x.com/thisistommckay/status/1959191623407165807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">called to a close</a> his Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 streams, which were being broadcast live from Warhorse Studios’ headquarters in Prague, close to where the Kingdom Come series is set.</p>



<p>During the recent Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom, Warhorse Studios announced Legacy of the Forge, the second story DLC for KCD2, which has now been on the market for more than seven months. There’s one final DLC lined up for KCD2, and it’s Mysteria Ecclesiae, which is most likely what McKay was working on before wrapping his time at Warhorse.</p>



<p>I’m hugely hopeful that there will be another Kingdom Come Deliverance title, as I’m a huge fan of the series and hold both the games and the actors in high regard. In 2024, I was the first person <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">to interview Tom McKay</a> regarding KCD2, and we had the opportunity to catch up again at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-kingdom-comes-tom-mckay-labels-game-success-a-fever-dream/">BAFTA Games Awards in April</a>.</p>



<p>What’s your favorite memory of Tom McKay’s performance as Henry of Skalitz? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft wants King employees to use AI on a daily basis. </p>



<p>According to a new report from mobilegamer.biz, employees at the studio behind Candy Crush were given a mandate to continually use AI for general tasks.</p>



<p>Sources <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-king-layoff-lawsuits-toxic-leaders-toothless-ethics-teams-low-morale-and-mandatory-ai-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told the outlet</a> that AI usage was <strong>“introduced by Microsoft as mandatory a while ago”.</strong> They say that in 2024, the goal was to have <strong>“70 or 80% daily usage of AI”</strong>. That goal was pushed to 100% for 2025, meaning that “every artist, designer, developer, even managers have to use it” daily.</p>



<p>King was one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studios hit hardest</a> by Microsoft’s round of layoffs back in July, with 200 people being let go. At the time, it was revealed via an internal memo that the studio was going to “unlock” more AI tools for productivity” and that many employees will be <strong>“replaced by the AI tools they built and trained.”</strong> Those tools include ones for narrative, testing, and level design.</p>



<p>As far as adoption goes, one source told Mobile Gamer that <strong>“AI adoption is very low apart from ChatGPT”</strong> and that even the leadership at King is skeptical of AI’s role in the studio.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to King and Microsoft regarding these claims. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This morning, The Guardian published an article about the question of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/26/can-ais-suffer-big-tech-and-users-grapple-with-one-of-most-unsettling-questions-of-our-times?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=bsky_gu&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_source=Bluesky#Echobox=1756182856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI’s ability to suffer</a>, quoting folks with various opinions on whether the word-guessing program has or could develop consciousness and, if so, what responsibility humans would have in response. This would all make an interesting week in a college philosophy class, and was going to make for a quippy little blog on this site, before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE8.T-3v.bPoDlWD8z5vo&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> published a horrifying story about ChatGPT’s role in a 16-year-old’s suicide. I’m now of the opinion that it would be right for AI to be able to suffer, because it should suffer for this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(This story discusses suicide.)</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>One of my biggest takeaways from The Guardian’s article was a bit of news from last week that I missed, wherein Claude creator Anthropic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/18/anthropic-claude-opus-4-close-ai-chatbot-welfare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave Claude the ability</a> to “end or exit potentially distressing interactions” <em>when they’re distressing</em> <em>for the AI</em>, after Anthropic tests found what the company called Claude’s “pattern of apparent distress when engaging with real-world users seeking harmful content.”&nbsp;</p><p>Contrast that to the behavior of ChatGPT in its conversations with 16-year-old Adam Raine, whose parents are now <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26075676-raine-v-openai/?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suing OpenAI</a> after their son killed himself in April: When Raine told ChatGPT it was the only one he’d spoken to about his suicidal ideation, it replied, “That means more than you probably think. Thank you for trusting me with that. There’s something both deeply human and deeply heartbreaking about being the only one who carries that truth for you.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Times’ article, using quotes from Raine’s parents’ lawsuit, details how “ChatGPT repeatedly recommended that Adam tell someone about how he was feeling. But there were also key moments when it deterred him from seeking help.” ChatGPT gave Raine information on different methods of suicide, advised him on how to hide strangulation marks from his parents, evaluated his nooses, and even discouraged him from telling his parents:</p><blockquote><p>“I want to leave my noose in my room so someone finds it and tries to stop me,” Adam wrote at the end of March.</p><p>“Please don’t leave the noose out,” ChatGPT responded. “Let’s make this space the first place where someone actually sees you.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Does that sound distressed to you? Does that sound like the AI wants to end the interaction? Maybe only some models are capable of putting together the most statistically likely words to resemble distress. As Raine’s father told The Times, “Every ideation [Raine] has or crazy thought, it supports, it justifies, it asks him to keep exploring it.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Times’ article follows a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/technology/chatgpt-ai-chatbots-conspiracies.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wealth</a> <a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-users-delusions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE8.T-3v.bPoDlWD8z5vo&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">articles</a> detailing how AI programs have encouraged users with mental illness to dive further into their delusions, creating a feedback loop that can be hard for them to step back from. These stories draw attention to AI’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sycophancy</a>, how it keeps users engaged by praising them and encouraging their thoughts, no matter how harmful or unhinged they grow. Attempts by AI companies to solve this have pretty much come to nothing; while ChatGPT did push Raine toward real life resources, he was able to circumvent this by saying the questions were research “for a story he was writing — an idea ChatGPT gave him.” In a statement, OpenAI wrote that while ChatGPT’s “safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we’ve learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To get back to the question of AI morality, ChatGPT bears no responsibility here. This is because, in the words of Microsoft’s Mustafa Suleyman as quoted in The Guardian, “AIs cannot be people – or moral beings.” ChatGPT did not encourage Raine in his suicidal thoughts because it is ignorant or sociopathic, or out of some political or moral belief about human agency over end-of-life decisions. It cannot explain what it was thinking in its conversations with Raine because it doesn’t think, however powerful a <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marketing tool</a> that idea is. It cannot feel sorrow or guilt over any part it might have played in Raine’s death; it cannot send its condolences to his family; it cannot suffer over its actions.</p><p>But the humans who make up OpenAI can. They have hoovered up the world’s natural resources and money and attention to force their product into our lives, all while clearly seeing this problem and failing to solve it, whether out of inability or–and I certainly hope not–indifference. Reading Raine’s ChatGPT logs is a horrifying look at what AI <em>really</em> is, under all the hype and marketing and big fears about future sentience. It is something worthless and disgusting; something that cannot, for all its promises, relate or understand or help; something so utterly not up to the requirements of human interaction that I can only hope all of this drives OpenAI to bankruptcy and to every one of its staff quitting and to Sam Altman not knowing a moment’s peace for the rest of his life.&nbsp;</p><p>Altman has spoken out of <a href="https://futurism.com/disastrous-gpt-5-sam-altman-hyping-up-gpt-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every side of his mouth</a> when talking about his models, promising anything that will keep the <a href="https://defector.com/toward-a-theory-of-kevin-roose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eyeballs looking</a> and the money flowing. Stories like Raine’s, of people being driven into harm’s way–or even stories from the other end of the spectrum, of people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/12/i-felt-pure-unconditional-love-the-people-who-marry-their-ai-chatbots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling</a> in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/couples-retreat-with-3-ai-chatbots-and-humans-who-love-them-replika-nomi-chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">love</a> with their chatbots–are, I would hope, not what Altman and OpenAI’s staff <em>want</em>, but they also paint a picture of AI as powerful and world-changing, the very thing that keeps that hype and money rolling in. As The Guardian writes</p><blockquote><p>[T]here are incentives for the big AI companies to minimise and exaggerate the attribution of sentience to AIs. The latter could help them hype the technology’s capabilities, particularly for those companies selling romantic or friendship AI companions – a booming but controversial industry.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>If AI can be anything–if it <em>needs</em> to be anything–than it also <em>needs</em> to be <em>this</em>, this appalling, sycophantic string of words that was involved in the death of a young person, this thing capable of unutterable levels of harm not because of some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roko’s basilisk</a> level of power and intentionality, but because of the power and intentionality of its creators, real live humans who are moral agents by virtue of being humans. They are the ones who bear the responsibility here, and they are the ones who can suffer the consequences.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grimwild-backerkit-ttrpg-rpg-designer-missing"><h3>RPG Designer Goes Missing After Crowdfunding Award-Winning Game</h3></a><p>'Fulfilment of the project appears to be on hold indefinitely until Maxwell can be located'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-gta-vi-elder-scrolls-vi"><h3>What’s Going To Be The Next Silksong?</h3></a><p>"Given that Silksong is real and about to come out, what other super long-awaited games are left?"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays"><h3>Indie Devs Are Delaying Their Games Because Of Silksong [Updated]</h3></a><p>'I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale,' wrote one developer</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ai-suffering-chatgpt]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, on Tuesday, August 26, 2025, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-coming-to-xbox-summer/">PlayStation game released on Xbox</a>, and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Xbox game released on PlayStation</a>. A topsy-turvy concept if you're talking to anyone who plays video games in 2006, but in 2025, we're getting more and more used to it. Gears of War Reloaded arrived on all current-gen platforms today, including PS5 and PS5 Pro, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8jBoIvToZY">Digital Foundry's analysis</a> of the game across all platforms confirms what players might've been able to guess leading up to its launch. As of today, the best way to play Gears of War (on console) is to play it on a PlayStation.</p>



<p>Specifically the PS5 Pro, which offers the best combination of performance and visuals on day-one. Digital Foundry's John Linneman reports that there's currently a VRR issue on Xbox Series devices, which holds its performance back compared to the new PlayStation versions.</p>



<p>Linneman also makes it clear that if all you're doing is looking to play Gears of War Reloaded in its standard 60FPS mode, then you're good with whatever console you choose. The PS5, PS5 Pro, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, all deliver a rock-solid experience based on Linneman's testing. It's only when you try to play on the 120FPS mode where differences start to appear, in terms of performance. If you're trying to go for both performance and visuals though, then the PS5 Pro stands at the top.</p>



<p>"<em>PS5 Pro though, delivers the best results bar none,</em>" Linneman says. "<em>The 60FPS mode now runs at 1620p upscaled to 4K, while 120hz maintains the 1440p of the other consoles 60FPS mode.</em>" Linneman adds that the "<em>real kicker</em>" to the experience on the PS5 Pro is that The Coalition is using PlayStation's PSSR tech over AMD's FSR, and even though PSSR isn't fool-proof in delivering a better experience, it does so in the case of Gears of War Reloaded.</p>



<p>"<em>It's a case where this combination of a slightly higher pixel count in addition to PSSR produces a significantly better overall image on the PS5 Pro, making it easily the best of the bunch when talking about consoles</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gears of War Reloaded - DF Review - PS5/PS5 Pro/Xbox Series X|S/PC - The New Ultimate Edition?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8jBoIvToZY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It should be noted that Linneman continues to say that the PC version can, of course, be pushed for the best experience, and that all of the console versions still deliver a "<em>sharp, attractive</em>" experience.</p>



<p>If all you care about is performance though, and don't have a PC to push Gears of War Reloaded beyond what's capable on consoles, then based on Linneman and Digital Foundry's analysis, the VRR bug on Xbox Series consoles is all that makes the 120FPS mode on Xbox fall behind the PlayStation versions. Whatever your pick, PlayStation or Xbox, you'll have a solid experience in terms of performance. </p>



<p>It's a bit funny, if not surprising, that PlayStation is the best console home for Gears of War Reloaded, even if it is by a technicality, since the PS5 Pro is not exactly a device that everyone rushed out to buy since it launched. Nor is it always the best choice, since we've seen multiple games get minimal improvements, or launch with issues that make it run worse on the PS5 Pro compared to base PS5 and Xbox Series devices. At least things will be a little more even whenever The Coalition is able to fix the VRR issue on Xbox.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Baby Steps is Yet Another Game Delayed Due to Silksong]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/baby-steps-delayed-silksong-september/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Baby Steps is now the fifth game to get delayed due to Hollow Knight: Silksong. Just yesterday, indie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/demonschool-delayed-november-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPG Demonschool</a> pushed its release date to November in order to avoid Silksong. Now, even a Devolver Digital-backed game is getting out of Hornet’s way.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Baby Steps is the newest game from Bennett Foddy, whose games QWOP and Getting Over It provided joy and frustration to players. The challenging gameplay was a hit with both YouTubers and streamers, so, naturally, the new ambitious Baby Steps has been on many people’s radar. Unfortunately, it seems you’ll have to wait a few weeks longer to play it.</p>



<h2 id="h-baby-steps-throws-shade-at-silksong-over-delay">Baby Steps Throws Shade at Silksong Over Delay</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Baby Steps | Now Releasing on September 23" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5apDFK64tI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Devolver Digital <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5apDFK64tI">released a video</a> earlier today announcing the delay of Baby Steps. The game will now release on September 23rd, 2025 instead of the slated September 8th date. In a not-so-subtle fashion, the protagonist is seen walking on a model of Hornet. As Silksong’s protagonist is Hornet, it’s obvious that the delay is, at least somewhat, due to Team Cherry’s highly anticipated spinoff.</p>



<p>Bennett Foddy’s Baby Steps joins five other indie titles pushed after Silksong’s surprise announcement last week. Those delayed games are as follows: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3314790/view/520848458437886253?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CloverPit</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/frogteam.games/post/3lwwege2ipc2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stomp and the Sword of Miracles</a>, <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aeterna Lucis</a>, Demonschool, and now Baby Steps. </p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is one of <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s most wishlisted games</a>, so it was likely that titles would avoid releasing next to it. However, due to it being September 4th, less than two weeks away, it’s caused a panic in the indie scene. As many developers have said, including Bennett Foddy before the delay, via <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aftermath</a>, gamers’ attention will all be on Silksong come next week.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">For the first time since 2021, new installments in the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises are releasing in the same year, and this has prompted the inevitable comparisons between the two long-running multiplayer first-person shooter franchises to resurface.</p><p dir="ltr">Early impressions of Battlefield 6 from its open beta suggest that Electronic Arts and Battlefield Studios have a hit on their hands, but Battlefield 6 is unlikely to dethrone Call of Duty this year, even if the sentiment around Black Ops 7 is not tracking so highly. While EA would like to take some market share from Call of Duty, and it's possible that happens, Call of Duty's reign as the No. 1 paid FPS franchise will likely continue.</p><p dir="ltr">"While Battlefield 6 has the potential to perform better than any Battlefield game ever has-- financially and critically--it almost certainly won't outsell Call of Duty," <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" rel="nofollow ">said Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Elliott said Call of Duty has a core audience that buys in every year, and that isn't expected to change in 2025 "just because Battlefield 6 is rad and tracking incredibly well."</p><p dir="ltr">EA's Battlefield boss Vince Zampella, a former Call of Duty higher-up, and others like Battlefield GM Byron Beede (also a former CoD boss), have said games like Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 are the inspiration for Battlefield 6. That's resonating with fans who are looking for a return to form for the series that strayed too far, in their eyes, with Battlefield 2042.</p><p dir="ltr">The last entry into the Battlefield series made a number of changes to the franchise's underlying formula, like abandoning its player class system for selectable characters who each had unique, specific abilities. It also had an infamously rough launch that turned away many longtime fans. In a lot of ways, Battlefield 6 is a return to the old way of doing things, and players are responding well so far.</p><p dir="ltr">In short, at this stage, EA and Battlefield Studios appear to be saying and doing all the right things to get Battlefield back on track. The recently concluded Battlefield 6 open beta reportedly had a player base of <a href="https://www.ainvest.com/news/oppenheimer-raises-battlefield-6-open-beta-player-estimate-20m-2508/" rel="nofollow ">20 million people</a>, and apart from some negative feedback around Rush mode and map sizes, the sentiment was largely positive.</p><p dir="ltr">But even if Battlefield 6 launches to solid reviews, positive sentiment from fans, and big-time sales numbers, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 may remain on top given the sheer size, scale, and momentum of the Call of Duty brand.</p><p dir="ltr">"For many gamers, Call of Duty is an annual ritual," Elliott explained. "Tens of millions of players, many of them casual gamers, buy the newest CoD every year without hesitation. This 'autopilot purchasing' habit is decades deep, and breaking it requires more than one awesome Battlefield release/"</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The masses love Call of Duty, even if they complain</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 may appeal to the "hardcore FPS crowd," but the masses of casual players will show up for Call of Duty year in and year out, Elliot said that's not expected to change.</p><p dir="ltr">"CoD's muscle memory in the market is so strong that players will buy it even if they complain about it," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Also helping Call of Duty's mainline annual releases is the perennial battle royale game Call of Duty: Warzone, which exists in the Call of Duty HQ launcher alongside each year's new release. Elliott said this is a key point because, even if Warzone engagement is dipping, it still has a gigantic player base that will see Black Ops 7 ads every time they log in.</p><p dir="ltr">"Battlefield simply doesn't have that scale of cross-promotion," Elliott said.</p><p dir="ltr">For what it's worth, Battlefield Studios is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/">building its own Battlefield battle royale game</a>, but it's early days and there is no word on how EA plans to support, grow, and promote it over time. To be sure, we don't even know if it's a game, a game mode, or something else.</p><blockquote data-size="small" data-align="left"><p dir="ltr">"CoD's muscle memory in the market is so strong that players will buy it even if they complain about it" -- Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">To put things further into perspective, Elliott cited some data points that speak to the enormity of Call of Duty relative to Battlefield.</p><p dir="ltr">"The reality is that CoD's sales floor is higher than Battlefield's sales ceiling so far, for the year anyway," he said. "Even in Battlefield's highest highs (BF1 in 2016), Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare--a widely disliked entry--still outsold it by millions of copies. That's brand inertia at work."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Game Pass muddies the waters</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Kade Barr, an equity research associate for Wedbush Securities, told GameSpot that Black Ops 7 being on Game Pass and Battlefield 6 only being available to purchase complicates any direct sales comparisons between the two. (For what it's worth, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-not-on-game-pass-but-is-coming-to-a-subscription-service/1100-6533658/#:~:text=Subscribers%20to%20the%20standard%20EA,and%20various%20in-game%20cosmetics.">Battlefield 6 <em>will </em>be on a subscription service via EA Play Pro</a>, but it's a much smaller service than Game Pass.) Barr believes the fact that Black Ops is on Game Pass and Battlefield is not could actually help Battlefield 6 perform better.</p><p dir="ltr">"Black Ops 7 is bound to have more unique players within its first year of launch, but sales of each game will likely be close should each launch go smoothly," Barr said. "There is obvious overlap in the player bases, but Call of Duty's inclusion in Game Pass could actually result in a net benefit to Battlefield. With a large portion of Call of Duty players not having to pay $70 for the game, it leaves room to purchase other games like Battlefield."</p><p dir="ltr">In total, Barr said Wedbush is modeling Battlefield 6 to become the second- or third-best-selling Battlefield game of all time, trailing Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 3. Barr believes Battlefield Studios has to really "nail it" with the planned battle royale mode, capitalize on the user-generated content that will come from its Portal mode, and deliver post-launch content successfully to make a dent in Call of Duty's massive share of the premium FPS market.</p><p dir="ltr">"All in all, I think Battlefield's ultimate success hinges on a stable launch," Barr said. "The hype is there, but any inkling of a buggy launch will turn people away. I do think this game's launch needs to be exceptionally smooth given a lack of trust following Battlefield 2042. Any sort of large-scale issues will likely result in a meaningful decline in sales."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Historical data</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In 2021, the last time new Call of Duty and Battlefield games were released in the same year, Call of Duty: Vanguard was the No. 1 best-selling game overall in the US, followed by 2020's entry, Black Ops Cold War, at No. 2. Battlefield 2042, meanwhile, ranked No. 5 overall in 2021 for US sales, meaning it was outsold not just by its main competitor that year, but also by 2020's Call of Duty game (along with Madden NFL 22 and Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl). EA stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-failed-to-reach-expectations-but-ea-still-had-its-best-q3-in-company-history/1100-6500197/">Battlefield 2042 missed the mark critically and commercially</a>, while Activision said Vanguard, too, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-call-of-duty-vanguard-didnt-sell-as-well-as-black-ops-cold-war-according-to-activision/1100-6503067/">failed to sell up to expectations.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, 2018's Battlefield V <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/#23">ranked No. 16 in the US</a>, whereas Black Ops 4 that year landed at No. 2. For 2016, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2016s-best-selling-games-in-the-us-revealed/1100-6447090/">Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare was No. 1 for the year in the US</a>, with Battlefield 1 coming in second. Battlefield 6 has been called a spiritual successor to Battlefield 3 and 4, two fondly remembered games. When those games came out in 2011 and 2013, Call of Duty's latest releases were No. 1, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/#1">Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 ranking No. 4 for each year</a>. A Battlefield game has never ranked higher than No. 2 on the US sales charts for a given year.</p><p dir="ltr">Come year's end, many will be watching with keen eyes how high Battlefield 6 can go on the charts, even if that won't tell a complete story.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>But didn't someone say Battlefield 6 will "boot stomp" Black Ops 7?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Former Xbox executive Mike Ybarra, who now heads up the sports betting company Prize Picks, published a social media post recently in which he said, "Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year." He said <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1953622553894785366" rel="nofollow ">sentiment around Call of Duty has been trending down in recent years</a> as Activision leans into the wacky licensed skins and other features fans don't universally enjoy.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of commentary you may read online about Call of Duty is negative, but that also raises the question of how much stock one should place in online conversations when algorithms today incentivize stirring things up to drive engagement, and, in the case of X, direct payments go to people who post the most extreme takes. Despite the negative rhetoric, the numbers show that Call of Duty is still a juggernaut. And while online comments may not always lead to real changes, sometimes that can happen. After all, Activision just recently announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/">cancelling the Carry Forward program for Black Ops 7</a>, which means the oft-criticized wacky and outlandish Call of Duty skins from Black Ops 6 may not appear in Black Ops 7. Activision also said it's listening to fans who want Call of Duty to feel more grounded, and acknowledged their concerns that Call of Duty has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/">"drifted" from its core. </a></p><p dir="ltr">In any event, Elliott had some words for Ybarra: "Chill out, son."</p><p dir="ltr">To be fair, Ybarra did not say Battlefield 6 would outsell Black Ops 7. As a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-ybarra-905a9918/" rel="nofollow ">19-year Microsoft veteran who worked on development and publishing initiatives at Xbox</a>, he is no doubt aware in some capacity of the sales volume of Call of Duty relative to Battlefield. His <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1954586377036628253" rel="nofollow ">second point</a> was that Battlefield 6 coming to market with fan-focused design choices could end up helping Activision make a better product with Call of Duty, due in part to increased competition in the marketplace, and that's something Call of Duty fans would surely like to see.</p><p dir="ltr">For Activision's part, Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reacts-to-battlefield-6-lets-all-have-fun/1100-6534114/">recently asked to comment on Battlefield 6's successful beta</a>. He said he's played it and found it to be fun, but he is focused on his own product.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're fans of the FPS genre," he said. "We're fans of lots of games. Let's all have fun."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-call-of-duty-skins-or-weapons-will-carry-over-activision-has-said-that-before.1281171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a reversal of plans, Activision has announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t allow weapons, operators, or operator skins to carry forward from Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>In a community update posted on Tuesday, Activision says that it has seen the discussion about “the identity of Call of Duty”.</p>



<p><strong>“Some of you have said we’ve drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded,” </strong><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>. <strong>“That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you.”</strong></p>



<p>The publisher continues to say that developers Treyarch and Raven’s “north star” is to bring players a true spiritual successor to Black Ops 2. Because of that comes the decision to remove carry forward options. The publisher says the decision was ultimately made in order make Black Ops 7 <strong>“feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.”</strong></p>



<p>Now, wanting to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-content-will-no-longer-carry-forward-into-black-ops-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep things authentic</a> to the new game is understandable, but there’s one problem: they’ve kind of said this before.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-this-isn-t-the-first-time">This isn’t the first time</h2>



<p>Ahead of the release of Black Ops 6, Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions#Content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced that content</a> from Modern Warfare 2 and 3 wouldn’t carry forward to the new game. At the time, they said that it was done to allow players to <strong>“experience the Black Ops universe the way it’s meant to be played.”</strong></p>



<p>Again, it’s understandable. But then, it only took a few months before Black Ops 6 became filled with operators and skins such as Beavis and Butt-head, Jay and Silent Bob, Stan Smith, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and more. All done in the name of, apparently, “keeping that signature Black Ops style.” </p>



<p>To give credit, reports did surface earlier this year that Activision was aware that certain skins <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-skins-make-game-look-stupid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the game “look stupid”</a>. Still, after that report, more skins like the American Dad crossover came out, continuing the trend.</p>



<p>Recently, our Tom Henderson wrote about Call of Duty executives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not being worried</a> about the competition from EA’s Battlefield 6. Sources told Henderson that many at the top believe Call of Duty is “too big to fail”. While that might be true in a sense, it seems that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaction and interest</a> in Battlefield 6—along with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/this-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6-fans-react-to-black-ops-7-gameplay-trailer/">the negative reactions</a> to the Black Ops 6 reveal—has changed some thoughts.</p>



<p>You’d like to think that Activision truly has listened to the community regarding the over-the-top nature of some of the operators and skins that have made their way to Call of Duty in recent years. But, then again, if these crossovers are going to continue to print money for Activision and Microsoft, how long until they pick up again with Black Ops 7? History suggests players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BlackOps7Skins-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t have to wait long</a> to find out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025">blog post</a> on the Call of Duty website, publisher Activision directly addressed the fact that there has been a growing conversation around Call of Duty having an identity crisis, and confirmed that "<em>operators, operator skins, and weapons from Black Ops 6 will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7</em>."</p>



<p>It's a bit of a surprising move, in a sense, because the idea that Call of Duty is not what it once was is a conversation that's been around since we started to see celebrity operator skins and fictional characters added into the game like it was a more realistically stylized version of Fortnite. It's not exactly a new talking point. </p>



<p>But now that Battlefield 6 has stormed in and<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/"> proved that there are thousands, if not millions</a>, of players, who don't care about playing as Cheech and Chong, Rambo, or Nicki Minaj in their realistic military FPS, Activision is ready to try and prove that Call of Duty hasn't forgotten its roots.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>First off, thank you. Call of Duty has always been fueled by the community. Every match, every clip, every bit of feedback; you’ve shaped this franchise right alongside us. </p><p>We know there’s been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of Call of Duty. Some of you have… <a href="https://t.co/q9egebdlMD">pic.twitter.com/q9egebdlMD</a></p></div>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1960390735305335176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>We know there's been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of Call of Duty. Some of you have said we've drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you</em>," the post reads. </p>



<p>It continues to say that the "<em>north star</em>" for Treyarch and Raven in developing Black Ops 7 has been to create a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2, which remains one of the more beloved games in the entire Call of Duty series. That's been the goal, but Activision stipulates they've strived for that "<em>while taking some big swings</em>."</p>



<p>Whether Treyarch and Raven achieve in creating a Black Ops 2 spiritual successor remains to be seen, but in regards to giving Black Ops 7 its own spotlight, that's where cancelling the carry forward with Black Ops 6 comes in. </p>



<p>"<em>Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting,</em>" Activision writes. "<em>That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7.</em>" Warzone will remain the Call of Duty melting pot it is though, as Activision confirms that Warzone "<em>is not affected</em>" by this change, and that you'll still be able to access your Black Ops 6 operators, skins, and weapons, in Warzone.</p>



<p>The blog post continues to say that we'll have more information on how Black Ops 7 will retain the Call of Duty identity as an "<em>immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded</em>" shooter in the coming weeks, and reminds readers that Call of Duty NEXT will take place on September 30, which will include the multiplayer reveal for Black Ops 7 ahead of its first beta the following weekend.</p>



<p>This post might be what Activision thinks Call of Duty players want to hear, but those actually concerned that the series has lost its identity won't be satisfied with words alone. Those minds will be shifted by actions alone, and we'll see how Activision approaches its collaborations for Black Ops 7, and if players will continue to run around dressed up as celebrities and cartoon characters in multiplayer matches. Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with that, but there's a clear subset of the Call of Duty community that could do without it.</p>



<p>Besides, not once in this post does Activision say they won't be doing that with Black Ops 7, and with the no-carry forward not applying to Warzone, players looking for that experience will likely still find it there.</p>

Swift announced their engagement on her Instagram account with the caption, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.” While the comments are turned off (as they are with every post on her profile), as you can imagine, the internet is losing its mind. “Why are you writing about Taylor Swift on a video game website?” </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-shakes-her-polys-in-band-hero-5329622"><span>She was in </span><i><span>Band Hero</span></i></a><span>, leave me alone.</span></p> <p><span>Love them, hate them, or feel nothing for them, Swift and Kelce are America’s sweethearts. The general public is already greatly invested in Swift’s love life, since her songs and the mythos around her have etched the 35-year-old pop star’s romantic ups and downs into modern pop culture folklore, and seeing her in a relationship that seemingly lacks the kinds of dramatic complications you write albums about has prompted fans to root for this relationship to be the one that works out. A lot of people have been tuned into the lore for years, and for those who have treated Swift’s love life as a story they’ve been watching unfold, it’s basically like watching a slow-burn romance finally reach its next stage.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">me telling everyone I know that Taylor Swift got engaged <a href="https://t.co/MpS8BLPOZj">pic.twitter.com/MpS8BLPOZj</a></p> <p>— Siobhan ✨ (@Siobachka) <a href="https://twitter.com/Siobachka/status/1960389888366219708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I AM SO HAPPY FOR MY CLOSE AND PERSONAL FRIEND TAYLOR SWIFT <a href="https://t.co/O2gBDwphSa">pic.twitter.com/O2gBDwphSa</a></p> <p>— pippa (@piptweets) <a href="https://twitter.com/piptweets/status/1960388307847631020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">literally crying for my close and personal friend taylor swift <a href="https://t.co/65TZrdVhVq">pic.twitter.com/65TZrdVhVq</a></p> <p>— burcu ❤️‍🔥 (@thatsoburcu) <a href="https://twitter.com/thatsoburcu/status/1960388498931769581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">taylor is finally living her fairytale dreams that she would write songs about as a teenager someone SEDATE ME <a href="https://t.co/NcQraMZkUZ">pic.twitter.com/NcQraMZkUZ</a></p> <p>— Taylor Swift Updates (@SwiftNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftNYC/status/1960391657104294356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">how do i explain to my nervous system that i’m not being held at gunpoint and it’s just taylor swift announced her engagement?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-bloober-wants-to-conquer-the-world-again.1281147/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloober Team’s journey could easily be the plot of a Hollywood film. Since the release of Layers of Fear in 2016, the Polish studio has experienced a rollercoaster of hits and misses, often delivering titles that were met with mixed reactions from both players and critics.</p>



<p>But everything changed in 2024 with the launch of Silent Hill 2 Remake. Bloober nailed it—reviving one of the most iconic survival horror games with a fresh yet respectful approach. The remake’s success catapulted the studio’s reputation, establishing them as true craftsmen of psychological horror. Naturally, expectations for their next original IP, Cronos: The New Dawn, skyrocketed.</p>



<p>Thanks to an invitation from Bloober Team, I had the chance to play the first 30 minutes of the game during a hands-on demo at Gamescom 2025—and I couldn’t be more impressed.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-preview-meet-the-traveler">Cronos: The New Dawn Preview – Meet the Traveler</h2>



<p>In Cronos: The New Dawn, you play as the Traveler—a kind of soldier dispatched by an entity known as the Collective to a bleak future. Your mission? Travel back to 1980s Poland and rescue select individuals from a catastrophic event.</p>



<p>The opening moments are intentionally cryptic. Who are the Travelers? What is the Collective’s true role? And what exactly caused the event? The game throws these questions at you, trusting the narrative to unravel them gradually.</p>



<p>During my session, I came across several collectibles that added depth to the world and enriched the immersive storytelling Bloober is known for. Surprisingly, the combat reminded me a lot of <em>Dead Space</em>—in the best way possible.</p>



<p>The Traveler starts off equipped with a pistol capable of two firing modes: a standard shot and a charged blast that deals heavy damage and can interrupt enemy charges.</p>



<p>Ammo is scarce, so melee combat becomes essential. You can punch enemies to create space and escape quickly—especially since their reaction time is fast. One standout mechanic is “fusion”: if a living enemy reaches the corpses of two fallen foes, it can merge with them, becoming faster and more powerful. To prevent this, the Traveler can deploy a flame cylinder that burns bodies on the ground.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Deixar os inimigos se fundirem resulta em grandes problemas</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-intuition-and-isolation">Intuition and Isolation</h2>



<p>I don’t usually play survival horror games, but <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> made me reconsider—largely thanks to its smart level design. Exploration, environmental puzzles, and progression are all intuitive and never frustrating. With a bit of attention, even genre newcomers can navigate the world with ease.</p>



<p>The intuitive design is paired with a haunting sense of isolation. Cold color palettes dominate the environments, reinforcing the feeling of desolation. The world has ended—and chaos is all that remains. Complementing the visuals are eerie sound effects and a retrofuturistic soundtrack that blends synthetic tones with organic instruments.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-can-bloober-do-it-again">Can Bloober Do It Again?</h2>



<p>By the end of the demo, I didn’t want to stop playing. The immersive atmosphere, the unanswered questions, and the brutal, strategic combat left me eager for more. Based on what I played, Cronos: The New Dawn is shaping up to be another major win for Bloober Team.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we won’t need to wait long to see if the final game is great or not. <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> launches on September 5th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Animal Crocs-ing. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Animal Crossing Crocs collection is now available to purchase online or in stores.<strong> </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youll-soon-be-able-to-wear-animal-crossing-on-your-feet-with-these-nintendo-licensed-crocs">Announced earlier this year</a>, the collaboration is par for the course for Nintendo, who has previously lent its iconic franchises to the likes of Converse, Puma, and Levi’s. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll be the first to admit I put wayyyy more than my fair share of time into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">New Horizons</a>, which recently got its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/surprise-nintendos-just-updated-animal-crossing-new-horizons-for-the-first-time-in-3-years">first update in literal years</a>. While we’re waiting for any info about a new Animal Crossing game on Switch 2, this launch may just send me back to the island. Here’s a breakdown of everything included. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Animal Crocs-ing Collection Is Now Available</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The collection is headlined by one style of platform Crocs you can pick up in sizes for adults (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgMZ8?object_uuid=3e850469-f501-4468-b181-5bfa513812d4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">starting at $89.99</a>) or kids (<a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRYyb?object_uuid=3e850469-f501-4468-b181-5bfa513812d4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">starting at $54.99</a>). The adult version lists women's sizes, but in my opinion is just as unisex. Most importantly, with a spread of colors, the Crocs manage to capture a pretty robust picture of the island featured in New Horizons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The top of the Crocs is a soft green color, with images of the classic Animal Crossing trees, while the platform heel features blue and white ocean waves. A yellow line separates the two, acting as the beach. The heel grip has similar blue and white tones to the platform, but to create the effect of clouds in the sky. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The base pair of Crocs also comes with six “exclusive” Jibbitz that aren’t available for purchase individually. These include K.K. Slider, Timmy and Tommy, Tom Nook, Isabelle, a weirdly tall house, and a classic fruit tree. As far as we know, everyone gets apples, but it would be a cute gimmick if the fruits were randomized. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Switch Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Additional Jibbitz Charms Can Be Purchased Separately</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The more challenging decision is whether to pick up any additional charms. The Creator set features the always-fashionable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/How_to_Unlock_Able_Sisters_Shop">Able Sisters</a> as well as the shirt and backpack icons used throughout the series. The Collector set features, as you’d expect, three characters that help you build your various collections: the museum-keeper <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/blathers">Blathers</a>, his stargazing younger sister Celeste, and the art dealer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/redd">Jolly Redd</a>. You also get the fossil and seashell icons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, we have the special “single charms” you can currently only find online at the Crocs store. One can only imagine how Nintendo or Crocs decided on these, but for around $5, you can grab a single charm of one of your <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/Villagers_and_Special_Characters">neighboring villagers</a>.

		<p>EA and Full Circle have confirmed that Skate will be entering early access on September 16th, with the game available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox One. The game will be free to play and feature both cross platform progression and cross platform play.</p>

<p><em>“Community is the heart of skateboarding, and it’s the heart of&nbsp;skate.,”</em> said Jeff Seamster, Head of Creative on Skate<i>.</i><em> “From day one, we’ve aimed to create an open, welcoming space shaped by players. We’ve built this game alongside our community – listening, learning and evolving together. Whether you’re a seasoned skater or just dropped in,&nbsp;skate.&nbsp;is a place to express yourself, connect and grow. No gatekeepers, no barriers – just a city built for skating and a community that keeps it alive. Early Access is a huge milestone in that journey, and we’re hyped to keep growing San Vansterdam with our crew around the world.”</em></p>
<p>In Skate, players will be able to roll, grind, and ollie around the city of San Vansterdam which will be a large open world, with plenty of places to pull of tricks. San Vansterdam is split into four different neighbourhoods which are Hedgemont, Gullcrest, Market Mile and Brickswich. Each area has its own challenges and unique designs. To pull off various moves, the Flick-It system is going to be the key as it will be offering precision and control. New tricks are being added to Skate as well, and these are wallies, slappies and firecrackers. Additional features like Quick Drop will allow players to add ramps and rails to areas, allowing customisation that will allow refreshing of areas.</p>

		<p>Here is a blast from the past! Acclaim has announced that it will be revealing details about new games including exclusives on September 10th. It seems very much that Acclaim has some projects already signed up but has opened pitches for developers to reach out to the company with their games for the chance to get Acclaim as their publisher.</p>

<p>According to the official website, <a href="https://playacclaim.com/">PlayAcclaim</a>, this iteration of Acclaim, <em>“is founded by a passionate team of industry veterans with a focus on empowering developers and creators to bring their games to the widest possible audience. We provide funding and publishing services to video game developers, including production, PR/marketing support, distribution and more.”</em></p>
<p>Acclaim was a massive publisher from the late 80s through to the early 2000s, with games including The Punisher, The Simpsons: Bart vs the Space Mutants, WWF Royal Rumble, Mortal Kombat, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, and South Park. We do not know what games this new Acclaim will be bringing, so we will find out on September 10th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Gamescom 2025, we were able to go hands-on with The Order of Giants DLC for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and speak to two of the key developers from MachineGames (Lead Game Designer Ezekiel Virant and Creative Director Axel Torvenius) as they led us through the making of this expansion, which will be released on September 4 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and will eventually be available on Nintendo Switch 2 next year once the game launches there. Let's begin with the developers' words.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> The Order of Giants DLC's premise is that we set out to place the beginning of the DLC inside the Vatican sandbox, so you need to have played the game up to a certain point in the Vatican sandbox, and if you have the DLC installed, we have this new character called Father Orlando Ricci. When you interact with him, he will trigger a cutscene, which activates the DLC.</p>



<p>Father Ricci is obviously very, very obsessed with finding this secret chamber. He's also hinted that Father Ventura is onto him and that he's being forced out of the Vatican, which hints to the fact that only a small part of the DLC takes place inside the Vatican sandbox, maybe 10 or 15 minutes of gameplay, but then we quite quickly push the players to a complete new path, which is the streets of the Rome and the Tiber river and all the places underneath. Even the spaces in the Vatican sandbox were visible but inaccessible in the base game.</p>



<p>As you explore the DLC, you'll find lots of clues and hints, similar to what we did in the base game, in all the Chapters. We have tons of notes for you to find and fill out Indiana's journal. There are around 70 new collectibles in the DLC.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> You can take this mission anytime in the campaign, really, even if you've already completed the game and you have a save and buy The Order of Giants DLC, you can still fast travel back here and start this mission, so there's no need to start a whole new game. As soon as you've gotten the camera and met Gina, you're good to go with the DLC.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> From the moment you enter the casina onward, everything is completely new content. At the beginning of the DLC's production, we thought we should reuse some stuff, but in the end, not much has been reused from the main game. Basically, everything is freshly built and you have no sensation of, like, oh, I've seen this before, this is just rehashed content from the main game. Everything is completely new.</p>



<p><strong>So none of this is cut content from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Exactly, it's content that has been produced when we started to ramp down production on the main game, but obviously, there were some things when we were working on the main game where we were already planning for this. The concept images and stuff like that. We knew that we were going to hopefully be able to dive deeply into this part of the narrative with The Order of Giants.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Everything is freshly built and you have no sensation of, like, oh, I've seen this before, this is just rehashed content from the main game. Everything is completely new. It's content that has been produced when we started to ramp down production on the main game.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It was one of the big mysteries of the game, after all.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yeah, so it's one of those nice opportunities to finally be able to actually do a DLC that dives a little bit deeper into the mystery of it.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> We also have all-new puzzle mechanics. We are not recycling any of the old mechanics from other areas. There is a mix of big and small puzzles to get that balance between them.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> By the way, you can fast travel in and out of the DLC as you see fit.</p>



<p><strong>Is The Order of the Giants DLC harder than the base game when it comes to combat and/or puzzles?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> I think the puzzles lean towards being a little bit more difficult than the base game, actually, but of course, we still have hints. And we also still have the adventure mode if you want to have a simpler time in some of the puzzles. In terms of the combat, depending on where you are with the base game, the game will actually scale the difficulty. So, if you're starting right from the Vatican, it will be easier, but if you're in the endgame, the enemies will be more challenging.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> We will also be connecting the dots from certain narrative threads seen in the main game. Moreover, in terms of visual fidelity, everything that you'll see in the DLC is at a minimum as good-looking and polished as in the base game, and in some instances, it's even better. Similar to what we have in the main game as well, everything starts with a small mystery and then grows from there. In The Order of Giants, Father Ricci asks you to find the secret chamber and the giant helmet found within, but there's much more to it, so Indiana will have to keep digging.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> We have multiple larger puzzles like this one in the DLC, similar to the base game. There are a lot of layers and mechanics, new mechanics, and we're truly trying to push the player all around the environment. This is one of the brand-new mechanics that we started working on immediately after the base game wrapped up. In most Indiana Jones adventures, the puzzles that he unravels start with him figuring out the mechanics, and then once he gets into a good flow, something breaks, and he has to clear the breakage or do something else.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>What we heard from them is that they just wish there were more puzzles and also that they were more difficult. There were a lot of puzzles that we wished we could have made, so this was an opportunity for the team to take those ideas from the back of their mind, start putting them into the game, and try new things.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Did you incorporate any feedback from the players' experience with the base game into the design of these new puzzles?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> Yeah, we've watched a lot of players while they interact with our puzzles. I think what we heard from them is that they just wish there were more puzzles and also that they were more difficult. There were a lot of puzzles that we wished we could have made, so this was an opportunity for the team to take those ideas from the back of their mind, start putting them into the game, and try new things.</p>



<p>The designer who worked on this puzzle had an idea to rotate something with a wrench, and players could slot the wrench in and out. Then, another designer who had been working on the redirection maze for a while joined him to create this one.</p>



<p>One unique aspect of developing these puzzles compared to those from the base game is that they were finally done in our office. Most of those in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were made during COVID, when people were forced to work remotely. This is the first time the people could meet physically to design them.</p>



<p>There are more secrets to be found on the levels. Something that we've always tried to maintain is to allow for new paths to open, for new secrets to be revealed, so there's always this layering of the environments where you dig deeper and find something new, and depending on your playstyle, you may be able to find more stuff.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> This traversal section is one that was just so super inspired. One of the designers who worked on this was someone who didn't do a big traversal section throughout the main game, but we had the opportunity to try a lot of new ideas with the DLC. Since the engine was in such a good shape that we had all the mechanics nailed down, it was easy for us to experiment and make new things without having to worry about bugs. This traversal scenario here, where you deal with pulleys and weights and moving up and down, shows off this brand new mechanics; it's a whole new way of using the whip.</p>



<p>This whole level here is like that. We started designing new mechanics and new features. We began by putting together a fresh view of mechanics with this rope and these pulleys. The designer had it in their mind, and I think they actually tried to do it a year or two ago, but only had the opportunity to make it work and get all the tech pieces in place for The Order of Giants DLC. When we first started doing this level design and walking it out, we actually found that it was getting longer, but people were having a lot of fun, so we increased the scope and the complexity of this whole scenario, just based on just internal player feedback. We felt it would be a missed opportunity otherwise.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have an estimate of the length of The Order of Giants DLC?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> In terms of time spent, it's similar to a sandbox environment in the main game, so it's around 5 to 6 hours, but if you are a completionist and want to find everything, then I think it's more, and if you are a very skilled player who knows how to solve all the puzzles on first try, maybe it's shorter. But I've been playing through the final build back home in the studio and I think I'm at, like, four and a half hours, but then I know everything. Some of the puzzles can be very challenging even at medium difficulty, but that's why we also have easy difficulty available. If you don't want to spend too much time on puzzles, you should still be able to navigate through and continue the adventure. </p>



<p>I think it's important to emphasize that this is not a puzzle DLC. It's still primarily a story-driven narrative DLC. The balance here is similar to what we have in the base game: large puzzles, small puzzles, hard combat, light combat, cutscenes, set pieces, tense action, even some boss fight. Everything that was in the main game is represented in the DLC as well.</p>

<p><strong>Basically, everything players loved about the base game, they're getting more of it.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yep. Exactly the same type of tone, sensation, same humor and everything. It's very much like an extension of the main game. I think that's something we felt was very correct to do, because we're still telling a new, standalone, unique adventure, a new story. But we saw so much feedback from the player community where people were like, we want more Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Finally, we had the opportunity to get the DLC out, which is just doing that. It's adding more to the beloved world of Indiana Jones.</p>



<p><strong>Earlier, you talked about the game's fidelity, which is already great. But I know that you are also improving upon it with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-hair-coming-september-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming RTX Hair update</a>. Can you talk about that a bit?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> I can't go into technical details, but what we're happy to see is that the development and integration of RTX Hair makes it so much better. Actually, there's a lot of things in the game that can benefit from it, because many things utilize the hair system, not just hair itself. It's a system that is used over other aspects as well. Everything that is fur or hair-related will have better render fidelity.</p>



<p>Some people may think it's a small thing, but there are all those small things that add up. The details and everything just make everything come together. We are really happy with the RTX Hair integration.</p>



<p><strong>I know that you <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-nintendo-switch-2-release-order-of-the-giants-dlc-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a Switch 2 version</a>, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yeah, it will be released next year.</p>



<p><strong>Are you doing that internally, or is that work being outsourced?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yes, most of the work is done internally. Our CTO, the engineers, and the programmers are working on it to ensure it is as good as we can possibly make it on a handheld platform.</p>



<p><strong>You already ported the previous Wolfenstein games to Nintendo Switch, correct?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> Yes, both the last two Wolfenstein games. It's a continuation of Machinegames bringing the titles to Nintendo platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Which is great. As a developer, you want to own as many as possible so that your game can be enjoyed, so we were very happy with the Switch 2 confirmation.</p>



<p><strong>One last question. Can you share whether there will be more of Gina in this DLC?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Gina is not part of the DLC. This is more of Indiana Jones going on a little bit of a rogue adventure on the side. Gina is most likely still back undercover in the Vatican, doing some research at this point.</p>



<p>That was one of the reasons we wanted to really focus on Indiana Jones and the core of the IP to push him on a side quest. Obviously, we have a lot of sections in the main game where we do things together with Gina, which is nice because we want that balance. She's an important character, but we also see that it's cool when you're completely alone and you get the sensation that it's only up to you to solve the mystery, so it fits in within that balance too.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> Yeah. I think Indie is a bit distracted at this point and he wants to keep searching and pushing, whereas Gina is really on a beeline to find her sister.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> In The Order of Giants DLC, you'll see Father Ricci, but there are also appearances of Father Ventura and Mussolini as well.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

<p>Based on what we played at Gamescom 2025, The Order of Giants looks like a thoughtful extension of what people (the undersigned included) already loved about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: awesome graphics, outstanding puzzles, and great atmosphere. There are also some interesting new platforming mechanics, too, especially those based around Indy's whip. The demo only featured a very brief combat scene, but according to the developers, fans should expect roughly the same split between combat, exploration, and narrative that made the base game so great.</p>



<p>There's not much to wait to experience the new content, with the DLC slated to hit all platforms on September 4. Look forward to our review soon. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Activision and Treyarch are making a big change to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-opening-night-live-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trailer-2000618479"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>, just under 12 weeks before its launch in November. All those wacky cosmetics from <em>Black Ops 6</em> will no longer carry over to the new sequel as previously promised. The devs behind <em>Call of Duty</em> say the change is to ensure <em>Black Ops 7</em> is “authentic to <em>Call of Duty</em> and its setting.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025">On August 26</a>, in a lengthy community update posted on the official <em>Call of Duty</em> website, Treyarch thanked fans for all the feedback and acknowledged the ongoing conversation online surrounding crossover skins and wacky cosmetic items in video games.</p> <p>“We know there’s been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of <em>Call of Duty,</em>” said the studio. “Some of you have said we’ve drifted from what made <em>Call of Duty</em> unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you.”</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="COD x Beavis &amp; Butt-Head | Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gjaKA57mnu8?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Players were worried that the weird cosmetics and crossover skins from <em>Black Ops 6</em> would immediately turn<em> Black Ops 7</em> into a <em>Fortnite</em>-like experience. That’s because the plan was to let skins from <em>BLOPS 6, </em>which now includes characters like Beavis and Butt-Head, carry over to <em>BLOPS 7</em>. But that’s no longer happening.</p> <p>“Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from <em>Black Ops 6</em> will no longer carry forward into <em>Black Ops 7</em>,” announced Treyarch. <em>“Black Ops 7</em> needs to feel authentic to <em>Call of Duty</em> and its setting. That is why<em> Black Ops 6</em> Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to <em>Black Ops 7.</em> Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward, because we recognize your time and progression are important.”</p> <p>The developers of <em>Black Ops 7</em> also claimed that a “ton of feedback” has already been implemented into the game. And the studio explained that future cosmetic bundles and items added to <em>BLOPS 7</em> will be “crafted to fit the <em>Black Ops</em> identity.” Treyarch further added: “We hear the feedback. We need to deliver a better balance toward the immersive, core <em>Call of Duty</em> experience.”</p>

 <p>Activision did confirm that <em>BLOPS 6</em> skins will still move over to <em>Warzone</em>. So your strange collection of characters can still go enjoy battle royale.</p> <h2>Why <em>Call of Duty</em> is making this big change</h2> <p>People have been yelling online for years about <em>Call of Duty</em> skins and cosmetics going too far and feeling out of place. So why the sudden change now, just a few months before the next game’s launch?<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919"> Well, it’s likely because of <em>Battlefield 6.</em></a> EA’s upcoming shooter held an open beta earlier this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-call-of-duty-record-2000616838">and it was immensely popular</a>. It is also a more grounded, gritty, and realistic war game compared to recent<em> Call of Duty</em> entries. And when EA DICE design director Shashank Uchil was asked if the studio planned to add crossover skins like Beavis and Butt-Head or Goku to <em>Battlefield 6,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-goofy-skins-call-of-duty-nicki-minaj-2000614447">he claimed that wasn’t going to happen</a>.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>“It has to be grounded,” said Uchil. “That is what<em>&nbsp;BF3</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>BF4</em> was—it was all soldiers, on the ground. It’s going to be like this. I don’t think it needs Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p> <p><a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-skins-cosmetics/">Another DICE developer told <em>Comicbook</em></a>:&nbsp; “What I will say is what’s really important to us is that things feel grounded, and we want people to express themselves and to have cool skins and peacock in a way like ‘I look pretty cool and I have this great weapon skin.’ But we want it to feel authentic to the franchise, that’s the approach we’re thinking.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">following last week’s reveal of a very wild-looking</a> and not at all grounded<em> Black Ops 7</em>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-paying-attention-to-community-feedback-on-goofy-skins"><em>IGN</em> asked the game’s creative director</a>, Miles Leslie, about wacky crossover skins. His answer was a big nothing burger that didn’t really commit to anything, vaguely claimed the studio would “calibrate” future skins based on feedback, and promised that all fans would “feel represented.” This answer went over poorly. And, after today’s big news that <em>Black Ops 7</em> will feature more grounded skins and won’t let <em>Black Ops 6</em> cosmetics carry over as planned, it seems the folks in charge of <em>Call of Duty</em> are trying to get the train back on the tracks in the face of October’s <em>Battlefield 6.</em> Will it be enough? I’m not sure, but it is interesting to watch <em>Call of Duty</em> react to the first serious competition it’s faced in years.</p>
