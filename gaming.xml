		<p>Black Myth: Wukong is going to be released on August 20th for Xbox Series X|S, exactly a year after the game was made available on PS5 and PC. Pre-orders for the Xbox version will go live on June 18th, alongside a 20% discount for the PS5 and PC versions of Black Myth: Wukong. Xbox pre-orders will be discounted too, so it matches the promotional discount on PS5 and PC.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is inspired by the 16th century Chinese novel “Journey to The West” by Wu Cheng’en. This has been adapted and twisted into a Souls-like, as we’ve seen in recent times with other myths, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a>&nbsp;and the Pinocchio story.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/black-myth-wukong-review/">Black Myth: Wukong Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Black Myth: Wukong review, Jason said, <em>“Black Myth: Wukong is a stunning game to look at, but the exploration is lacking, and the fighting is just sort of fine for the most part. It’s just a bit uninspiring, and isn’t a game that I’m expecting to stick with me for any length of time now that I’m done with it.”</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-x-s-version-arriving-exactly-a-year-after-ps5-launch.1209180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-xs-version<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Exactly one year after its release on PS5 and PC, celebrated Soulslike action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Xbox <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1930806857725026414" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirms the news</a> in a post on X, simultaneously revealing a release date of August 20th, which is, to the day, exactly a year after it was released on Sony's platform and on PC.</p>

<p>This release date arguably throws some doubt on the idea that the Xbox Series S console's memory limitations were to blame for the port's delay, which was the official line taken by developer Game Science <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s" rel="nofollow">back in January this year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-xs-release-date-potion.jpg?itok=1BFhyhK4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-xs-release-date-potion.jpg?itok=K90vimi5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Xbox Series X|S.</figcaption></figure><p>Certainly, some <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1930854070551523584" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">people</a> in the replies for Xbox's message are <a href="https://x.com/SnapBlastPLAY/status/1930905753251922425" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a> that the previously-mooted Sony exclusivity deal may be the <a href="https://x.com/Charmer184/status/1930834254499590506" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reason</a> for the August 20th release date, or at the very least that the Xbox Series S' memory limitations weren't really to blame.</p>

<p>In fairness to Microsoft and Game Science, the Xbox Series S is a notably less powerful machine than the Series X, and&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is a notoriously demanding game, requiring some pretty hefty hardware to run well on PC.</p>

<p>In any case, if you're an Xbox Series owner, you'll finally get to play&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>on your console on August 20th. The timing of this announcement is also notable, coming as it does just two days before Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-summer-show-date-2025-the-outer-worlds-2" rel="nofollow">Summer Game Fest showcase</a>.</p>

<p>While we don't know what surprises Xbox has in store for that show, we can reasonably guess that a release date for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>will be revealed, given that a showcase specifically dedicated to the game will air after Xbox's main show.</p>

            <p>In case you hadn't herd, a little something called the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> released yesterday. Nintendo's latest console arrived in a flurry of red boxes, with many new owners quickly making the most of launch title <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Now, there is one standout star in Mario Kart World. No, not Mario, Luigi, Peach or any other of Nintendo's staple karting racers. Rather, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">the all-new Cow has stolen the hearts of many a Mario Kart World owner</a>, to the point where races are now a mélange of moooo-ving parts.</p>

<p>There have been numerous social media posts showing Mario Kart World races which have been infected with rad cow disease (thank Ian for that pun).</p>
<p>"24 people all cows," reads one translated Mario Kart World post on X, with an accompanying video proving these players aren't doing things by calf measure. "Mario Kart is too chaotic, lol."</p> <div>

<p>"Anyone else's online lobbies look like this in Mario Kart World?" another poster asked with yet another stacked image of bovines getting ready to battle it out (cattle it out?) for that sweet gold cup.</p>
<p>"I've been in three full cow races."</p> <div>

<p>Cow certainly seems popular, with other users just sharing posts of appreciation for the new racer. </p>
<p>"COW MAINS RISE UP MOOO," reads one social media post, complete with their Cow reaching up in victory, udders flying in the breeze like they just don't have a care in the world.</p> <div>

<p>So, have you managed to get your hands (or hooves) on Mario Kart World yet? Who is your go-to racer? My console still hasn't arrived yet, but when it does, perhaps I will see you in one of those lobbies bursting at the seams with Cow!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you are yet to play but are planning on it later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-mario-kart-world-defaults-to-smart-steering-but-its-easily-turned-off">know that Smart Steering controls are on by default</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a> has arrived on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> as part of its GameCube collection, but the default controls make the game virtually unplayable.</p>
<p>This might shock you for a racing game, but F-Zero GX is all about going really fast. And to do that you need to boost - a lot.</p>
<p>Except by default, the Switch 2 maps accelerate to the A button and boost to the Y button. In order to effectively boost you need to be accelerating, which means hitting both buttons at the same time. And that's practically impossible, especially without hitting the B button which is brake by default.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it's easy enough to remap the controls. Hit the minus button to suspend the game and bring up the options, and from here you can switch any of the controls around.</p>
<p>So what's best? I swapped the Y and B buttons around, so I could boost more easily instead of braking. After all, who hits the brakes in an F-Zero game?</p>
<p>An alternative would be to put boost on X, which is also accessible while pressing A to accelerate, though you'll need to move attacks (on X) to another button. This A and X combo would mimic the original controls that put boost on the kidney shaped Y button above the central A.</p>
<p>Another option would be to put boost on the Switch 2's L button, which is unused by default.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Of course, the real alternative Nintendo wants is for you to buy the GameCube controller, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">that'll set you back almost 60 quid</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">remaining two GameCube classics are The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Soul Calibur 2</a>, but the controls appear much more manageable by default. The collection is available for those with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p>F-Zero GX was developed by Sega and published by Nintendo for the GameCube back in 2003. Since then, we haven't had a new home console entry in the series (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-99-feels-like-a-battle-royale-in-a-pinball-machine">beyond F-Zero 99</a>). Still, I'm very happy to see Switch 2 technically launch with an F-Zero game, just like the SNES and GBA did - I've missed those camp post-race news reports.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom may not be among the best-looking open-world games released in the past few years, but it can look stunning with some choice mods on PC, which outshine the recently released Nintendo Switch 2 edition.</p>
<p>A new video shared a few days ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> shows the latest main entry in the series running on PC via an emulator at 8K resolution with some mods, such as the Ultra CAM mod by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MaxLastBreath">MaxLastBreath</a> and ReShade ray tracing. As even an RTX 5090 has some trouble running the game at 60 FPS at such a high resolution and with these mods, it would have been unreasonable to expect such a makeover to run on the Nintendo Switch 2, so those who wish to experience the game like never before have no choice but to turn to emulation.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] Zelda Tears of the Kingdom - Ultra CAM extreme Settings RAYTRACING RTX5090 gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Mcf-9g5CQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The fact that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't feature any transformative visual improvements doesn't mean that the new version of the game doesn't feature enhancements that enhance the experience. Besides offering 60 FPS gameplay at 1080p resolution, the Switch 2 version of the game also features faster load times, which makes fast traveling much more convenient, and support for the Zelda Notes app, which provides a navigation feature, milestone tracking, and more.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom builds on the features introduced by its predecessor to offer a compelling experience no matter the system used to play. You can learn more about the game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">review.</a></p>

For everyone else, the game goes live on June 10, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concurrent players isn't the only metric we should use when measuring how successful a game is, of course, but it's a good starting point, even though it doesn't account for players on other platforms (not that Dune: Awakening is available on other platforms just yet; the PS5 and Xbox Series release will follow at a later date).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Historically, weekends are usually when most players opt to jump into a game, so it's possible Dune: Awakening will hit an even higher peak concurrent count before official launch on June 10. Of the thousands of games currently on sale on Steam, it's currently 195th in the chart of the highest-ever concurrent peaks. Not bad for a game that's not even out yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We haven't yet had chance to review Dune: Awakening, but we did have take an extended peek when the beta was live. "As a longtime fan of Dune, it also just feels so good to explore and learn more about a world that I’m quite fond of, and Funcom has clearly put a ton of effort into worldbuilding and lore, even despite taking quite a bit of creative liberty by placing Awakening within a parallel reality and canon than the books/movies," we wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakenings-first-20-hours-are-damn-impressive-despite-loads-of-bugs-closed-beta-impressions"><u>IGN's Dune: Awakening closed beta impressions preview</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are little details that have a massive impact on gameplay. I won’t go into spoilers, but this kind of attention to detail touches just about every aspect of the world, including the factions and characters you meet along the way, which should be a treat for any fan of the setting."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out details on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-says-its-release-date-is-the-full-launch-and-while-theres-no-subscription-there-will-be-optional-dlcs"><u>the MMO's business model and post-launch plans</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/fast-fusion-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Fast Fusion was my first Switch 2 game. While I had Mario Kart World waiting in the wings, it was this indie racer, available at launch for a bargain price, that was my first choice for the brand new Nintendo system. You might be wondering if I’ve lost all my marbles, but if you’re a Nintendo fan, you’ll know that this is a racing series that’s consistently delivered an experience far beyond its indie trappings. We’re not getting a new F-Zero or Wipeout, but with Fast Fusion, you likely won’t care.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fast Fusion – Ultra fast, ultra essential anti-grav racing for Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4GXh3QTd_D4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Anti-grav racing is hardly new – Wipeout first appeared on the PlayStation in 1995, and F-Zero on the SNES in 1990 – but time, or licenses, seem to have dwindled in recent years for a futuristic sub-genre that used to sit on the cutting edge of tech. The Fast series began life on the Wii with Fast Racing League, appearing on the Wii U with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/16/fast-racing-neo-review/">Fast Racing Neo</a> and then an enhanced version on the original Switch with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/09/fast-rmx-review/">Fast RMX</a>. Each time, developers Shin’en Multimedia found a way to make the hardware sing, producing games that looked like AAA racers on indie budgets, and keeping a genre alive to boot.</p>


<p>Fast Fusion looks like a true current gen racing title, fit for your PS5 or Xbox Series X. The different tracks in particular look stunning, with the sweeping views as you load into a race showcasing the detail and depth of each intergalactic locale. While each track is tied together by industrial sections of gleaming metal, the different landscapes shift between the traditional vision of the future with its towering structures of metal and glass and more naturalistic luscious forests, each track also bringing different hazards to bear on the racers as well. The incremental details are just amazing, from Sand Whales leaping out of the desert, to the Ewok-esque tree hazards in the forest</p>
<p>Fast Fusion, as with its predecessors, is a true racing game. There is combat, but it’s not in the vein of Wipeout or Mario Kart where you’re given weaponry to help move up the leaderboard. Fast Fusion is about going, well… fast, and while your vessel is pretty nippy to begin with, even on the introductory Subsonic circuits, you need to utilise boosting to succeed.</p>


<p>There’s two types of boost. Firstly, you collect charges as you race, which alongside serving as currency, also give you a shot of nitro for each one you collect. You don’t hold this boost down, instead firing singular shots of it off, allowing you to be more directed with it. These boosts also allow you to attack your competitors, and hitting a player while you’re boosting will see them spin out, slowing them down and putting you ahead.</p>
<p>You gain the other type of boost via the coloured speed pads found on the floor of each circuit. Coming in blue or red, you have to select your vehicle’s frequency to match that – shown in the exhaust fumes coming from your ship – and if they match you’ll speed up significantly.</p>
<p>Get it wrong, and the pad will actually slow you down, electricity arcing from the ship to the pad as it struggles for anti-grav traction. It’s such a simple mechanic, but an incredibly clever one. Many circuits will also stagger differently coloured pads back-to-back, and it throws in rhythm action test of your reactions beyond the actual racing.</p>
<p>You start off with access to three ships, with fourteen standard craft available in total. What’s interesting here, and what gives the game the ‘Fusion’ in the name, is that you can mash two of them together, creating a new craft that draws in elements from each of the original ones. After completing the first cup, I merged the primary ship with one I bought, upping both the top speed and the boost capacity, while adding to the weight, giving it a whole new look along the way.</p>

<p>Despite weighing more, this new ship was a clear improvement, and the whole idea just feels great, like you’re taking part in futuristic racing R&amp;D. It also gives you a ton of options to explore in terms of visuals and stats, giving you an added reason to unlock all of the ships as you clear the different Leagues.</p>
<p>The vehicles here clearly owe a debt to Wipeout’s art direction, but it’s pretty hard to truly innovate in the space when the Psygnosis team perfected the concept on the first attempt, and then upped the fidelity each time It’s simply a stunning looking game though. Fast Fusion looks like a current-gen title, and it’s got to be amongst the best-looking indie racers of all time.</p>
<p>Quite how the team continue to pull off this feat, I’ll never know, but they do, and here it’s delivered in 60FPS with HDR. Interestingly, there’s a host of graphics settings to choose from too, and you can go all the way up to 4K at 30fps if you want Ultra Quality, but there’s presets that target 60fps with varying shadowing and details for 4K, 1440p and 1080p. Frankly, it looks amazing in the 1080p Performance mode, and I was hard pressed to see too many differences in the more graphically intensive settings above it. As long as it’s 60fps, they all feel great.</p>

<p>Those spectacular visuals are combined with genre-required hard-hitting electro and dance, but rather than just relying on the familiar, there’s a suite of interesting instrumentation from around the world, as well as more dramatic, symphonic pieces that wouldn’t sound out of place in a sci-fi movie. The different tracks fit perfectly with the different tracks and areas they represent, and they’re undeniably part of the game’s character and appeal.</p>
<p>Fast Fusion offers plenty of longevity, with the Championship racing your initial gateway into the game. Each League contains multiple races, unlocked via the same currency you use to buy and fuse your ships – it’s worth remembering this at the start, as I spent all my money on ships before realising I needed money to advance to the next League – and there’s a svelte selection of twelve tracks in total to race on. More tracks would be lovely, but it’s worth remembering the £13.50 price point.</p>
<p>There’s then Super Hero Mode, which tasks you with completing a race in first place, without crashing, while jumping decreases boost energy, and that boost energy is also your shield energy. When it calls it Super Hero Mode, it flipping means it, and this is a cruel and punishing reworking of the game’s rules to push you to the limit. It gives you some lovely prize money for succeeding though, so you can buy a new ship after you’ve got over the whole thing.</p>
<p>Time Trial does exactly what you’d expect it to, though it gives you the Shin’en team’s best lap time to beat for each track, once more giving you some cash for achieving it, as well as giving you the bragging rights for beating the people that made the game.</p>

<p>Multiplayer is perhaps the biggest sign that this is a budget release, as there’s a limited online racing component. You can race in splitscreen with up to three friends, or there’s GameShare functionality which lets you beam the game to another Nintendo Switch 2, either locally or via the Switch 2’s new GameChat function. With GameShare everyone gets to race on their own Switch 2, with the host Switch 2 rendering and streaming a game view of the race for each individual player, but you’re playing with only one copy of the game. It’s great that you can experience racing against your friends, but I’ll be hoping that Fast Fusion sells well enough that Shin’en decide to add a true online component in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-revealed-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-persona-2-remaster-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persona 4 Remake</a> is going to be revealed during this year's Xbox Games Showcase in two days, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/persona-4-remake-xbox-games-showcase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP1st</a>, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to the outlet that the remake of the fourth entry in the series by ATLUS will be revealed on June 8th during the annual Xbox Games Showcase. The source confirmed the game is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, but couldn't confirm a Nintendo Switch 2 version, so there's the chance the game will launch later on Nintendo's new system. No other details have been confirmed, so it remains to be seen if the Persona 4 Remake will feature improvements in line with those seen in<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/"> Persona 3 Reload</a>, and if it will be based on the original, or the Golden enhanced version.</p>
<p>What we know almost for sure about the remake is that none of the original voice cast will be returning. In the past few weeks, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/">Yuri Lowenthal</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-wont-see-the-return-of-another-beloved-voice-actress/">Erin Fitzgerald</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-third-persona-4-voice-actor-has-confirmed-they-wont-be-returning-for-the-persona-4-remake/">Amanda Winn Lee</a>, who voiced Yosuke, Chie, and Yukiko, won't return in the remake. Having contributed so much to the characters they played, it is disappointing not to see them return, but at the same time, it's not exactly surprising they won't, considering Persona 3 Reload features a brand new voice cast.</p>
<p>The Persona 4 Remake has yet to be officially announced. We will cover this Sunday's Xbox Games Showcase as it happens, so stay tuned for the official announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ark-gets-ps5-pro-patch-with-pssr-support-ue5-5-upgrade-and-10-year-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Studio Wildcard is celebrating the 10-year anniversary since the early access launch of ARK: Survival Evolved in its Unreal Engine 5 remaster, ARK: Survival Ascended, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-first-ue5-gameplay-cross-platform-modding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> nearly two years ago.</p>
<p>During this event, Survivors can collect cake slices for buffs, discover a flashy set of Party Dinos, and grab new cosmetics like the Birthday Suit and Party Hat skins. There's even a DJ Party emote, a Rave Dance, and a Club ARK tropical Island makeover. The 10-year anniversary celebration is already live on official servers until Tuesday, June 17. Owners of unofficial ARK servers can enable it by adding "-ActiveEvent=Birthday" to their command line. The developers also introduced a drop-down option to enable Active Events in Host/Single-Player mode under Game Rules &gt; Rules.</p>
<p>There's a lot more in store for fans than just the event, though. A free update has been released, updating the game from Unreal Engine 5.2 to Unreal Engine 5.5. According to Studio Wildcard, players can expect a noticeable performance boost, not to mention improved visual rendering, quicker loading times, and a lower install size thanks to optional downloads for the expansion DLCs. Additionally, PlayStation 5 Pro owners can look forward to improved long-range shadow and support for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscale, which delivers up to 30% higher frame rates.</p>

<p>There's also new content available for owners of the Astraeos DLC. The Lemnokis update adds another vast island created by the renowned ARK modder Nekatus. This sprawling new island features diverse biomes, hidden caves, and towering redwoods. Its ancient ruins and colossal statues hint at lost civilizations. However, the lush expansion isn't just for sightseeing, as players can also take on the game's first-ever duo minibosses: Kalydonios and Erymanthian. These two massive boars fight with fire and poison. From deep-sea resource zones and the mysterious Maelstrom far offshore to a glacier cave tucked beneath the redwoods, Lemnokis is loaded with far-flung new adventures and prime build spots, not to mention the return of the fan-favourite snow owls.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> kicked off its early release for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition players yesterday, hitting a peak player count of almost 100k worm lovers.</p>
<p>This early launch, which requires people to drop at least £58.50 / $69.99 / €69.99 to hop in, immediately found itself a sandy society of 79,410. The following hours would see the figure slowly climb to a peak of 93,634 before tapering off for the night.</p>
<p>Prior to the release the game surpassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-surpasses-elden-ring-nightreign-on-steams-top-sellers">Steam Top Sellers page</a>, falling short of just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a>. Earlier this year the game held its final invite-only beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcom-has-heard-your-feedback-and-opened-the-dune-awakening-beta-to-all-pre-orderers">which eventually opened to those who pre-ordered</a>. That beta hit a peak of 37,889, so there's a real sign of growth in terms of early adopters.</p>

<p>The launch was not without its technical stumbles, the eternal curse of MMO launches. A selection of players suffered from crashes and freezing issues, with Funcom urging those affected to update Nvidia drivers, limit in-game CPU usage, and disable Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling.</p>
<p>Server capacity issues were also a thorn in the player's side initially. Due to the number of players flooding in, Sietches (the game's name for server instances) were filling up fast. In response, Funcom pumped up the number of players that could populate each Sietche so playing with friends was more feasible.</p>
<p>But compared to the launches of the past, it's not too drastic a technical disaster! Which is good for these kinds of games, first impressions are crucial and nothing turns people away like a massive login queue or progress blockers. </p>
<p>As for what this means for Dune Awakening? Well, the fact that this pre-order release has hit a far larger peak than the previous beta indicates a real growth in interest for the game, and that a substantial number of players dropped a solid chunk of cash on the game to get in ASAP.</p>
<p>In addition, it may just be a canary in the coal mine for an even greater spike in popularity come June 10, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-gets-steam-release-date-plus-character-creator-and-benchmark-tool-in-advance">when those who nab the standard version of Dune Awakening gain access</a>. Given you've got streamers diving in, plenty of buzz on social media, and a strong start reverberating around the MMO space right now, I'd imagine the Funcom devs are absolutely beaming right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The Switch 2 launch day was filled with disappointment for some unlucky GameStop patrons, with reports emerging online of receipts being stapled to the front of Switch 2 boxes going deep enough through the cardboard to damage the screen of the Switch 2 console beneath.</p>
<p>Thankfully, GameStop has quickly followed up on this, figuring out that it was “isolated to one store” and offering replacement consoles to those affected. They’ve also claimed to have confiscated the staplers in question to prevent this happening again!</p>



<p>The GameStop store was one of those in Staten Island, New York that was open for a midnight launch of the Switch 2, with those queueing up to grab a Switch 2 at the earliest possible moment having a real sour note upon opening the box. Someone had the bright idea of stapling the receipts to the front of the Switch 2 box, presumably unaware that the Switch 2 and Joy-Con are placed right beneath this surface. Unfortunately, the staples went deep enough to scratch or puncture the screens, creating two dots of dead pixels.</p>


<p>Obviously the only move from GameStop was to hold up their hands to the error and replace the consoles, and thankfully they seem to have stock available in order to do this.</p>

            <p>The team over at CD Projekt may be busy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-a-new-name-as-pre-production-phase-now-officially-underway">working on a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077</a>, but that doesn't mean it has finished with the first game. Last night, the developer announced that, yes, there is another update on the way for V and the rest of Night City.</p>
<p>The news was shared during a dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/t_SENc98vkI?t=3621s">Cyberpunk 2077 Switch 2 livestream</a>. Just around the time the developer was wrapping up its stream, the host drew attention to some of the questions viewers had been asking. Well, she drew attention to one particular question viewers had been asking: Is there going to be more DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>?</p>
<p>"I can tell you right now, we are planning another part for the game," senior community manager Alicja Kozera casually dropped. "The last one wasn't the last one."</p>

<p>This update will be known as 2.3, and will arrive later this month, on 26th June. Further details on what exactly will be included with this particular Cyberpunk 2077 update will be shared in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Sharing the news <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1930653122650579400">again on social media</a>, CD Projekt's global community director Marcin Momot proclaimed: "We're not done yet!"</p>
<p>Momot again reiterated that the team would be "spilling the beans" closer to that 26th June release date, asking that fans wait patiently for more news and "let the team cook".</p>

<p>Rumours that Cyberpunk 2077 would be getting more content started making the rounds earlier this week, when a LinkedIn post from a developer at Virtuous was circulated online. This post said the developer was working on Cyberpunk 2077 DLC, something that hadn't been announced yet.</p>
<p>As for Cyberpunk 2077, it is now available on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a>. Our pals at Digital Foundry have taken the game out for a spin on the Switch 2 already, asking the question: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">Can the new Nintendo console handle it?</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review.1209057/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Nobody would be complaining about Welcome Tour if it was free. This little introductory experience to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo’s Switch 2</a> feels like a perfectly Nintendo way to do things, turning the Switch 2 itself into a giant convention centre, filled with visitors who are there to check out the new Joy-Con 2, like they’re the latest exhibit in the Louvre. The thing is, we’re being charged £7.99 for this introduction, and while, yes, that also feels like a very Nintendo way to do things, it’s a bit too dry, too scientific, and comes with too little actual fun.</p>

<p>You set out by choosing a faceless avatar to be from the surprisingly long queue of potential guests, before heading up the extremely long escalator onto the exceptionally large left Joy-Con 2. It’s literally a huge version of the console, and one where you can run around, talk to other visitors, bother the staff, and play a selection of different minigames. There’s a handy Information desk nestling beneath the analogue stick, where the staff are only too happy to help you work out what you’re doing here.</p>


<p>Weirdly, the first two games over here on the left Joy-Con 2 are ones that showcase the Switch 2’s new mouse functionality, when around 90% of all humans would use the right Joy-Con instead. I’m not the only one who thinks that’s weird, am I? Hand preferences aside, the first minigame has you avoiding spiky balls falling from the top of the screen, quickly moving your craft around using the mouse and trying to stay alive as long as possible. It’s the most mini of minigames, but it is fun for what it is.</p>
<p>Successfully surviving for long enough in the first level unlocks a second level where you also have to catch stars, so I did. Completing this then opens up a <em>further</em> level, but the medal requirements to unlock this are so high it means coming back much later in your playthrough. The whole experience of Welcome Tour is gamified enough that you’ll want to earn the medals it offers to you, but there’s very few minigames on offer here that I’d be returning to in a week’s time.</p>


<p>The thing it does do is teach you about the Switch 2’s mouse mode. It shows you how it feels, how to set it up, and there’s some nice reassuring haptic rumble from both the Joy-Con when you select the game start. There’s not a ton of games to use the mouse with at launch, so as a Welcome Tour of the console, it is doing its job. Maybe you’ll mouse around the main menus?</p>
<p>Next up, the other minigame showcases the HD Rumble 2 of the Switch 2. Yes, that’s a lot of 2’s. Here you use the mouse to try and judge where the strongest rumble is on a line diagram. It doesn’t sound enthralling, and visually it isn’t, but it was interesting enough to take multiple goes trying to perfect my rumble strength sensing. The game also told me it was my forte, and I like compliments.</p>
<p>That’s it for the opening minigames, with the game’s next trick being to show you things, and then giving you a test on what you’ve seen. I’m not sure if multiple choice quizzes are anyone’s idea of a good time, but Nintendo wants to make sure you’ve not just been going about Welcome Tour with your eyes and ears shut, not paying attention. Paying attention is fun, isn’t it?</p>

<p>When you come across one of these quiz zones, you talk to the quiz giver, and they’ll then fire up four information boards for you to watch and read through, before you come back to take the test. If you thought you’d left English comprehension behind at school, think again.</p>
<p>This will all be of interest to a certain kind of person though. If you like watching people dismantle tech – I’ve already watched someone take apart a brand new Switch 2 and if anything it was a bit upsetting – and you’re interested in how things work, there’s some very detailed information about how the tech has been developed, and how it’s changed since the Switch 1.</p>

<p>It definitely gives you a different view of the console you have in your hands, and while I could have lived without knowing that the HD rumble is attached to the rear of the Joy-Con for the best flowthrough to your palm and hand, now that I know, I appreciate the engineering that’s gone into it. Welcome Tour might be, if anything, a bit of a back slapping exercise by Nintendo, but, on early impressions they deserve at least a few congratulatory fist bumps.</p>
<p>Welcome Tour is a very constrained experience though. If holds you back from wildly running around, peering at the odd analogue stick here and marvelling at a steel button there. Instead, you have to fully explore each area and visit every possible feature point in order to advance to the next, sometimes struggling to find the last blasted hidden point of interest is, while the minigames and quizzes also feel like they’re holding you back, slowly showing their hand rather than having their wares on display. It’s not that it doesn’t hang together, it does, but it’s a very particular, controlled kind of fun.</p>
<p>Somewhat disappointingly, a handful of minigames are also locked away behind needing to own a given accessory, even if you can visit those areas. It’s entirely understandable that the camera minigame would need a camera, but it’s a bit daft to have a whole minigame devoted to back buttons that needs a Pro Controller or a Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip.</p>
<p>Undeniably, Welcome Tour is visually charming. The tiny people wandering around the giant console museum look great, and there’s plenty of incidental details, like the distant hedgerows beneath, lost children sat alone on the edge of a controller and the elevator structures linking different levels. That’s followed through with Nintendo’s trademark presentation: clean, concise, and suitable for all ages.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review Update]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update.1209051/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 has finally arrived, and call me crazy but I’ve opted to celebrate its launch by playing the same game I played day one on the original Switch: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is of course an enhanced version with visual upgrades, faster loading times, and support for the Zelda Notes service via the Nintendo Switch App on your mobile device. It’s admittedly a fairly modest upgrade in terms of actual new features or content, but a welcome one, and it makes this undoubtedly the best way to play a sprawling epic that still stands tall as one of the greatest achievements in Nintendo’s iconic adventure series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get to what’s new, here’s what IGN said about Breath of the Wild in our original review:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Breath of the Wild is a 10 out of 10 game. It was a 10 out of 10 eight years ago, it’s a 10 out of 10 today, and it will probably remain a 10 out of 10 until the end of time. It’s just one of those milestone games that will be remembered as being hugely influential upon so many great games that were released in its wake, from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>. Those incredible open worlds and many more have clearly been inspired by Breath of the Wild’s groundbreaking approach to experimental and emergent gameplay, and I’ve got no doubt that it will continue to influence game developers for many years to come.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Therefore, this is not a re-review of Breath of the Wild. Instead, it’s some early observations based on my first few hours back in Hyrule in the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It runs at 4K when docked and 1080p in handheld mode, and both look as sharp as a Master Sword’s edge.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>This is Breath of the Wild as It Should Have Always Been</strong> </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gaming landmark that it was, Breath of the Wild almost seemed too ambitious for the original Switch – in fact it ran so poorly in parts that I really pity the poor folks who were somehow playing the Wii U version at the time. At any rate, the Switch 2 version has finally delivered Breath of the Wild as I assume the developers intended. It runs at 4K when docked and 1080p in handheld mode, and both look as sharp as a Master Sword’s edge. HDR is now supported also, and the kingdom of Hyrule really pops as a result – particularly once the blood moon is hanging in the sky above or the blue glow of a shrine can be glimpsed in the distance. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that resolution jump does have some downsides – the clarity it brings only makes it more obvious how basic a lot of the texture work on things like rocks and logs is when viewed up close, and it also doesn’t really clear up the jagged edges on blades of grass and the like. Still, the character models look fantastic, and more importantly it’s all so much smoother in motion than it was before thanks to the consistently 60fps framerate. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>That Means You Can Now Explore Korok Forest Without Your Switch 2 Suffering a Nervous Breakdown</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Pretty much the first thing I did when I hopped back into Breath of the Wild on Switch 2 was to beam myself directly into the Korok Forest, since that seemed like the best way to stress test this version’s improved framerate. Setting foot into the Korok Forest in Breath of the Wild on the original Switch forced the system to stutter like a shy Goron on a first date, but here in the Switch 2 it runs as smooth as goat butter. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, no matter where I’ve roamed in this enhanced Breath of the Wild, the framerate has stayed locked at 60fps, whether I was shield-surfing down the slopes of the Hebra Mountains or scrapping with large groups of moblins in Hyrule Field. No matter what I do or where I go, Breath of the Wild on Switch 2 has been more stable than a barn full of Hyrulian horses. It really is a big step up.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>No matter what I do or where I go, Breath of the Wild on Switch 2 has been more stable than a barn full of Hyrulian horses.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>While the Framerate Now Holds Firm, the Weapons Still Break</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Breath of the Wild on Switch 2 might look and load to the modern standards we’ve come to expect in 2025, but it otherwise plays in almost the exact same way that it did back on the original Switch. That’s either a really good thing, if, like me, you were a big fan of the sandbox structure, shrine-hunting, and unprecedented sense of freedom. However, if you tried Breath of the Wild on the original Switch and you bounced off it because the weapon degradation system ticked you off – and I know quite a number of people did – or perhaps you simply prefer an old-fashioned Assassin’s Creed style of open-world that leads you around by the nose instead of giving you the freedom to find your own fun, then you’re unlikely to change your mind with this Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The core Breath of the Wild adventure has been preserved, nothing has been tinkered with – at least nothing that’s been obvious to me in my first few hours with this Switch 2 port. If this style of Zelda game wasn’t your cup of tea before, then this is still that same flavour of tea. It’s just been poured into a noticeably prettier cup.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Loading Times Have Been Sped Up Significantly</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also a cup of tea that is served substantially faster, as this Switch 2 version of Breath of the Wild has had its loading times cut dramatically. Of course, that might not sound like the most sexy of features. You probably won’t want to invite your friends over to marvel at how quickly your game boots up, and you’re not going to buy a brand new TV to show off the rapid-fire rate at which Breath of the Wild now gets in and out of fast travel. But it becomes a meaningful difference the further you get into the main quest, because so much of Breath of the Wild involves hopping back and forth from one side of the sprawling map to the other searching for shrines or returning to quest givers and so on, and cutting down the time spent staring at the loading screen becomes hugely important after a while. In fact, you barely have enough time to watch the little animated silhouettes anymore, and you virtually have to speed read the loading screen pro tips! </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>There Is Some New Content, it’s Just on Your Phone Instead of Your Switch 2</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with the performance upgrades, there is some new content to be found in Breath of the Wild on Switch 2, but you’re going to have to keep a phone or tablet handy in order to access it. By pairing your game with the Nintendo Switch App on your mobile device, you can get access to the Zelda Notes suite of tools. One enables voice directions much like Google Maps, which is handy for tracking down shrines, enemies, or even those hundreds of Korok seeds that are scattered across the map. It works as advertised, and will automatically adjust even when you beam in and out of fast travel. Since I’ve already completed Breath of the Wild I was fine with map spoilers, but I like that there’s a toggle to disable them if you’re a newcomer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">125 audio logs have been spread around the map as well, which are essentially recordings of Princess Zelda making observations on certain places and characters. These are signalled by a pinging proximity sensor in the phone app, and when you find the sweet spot they’re added to a collection of recordings that you can playback on your phone whenever you like. Theoretically, that is, because I can’t really see myself listening to any of these more than once. While I’ve only found a few so far, they’ve been pretty inessential anecdotes like Zelda describing the hospitality she was once treated to by Lurelin villagers, or explaining why the mayor of Hateno village had trouble selling Purah’s house. If you’re a completionist then these small scraps of backstory are yet another collectible to search for, but I doubt I’ll bother seeking them all out myself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also detailed stat tracking of your travels and enemy kills, the ability to share an item with a friend via the generation of a QR code if you’re particularly proud of that hearty meal you just made, as well as a daily bonus which is like a wheel of fortune you can trigger once a day to give you a prize like replenishing your hearts on the spot. One of them even allows you to repair a broken weapon! Most of these are welcome and useful additions, my only wish is that they were just added in-game rather than accessed through my phone. Sure, I do have my phone beside me at all times, even when I sleep at night. I’m not proud of that. However, I don’t really want to drain my phone battery if I don’t have to, and I feel like things like voice directions and audio logs could have easily been added into Zelda itself, saving me from playing through with both hands on the controller and my phone balanced on my knees.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>You Can Now Add a Second Save File</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, I had planned on spending the $10, or in my case, $20 AUD to upgrade my existing copy of Breath of the Wild to the Nintendo Switch 2 edition, mainly because it seemed like a relatively small asking price to be able to finally play at a higher resolution and stable framerate. In my mind, I was only going to play my existing save game for a few hours of fun before I got stuck into some of the other Switch 2 launch games. However, as it turns out eight years is quite a long time, and at least in my case it’s long enough for me to have forgotten large parts of the Breath of the Wild story and its various shrines and quests, and I’ve found myself sucked back in and eager for another full playthrough. Luckily, this Switch 2 version adds a second save game, and I fully intend on starting the story over again – so it’s nice that I can do so without having to write over my original completed save and lose the hundreds of hours I invested in Breath of the Wild back in 2017. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite Zelda Games</h3><p>It's my rule or the Hyrule.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So there you have it, that’s a very quick look at The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. If you’re yet to try this masterpiece then this is the best place to jump in, and if you’ve already got a copy of the original then the performance upgrades alone make the upgrade price worth it. We’ve got plenty more Nintendo Switch 2 launch coverage to come in the days and weeks ahead, so be sure to keep checking IGN for updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a Senior Video Editor at IGN's Sydney office. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> has finally received a release date for its long-expected Xbox version.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=189">revealed by developer Game Science</a>, the Xbox Series X/S version will launch on 20th August, with pre-orders starting on 18th June. Further, the game will be discounted on PlayStation and PC in June.</p>
<p>The Xbox release date is exactly a year after the game's initial release on PS5 and PC last year, seemingly lending credence to previous claims the Xbox version was missing due to PlayStation console exclusivity.</p>

<p>Ahead of its release last year, Game Science stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">Black Myth: Wukong wouldn't be available on Xbox at launch</a>.</p>
<p>What followed was months of speculation, with many suggesting the limitations of the Xbox Series S console were to blame. Game Science itself said it was optimising the game "to meet our quality standards".</p>
<p>However, reports suggested the real reason for the delay was an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">undisclosed exclusivity deal between Game Science and PlayStation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">Microsoft itself later clarified the delay was not due to "platform limitations"</a> and a representative stated the company wouldn't comment "on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders".</p>
<p>Then, at the start of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-remains-over-black-myth-wukongs-xbox-delay-as-developer-blames-console-memory">Game Science CEO Feng Ji appeared to contradict Microsoft</a>, stating on Weibo: "But that 10G shared memory, I can't really get it without a few years of optimisation experience."</p>
<p>There's another theory: Game Science has regularly released trailers on 20th August each year as it's the day many celebrate the birthday of Wukong, the monkey king. Perhaps, then, the company has simply waited for this convenient date.</p>
<p>As for the <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194">official line</a>, Game Science has stated: "Bringing Black Myth: Wukong to Xbox Series X/S - and ensuring the experience met our internal quality standards - was no easy feat. Fortunately, we were able to complete this challenging task smoothly within the first year of the game's official release."</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong has been a huge success since its release last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">selling 10m copies in just three days</a>. It's considered China's first AAA release and has helped shift the Chinese games industry towards PC and console gaming.</p>
<p>Indeed, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">success has changed the game for Chinese developers creating action-RPGs</a>, including the likes of Tides of Annihilation, Phantom Blade Zero, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Chinese developer GameScience announced the Xbox release date of its highly acclaimed action RPG Black Myth Wukong. The game will debut on Xbox Series S and X consoles on August 20, 2025, exactly one year after the launch on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The issue of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delays-xbox-series-sx-version-opens-pre-orders-on-pc-ps5-shares-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> was long disputed among the fanbase and even between GameScience and Microsoft itself. The developer of Black Myth Wukong openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-low-ram-black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the low amount of RAM available on the Xbox Series S was causing optimization headaches that had to be resolved before the launch. Microsoft, on the other hand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delay-has-nothing-to-do-with-xbox-limitations-says-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that the Xbox console was not the issue.</p>
<p>It's hard to know where the truth lies in this case, but it is quite peculiar that everything has been worked out to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the same. It's definitely possible that there was a silent timed exclusivity deal with Sony. After all, a PlayStation executive <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/leadership-spotlight-a-conversation-with-phil-rosenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> in an interview that the Content Ventures team supported games like Genshin Impact, Stellar Blade, and Black Myth Wukong, and the two other games did launch on PlayStation first.</p>
<p>Anyway, pre-orders for the Xbox version will open on June 18. On the same day, GameScience has also planned to kick off the first discount campaign, which will reduce the price by 20%. Thankfully, the same will apply to Xbox pre-orders from June 18 to July 11.</p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong was a smashing success for GameScience, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-18-million-copies-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling over 18 million units</a> in just the first two weeks. More importantly for Xbox gamers, it's a damn good game well worth playing if you're into its genre, as explained thoroughly in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong couldn't have been a better debut for Game Science. Although their action role-playing game may not be innovative, it's got great production values, it's fun to play, it's engaging, and it's beautiful to look at. Some minor issues, such as a challenge level that could be too low for some and an experience that gets a little stale over time, hold back the game a bit, but in all honesty, I wouldn't be surprised to see more than a few players name Black Myth: Wukong their Game of the Year.</em></p>
