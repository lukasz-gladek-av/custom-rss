            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a decade of storytelling, Square Enix has decided to wrap up the story of Max Caulfield and Chloe Price in the newly-revealed Life is Strange: Reunion, which is set for launch on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on March 26, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A direct sequel to 2024's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, featuring many of the same secondary characters, Reunion will also finally answer fan wishes by bringing back both beloved faces from the franchise's original 2015 game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Max, who returned as the protagonist of Double Exposure, will reunite with her former lover/best friend Chloe for one final adventure — and for the first time in the same game, both characters will be playable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, there's a sci-fi mystery to solve and limited time to do so — this time, Max's Caledon University must be saved from a deadly fire — and once again, Max can rewind time to remake decisions, while Chloe can use her risk/reward "Backtalk" ability from 2017's Life is Strange: Before the Storm to provoke further responses from others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How is Chloe back, if players previously saw her demise? The story here seems to be that Chloe is now alive regardless after Max merged a pair of disparate timelines in Double Exposure's finale. Returned to life with memories of a past she never lived, Chloe is prompted to seek out Max for answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game builds on all the character-led, grounded storytelling for which the Life is Strange series is known, with meaningful choices that affect the outcome of a dramatic and surprising narrative – all culminating in an epic climax that serves as a finale to the Max and Chloe saga," Square Enix wrote today. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Life is Strange: Reunion Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans may be surprised to learn that Max and Chloe's stories will end here, but after a lengthy and often bumpy development road for the franchise, now perhaps feels a good point to ensure their tale gets a definitive ending, with both characters together one final time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember that Don't Nod, the series' original developer, never planned for the characters' stories to continue beyond its initial hit game. Remember also that both Don't Nod and current maker Deck Nine have experienced mixed fortunes with the series since, with the original game's emotional climax still considered by many fans to be the franchise's high point. Finally, there are likely narrative advantages to letting players decide on a final outcome for the pair — something that doesn't need to be unpicked or worked around in any continuation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Life is Strange continue without Max and Chloe? Square Enix doesn't go as far as stating that Reunion is the last Life is Strange game <em>ever </em>— though this feels an ending, for now. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/20/g-ibdyox0aeuhtr-1768932660114.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Farewell, Max and Chloe.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We couldn’t dismiss the tragedy at the heart of Max and Chloe," Life is Strange senior brand manager Andrew James said in an Xbox Wire blog post today. "Their reunion could be no quick fix. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Max and Chloe’s relationship is at the core of the story," James continued, "a relationship that YOU will choose how to develop over the course of the game. Whether Chloe lived or died in Arcadia Bay, and whether she and Max were friends or lovers — these choices are key not just to the <em>past</em> you’ll confirm as you play, but to the <em>future </em>you’ll fight for the chance to build."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon launch, Life is Strange: Reunion will be available for $40. There's also a $50 Deluxe edition featuring a digital soundtrack, art book and comic, and access to a behind-the-scenes documentary with returning Max Caulfield actress Hannah Telle, and Rhianna DeVries, Deck Nine's actress for Chloe Price. (Yes, thankfully there's no cat content sold separately this time around.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're yet to play Double Exposure, a double pack of both games will be available for $60. (It's a solid entry in the series that sets up a new cast of characters we'll see more of in Reunion — and one which Chloe fans may now enjoy more in retrospect.) Finally, a $100 Collector's Edition of Reunion will be available for die-hard fans, featuring a range of physical goods such as a 12" vinyl soundtrack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

I've pulled three normal 'Zard ex's so far, so no need to worry about deck building with Phantasmal Flames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They also had the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwZV5?object_uuid=a4e67122-6c4e-4044-aa3f-fa1b60d0cb2d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box live</a>, which is actually available for $74.99 right now, though it's been going in and out of stock as the months have gone by. With that, I'd suggest keeping an eye on that too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What made this set even more exciting is its size, with about 90 cards before secret rares, which makes it the smallest English set in nearly a decade. For collectors like me, that usually means a much more manageable chase, while still packing in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokemon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-august-28">plenty of heavy hitters</a> for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The product lineup altogether for Phantasmal Flames was pretty stacked, too. We got the usual booster packs and booster box (36 packs), a 9-pack Elite Trainer Box featuring a shiny new Charcadet promo, and an Ultra-Premium Collection built around Mega Charizard X ex.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, two theme decks for Mega Gengar ex and Mega Diancie ex arrived a few weeks early on October 24, which was a fun way to get a taste of the set before launch. If you’re like me and love cracking packs, the booster box was the way to go, but the UPC already looked like the big collector piece this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What tied it all together was the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6bvY?object_uuid=a4e67122-6c4e-4044-aa3f-fa1b60d0cb2d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Japanese set Inferno X</a>, which hit shelves there in late September. That set had only 80 cards, and once you added in the Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie decks, you basically got the full Phantasmal Flames lineup. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'd already seen some killer reveals, including the Mega Charizard X ex secret rare previewed at Worlds, so I fully expected that to be the chase card when this launches. Between the smaller set size, Charizard hype, and some solid gameplay cards, I'm not surprised this one flew off the shelves and I’m definitely glad I locked in my preorder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mega Evolution - Released Sept. 26, 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-preorders-up-today-1752498558521.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mega Evolution - Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just when you thought the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop"><u>Pokémon TCG</u></a> had enough going on with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-destined-rivals-cards"><u>Destined Rivals</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed"><u>Black Bolt and White Flare</u></a>, in came a brand new series altogether with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025">Mega Evolution sets</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced at Japan's Championship tournament, the two new sets featuring Mega Lucario ex and Mega Gardevoir ex marked the popular trading card game stepping away from its Scarlet and Violet era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Evolution released on August 1, 2025, in Japan, and September 26 in English markets (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-where-to-buy">with more preorders also supposedly taking place on September 13</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finding sealed products like these at a fair price became a challenge very quickly.

I think it's great and possibly the best opportunity to pull Illustration Rares in the Scarlet and Violet era, it's ending on a high note. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally I'm not a fan of stuffing the set with Pokéball and Masterball rares, but in terms of quality and presentation, they look cool. It would be grand to see Mega Evolution additionally double down on the dual format and loads of Illustration Rares going forward, but this is an encouraging sneek peek into what's next for Pokémon TCG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Bolt and White Flare focus on the 156 Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region. Each Unova Pokémon appear as either an illustration rare or a special illustration rare card, with different versions available in Black Bolt and White Flare products.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>July 18, 2025:</strong> Scarlet &amp; Violet Black Bolt/White Flare ETBs (9 boosters, promo, accessories); Binder Collection (5 boosters, Zekrom/Reshiram album); Unova Poster Collection (6 boosters, Snivy/Tepig/Oshawott promos, poster); Unova Mini Tin (2 boosters, art/sticker card).</li><li><strong>August 1, 2025:</strong> Tech Sticker Collection (3 boosters, Reuniclus/Gothitelle promo, stickers); Unova Victini Illustration Collection (4 boosters, foil/parallel/oversized Victini).</li><li><strong>August 22, 2025:</strong> Booster Bundle (6 Black Bolt/White Flare boosters).</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Destined Rivals - Released May. 30, 2025</h2><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/24/pokemon-destined-rivals-ign-preorders-1742828696068.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Destined Rivals - Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things really kicked off on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025"><strong>May 30</strong> <strong>with Destined Rivals</strong></a>. This set brought back Trainer’s Pokémon, reintroduces Team Rocket for another round of villainous fun, and includes some of the best card art we’ve seen in ages. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-preview">Destined Rivals</a> top chase card prices are also finally stabilizing, making it a great time to snap some up. Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex SIR has been going for anything over $450 since release, but is starting to settle on a more respectable $310. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A while back, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-best-singles-to-chase-and-buy">Destined Rivals singles market</a> was bouncing all over the place. Some cards were doubling in price overnight and it was tough to tell what was hype and what would hold. Now, prices feel a lot more stable by comparison. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some have dipped. Some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-best-singles-to-chase-and-buy">Destined Rivals</a> bangers are just cruising right at market. It feels like we’re finally seeing what these cards are actually worth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Above are the ten of the most expensive cards you can find in the set right now. A couple of them are legit strong in decks. A few are pure collector bait. Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex was the hottest card in the set for a while and it’s still holding close to market. The artwork is what does it for me, personally. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GRqK?object_uuid=a4e67122-6c4e-4044-aa3f-fa1b60d0cb2d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mewtwo</a> looks like it's about to explode, floating in this dim lab setting with everything glowing around it. The ability makes it tough to use unless you’re running a full Rocket build, but once it's active, Erasure Ball gives you some serious power. Definitely still a top-tier pull even with the market calming down.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Journey Together - Released Mar. 28 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s about time we got a set like this. Bringing back nostalgic Trainer’s Pokémon cards from the Gym Heroes era. N’s Zoroark ex and Lillie’s Clefairy ex end the chaos of endless secret arts for a more curated, collectible experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With just 16 Pokémon ex, 11 illustration rares, and three hyper rare gold cards, it’s been easier to track what’s worth pulling without feeling like you need a PhD in pack odds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fancy snagging the Enhanced Booster Display Box with its bonus N’s Reshiram illustration rare or pull Iono’s Bellibolt ex? This set screams nostalgia with a new coat of paint.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rare Cards and Collector’s Highlights</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re into collecting, this set hits the sweet spot. It’s got 16 Pokémon ex, six unique illustrations rares, and just three hyper rare gold cards, which means you won’t have to mortgage your house chasing every rarity. As for the artwork. illustrating rares like N’s Zoroark ex will look incredible in your binder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Center’s Enhanced Booster Display Box is the one to grab for preorder exclusives. It comes with a bonus N’s Reshiram illustration rare card — a little extra flex for your collection.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prismatic Evolutions - Released Jan. 17 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Prismatic Evolutions, kicked off 2025, and it’s all about Eevee and its many evolutions. This set is doing things differently, which is probably why stock sells out as soon as it comes in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is another 151 situation, but there were plenty of stock refeshes coming throughout 2025, with hopefully more coming eventually in 2026. You won’t find these cards in the usual booster packs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, they’ve be released in boxed sets throughout last year, each packed full of exclusive cards celebrating Eevee and friends. With over 175 cards, including unique designs and new game mechanics, Prismatic Evolutions is shaping to be a hit with collectors and competitive players alike.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rare Cards and Collector’s Highlights</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">For collectors, Prismatic Evolutions isn’t short on treasures. Each Eevee evolution has its special illustration and hyper-rare gold Pokémon ex card, making them must-haves for anyone building a showcase-worthy collection. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The set includes 32 illustration rares featuring detailed artwork for Pokémon ex and Supporter cards, so plenty of eye candy is here. With so many unique finishes and designs, it’s bound to make a few waves among fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the fresh artwork, inventive mechanics, and the undeniable charm of Eevee and friends, Prismatic Evolutions is set to be one of 2025's standout sets. Collectors and players alike will still find something to love here, from stunning illustration rares to powerful new game cards that can make a real difference in play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/the-climber-shin-ichi-sakamoto-seinen-sports-manga-climbing/</link>
            <guid>1411300</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>The first time I encountered the word “egoist” was while watching the shonen sports anime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lock?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Blue Lock</u></em></a>. By all accounts, it was a solid first foray into how an (ego) death game-lite soccer tournament comprised of nothing but strikers would have hotheads butting heads. However, everything <em>Blue Lock</em> had to offer me might as well have been baby food by the time I finished the underappreciated seinen gem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Climber_(manga)?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Climber</u></em></a>—a brutal, transcendent tale about when grit and enlightenment arrive a hair too late to save men already ruined by their own compulsions.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than being a glorified glossary of the sport like its breezier contemporaries, <em>The Climber</em>, written by novelist Jirō Nitta and adapted into a manga by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin-ichi_Sakamoto?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Shin-ichi Sakamoto</u></a>, is essentially about a group of climbers and the folly and pyrrhic victories of their impulses—namely, those of protagonist Mori Buntarō. When we first meet Mori, who’s loosely based on the <a href="https://onehundredmountains.blogspot.com/2010/10/life-and-death-on-matterhorn-of-japan.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>real-life legend Katō Buntarō</u></a>, he’s an edgy transfer student already halfway checked out of humanity. After a run-in with a classmate who impressively scaled the school roof just to poke fun at Mori for being an antisocial prick, Mori repeats the climb, to the horror of everyone at the school, without a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belaying?ref=aftermath.site"><u>belaying rope</u></a>. The instant he pulls off a ballsy double dyno jump to the school roof, Mori’s life shifts into a new paradigm as he chases an insatiable high for climbing, a sport the manga frames as his supposed salvation.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>(Viz Media)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>At the onset, Mori’s got everything your typical shonen protagonist would have: a built-in rival in his former bully turned climbing senpai, a mentor in his homeroom teacher and climbing coach, and a cute girl cheering him on from the sidelines. All signs point toward a clean, redemptive path to being a normal guy. But climbing doesn’t save him; it drags him deeper into himself. Mori doesn’t want to tether himself to a partner—he wants to be a solo climber, and if he could help it, he wants to be a solo climber without the lifeline of a belay rope. What follows are chapters, cleverly stylized as “climbs,” that amplify everything fundamentally broken in Mori long before they ever offer a way out—which he frequently refuses—as the manga tracks his psychological descent with grisly patience, from dropping out of high school to the isolating, obsessive adulthood that cements his effigy as the “immortal climber.”</p><p>Part of what makes <em>The Climber</em> so arresting is its insistence that the logic of “the ground” does not apply to the logic of the mountain. Down here, cutting a belay rope is unthinkable. Up there, if it comes down to severing that line or dying alongside your partner, you cut the rope. The manga never sensationalizes this binary choice of extremes; it simply presents the reader with the reality of a world where survival demands choices that would make no sense to anyone not already resigned to the possibility of dying for having made the climb in the first place.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>(Images: Viz Manga)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>To keep readers grounded without slowing the pace, each volume includes a glossary of climbing terms—clean, unobtrusive, and genuinely helpful—as well as interviews with real climbers explaining why they do what they do. But as the series reminds you, just because you can cut your ear off doesn’t make you Vincent Van Gogh. <em>The Climber</em> interrogates the “Why do you X?” refrain that runs through other art/athletics‑driven stories like <a href="https://aftermath.site/look-back-gkids-tatsuki-fujimoto/"><em><u>Look Back</u></em></a> or <a href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review/"><em><u>100 Meters</u></em></a>, only here the characters are often too far gone for a redemption that isn’t self‑destructive. Real egoists, the manga argues, are R.U.N.s: revolting, ugly, nauseating, and shameless—and <em>The Climber</em> is packed with them.&nbsp;</p><p>No arc better epitomizes the ambitions and the hubris of an egoist than <em>The Climber</em> putting its characters through the wringer in their attempt to conquer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2?ref=aftermath.site"><u>K2</u></a>, one of the five tallest mountains on Earth, and also the deadliest. Given the mountain has killed one person for every four who reached the summit since the year 2021, totalling to around 96 deaths for every <a href="https://www.climbing.com/places/k2-worlds-second-highest-mountain/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>estimated 800 climbers who summited by the year 2023</u></a>, the odds of <em>The Climber</em>’s egoists being successful are dog water considering its climbing team would climb the bodies of their partners if it meant being the first to conquer its eastern face.&nbsp;</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>(Images: Viz Media)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><em>The Climber</em> is also one of those manga where the artistry illustrates its point far more effectively than dialogue ever could. For 170 chapters, <em>The Climber</em>’s pages capture the true devastation of an avalanche, not as the usual cloud of powder sliding politely down a mountain, but as a catastrophic force of nature rendered through panels of skyscrapers and semi‑trucks plummeting downhill at blistering, irrational speeds. It’s a visual language designed to make you feel, in your bones, how dangerous climbing really is. And Sakamoto’s artistry drives that point home, shifting effortlessly between the magical realism of trippy, ethereal, dreamlike climbing sequences and the raw, uninhibited anguish his characters endure as they bivouac on the mountain and as they curl up in a husk below it, should they be fortunate enough to descend a climb by their own power without their frozen carcasses being helicoptered from a rocky metaphor for their own hubris.</p><figure><figcaption><span>(Image: Viz Media)</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>The Climber</em>’s answer to “Why do you X?” is a deceptively simple one. Mori doesn’t climb because he loves it, nor does he do it to be the best. He does it because it’s natural to go where you feel compelled to go. And, as in life, the path that demands the most courage is, more often than not, the one you’re supposed to take. Whether that place is the zenith of a man‑killing mountain, or its nadir, where the people who love you white-knuckle it out through deafeningly silent weeks for your safe return. Along his trek, Mori metamorphosizes from an irredeemable little shit into someone worth rooting for one brutal climb at a time.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time I tore through <em>The Climber</em>, taking many a “woosa” break, I felt I’d read a masterpiece on par with <a href="https://gizmodo.com/vinland-saga-creator-makoto-yukimura-looks-back-on-writing-his-pacifist-viking-epic-2000664303?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Vinland Saga</u></em></a>. It gave me a new appreciation for climbing—and scared me straight out of ever wanting to solo climb a mountain, much less face life’s less voluntary obstacles alone.</p>

			<p>Following the conclusion of the staff and community polls, it is time to declare the winners of the <strong>Wccftech Awards '25</strong>, which include the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best games of 2025</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-the-return-of-aaa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most anticipated titles of 2026</a></strong>, based on the nominees from our genre lists.</p>



<p>Let's begin with the results of our best games of 2025 polls. When it comes to last year's releases, the Wccftech staff and our community <strong>agreed on practically every winner except for a single category</strong>, Strategy and Simulation, with our staff giving the award to <strong>Square Enix's Final Fantasy Tactics - Ivalice Chronicles, </strong>while our community preferred <strong>Slipgate's Tempest Rising</strong>.</p>



<p>The clear winner is, to the surprise of absolutely nobody at this point, <strong>Sandfall's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>, which walks away with <strong>four prizes</strong>: best indie game and <strong>Game of the Year</strong> from both staff and community.</p>



<p>The universally acclaimed game did, however, lose to <strong>Warhorse's Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong> in the best RPG category. Other multi-winners in the Wccftech Awards '25 include <strong>Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei</strong> in the action category, <strong>Team Cherry's Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> in the platform category, <strong>Nintendo's Mario Kart World</strong> in the sports/racing category, <strong>AdHoc Studio's Dispatch</strong> in the adventure category, <strong>EA's Battlefield 6</strong> in the shooter category, <strong>KONAMI's Silent Hill f</strong> in the horror category, <strong>KOF Studio's Fatal Fury: City of Wolves</strong> in the fighting category, <strong>Embark's ARC Raiders</strong> in the multiplayer category, and <strong>NEOWIZ's Lies of P: Overture</strong> in the DLC/expansion category. </p>



<p>Without further ado, scroll for the full breakdown of the votes and rankings.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Wccftechs-Most-Anticipated-Games-of-2026-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>These five are definitely among the most anticipated games of 2026.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While 2025 was essentially the year of the indie-ish, 2026 <strong>looks a lot more centered around triple-A releases</strong>, featuring heavyweight returns from triple-A developers, franchises, or both.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Wccftech staff and community 2026 polls, they were a fair bit more discordant than the 2025 polls, but that is to be expected given that we're talking about unreleased games. Our own staff also voted differently in a few categories, resulting in a few ties at the top.</p>



<p>Even so, one game emerged above all the others. Yes, it's obviously <strong>Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto 6</strong>, which received <strong>four prizes</strong>: most anticipated action game from the community, most anticipated multiplayer from the community, and most anticipated overall from both staff (tied) and community. The runner-up for most anticipated prizes is <strong>CAPCOM's Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, which got <strong>three</strong>: most anticipated horror game from both staff and community, and most anticipated overall from the staff (tied).</p>



<p>The other multi-winners were <strong>Playground's Fable</strong> (in the RPG category) and <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong> (in sports/racing), <strong>The Coalition's Gears of War: E-Day</strong> (in shooter), <strong>ARC System Works' MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls</strong> (in fighting), <strong>Crystal Dynamics/Flying Wild Hog's Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</strong> (in platform), the <strong>untitled STALKER 2 DLC</strong> (in expansion), <strong>Creative Assembly's Total War: Warhammer 40,000</strong> (in strategy/simulation), and <strong>Big Bad Wolf's Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</strong> (in adventure). </p>



<p>Keep scrolling for the full breakdown per genre.</p>

The developer describes <em>Reunion</em> as the “emotional conclusion of the Max and Chloe saga.” Players will have three days to attempt to avoid a fire at their old college, where Max is now a teacher. Here’s the basic set-up:</p><div><blockquote><p>Returning from a weekend away, Max finds her beloved Caledon ablaze, as a raging inferno destroys the hallowed grounds and ends the lives of Max’s friends, students, and faculty alike. Max only escapes the devastation due to her Rewind power — returning from the original <em>Life is Strange </em>— a supernatural ability that lets her reverse time. Jumping back in time through a selfie, Max now has just three days to work out how the fire began. Can she make the most of her second chance to prevent this fiery disaster?</p></blockquote></div><p>The twist is that both characters will be playable for the first time. While Max retains her time travel power, Chloe’s skill is her back talk and attitude, which can apparently do a hella good job of dealing with suspects.</p><p>Of course, while <em>Reunion</em> marks the end of this particular storyline, that doesn’t necessarily mean <em>Life is Strange</em> won’t continue. The series has adopted something of an anthology format, with several games — <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21003367/life-is-strange-2-season-review-xbox-ps4-pc-dontnod">Life is Strange 2</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22661479/life-is-strange-true-colors-review-xbox-ps5-switch">Life is Strange: True Colors</a></em> — telling all new stories within the same themes and gameplay structure.</p><p>It appears that <em>Life is Strange: Reunion</em> won’t be an episodic release — publisher Square Enix describes it as “a full-length adventure” — and it’s launching on March 26th on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/864438/life-is-strange-reunion-release-date-max-chloe]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[What Games Are Forever Stuck In Your Backlog?]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/backlog-forever-game-stuck-cyberpunk-2077-daggerfall-2000661313</link>
            <guid>1411261</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Video game backlogs vary wildly from person to person. Some folks have massively long lists of games they want to play. Others might only have a few that they are dedicated to crossing off. But one thing I find true across all gaming backlogs is that there’s always one game that, for whatever reason, remains stuck on the list and seems unlikely to ever be finished.</p> <p>So we at <em>Kotaku, </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews/backlog">in honor of our ongoing Backlog Week</a>, want to know what game or games are forever trapped in your backlog and why? Maybe its because you love it and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-how-long-to-beat-2000657800">can’t bear to watch credits roll</a>, or maybe it has an excruciating <a href="https://kotaku.com/13-bad-boss-fights-zelda-mass-effect-kingdom-hearts-1850334686">difficulty spike or story twist</a> that made you completely bounce off it.</p>

 <p>Speaking personally, I have two games that remain permanently stuck on my backlog like tiny splinters unable to be removed. The first is a more recent-ish title: <em>Cyberpunk 2077.</em></p> <p>I’ve now tried on three separate occasions to start playing <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-kotaku-review-1845946628">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</em> And each time I get about two to three hours in and reach the moment when the game goes fully “open world,” I quickly fall off.&nbsp; There’s something about <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>‘s city and world that just feels lifeless and dull. Walking around it doesn’t do much for me. Then I try to explore and find quests and I just get bored and stop. This annoys me a lot. There are people whose opinion I trust a lot who love<em> Cyberpunk 2077.</em> They adore it. They’ve played it more than once. And yet I can’t even get past the opening hours. Perhaps I’ll never cross this one off my list.</p>

 <p>The other game in my backlog is an old one: <em>Daggerfall</em>. I’m a big fan of the<em> Elder Scrolls</em> games, but I started with <em>Morrowind</em>. Each time I’ve tried to play <em>Daggerfall</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-daggerfall-unity-oblivion-remastered-1851779519">even the great Unity port,</a> I’m just unable to push through the ancient mechanics, menus, and design ideas. But again, I know people who love this game and find it super special. And as a big <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fan, I want to experience it. Sadly, that hasn’t happened yet, despite trying a few times in recent years.</p>

 <p>Anyway, leave your backlog games that won’t leave in the comments below, and tell us why they’re stuck forever on your list.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/20/chloe-is-back-in-life-is-strange-reunion-this-march-even-if-you-know/</link>

		<p>Square Enix and Deck Nine have revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-reunion">Life Is Strange: Reunion</a>, with Chloe Price returning to reunite with Max Caulfield and put a bow on their story together. The game is launching on 26th March 2026 across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p>Yes, Chloe is back, even if, well, you know what you did at the end of the first game.</p>


<p><em><strong>Spoiler Warning</strong> for the original Life Is Strange and Double Exposure in the reveal stream and loosely for this announcement post.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Life is Strange Returns in 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2eHeCKYHJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Life Is Strange: Reunion will take us back to Caldeon University, where Max is now a photography teacher, following the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>. However, as she returns from a weekend away, she discovers the university ablaze and all her friends trapped in the fire. Her only course of action is to jump back in time three days, travelling through a photograph once more to try and figure out what happened and how to stop it.</p>

<p>And then Chloe shows up. Now, for an awful lot of people Chloe died back in 2015 at the end of the original game, with players having to choose between saving Chloe and with saving Arcadia Bay from a huge storm. Life Is Strange: Reunion will honour your decision within the dialogue and narrative flow, and not pick a single canonical path for you.</p>
<p>How does it do this? Well, Double Exposure’s evolution of Max’s powers and the events that transpired have done some kind of timey-wimey stuff and somehow managed to merge both potential timelines. Chloe arrives as she is now haunted by memories of both timelines, while Max remains traumatised by what happened, even through it’s undone. It’s a neat path, and this game will aim to give them some kind of closure, it seems, wrapping up their combined and separated stories.</p>

<p>Together, and with Max’s group of friends, they need to get to the bottom of what’s happening at Caledon. They’ll uncover plots for revenge, secret societies, and potentially worse, and you’ll get to play as both Max and Chloe in this game. Max has her classic time rewinding ability with the spiral in the corner of the screen, choosing alternative paths through a situation, winding things back and picking different routes, and using the ability to retain inventory and position while time skipping to solve environmental puzzles. Chloe, meanwhile, has her Backtalk ability to snarkily wriggle her way through various scenarios that she runs into.</p>

<p>Life Is Strange: Reunion will be available in a standard edition, priced at €49.99/£44.99, but there are also a Deluxe Edition, Twin Pack, and Collector’s Edition versions of the game with various extras. Pre-ordering the game or buying through the first month of release will net you the Max and Chloe Classic Outfits DLC.</p>
<p>The Life is Strange series has been in the hands of Deck Nine for a good few years now, with the IP held by Square Enix and original developer Dontnod branching off to other projects since Life is Strange 2. Having bounced between new protagonists and settings, Deck Nine brought us back to Max Caulfield’s story with 2024’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review/">our review</a>, Reu said, “Life is Strange: Double Exposure is a very easy game to recommend. If you have enjoyed previous games in the series, this is doing enough of the same to scratch that same lowkey mystery vibes itch. The ability to shift between timelines can become a touch overwhelming at times, but there’s several things in place across the UI, accessibility options, and narrative flow to keep the gameplay smooth. What’s more, I think this game might have redeemed Max Caulfield for me too, so take that how you will.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wizards of the Coast is “Bringing the Spirit of D&D Homebrew to Fortnite,” New D&D Fortnite Islands Announced]]></title>

            <guid>1411231</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The latest <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/fortnite-everything-we-know-hub/">Fortnite</a></strong> collab has been revealed, and it's seemingly just in time to catch <strong>Stranger Things</strong> fans who are looking for anything that makes them feel closer to their favourite show now that it's over. <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong> has announced five new Fortnite Islands, all <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> inspired, officially bringing D&amp;D to the popular everything game.</p>



<p>The five islands were made through a collaboration with UEFN creators <strong>Chartis Games</strong> and <strong>Teravision Games</strong>, each of them "<em>inspired by iconic D&amp;D locations, monsters, and gameplay styles ranging from PvP and platforming to a massive co-op roguelike experience</em>," according to a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>We’re bringing the spirit of D&amp;D homebrew to Fortnite</em>," added <strong>Nick Strann,</strong> franchise strategy director for Dungeons &amp; Dragons at Wizards of the Coast. <em>"Supporting creators, experimenting in new mediums, and learning how we can introduce D&amp;D to new players. D&amp;D already means so much to all those who have joined us at the table, and we hope that we can make it just as meaningful for millions of&nbsp;</em><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>fans. We very much look forward to hearing player feedback on these creator-made islands and using that feedback to shape future adventures wherever people love D&amp;D."</p>



<p>Here are the five islands and their island codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>DnD Boxfights – Island Code 1190-4691-0255&nbsp;</li>



<li>DnD Treasure RNG – Island Code 4958-2624-5634&nbsp;</li>



<li>DnD Dungeon Deathrun – Island Code 5806-6430-0158&nbsp;</li>



<li>DnD Bossfight – Island Code 2218-1049-5866&nbsp;</li>



<li>DnD Zombie Dragon Adventure (early access) – Island Code 2525-9596-3235&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Last year, Fortnite had more than a few major collaborations that saw the game go through major environmental changes for a limited time, most notably with its collaborations around <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-x-the-simpsons-crossover-introduces-players-springfield-island/">The Simpsons</a>,</strong> the <a href="https://wccftech.com/disneyland-game-rush-brings-disney-parks-to-fortnite-starting-tomorrow/"><strong>Walt Disney World</strong> theme parks</a>, and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-lost-chapter-yukis-revenge/">Quentin Tarantino</a> </strong>collaboration. </p>



<p>The official introduction of D&amp;D to Fortnite doesn't seem to be on the same scale as any of those past collabs, but that's likely due to Wizards of the Coast claiming these islands are part of a "<em>launch and learn initiative to explore how D&amp;D can connect with a diverse range of Fortnite players in fun and meaningful ways</em>."</p>



<p>We know how far Fortnite collaborations can go, and how expansive the world of D&amp;D is. If Wizards of the Coast feels good about how the launch of these five islands is received, we may be in for a much grander D&amp;D collaboration with Fortnite in the future.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/deck-nine-games-new-life-is-strange-game-reveal-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised last week</a>, <strong>Deck Nine Games</strong> has just announced <strong>Life is Strange: Reunion</strong>, a new entry in the adventure game series published by <strong>Square Enix</strong>.</p>



<p>The press release describes this as the emotional conclusion to the journey of <strong>Max</strong> and <strong>Chloe</strong>, the main characters in the acclaimed first game of the saga. For story reasons we won't spoil here, fans would never have thought the two could meet again, and <strong>yet they will in this new title</strong>.</p>



<p>Players will once again visit the grounds of <strong>Caledon University</strong>, where Max Caulfield works as a photography teacher, as seen in 2024's game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a></strong>. Returning from a weekend away, Max finds her beloved Caledon ablaze, as a raging inferno destroys the campus and ends the lives of Max's friends, students, and faculty alike. She escapes the devastation only because of her <strong>Rewind power</strong>. After jumping back in time through a selfie, Max now <strong>has just three days to work out how the fire began and prevent it</strong>. </p>



<p>That's when Chloe Price <strong>arrives at Caledon</strong>, much to Max's surprise. This is apparently a shocking repercussion of <strong>Max's merging of the timelines</strong> that happened at the end of Double Exposure. Haunted by nightmares of a past she never lived, and with her grip on reality quickly unraveling, Chloe needs Max's help more than ever. </p>



<p>The standout feature is that, for the first time in the series, Life is Strange: Reunion <strong>lets players play as both Max and Chloe in the same game</strong>, alternating between their perspectives as the story unfolds. Max's Rewind power is, of course, used to undo and redo decisions, change the course of conversations, and manipulate the environment to solve '4D puzzles', while Chloe's Backtalk ability, quick wits, and attitude let her sway key suspects and go where Max cannot.</p>



<p>Deck Nine Games aims to build on the series' grounded storytelling to provide players with meaningful choices that affect the outcome of a dramatic and surprising narrative, all <strong>culminating in an epic climax that serves as a finale to the Max and Chloe saga</strong>.</p>

<p>Known as Life is Strange: Reunion, the upcoming release reunites Max and Chloe following the climatic events of the first game. It's set to release on 26th March, across Xbox Series X/S, PC and PlayStation 5. You can check out its announcement trailer below.</p>

<p>According to the Reunion team, Chloe's return is probably down to the powers that Max gained in the most recent series release, Double Exposure, which could allow her to shift between parallel timelines. </p>
<p>However, whichever choice players made in the original Life is Strange game - bay or bae - will still be reflected with branching dialogue. It does affect Chloe, though, who is having flashbacks to those moments in the first game.</p>

</figure>
<p>On the supernatural power front, there has been a "resurgence" of Max's rewind ability, and in Reunion she can stay in the past via Polaroids. Max's rewind power also allows her to undo everything. One thing she can't erase, though, is the memory of her own actions. Her rewind power will also be "more responsive" than ever in Reunion.</p>
<p>As for Chloe, she has the gift of the gab. That is to say, Backtalk, which Chloe can use to "browbeat her opponents during key conversations" and explore areas of Caledon University that Max can't (see image below).</p>

<p>"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield's partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max's help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus," reads the official blurb for Life is Strange: Reunion. </p>
<p>"Max's Rewind power has bought her time - but she can't prevent the blaze alone. The fire will force Max and Chloe to make devastating decisions. Can they find a future together… Before everything burns?"</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>'s franchise art director Joseph Cross left Bungie in December, shortly after the Destiny developers announced a March 2026 release window for the sci-fi shooter reboot. Now, he’s talking about what it was like to work on the game, which has a fair bit of lingering negative press to contend with – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">extended delays</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass studio layoffs and restructuring</a>, repeated accusations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">plagiarism</a><a></a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-still-fully-dedicated-to-releasing-marathon-by-march-as-they-sigh-in-disappointment-at-bungies-money-numbers">money troubles</a> owing to Bungie’s ailing shooter Destiny 2, and apathy about blockbuster live service games at large, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">epitomised</a> by the cancelling of Sony’s once-touted Concord.</p>
<p>Many would agree that nu-Marathon’s art is its strongest suite, accusations of plagiarism notwithstanding. It’s certainly the thing I like best about the game. Or at least, find the most intriguing. For want of a better analogy at this dismally late stage in the UK working day, everything in Marathon’s world looks like it’s made of very expensive cybernetic ice cream, sold in a branch of IKEA that appears on no Earthly map. As one might expect from his previous job description, Cross has nothing but good things to say about Marathon’s art. Indeed, he thinks the art direction has “more of a responsibility for creating interest” than is usual, because the game beneath is more about “compelling spins on established mechanics”.</p>
<p>“I believed immediately in the simplified style — but the simplified style was the risk,” Cross explains in a generous chat with Mikhail Klimentov for <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/exit-interview-joseph-cross-marathon">the latest ReaderGrev newsletter</a>. “This look that we went for and that you see an evolution of today in the game, it clicked for me right away. I was like: This is the horse I’m betting on. And I know it's challenging. That's a big part of the point. I knew very early on, it should make people nervous. Anything new like this, at this scale, by definition almost, should be a little bit nerve-racking to fund.</p>
<p>“My instinctive way of approaching that challenge was to really approach the art side of it like production art — like we were doing product design, whether it was a weapon or a loot box or a character’s helmet,” he goes on. “Product design, by nature, lends itself to production, regardless of the industry, where you're thinking about how stuff works and fits together, and shape language and color and all this stuff. We didn't spend a lot of time trying to sell the fantasy, if that makes sense, and at least early on, we didn't invest a lot of time in creating illustrations, for example. In hindsight, I would have commissioned more illustration work. Famously, that's what George Lucas did to get Star Wars sold, is these Ralph McQuarrie illustrations.”</p><p>There’s a lot more in the full chat, including debts to graffiti, comparisons with the visual language of Roblox, and an ode to one particular character’s sneakers. There’s also some cagey talk about Marathon’s choppy pre-release fortunes, and the rigours of making the game run in Bungie’s Tiger engine without looking like a “first cousin of Destiny”. And then there is the below section on why Cross feels the art direction needs to go particularly hard for Marathon.</p><p>

“There's also something about the design of the game, where at a certain point I really did believe that art had potentially more of a responsibility for creating interest than it would if we were working on a different kind of game,” he says. “The game design, nobody's reinventing the wheel here. We're putting compelling spins on established mechanics. The narrative is also not reinventing the wheel. It's an abandoned space colony where something mysterious happened. We've seen this a lot. It's about how you spin it, and at some point, for better or for worse, I told myself that this is an opportunity for art to sort of step up and provide a level of newness to this world.”
</p><p>To intercept the obvious criticism here, I don’t think this is Cross throwing his old colleagues in Marathon’s game design team under a bus. I don’t think anybody at Bungie can reasonably deny that nu-Marathon is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-lives-as-bungie-set-a-march-release-date-and-try-to-convince-you-the-extraction-shooter-is-good-now">familiar species of shooter</a>. Still, I imagine Bungie would prefer that it both look astonishing and blow your puny human brain at the level of the gunshoots and loot-getting. We’ll be able to decide for ourselves in not too long – as of yesterday, the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathons-final-release-date-locked-in-by-bungie-with-the-shooter-finally-set-to-run-out-of-cover-soon">due to launch on 5th March</a>.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s servers have been shut down</span></a><span> for a week now, marking the end of a pretty tragic chapter in developer BioWare’s history. The live-service looter shooter’s crash and burn reportedly nudged publisher EA to let the studio strip out the reported multiplayer elements from the game that would go on to become </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i><span>, which signaled to some that the studio was “returning” to its roots. However, as </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> has been dropped down into an abyss, ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah is disputing the notion that the game was </span><i><span>that</span></i><span> far out of left field for the studio.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y65eoBVF0Y"><span>YouTuber Destin Legarie</span></a><span>, Darrah talked at length about the life and death of </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>, and in the closing minutes, Legarie asks if there’s anything Darrah wants to “set the record straight” on regarding the game. Darrah replies that while many people want to point fingers solely at EA for mandating that the historically single-player RPG studio shift into making an ill-advised cooperative loot shooter, it wasn’t “all their fault.” He also said that, at the time, the prospect of making </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>seemed like just the latest evolution for a studio that had evolved many times before, so he says he is less swayed by arguments stating that the company shouldn’t have even tried.</span></p>

  <p><span>“My feeling is that BioWare has always been changing,” he said. “I mean, by that argument, we should never have made </span><i><span>Neverwinter Nights</span></i><span> because we were a 2D RPG maker. We should never have made </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> because we were a tactical RPG maker, not an action RPG maker. So I don’t know that that argument holds a lot of weight for me. To me, it’s like, yeah, your studios evolve, and they try new things, and was </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> too big of a reach? Yeah, for sure. But could you tell at the time? I don’t know. I don’t know that you could.”</span></p> <p><span>In a perfect world, developers would be able to make mistakes like </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>without risking going under, but reports about </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s development indicate that it did some seismic damage to BioWare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>internally that it’s still recovering from</span></a><span>. The company was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>downsized last year</span></a><span> as a small team works on the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>game. We’ll see if it’s enough to get the studio back on track after a decade of strife.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Highguard Free-To-Play? Highguard Price, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-free-to-play-price-cost/</link>
            <guid>1411195</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The mystery surrounding Highguard stayed with the game until its inevitable launch. The FPS revealed next to nothing in the build-up to its launch, but Wildgate Entertainment was happy to address one major detail about Highguard: Its price and free-to-play status.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> aptly kept up a high guard following its shocking The Game Awards 2025 reveal, even as the days and weeks ticked by to its release date. This added only to Highguard’s aura, and while we all tried to work out what the game was and what it was about, the dev left no doubt about Highguard’s price tag.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-highguard-cost-f2p-status-explained">How Much Does Highguard Cost? F2P Status, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It won’t blow a hole in your wallet. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard doesn’t cost anything, and it doesn’t have a price, because Highguard is a free-to-play shooter.</strong></p>



<p>That’s the first big stumbling block out of the way. Games like Concord have shown that charging a fee for this type of game can warrant a backlash, or worse (in the case of Concord), nothing at all from anyone.</p>



<p>The gaming world was left with its mouth ajar, watching Highguard be the final reveal of TGA 2025. By not showing anything since, this ironically increased the game’s appeal and hype. On the plus side, no matter how Highguard turns out, whether you love it or hate it, it won’t cost you a penny.</p>



<p>In fact, the game’s only real marketing at all, a few days from launch, was its initial reveal trailer. The impressive footage ended with a definitive message: “Play Free.”</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-will-highguard-have-microtransactions-amp-battle-pass">Will Highguard Have Microtransactions &amp; Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Many will. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Steam claims that Highguard will have ‘In-App Purchases,’ but this is the full extent known about Highguard’s extra paid purchases and potential live-service elements.</strong></p>



<p>All that is known about Highguard—other than the Steam notice about the purchases—is a brief description of the shooter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From the creators of&nbsp;Apex Legends&nbsp;and&nbsp;Titanfall, comes&nbsp;Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to battle for control of a mythical continent. There they’ll clash against rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>You’ll find out, like everyone else, what Highguard has in store (potentially literally) when it launches as a F2P game on January 26.</p>



<p>If Highguard wasn’t free-to-play, would it have put you off? Will you still be skipping Highyuard anyway?

This progression includes:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting, however, that Cross-Progression does not mean Cross-Purchase. So, just because you might own the game on PC, don't expect to suddenly be able to fire it on PlayStation. The same goes for its DLC packs, which similarly must be bought for any platform you wish to play their content on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Older saves not tied to your Primary Account won't be deleted, though you will need to toggle off Cross-Progression to regain access to them. Doing so will let you pick up your older save specific to that platform. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One wrinkle to all this is the end of IO Interactive's ability to carry over progression from Hitman 2 to Hitman 3. The ability to do this will end on February 3, alongside the addition of Cross-Progression. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This guarantees data integrity and prevents conflicts between legacy progression systems and the new unified WOA progression," IO Interactive wrote in a <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> on the changes. "Past February 3rd 9:00 UTC players won’t be able to proceed to the Hitman 2 to Hitman 3 carryover, giving you two weeks to proceed to the carryover if you are yet to do so."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive has three main productions right now: ongoing work on Hitman: World of Assassination, including work on a co-op mode, James Bond blockbuster 007 First Light, and a new fantasy IP appropriately codenamed Project Fantasy. Beyond all that, there are also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-theres-going-to-be-a-hitman-4-developer-io-interactive-says">plans to release Hitman 4 — eventually</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Block rocking beats expectations.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The chief developer behind the saving of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has celebrated the game’s early access launch, declaring: “I have no regrets.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme issued an update a week on from Hytale’s release on PC (check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-review-early-access">IGN's Hytale early access review so far</a> to see what we think). He said saving the game and releasing it had been “the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale has endured a tumultuous development. It was announced in December 2018 with a trailer that so far has an incredible 62 million views on <a href="https://youtu.be/o77MzDQT1cg?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a>. The idea was to expand on the likes of Minecraft by combining the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, all set in a procedurally generated world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. League of Legends developer Riot Games invested in the project and, in 2020, bought the studio outright.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in June last year development on Hytale stopped and Hypixel Studios began winding down operations. It was thought Hytale was canceled, destined never to release. But in November, Riot confirmed it had sold the rights to Hytale back to Collins-Laflamme as this "gives players the best chance to one day experience a revised version of the game they've been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006090043665088900" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>statement</u></a> published at the end of 2025, Collins-Laflamme expressed his "anger" at what had happened to Hytale over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game has insane potential, but four years of engineering went into rebuilding the engine rather than gameplay features," he said. "That leaves us with a four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do, and that rebuilt engine is never gonna be used.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you don’t invest in gameplay, you don’t just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a damn miracle we were able to salvage Hytale. It was barely playable. All basics were broken. Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering. Everything, everything was wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It should have taken years to fix, but within weeks, we got the game into a playable, fun state. And now, instead of slowing down or celebrating a release, we have to keep pushing for years to make up for the time that was lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So yes, I feel anger. And I’m turning that into focus and execution. I’m committing more money, more time, and personal sacrifice to deliver the game this vision deserves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to the early access launch, and it sounds like all the heartache was worth it. Even before the early access launch, Collins-Laflamme said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-isnt-even-out-yet-and-its-already-made-enough-money-to-cover-the-next-2-years-of-development-costs">Hytale had already made enough money to cover the next two years of development</a>. And now, he’s told fans he can call the launch a success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s now been seven days since early access launch and I can confidently say that I have no regrets saving Hytale, it’s been the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life,” Collins-Laflamme said in <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2013636980626595976" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X / Twitter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you everyone for the amazing support, and a big thank you for the rebuilt Hytale team for trusting me to get this to the finish line in just a few months. I haven’t been involved with Hytale development for many years and coming back was a big unknown and risk for me, and my family. I fully trusted the people and it just worked. Amazing team, every single one made a big difference.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Work on updating Hytale continues, with Update 2 coming this week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/15/life-is-strange-livestream-will-reveal-a-new-game-launching-this-year">teasing the next Life is Strange game</a> last week, a special livestream that aired this afternoon revealed the next entry is called Life is Strange: Reunion. Max Caulfield returns yet again, alongside her original BFF and fan favorite character, Chloe Price.</p><p>Developed by Deck Nine, Reunion is a direct follow-up to 2024’s Life is Strange: Double Exposure. Set once again in Caledon University, the school has been mysteriously set ablaze. Although Max manages to escape the fire thanks to her time rewind power (which makes its full return), all of her friends, the students, and the faculty are killed.</p><p>Max avoids this fate by jumping back in time through a selfie and has three days to uncover how the fire started to prevent the school's destruction. However, due to Max’s reality-shifting actions during the events of Double Exposure (which we won’t spoil), Chloe appears at Caledon University. She’s understandably confused and haunted by memories of a past she never lived, and needs Max’s help.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrxm00_0jPE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrxm00_0jPE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Players switch between controlling Max and Chloe in Reunion, offering two perspectives on the story. Max can use her rewind power to redo decisions and manipulate the environment to solve four-dimensional puzzles. Chloe (voiced once again by Rhianna DeVries) has her Backtalk dialogue mechanic from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/life_is_strange_before_the_storm/b/playstation4/archive/2018/03/07/life-is-strange-before-the-storm-complete-review.aspx">Life is Strange: Before the Storm</a>, channeling her quick wits and attitude to steer conversations in ways Max can’t, which will let Chloe access information and areas her bestie couldn’t. Regardless of how the story shakes out, Deck Nine bills Reunion as the big conclusion to Max and Chloe's story.&nbsp;</p><p>Life is Strange: Reunion is launching on March 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

<p>The 'Freeze Break' event kicked off today (<strong>20th Jan</strong>) and will be sticking around until <strong>27th Jan at 7:59am GMT / 8:59am CET / 11:59 PT (26th)</strong> — so there's plenty of time to get in and grab the rewards.</p>
<p>Much like previous events, this one sees another pair of familiar faces from the DK series get the statue treatment. It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Tropical Freeze</a> in the limelight this time, with Tucks and Lord Fredrik statues available to all those who meet the event quota.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4kwljuv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>As we've seen previously, 'Freeze Break' will challenge you to complete the Emerald Rush roguelike mode only using a limited number of perks and upgrades. This one takes place entirely on the Freezer Layer, fittingly, so prepare to mix up your approach with whatever boosts are available.</p>

<p>The launch of the studio's first new IP in years since the launch of Destiny in 2014, however, will be remarkable even for those who own a <strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong> but may not be fans of the team which created the iconic <a href="https://wccftech.com/its-a-bold-claim-to-reconnect-with-the-community-without-multiplayer-can-halo-campaign-evolved-really-bring-players-back-together/"><strong>Halo</strong></a> back in the days of the original Xbox, as <em>Marathon</em> will be putting the power of the system to some interesting use.</p>



<p>In the game's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/"><strong>landing page on the PlayStation Official Website</strong></a>, it is confirmed that the extraction shooter will be a PS5 Pro Enhanced title. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"PS5 Pro Enhanced PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) blends 5K internal rendering into a clean, stable 4K image so your Runner’s view stays sharp, even when the action gets hectic,"</em> the dedicated box on the website reads.</p>



<p>Barring a potential mistake, this would make <em>Marathon</em> the first P<strong>layStation 5 Pro Enhanced competitive title that renders internally at 5K resolution</strong>. Although this isn't really surprising, considering the power of the Sony console and how the game doesn't seem to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-reveals-mild-marathon-pc-system-requirements/">extremely demanding</a></strong>, it may have made more sense to tout how the <strong>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution would deliver a 4K resolution output with 120 FPS support</strong>, which would definitely be preferable for a shooter than the sharpest image quality., </p>



<p>Hopefully, the system will still be able to deliver the high-framerate <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">gameplay experience that is perfect for a game such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Marathon</em>, possibly with the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">new version of PlaySt</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ation Spectral Super Resolution,&nbsp;</strong>which will reportedly be available by March 2026. What is colloquially known as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-higher-quality-proper-4k-120-fps/">PSSR 2.0</a></strong> is said to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-0-is-allegedly-launching-between-january-and-march-delivering-higher-resolution-for-classic-games/">significantly boost </a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-0-is-allegedly-launching-between-january-and-march-delivering-higher-resolution-for-classic-games/"><strong>performance</strong></a>, which would definitely help a game rendering at a high internal resolution achieve higher framerates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has officially announced a new <em>Life Is Strange </em>game, <em>Life Is Strange: Reunion</em>, and it will (as the name suggests) reunite Chloe and Max when it launches in just a couple of months.</p><p>Ahead of a livestream, Xbox officially unveiled the name, direction, and release date for <em>Life Is Strange: Reunion </em>in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Wire blog post</a>. It's coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S (and, presumably, other platforms) on March 26th.</p><p>The goal, according to the <em>Life Is Strange </em>team, is to give Chloe and Max "the ending they deserve" and to provide a "thrilling finale" to the stories of both characters in a reunion "thought impossible". Be aware that spoilers for <em>Life Is Strange </em>and its sequels may follow.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're wondering how Chloe was able to return after the events of the original <em>Life Is Strange</em>, well, the team says it "may be due to Max's power", making reference to the conclusion of 2024's episodic<em> Double Exposure</em>, in which Max merged parallel timelines and recovered her Rewind ability.</p><p>Chloe, however, is "no prize to be won", as the <em>Life Is Strange </em>folks say; she's her own woman, which is why she'll be the co-protagonist of this game alongside Max.</p><p>They'll be trying to find their way back to each other over the course of <em>Reunion</em>, each offering "alternating views of the world" and "different-but-complementary perspectives" on the events of the story.</p><p>Once again, Max is able to rewind time, a power she'll be using to both escape and get herself into some pretty tricky situations. Chloe's Backtalk ability returns, too, allowing her to smart-talk her conversation partners.</p><figure role="group">
