		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for May 2025 have been announced and it’s a pretty good month, featuring tons of dinosaurs, a great boomer shooter, and the Poker-inspired card dealing phenomenon that is Balatro.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus May 2025 games?</span></p>


<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 6th May – no kidding – and they will be available until 2nd June.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> | PS5</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> | PS5, PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/balatro">Balatro</a> | PS5, PS4</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Considering that it’s a celebrated Game of the Year contender and nominee from last year, Balatro is likely the biggest included here. The game is a roguelike that takes inspiration from Poker hands, asking you to play card combos in order to generate high scores, while collecting Joker cards that add multipliers, boosters and other effects as you play. It’s hugely addictive and was <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/19/game-of-the-year-2024-best-independent/">an easy winner for our Best Independent Game award in 2024</a>. </strong>Through 2025, it’s reached even more people as more awards have rolled in, and that attention has led to some interesting collaborations with much bigger budget games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Balatro - Short Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9agt18c_V1U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>An then there’s Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun. Before Space Marine 2 dropped into our laps last year, this was probably up there as the latest and greatest 40K shooter, leaning into the “Boomer Shooter” fad with retro graphics and retro FPS gameplay to match. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">our Boltgun review</a>, Dom said, “The commitment to ‘the bit’ means that Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun stays true to its old-school shooter roots, with very little signposting, apart from the occasional spot of yellow marking to show you can climb up through an area. Otherwise, you’re left to your own devices. The same goes for storytelling, which extends to your servitor’s asides, short loading screen introductions to each area and the occasional cutscene. It doesn’t hurt it, but there were times where I yearned for a little more explanation.”</p>


<p>Rounding out this month’s selection is Ark: Survival Ascended, the current gen revamp of Ark: Survival Evolved within Unreal Engine 5. This remaster fully implements Unreal Engine’s Lumen lighting, Nanite mesh rendering, and all the other new technologies, while Studio Wildcard has gradually reimplemented all of the DLC maps from the original game over the course of the last year and a half – it’s still in Early Access with the final map planned for release in October. It hasn’t had the smoothest launch or reception, but the game has an enduring popularity regardless. Dinos, am I right?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the April 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 5th May March to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10003485">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10002719">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a> | PS5, PS4</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0700-CUSA09923_00-DSHACKERSMEMORY1/"><strong>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory</strong></a><strong> | PS4&nbsp;</strong></li>

		<p>Evil Dead: The Game is being delisted from digital storefronts, Saber Interactive has announced. The statement the company has released follows the disappearance of the game from the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/evil-dead-the-game/">PlayStation Store,</a> among others. Those who own the game will not need to worry about servers being shut down, as it has been made clear that the servers for Evil Dead: The Game will remain online.</p>
<p><iframe title="Evil Dead: The Game - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LiZqKiamYSs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement on Steam, Saber Interactive said, <em>“We can confirm we’ve begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts. Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone. We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support.”</em></p>
<p>The delisting of Evil Dead: The Game comes just shy of three years from the game’s launch date of May 13th, 2022, when it released for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. The game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game where four players face off against a number of villains controlled by another player. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/16/evil-dead-the-game-review/">Evil Dead: The Game Review</a>, Jim said, <em>“Evil Dead fans will love the amount of fan service on offer here, from the painstaking recreation of movie locations to Bruce Campbell’s goofy one-liners. However, when it comes to raw entertainment value, there’s an imbalance between the forces of good and evil. Playing as the survivors can be fun with friends but lacks the fun or variety of being an evildoer.”</em></p>

			<p>EA studio Codemasters had two major announcements for players, one to do with the WRC and DiRT games, and the other with <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-announced-for-may-30-launch-pc-requirements-released/">F1 25</a>.</p>
<p>F1 25 fans get the 'good news' end of the deal, with Codemasters showing off the first gameplay for F1 25, highlighting the reversed tracks, the improvements players will enjoy in F1 25 due to <span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">LIDAR scanning</span>, and all the little details in these tracks being rebuilt to really add that extra layer of realism for players keen to jump behind the wheel.</p>
<p>WRC and DiRT fans aren't as lucky, with the confirmation that the 2024 season expansion for EA Sports WRC 2023 is the last expansion from the team, and Codemasters is officially pausing development on future rally racing titles.</p>
<p>"<em>After releasing EA SPORTS WRC in 2023, the 2024 season, including the recently released Hard Chargers Content pack, will be our last expansion. For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles. Rest assured, EA SPORTS WRC will continue to be available for existing and new players,</em>" Codemasters wrote in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc-24/news/wrc-development-update">blog post</a> on the EA Sports WRC website.</p>
<p>"<em>Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and DiRT. We've provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge...Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey.</em>"</p>
<p>Back to F1 25, the new gameplay trailer showcases four of the five updated circuits and digs into the improvements made in this iteration.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The tech behind LIDAR gives players unprecedented levels of detail, bringing them closer to each race weekend,</span></em>" creative director at Codemasters Gavin Cooper said in a press release. "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Also, we’ve carefully selected the three reverse circuits to provide a unique and engaging experience for our players that feels polished, authentic, and fun. The process includes reworking DRS zones, retraining AI, recalibrating sector boundaries, repositioning the starting grid and pit lanes, and more, delivering new thrills and</span></em> <em>challenges</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 First Look at Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/smwFJlL9wCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>F1 25 will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC this coming May 30, 2025.</p>

Ding ding, it is AI-slop-alypse-O-Clock. Time for another helping of doom-ridden commentary upon the technologies that are busily scraping and remaking all the wit, lore and gibberish accumulated over 30 blessed years of the internet. Here's a cut from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDZYR0gEsfg">a Mustard Plays interview</a> with Fortnite product management director Dan Walsh, in which he comments upon the issue of Fortnite players using latter-day generative AI tools to conjure up thumbnail images for their profiles. 
</p>
<p>
While Epic aren't, Walsh says, about to use any genAI when creating their own assets such as character models for Fortnite, they don't really care if players do, as long as the resulting images don't break any rules around graphic violence or similar. Beyond that, Walsh argues that generated images are becoming so tricky to spot that the idea of banning their usage in a game like Fortnite is impractical. Hmmm.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Here's the quote in full, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-wont-police-ai-generated-thumbnail-images-and-epic-games-says-detecting-them-will-likely-become-impossible">Eurogamer</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
 "From our perspective, for moderation, thumbnails - like, we don't really care what tool you use to make your thumbnails. All we care about is whether or not it's compliant with our rules. I think to some degree AI is going to become more and more difficult to detect. It's not going to stand out as a unique thing, it's just going to be another tool that people are using to create things. So trying to look for that specifically is going to become increasingly difficult to the point where it's probably going to become unenforceable. We're really just focused on - 'does this asset comply with our rules, yes or no?', not 'what tool did you use to make this asset'?" 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It's perhaps focussing on the trees, not the wood, but I'm struck by Walsh's suggestion that genAI stuff at large is becoming impossible to detect, inasmuch as it rests on the idea that genAI art currently looks a certain way, that genAI is a kind of artstyle with specific hallmarks. In amongst all the gloom of the genAI industry's impact at the level of livelihoods, energy consumption and conceptions of creativity or culture, I find it endlessly interesting to grapple with what, right now, is considered a symptom or stigma of AI generation. 
</p>
<p>
The obvious signs are outright errors - characters having too many fingers, or objects with reversed proportions. There's also a bottomless seam of syrupy or sparkly genAI material that is evidently born of the understanding that "artistic" means expensive-looking. The goalposts move continually, however, and I do worry that certain creative works are getting misidentified in the urgency to identify the regurgitations. 
</p>
<p>
Works of photorealism, for example, a tradition now heavily associated with fancy computing technology. Or simply projects that wear their inspirations so openly and honestly that they can be falsely interpreted as automatic pastiche. I'm uneasy about the association of genAI with obvious errors - there are plenty of digital artists who make deliberate usage of incorrectness, blemishes, and uncanny disorder. There are plenty of artists who work with more "innocent" forms of generation. Experimental art in general is at risk of being mislabelled because it is supposed to seem counterintuitive, or perverse. 
</p>
<p>
To care about art in the current era of vociferously oversold generated art is to be lumbered with the maintenance of a personal Turing Test methodology that must be continually updated as the genAI tools themselves change. Inasmuch as there's anything positive or "fun" about having billion-dollar image-scramblers dumped on us by a collection of big corporations in need of double-digit growth, it's being obliged to engage more closely with all sorts of artistic traditions, so as to sort the human-crafted stuff from the bot fabulations.</p>
<p>Anyway, this probably should have been a proper editorial. I started writing a news piece and got carried away. It happens! What do you look for when you're trying to identify a piece of AI-generated art? Do you think that certain image generation tools have particular visual hallmarks?

Then, he went on to shout out another current RPG in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. "Even after you finish Expedition 33, this Japanese cult game will still be here, waiting for you!" <a href="https://x.com/kazkodaka/status/1916525336373952567" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Kodaka.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He went on to praise Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in a follow-up post, drawing a comparison between the two games' unique takes on their respective genres. "Expedition 33 is an amazing tribute to classic JRPG, while Hundred Line is a cult Japanese VN &amp; SRPG," said Kodaka. "Hundred Line has its own unique charm too, so why not play!!!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sandfall Interactive seemed to notice the shout-outs, and the official Expedition 33 account <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1917500503627555303" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a message</a> from creative director Guillaume Broche:</p><blockquote>"After your Expedition, check out The Hundred Line, another great turn-based RPG that was also released last week, and made with love by an awesome team.

Over 18,000 released on Steam last year alone. By any metric, that's a baffling number, and even games with newsworthy creators may struggle to reach audiences in the massive flood of new things to play. Factor in ever-evolving live-service games and their content update schedules, and everything, everywhere is fighting for your time and attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In light of that, it's heartwarming to not only see two creators acknowledging and promoting each others' games, but encouraging fans to go play them afterwards.

The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is also out now, for PC and Nintendo Switch. If you're close to finishing one, it sounds like you might want to check out the other, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Two mobile games were released simultaneously, <em>Cube Escape: The Lake</em> and <em>Cube Escape: Seasons</em>. Each, at first glance, appeared to be part of the current trend for both digital and real-world escape room games, in which you solved puzzles to set yourself free from some kind of intricately locked enclosure. But very quickly it became apparent that this was something <em>different</em>. Rusty Lake is not the sort of place from which anyone escapes. And ten years later, with a brand new game to celebrate, we’re still trapped within its Lynchian aberrations.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196086" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196086,196663,196345" data-current="196086"><div><p>The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21614.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Ten years and an extraordinary 18 games, one film, and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rustylakeuntold.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rustylakeuntold.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">table-top RPG</a></span> later, people are still trying to piece together the mysteries of Rusty Lake, the various buildings in the very small town (the Cabin, the Chapel, a Cave, a Mill, the Vanderboom home, and of course the Hotel), and the unsettling figures who appear throughout its history like Mr Crow and Mr Owl. We know the Lake needs our memories, and we know that once the negative ones are extracted from people—in the form of black cubes—they become Corrupted Souls. And we know there’s a damned weird obsession with shrimps. But the real joy of <em>Rusty Lake</em> is that, as with the David Lynch films that heavily inspired it, we also know complete, coherent answers will always be just out of reach.</p><figure id="" data-id="706a308e894d1480bf015c30b9ab972f" data-recommend-id="image://706a308e894d1480bf015c30b9ab972f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character holds eyeballs up in front of her eyeballs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character holds eyeballs up in front of her eyeballs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rusty Lake / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="706a308e894d1480bf015c30b9ab972f" data-recommend-id="image://706a308e894d1480bf015c30b9ab972f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character holds eyeballs up in front of her eyeballs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Earlier this year, with the 10th anniversary looming, I thought it would be a good time to replay every game in the series, in release order, to try to get myself on top of what these games are about. I’m genuinely delighted to report that at the end of this process, from <em>Cube Escape: The Lake</em> through to <em>Underground Blossom</em>, and indeed the shadow-dropped-as-this-post-goes-live <em>The Mr. Rabbit Magic Show</em>, I’m none the wiser. I can tell you these are games about burdened families, dark secrets passed through generations, and a lake with an insatiable desire for memories, but the “why” and the “how” fade into irrelevance in the shadow of such an incredible atmosphere of haunting malevolence, and a permanent wicked glint in the series’ eye.</p><p>On a more pragmatic level, these are games created in that modern, touchscreen-driven style of a point-and-click puzzle game. You explore locations, gather items for your inventory, and listen to the peculiar utterings of the inhabitants, attempting to solve puzzles that usually end up pointing toward the appearance of mystical cubes. But rather than the genre’s usual predictable results, in a <em>Rusty Lake</em> game you’re far more likely to discover that using the hammer on the nail causes a crack in a wall to unveil a fish, which when used on the right character will cause them to die, falling to the ground with their mouth open, into which you then travel to discover an impossible chamber within their body. There’s one game in which you slice off a man’s nipple in order to travel into the bizarre realm hidden behind it.</p><p>Yet despite this overtly surreal approach, the <em>Rusty Lake</em> games maintain a sense of order, a notion that—even if you can never quite grasp their wraith-like tendrils—there <em>is</em> an internal coherence here. (The wonderful Mike Fahey (RIP) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rusty-lake-paradise-is-my-kind-of-creepy-1822134955&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rusty-lake-paradise-is-my-kind-of-creepy-1822134955">wrote about that aspect here</a></span>.) In the same way as  Lynch’s <em>Lost Highway</em> confidently casts a dream-like spell on you such that you understand why watching a video of a man murdering his wife would mean the same events now have to have happened in reality, these peculiar games sweep you up in their own internal rationale.</p><figure id="" data-id="4427e57539f58c6f700dada6c650efa8" data-recommend-id="image://4427e57539f58c6f700dada6c650efa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2177" data-height="1225" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A corrupted soul appears in front of a crowd of humanoid animals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A corrupted soul appears in front of a crowd of humanoid animals." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rusty Lake / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4427e57539f58c6f700dada6c650efa8" data-recommend-id="image://4427e57539f58c6f700dada6c650efa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2177" data-height="1225" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A corrupted soul appears in front of a crowd of humanoid animals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Over the years I’ve been covering the series, I’ve commented that <em>Rusty Lake</em>’s weakness is that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusty-lake-paradise-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusty-lake-paradise-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it wears its Lynch influences too clearly on its sleeve</a></span>. Sharing an interest in the inherent spookiness of owls is one thing; writing “THE OWLS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM” on a wall in <em>Rusty Lake Paradise</em> was pushing it too far. But, importantly, the series has established so many of its own distinctive themes that crop up throughout, giving that sense of timelessness to a collection of games that can be set a hundred years apart.</p><p>So in the end, it’s really rather incredibly lovely that the new game, surprise-released today, features a small, lovely tribute to the late filmmaker. And fittingly, it’s hidden outside of the game within the game...Yeah, it’s appropriately strange.</p><figure id="" data-id="35dd6ed7e07e2743790abf0450d0f8b0" data-recommend-id="image://35dd6ed7e07e2743790abf0450d0f8b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2543" data-height="1431" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr Rabbit has had his arm bitten off by a tiger." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mr Rabbit has had his arm bitten off by a tiger." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rusty Lake / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="35dd6ed7e07e2743790abf0450d0f8b0" data-recommend-id="image://35dd6ed7e07e2743790abf0450d0f8b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2543" data-height="1431" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr Rabbit has had his arm bitten off by a tiger." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Mr. Rabbit Magic Show</em> is seemingly a game dedicated to the rabbit-headed character who first appeared in <em>Rusty Lake Hotel</em>, and indeed is served as the game’s second dinner. (Seriously, you have to play it.) It’s presented as a series of mini-puzzles, a stage show being put on by the magician rabbit, in which you must arrange objects and colors or successfully sproing baby rabbits from a top hat such that they land in another hat on the floor (rather than miss and land in a bloody splat), in order to bring on the next scene. And honestly, as I was playing, I was thinking—hmmm, this isn’t quite it. But the game knew that, and then a whole bunch of other stuff happens, and it’s yours to discover.</p><p>But it’s safe to say it’s a fittingly unnerving celebration of ten years of these  unnerving games, deliberately indulgent, and packed with fun callbacks to the series. It’s going to be fun to discover if it’s ever considered canon, but since Mr. Rabbit has been haunting the Lake in his altogether more unpleasant form since 1894, we have to assume that his magic act took place before he arrived in the Hotel, so pre-1893.</p><figure id="" data-id="c16e280720ed39f68b5181dcd268069d" data-recommend-id="image://c16e280720ed39f68b5181dcd268069d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2541" data-height="1430" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error message pops up in front of Mr Rabbit on stage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An error message pops up in front of Mr Rabbit on stage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rusty Lake / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c16e280720ed39f68b5181dcd268069d" data-recommend-id="image://c16e280720ed39f68b5181dcd268069d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2541" data-height="1430" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error message pops up in front of Mr Rabbit on stage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What’s so fun here is <em>Magic Show</em> allows the developers to let their usual sly winks come to the forefront, break the frame a little, and make sure you know that they know that you know they’re playing you. In fact, despite ostensibly having finished it, I’m still plugging away at a few remaining—extremely difficult—puzzles, to try to find every Easter egg hidden within.</p><p>And, at the same time, there’s also a new short film—<em>The Intern—</em>to complement the new game! It’s 10 minutes long, and has the developers wonderfully spoofing themselves as an intern tries to publish <em>Mr. Rabbit</em>, but discovers the Rusty Lake office is as much of a series of weird puzzles as the games they make.</p><p>If you want to get started with the <em>Rusty Lake</em> games, there’s no better place to begin than the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rustylake.com/room-escape-games/cube-escape-collection.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rustylake.com/room-escape-games/cube-escape-collection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cube Escape </em>Collection</a></span>. Because those original games were made in Flash, and Flash is no more, they’ve been remade in a modern engine, and re-released in one package which—ludicrously—only costs $5 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.RustyLake.CubeEscapeCollection&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.RustyLake.CubeEscapeCollection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Steam</a></span>, and is a free download on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cube-escape-collection/id1555267021&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cube-escape-collection/id1555267021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.RustyLake.CubeEscapeCollection&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.RustyLake.CubeEscapeCollection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a></span>, with similarly priced in-app purchases to unlock the all nine games.</p><p>Beyond the <em>Cube Escape</em> series, there are what seem to be known as the “Premium Games,” all of which are included in Steam’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/3669/Rusty_Lake_Bundle/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/3669/Rusty_Lake_Bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rusty Lake </em>Bundle</a></span> alongside the <em>Cube Escape</em> Collection and the separately released <em>Cube Escape: Paradox</em>. The latter is something quite extraordinary—a two part game that’s emboldened by a live-action short film. You can also watch that film for free via Steam, or indeed on YouTube, immediately below.</p><p>Of those premium games, not all have “Rusty Lake” in the name. So make sure not to miss <em>The White Door</em> (an incredible  story of a man trapped in an asylum), <em>Underground Blossom</em> (the most recent full game, entirely set on a train platform), and 2022's <em>The Past Within</em>, a co-op puzzle game set in the <em>Rusty Lake</em> universe in which each player sees a completely different version of the game, requiring you to coordinate to solve its puzzles. (And don’t forget the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281800/Samsara_Room/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281800/Samsara_Room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remastered <em>Samsara Room</em></a></span>, a game originally released in 2013 before <em>Rusty Lake</em>, but very much in the same universe.) They’re all on Steam and mobile, and personally, I prefer to play them as mobile games, ideally on a good-sized tablet.</p><p>I have so much fondness for this series, and am constantly impressed by the lengths to which the Dutch developers have gone to innovate within their deranged little world. I love how chilling it can feel, despite being a cartoonish series filled with tongue-in-cheek goriness. I love that every time I see a Corrupted Soul, no matter how much they appear in every game, I get the shivers. I also love how many questions I have, and how much I don’t want them answered. Congrats on ten years, Rusty Lake, now please make me many more games.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In advance of the Switch 2's planned June launch, Nintendo has <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current">released a system update</a> for the original Switch that, among other things, activates <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">the company's new Virtual Game Card system</a> for sharing digital downloads. But Switch owners are finding that this new sharing system is a bit more limiting when it comes to sharing a single digital purchase for online play across multiple consoles.</p>
<p>For those who missed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">Nintendo's March announcement of the Virtual Game Card system</a>, the new setup allows players to easily "unload" a digital game license from one Switch (or Switch 2) console and "load" it onto another console connected to the same Nintendo Account (or <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28815/~/what-is-a-nintendo-account-family-group%3F">one in the same family group</a>). An Internet connection is required for the initial loading and unloading process, but after that, the system with the Virtual Game Card can play the downloaded game completely offline.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to constantly load and unload their virtual games between systems, Nintendo also offers an "Online License" feature deep in the Switch's system menu. When this feature is turned on, if you load a digital game without a Virtual Game Card present, the Switch will perform an online check to confirm that your Nintendo Account actually has access to that game. Nintendo recommends this feature for players who want to share games across three or more Switch units.</p>
<h2>Forget the old ways</h2>
<p>Both the Virtual Game Cards and the Online License feature represent a significant change from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/how-do-you-manage-software-and-saves-on-a-second-switch-its-complicated/">Nintendo's previous system</a> for managing digital games across multiple Switch units. Under that now-defunct setup, any number of users on a Switch designated as the "primary" console could play digital games without the need for an online check-in. Only users on any number of "secondary" consoles would need online access to confirm ownership when a game was launched.</p>

          </p>

<p>While that old system could be cumbersome to set up, it actually allowed for quite a bit of flexibility when it came to game sharing. As Nintendo noted on its official FAQ <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/47524/~/how-to-play-your-games-across-multiple-nintendo-switch-systems">as recently as last week</a>, two users could play a single digital game purchase <em>at the same time</em>, as long as the Nintendo Account that purchased the game was playing on the secondary console (with an active Internet connection).</p>
<p>But Nintendo's FAQ explanation for "how to play the same digital game at the same time with different Nintendo accounts" has been removed from <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/47524/~/how-to-play-your-games-across-multiple-nintendo-switch-systems">the current version of Nintendo's Switch digital game sharing FAQ</a>. In its place is a link to <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891">a new page detailing the Virtual Game Card system</a>. While the new FAQ also discusses the Online License feature for sharing games "even if you don't have a virtual game card loaded," there is no longer any discussion of how to access a single digital game on two consoles <em>simultaneously</em>.</p>
<p>Ars' own testing confirms that trying to load a digital game while another Switch is actively playing <em>the same game</em> results in <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/41190">a "play is being suspended" error</a> on one console. This seems to be true even if one console has a loaded Virtual Game Card for the game being played and even if the consoles use different Nintendo Accounts from the same family group.</p>
<p>Players can simultaneously play <em>different</em> games from the same digital library on two different Switch systems, but only if at least one of those games is on a loaded Virtual Game Card.</p>

<h2>A partial workaround</h2>
<p>Players who want to play a single digital game purchased across multiple Switch consoles simultaneously can still use a partial workaround. A Switch console with a Virtual Game Card currently loaded should be set to Airplane mode (or have Wi-Fi disabled), and the user's Online License feature should be enabled for the game's original purchaser. The first system will still be able to play that Virtual Game Card offline, while the Online License feature will allow the same game to be played at the same time on a second system.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>The major drawback of this workaround, of course, is that one Switch has to be completely offline for it to work. That means two players wanting to share a single digital copy of <em>Mario Kart 8</em> for an online race won't be able to do so, for instance. It also means <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/mario-kart-8-deluxes-new-expansion-is-good-so-far-but-is-it-worth-25/">certain DLC tied to a Switch Online subscription</a> won't be loadable on the offline system.</p>

<p>In a way, it's a bit surprising that Nintendo took this long to close what can be seen as a convenient loophole in its digital game sharing system. After all, players who buy a single copy of a physical game can't simultaneously play that game on two separate consoles. The fact that Switch owners <em>could</em> do that with digital games until now was something of an officially acknowledged bonus for players who opted for downloadable games.</p>
<p>With the impending launch of the Switch 2, though, Nintendo seems intent on making sure that each player owns their own copy of a game when playing together online (with the minor exception of the few games that use <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/gameshare/?srsltid=AfmBOoph7oDqGjKTQ_gWuqNAdKkI1O49rvPlVKC_K6kYQrupbFaYmHaZ">Nintendo's GameShare system</a>). As Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/will-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-become-gamings-new-normal/">starts asking $80 for a single copy of <em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, that closed loophole could end up being costly for some multi-Switch households.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has outlined the Year One roadmap for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which will kick off in May with several big new features being added to the game. In a dev diary, Ubisoft confirmed that early May will see new story content added to the game--focusing on Portuguese scholar Luis Frois--alongside a new ally, abilities, and quality-of-life updates.</p><p>Late May will see a major upgrade made to the parkour gameplay, as Naoe will be able to wall-vault and grab a low ledge, plus she'll have a few other new moves at her disposal. This includes height-gaining back-eject and fully reanimated height-gaining side-eject moves.</p><p>Another nice upgrade coming at the end of May will be an enhanced photo mode, as you'll be able to make Yasuke or Naoe strike a pose before you take a photo. Ubisoft is also teasing special collaborations in late May, but it remains to be seen who you'll meet in your trek across Japan. Moving ahead to June, you can expect more story content, a fresh face joining your league, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-developers-are-considering-an-even-tougher-difficulty-option/1100-6530486/">and a new difficulty mode</a> that Ubisoft had previously teased.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LLB-WNvQEQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1LLB-WNvQEQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game will also be updated with more immersion options--like turning off the outline that appears on a character when they enter stealth--optional headgear in cutscenes, and the alarm system from castles will be applied to the entire game world. Beyond that, Ubisoft is working on lots more additional content, like New Game Plus mode, more codex updates, new Animus content, and the Claws of Awaji expansion. This will still be free to anyone who preordered the game, and it adds a new island to explore and a bo staff weapon category for Naoe to master.</p><p>Ubisoft has been steadily working on Assassin's Creed Shadows since it launched in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-patch-adds-quality-of-life-updates-and-ps5-pro-upgrades-this-week/1100-6530661/">with major title updates adding PS5 Pro upgrades</a>, an auto-follow option for players when they're on horseback, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-assassins-creed-shadows-update-fixes-more-bugs-and-ps5-pro-graphical-issues/1100-6530897/">and bug fixes</a>.

            <p>
Game of Thrones the TV show might have farted out of existence with a dribble, but that doesn't appear to be of much concern to the beancounters; Game of Thrones: Kingsroad - the free-to-play action-RPG from South Korean developer Netmarble that's looking to reanimate the HBO series' corpse - is leaving paid early access and launching for PC and mobile on 21st May.
</p>
<p>
Game of Thrones: Kingsroad promises to take players on a "truly immersive journey" through the TV series' version of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, taking in some familiar sights - from the northern Wall's Castle Back to King's Landing, Highgarden, and beyond - as they freely roam an open world of "vivid landscapes, massive cities, backwater towns, untamed wilderness, and the uncompromising lives of the people that inhabit them."
</p>
<p>
Players start their adventure as an illegitimate child from a small noble house in the North who, following the death of their brothers, sets out to "solidify [their] political position, navigate the complex power struggles between the noble houses of Westeros, and seek out... allies" - all while preparing for the White Walkers' arrival. It's got classes (players can adopt the role of either Knight, Sellsword, or Assassin), co-op, and familiar series characters too.

<p>
Game of Thrones: Kingsroad launched into paid early access in March and it's garnered plenty of criticism on Steam since then - and not just because playing it is bringing back terrible flashbacks of show's tumble from grace. Most of the complaints - it's currently sitting at a "mixed" rating on Steam - revolve around Kingsroad's monetisation, with players lambasting its "filthy microtransactions", and calling it "greedy", a "money grab", and "like a mobile game on steroids", with talk of $20 dollar battle passes, $15 subscriptions, paid progression, and more.
</p>
<p>
Still, if you fancy doing a little wave at Jon Snow, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be available for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-e19c7c">Epic,</a> and the Windows Store when it gets its full free-to-play launch on 21st May. And if you'd prefer to play on mobile (cross-saves are supported), you can also pick it up on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-kingsroad/id6483917232">iOS App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netmarble.got">Android Google Play Store</a>. If nothing else, it's one way to pass the time waiting for George R. R. Martin to finish up The Winds of Winter.

            <p>
In another sign of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and Disney cosying up under the covers, you can now unlock a free First Order Stormtrooper skin by linking your MyDisney account to the game. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't your Disney+ account, to be clear, and there's no need to be subscribed elsewhere. And it provides another sign-in option for Fortnite, just like when the game added Lego account sign-ins as an option previously.
</p>
<p>
The likely intended benefit of this freebie is that Fortnite itself is now being flooded by players showing off their new Stormtrooper skin, setting the vibe for the game's impending Star Wars season that's set to take over later this week and run until early June. 
</p>
<p>
The next battle pass will feature Emperor Palpatine, Poe Dameron and General Grievous, as well as Chewbacca-styled Cuddle Team Leader and a Sith/Jedi remix of Evie. There's no sign of Darth Jar Jar here, so my guess would be you'll need to stump up for him separately via the in-game shop.
</p>
<p>
As well as all that, Fortnite will be hosting an early watch party and premiere of the first two episodes of the next Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld season from 2nd May, before their arrival on Disney+. If you're a fan of Asajj Ventress from The Clone Wars and The Bad Batch, you should probably tune in. (And if you do, you'll unlock a free Asajj Ventress loading screen.)
</p>

			<p>PS Plus subscribers will add <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/">Balatro</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-boltgun-old-school-fps-2023/">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> to their libraries for May 2025.</p>
<p>PS Plus subscribers on every tier, including the base-level Essential tier, will be able to add these games to their libraries beginning <strong>May 6, 2025</strong>, a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-may-ark-survival-ascended-balatro-warhammer-40000-boltgun/">PlayStation Blog</a> announced. The final day to grab the games for April 2025, which are RoboCop: Rogue City, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory, is <strong>May 5, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>It's a pretty strong month overall for PlayStation Plus subscribers, who can at least look forward to trying these games after the most recent PS Plus news. Sony recently confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">over 20 games would exit</a> the game catalogs for PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium subscribers, including first-party titles like the first two Resistance games. Neither of which are playable on PS5, except through the PS Plus Premium classic's game catalog.</p>
<p>Removing first-party titles from its own subscription service isn't anything new for PlayStation, but it did feel even more egregious since this happened after the latest price hike for the service in over 20 countries. The United States has been left out for now, but Canada, Australia, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Colombia, Chile, and others are all already dealing with the higher prices.</p>
<p>Other notable games exiting soon are Grand Theft Auto V, Ghostrunner, and Infamous: Second Son, which is another first-party title, but at least it is still playable on PS5 and PS4 without having access to it through a PS Plus subscription.</p>
<p>The three games for May 2025 will be available to grab until June 2, and by then, we'll know which games PlayStation will use to try and keep players happy for June 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-rumble-global-release-delayed-no-new-release-date-revealed.1177749/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-global-release-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that upcoming free-to-play battle royale-style party game&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, and the studio hasn't announced a new release date for the game either.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-release-date" rel="nofollow">originally due to launch</a> on May 8th, but in <a href="https://x.com/Sonic_Rumble/status/1917453885326688412" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X</a>, Sega says it's made the "difficult decision" to delay the game's release indefinitely. The studio says it wants to "build the kind of high-quality, long-lasting&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>game" its players deserve.</p>

<p>Sega says it knows the news of <i>Sonic Rumble</i>'s delay will be "disappointing" to fans, but that it thinks taking the extra time to work on the game is the "right choice for the future of&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-rumble-release-date-delayed-death-egg.jpg?itok=9oRVUmcG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-rumble-release-date-delayed-death-egg.jpg?itok=lvLlKF54 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>won't be coming in early May as originally planned.</figcaption></figure><p>Although no new release date is forthcoming at the moment, Sega says it will update fans "as soon as we get closer", so hopefully, you won't be waiting too long for a new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>release date.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>, it's a&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-esque free-to-play battle royale party game coming to PC and mobile...well, at some point in the near future, apparently.</p>

<p>The game comes with a range of modes, including a classic-style Run mode, which sees players racing against one another, as well as Ring Battle and more.</p>

<p>Sega says the game has been designed with shorter games in mind, ensuring that anyone can pick up and play&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>"in their spare time".</p>




<p>As you'd probably expect, a range of&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>characters will be available for you to play as, including Sonic himself (naturally), as well as Shadow, Tails, Amy, and many more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>when it launches at some point in the future on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2951690/Sonic_Rumble/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sega.sonicrumble&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/sonic-rumble/id6511215584" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. Hopefully, Sega will announce a new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>release date sometime soon, so stay tuned for more.</p>

Generally, for the vast majority of the game, <strong>when you step into a new area, most of the enemies will all be weak to one specific element</strong>.You’ll want to build around that.

In addition, <strong>every skill also can activate a modifier for itself depending on if particular Stains are on the board</strong>. </p><p>For example, Immolation is Lune’s bread-and-butter Fire Skill. It generates a Fire Stain, but if you have Ice Stains on the board, you do extra damage. In addition, some skills will generate a more generic Light Stain that can be used like a wild card. </p><p><strong>Watch: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/4-tips-clair-obscur-expedition-33-first-hours-1851777856&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/4-tips-clair-obscur-expedition-33-first-hours-1851777856">4 Essential Tips To Survive <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>’s Brutal First Hours</a></span></p><p>Building up useful Stains often means using a Skill that doesn’t do jack shit to the enemies in a particular area, and that’s a bigger problem as you progress and start running into enemies that outright absorb specific elements. But you’re easily 20 hours in before you have to factor that in. In the early going, it’s best just to get familiar with which Pictos to pain up to maximize weaknesses. Speaking of…</p><h2 id="h246720"><a id="synergy"></a>Recommended builds/synergy</h2><p>In the early going, Lune will be drowning in Fire-focused Pictos/Lumina, so by all means, build Pictos/Lumina around that up through the Gestral Village. Keep at least three burns on at any given time and you’ll be doing your part. The Lighterim Weapon allowing you to build up Burns without a specific skill is also going to be a huge help, especially when Maelle joins and a single burning enemy is all it takes to put her in Virtuose mode. Even later, though, Fire is gonna be your go-to element. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-how-long-to-beat-1851777481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-how-long-to-beat-1851777481">How Long Of A Journey Are You Signing Up For With <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><div><p><strong>While Ice won’t do much to damage every enemy, it does generate Stains that boost Fire attacks</strong>, and even better, <strong>Ice actually slow enemies down no matter what they’re weak to</strong>, which is a huge help when facing off against baddies fast enough to schedule two turns in a row. That also means speedsters are a damn fine excuse to get a board of four Ice Stains, then unleash Hell at your leisure. Way later, that can be very literal, but, we’re here just to get you on your way.</p><p>All this stuff does cost quite a bit of AP, though, and Lune’s base attack isn’t always able to generate enough. <strong>Energizing Attack and Dead Energy Pictos/Lumina can help</strong> with that, especially the latter since an enemy that dies from Lune casting the spell that set it on Fire still counts, giving her a nice AP bonus when you least expect it.</p></div><h2 id="h246721"><a id="skills"></a>Skills to aim for</h2><figure id="" data-id="29fc598343ac7de39c5b3ec29af509a5" data-recommend-id="image://29fc598343ac7de39c5b3ec29af509a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lune casts a spell at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lune casts a spell at an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="29fc598343ac7de39c5b3ec29af509a5" data-recommend-id="image://29fc598343ac7de39c5b3ec29af509a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lune casts a spell at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><br><strong>If there’s any one skill you want to get your hands on as soon as possible, it’s Mayhem.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shotgun-cop-man-review.1177731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shotgun-cop-man-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With your hands full of guns and a warrant for the Devil’s arrest in your pocket, Shotgun Cop Man sends you on a nonstop blitz of new ideas. This short and sweet action-platformer continually reinvents itself across 10 clever worlds, leaving little room for a good idea to get stale. Once I mastered its distinct style of projectile-based movement, barrelling through the circles of hell turned into a pure power fantasy. Even though it’s harder than it should be to chase high scores and better times, I still had a blast gunning for a more optimized run after the credits rolled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shotgun Cop Man’s goofy vibes, flashy acrobatics, and time attack setup transported me back to my middle school days of bypassing the browser security settings in the computer lab to sneak in runs of Flash games like Fancy Pants Adventures or Electricman 2. Granted, this would blow many of those study hall time killers out of the water, but I could still easily see myself racing to the end of its first world with a friend while we’re supposed to be working on a research paper or math homework. It shares the same tight scope and paired back tone, but here those mask a surprisingly deep platformer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Shotgun Cop Man isn’t just a standard run-n-gun shoot-em-up. Instead, the recoil from your shotgun serves as the driving force behind most of the movement. Need to take out some demons to your right? Well, you better make sure the coast is clear to your left when you pull the trigger. This challenging, but ultimately rewarding, system of ballistic blowback fills in for genre-standards like jumping or dashing midair, while firing your sidearm — which ranges from a satisfyingly snappy but weak pistol to a powerful gatling gun — allows you to hover midair or make more precise hops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t just spray and pray you wind up on the next platform, though. Each weapon has limited ammo, keeping Shotgun Cop Man relatively grounded: the shotgun itself only holds three shells at a time, so he needs to touch terra firma to reload. That said, sidearms tend to have bigger magazines, allowing for a reliable second option to fall back on when you need to get to the ground and take another shot at a tough jump. This restrained approach brings a levelheaded balance to Shotgun Cop Man that encourages mayhem and speed without leaving precision and skill in the dust.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Shotgun Cop Man bets big on its platforming acumen, and it pays off.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To make matters more difficult, Shotgun Cop Man also has to contend with the armies of Hell as he chases down their leader. Aside from a few combat-focused levels that blend each circle of Hell’s unique mechanics into an arena-style showdown, as well as the requisite boss that shows up at the end of each 17-level world, Shotgun Cop Man is all about movement. Because of that, enemies play second fiddle here, being treated as platforming obstacles masterfully woven into each level. They act like the bright-red explosive barrels of a 3D shooter, providing the satisfaction of popping them while offering direction on where and when to shoot. Shotgun Cop Man bets big on its platforming acumen rather than falling in-line with other action platformer successes like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/18/katana-zero-review"><u>Katana Zero</u></a>, and it pays off in spades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this unique movement takes quite some time to get used to, especially if you’re playing with a controller: Pointing in two different directions like a twin-stick shooter (left for walking, right for aiming) makes for an unnatural platformer control scheme. Wrapping my head around it felt like being asked to rub my belly and pat my head at the same time. Unfortunately, there’s really no better way to make this specific type of movement work on the sticks, though it is much more comfortable with a keyboard and mouse. Thankfully, Shotgun Cop Man’s accessibility features allow you to skip certain inputs, like making it so you pick up new sidearms automatically, so you can tweak things to be much more comfortable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was halfway through the roughly five hour campaign by the time I felt like I’d fully climbed its relatively steep learning curve, mastering this propulsion-based blend of combat and movement. Normally, this initial struggle would be a knock against it, but Shotgun Cop Man constantly introduces and innovates on new ideas while rewarding your growing mastery of them. It also sets up systems that successfully encouraged me to obsessively replay levels in an attempt to shave nanoseconds off my time. This potent blend dangles an appetizing carrot-on-a-stick to gnash at in bite-sized speedruns once you’ve found your footing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When he inevitably takes a hit, Shotgun Cop Man’s heart comically pops out of his body. Running into it will pick it up and restore health, but he’ll die in one hit without it. When that happens, the camera zooms in on his oddly detailed face as he says, “I die,” in a goofy, computerized voice. This minimal, self-aware sense of humor sets the tone overall, as there’s otherwise not much of a premise to explain here (and developer Dead Toast Entertainment even pokes fun at this in the credits by putting quotes around the word “Story”). You’re a cop with a shotgun trying to arrest the Devil. Naturally, Old Scratch doesn’t play ball. Each time our hero catches up to him, Satan tells the boy in blue to shove it, and you continue on your chase once more. It’s thin, but it works, and is just amusing enough to keep things moving.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Charlie's Favorite Action Platformers</h3><p>these are some of my favorite action platformers!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, that sense of humor eventually becomes Shotgun Cop Man’s Waterloo. Each time it zooms in on his face as he points out the obvious, it takes far too long to get back into the action. It takes as many as three button presses to respawn, and even longer to restart a level. I know how silly this sounds in the face of everything Shotgun Cop Man gets right, but in a game where you’ll be dying and trying again quite a bit, these add up to completely hamper any sense of momentum. That’s especially glaring when every level in Shotgun Cop Man grades your performance on whether or not you killed every enemy, beat the par time, took any damage, or did all three of those in the same run. In what feels like a big oversight, there’s no quick level restart button when you die, so to chase that perfect run, you need to resume the level after that death, pause, and then hit the retry option from there. Because Shotgun Cop Man trades in seconds and milliseconds (most levels took me less than a minute to complete), this otherwise small bump in the road became an outsized, unnecessary part of mastering each level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, for a game that only took me about five hours to see from end to end, Shotgun Cop Man crams in a staggeringly impressive range of innovations and spins on its seemingly simple run-and-shoot formula. It ricochets from idea to idea, never allowing a mechanic to get old — in fact, there are quite a few I wish got some more time to shine, like reactive floors, which alternate between safe and deadly each time they’re shot, or clever box-moving puzzles that put your understanding of each weapon’s power to the test. Most mechanics get a chance to shine before being woven into more new mechanics later on, but there’s also an impressive level creator (exclusive to the PC version) that lets you toy with some of these ideas yourself if you feel like your favorite didn’t get its time in the sun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not much of a level designer myself, but the creation suite provides a robust toy chest for dedicated designers to mess around with. It doesn’t just feature tools that enable you to recreate or expand upon any clever idea found in the campaign, it even includes wholly unique mechanics that aren’t found there, like extra enemy and NPC types. I didn’t get to try any user-created levels during the pre-release period, but I’m really excited to see what people think up once Shotgun Cop Man is out in the wild.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Shotgun Cop Man is a left field nostalgia trip that hits just about every shot from the volley it unloads — from its engaging, refined movement to its distinct level design ideas to its compelling time trials. That makes it all the more disappointing that it’s missing a couple of load-bearing features for any game that’s all about sanding down your runs to the last second, like a way to quickly restart from the start of a level after each death. Still, using firearms to fly through the air is a total blast, and I’m excited to get back to chasing better times and more precise runs through the underworld.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
