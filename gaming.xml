			<p>Since its humble beginning back in 1991, the Civilization series has undergone many changes, evolving into something great, much like the civilizations you control in game. Civilization 7 has evolved once more, introducing some new concepts, but simplifying the formula in many ways.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sid Meier's Civilization VII - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGOdJMNN2b0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Because of this shifting focus, Civilization 7 can feel like less of a sequel and more of a sideways set. It’s not that I dislike the way the game plays, but some of the changes are certainly jarring, and the comparison points to Civ 6 or Civ 5 are impossible not to make. As the old adage goes, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Well, Firaxis tried to fix it anyway with mixed results. From an accessibility standpoint and with the simultaneous launch on console in mind, Civ 7 is great. It’s streamlined and simplified features will be great for people getting into the series for the first time, but anyone looking for anything a bit more mechanically complex might be left wanting.</p>


<p>One of the first big changes comes in the form of how you actually pick your leader and civilization. This has now been split apart so that you pick a leader first, and then a civ for them to lord over. Your leader stays with you through to the end of your campaign, but the introduction of distinct Ages – Antiquity, Exploration &amp; Modern – will see you changing civs as time passes. Each time you move into a new one, time will skip several hundred years, and you pick from one of a bunch of new civs to lead, specific to that era, and linked in some way to your previous choice. This means at the start of the game you could be playing as Greece and by the end, the USA.</p>
<p>On one hand, in a way this is kind of cool, because it lets you be a little more customisable in the way you play with unique units, bonuses, civic trees and more. On the other hand, I found it quite jarring that I couldn’t play just one civ out till the end. To me it takes away the whole point of picking a civ in the first place. If I want to lead Spartan Greece to a scientific victory, then let me do it, dammit!</p>


<p>Each transition into a new Age acts a bit like a soft reset, although you will take with you certain traditions and other bonuses. Towards the end of each age, the world will face some form of crisis, such as a plague, which needs to be dealt with before the transition can take place. As you play, you’ll be given missions in the form of Legacy Paths, of which there are four, Culture, Military, Science and Economic. Completing objectives within these paths grants you Legacy Points which you can spend on special boons at the start of the next era. In the Modern Age, each Legacy Path then leads to a victory condition.</p>
<p>What this new system does is break things up quite nicely. Games of Civ are often long affairs and the 4X genre has often struggled with an endgame grind, but this three act structure helps with the pacing. It also means that you’re never truly out of the race, as everyone starts on an even keel when a new age begins.</p>
<p>Each era also introduces new game mechanics, such as religion in the Exploration Age, and ideologies such as fascism, democracy, and communism in the Modern Age. They also march technology forward, so those hoping to charge a mass of Hoplites toward a Panzer Tank will be disappointed. You can always return to the classics to relive this age old Civ meme, but that kind of quirky playfulness is missed.</p>

<p>Overall, the Age system does a lot to freshen up the formula and make games a little more fair, but the end game of the Modern Era feels a little lacklustre. The two prior eras have a lot of focus whereas Modern just feels a bit off. There’s no World Congress anymore, which is a massive shame, and the era itself just feels a little bloated and lacking in excitement.</p>
<p>Citizen management and growth has also taken a new turn, with you no longer being able to assign your best and brightest to work specific tiles for bonuses. Now, each city has slottable resources which are picked up when you expand to new tiles as your city grows. Food is generated every turn, and once you reach a specified number of food, you can expand your city to new tiles and immediately put those new folk to work. If a tile you expanded to has a resource, then you can slot that into your city and gain its bonus. This is a pretty versatile system, as any resources gained can be slotted in any city or town where there is space. After a while, having to slot dozens of resources and moving them about can get a bit tiresome, making me appreciate the old methods all the more. This also means that builders and workers have been done away with, and this reduced unit clutter is very welcome.</p>

<p>Diplomacy in Civ 7 also feels less engaging. In previous games, I really felt like I was hashing things out with other leaders, as they would approach me, telling me how much they disapproved of the pillaging of the small village. Now, the leaders seem to have no real identity, with each interaction feeling very transactional. Clicking on each leader takes you to the diplomacy screen where you can spend Influence – a new yield introduced in Civ 7 – to choose certain actions, such as, establishing a trade route or proposing some good old fashion join science research. You can also spend your influence to block denouncements or even perform a little espionage. It’s all good on the surface, showing that the more influential you are, the more people will like you, but it feels a little soulless. I felt that no matter what I did, the numbers would always stack against me. Xerses would always hate me, and my attempts to nullify that hate ultimately didn’t matter. I would keep spending influence to balance the books without any real conversation taking place. The leaders don’t even look at you anymore, just sideways to the on screen avatar of your leader.</p>
<p>The inability to bargain properly with these other nations is also jarring. You used to be able to negotiate yourself a lucrative deal, getting resources you need in exchange for peace, but now, with resources being shared via trade routes, it all felt a little pointless. You can still demand cities in peace treaties though, so there’s that.</p>
<p>Another major change is the way religion works, with the entire process being stripped back. You can still send Missionaries to other cities to convert their masses, and even when you convert them, religion doesn’t spread, and you don’t get any diplomatic benefit from it. You don’t even get Inquisitors any more entering hold combat which is a real shame. The mechanic was introduced twenty years ago, so to see it relegated now fills me with sadness.</p>
<p>I know it feels like I’ve been nothing but negative towards Civ 7, but it really isn’t a bad game, it’s just not as good as its predecessors yet. I still lost countless hours to it while playing and there have been some clear improvements in many areas. Games do have a good pacing to them thanks to the era system and combat has been tidied up.</p>

<p>The UI could do with a bit of an overhaul though, and Firaxis has already stated this is a priority for them to address. Some parts are just not as intuitive as in previous entries and I often spent way too long looking for what I needed. This could be down to unifying development across both PC and consoles, simplifying the experience for pad players, but it’s detracted form the game with keyboard and mouse.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-plans-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yves Guillemot has stated that Ubisoft plans to focus on Open World Action-Adventure games and live service games year-on-year. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-says-the-plan-is-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games-year-after-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Originally posted by VGC</a>, Guillemot went on to confirm that the company's way of getting out of hot water was to continue exactly the way it has been. This information game during a Q&amp;A that followed after the company's financial results for Q3 of the 2024-25 financial year.&nbsp;In this presentation, a caller asked if the executives could provide more information on what the development pipeline looks like for the future.</p>
<p>In response to this, CEO Yves Guillemot said that the focus would be on open-world adventures, such as the longstanding franchise Assassin's Creed, as well as live service games such as Rainbow Six Siege. The choice to include live-service games definitely comes as a surprise to some, considering its recent announcement to shutter the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">live-service title XDefiant</a>, with the servers of this live-service game due to close in June 2025.</p>
<p>"We have been investing significantly for a big pipeline of products for the coming years along our two verticals, these being open-world action-adventure as well as 'Game as a Service'-native experiences," said Guillemot. "And that's what we want to deliver year after year."</p>
<p>In this presentation, games that have already been confirmed were discussed. This includes Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will be the latest open-world game ready to be released. However, this game has already caused a significant amount of controversy, and it hasn't been released yet. Initially set to be released last year, the game has received multiple pushbacks, with it set to release on 20 March, 2025.</p>
<p>"We've announced that Anno 117: Pax Romana will also come next year, as well as The Division: Resurgence on mobile. All this is coming along well. We haven't provided more color for FY 2026, but we'll have more to share by the time of May."</p>
<p>Guillemot also mentioned that Assassin's Creed Shadows pre-orders were in the same ballpark as those of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which was the second most successful entry in terms of unit sales. Despite the controversy, it seems that Assassin's Creed Shadows may be in with a chance of helping provide redemption for the struggling company Ubisoft.</p>
<p>It's not much of a secret that Ubisoft has been struggling for a while, with there being studio closures and layoffs far too often. On top of that, all of the money that was funneled into Star Wars Outlaws wasn't beneficial to the company, as it didn't perform as well as Ubisoft had hoped.</p>
<p>Whether Assassin's Creed Shadows will be the saving grace of the company remains to be seen, with its tentative release date around the corner.</p>

			<p>More opportunities to test Elden Ring Nightreign may be coming today following the server issues that have prevented many from trying out the game in the very first testing session.</p>
<p>At the end of the first testing session, FromSoftware shared a message on <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> apologizing for the server issues and revealing that they are considering holding additional tests. Like many other PlayStation 5 users, I couldn't access the network test at all in the first hour or so due to the server going offline to fix issues, and I wasn't able to get into a single game once the server went back online. I was only able to wander around the Roundtable Hold and head into the new training area for a few minutes before the connection was lost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="ja">ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGNゲームサーバーの障害によりプレイヤーの皆様にはご迷惑をおかけし誠に申し訳ございません。本日のネットワークテストは予定通り23時に終了とさせていただき、改善作業を進めます。本日分については追加でテスト開催を検討しております。ご理解ご了承をいただけますと幸いです。</p>

<p>Being an online co-op-focused experience, it is definitely a good thing that FromSoftware is holding this Elden Ring Nightreign Network Test and that issues are surfacing now and not after the game has launched.<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/">&nbsp;</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earlier this week</a>, we got a new look at the game with a new trailer and confirmation that it will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on May 30th.</span> Together with the standard edition, multiple Elden Ring Nightreign special editions will also be released on the same day, including an exclusive collectible produced in limited quantities.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-lawsuit-trade-secret-infringement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Korean courts have ruled that Ironmace's dungeon-crawling PvPvE action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>did not infringe on Nexon's copyright, but that it did infringe on the company's trade secrets, necessitating a payment of around 8.5 billion Korean won (around $6 million).</p>

<p>Per Korean news platform <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-it/2025/02/13/MXHA4WV3ANHRFCJZQI4UE4HTQE/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chosun</a>, the Seoul Central District Court's Civil Division 63 came to the decision yesterday. It essentially represents both a win and a loss for Ironmace.</p>

<p>For context, since 2023,&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>has been the subject of an ongoing legal battle between developer Ironmace and Korean studio Nexon, several ex-employees of which make up some of Ironmace's ranks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-and-darker-court-case-trade-secret-infringement-skeletons.jpg?itok=o1901PnW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-and-darker-court-case-trade-secret-infringement-skeletons.jpg?itok=LR9qxE_F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>developer Ironmace must pay Nexon around $6 million for trade secret infringement.</figcaption></figure><p>Nexon alleged in its lawsuit that&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>bore striking similarities to an internal game tentatively codenamed&nbsp;<em>P3</em>. That project's leader Ju-Hyun Choi was fired from Nexon in August 2021 and went on to create&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>alongside several other ex-Nexon staffers.</p>

<p>According to Nexon, assets from&nbsp;<em>P3</em>'s development were leaked by Choi onto an external non-Nexon server, and those assets were instrumental in Choi's decision to try and create a game that would play similarly to&nbsp;<em>P3</em>.</p>

<p>The lawsuit led to Nexon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-developers-respond-to-dmca-takedown-from-nexon-after-removal-from-steam" rel="nofollow">issuing a DMCA takedown</a> against&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>on Steam in March 2023 (although the game has since been restored to the platform) and also resulted in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-early-access-delayed-bit-following-legal-dispute-against-nexon" rel="nofollow">delay to the game's eventual 1.0 release</a>, according to Ironmace.</p>

<p>From Chosun's report, it sounds as though the Korean court agrees with Nexon that material was leaked onto a server from inside the company, but the court doesn't consider this matter to fall under the umbrella of copyright infringement.</p>




<p>It's not clear whether Nexon will pursue any further legal action against Ironmace and&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, but for now, it looks as though the studio and its game won't be facing any more imminent legal threats or takedowns.</p>

            <p>Cult classic N64 platformer Glover now has a release date on current consoles.</p>
<p>Courtesy of publisher and developer QUByte Interactive, Glover will release across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch later this month on 27th February.</p>
<p>Don't expect any changes for this re-release though, it still looks and plays as it did back on N64.</p>

<p>Glover was first released back in 1998 from British developer Blitz Games Studios. And as the name suggests, players take control of a giant glove.</p>
<p>This leads to plenty of creativity as the four-fingered hero throws, dribbles, bounces, and rolls a rubber ball across colourful worlds to help out an old wizard after a magical accident causes him to lose his enchanted gloves.</p>
<p>The game was released on PC back in 2022, though has "mixed" reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257880/Glover/">Steam</a> due to issues with both sound and visuals in this port. Let's hope these console versions fare better.</p>
<p>The original N64 release did receive mostly positive reviews and proved refreshing compared with other platformers of the day. A sequel was in development, but subsequently cancelled.</p>
<p>If you're a subscriber to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, Glover isn't part of it but great platformers like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a> and Banjo Kazooie are available.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ethnos-2nd-edition-review-breezy-power-struggle<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Published by CMON, I got the chance to try out Paolo Mori's&nbsp;<i>Ethnos 2nd Edition</i> thanks to a preview copy sent by distributor Asmodee USA. This update to the original <i>Ethnos </i>game features all new artwork, updated components, a new clan, and a solo-player mode. Follow along as I dive in!</p>

<h2>What Is <i>Ethnos 2nd Edition</i>?</h2>

<p>In <i>Ethnos 2nd Edition</i>, players take on the role of aspiring leaders battling for control of the continent of Ethnos, with the goal of becoming emperor. To&nbsp;do so, you’ll need to gain the help of scattered clans, uniting them in your quest for conquest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Ethnos 2nd Edition</i> Stats:</p>

<ul><li>1 - 6 Players</li>
	<li>Est. Game Time: 60 Minutes</li>
	<li>Game Genre: Tableau Building, Area Influence</li>
	<li>Complexity: Medium</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h2>How Do I Play&nbsp;<em>Ethnos 2nd Edition</em>?</h2>

<p>Setup begins by laying out the central board and determining which six of the twelve included clans will be a part of the game (after your first few games with more straightforward clans, this is determined randomly, which adds nice variability from game to game). Each clan has a different special ability, and you'll take turns either drawing Ally cards from a shared pool or playing Ally cards from your hand.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-board-and-cards.jpg?itok=s-LwuS-r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-board-and-cards.jpg?itok=V5w1jpm8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When you play a set of Ally cards, they have to either each be of the same clan, or be from different clans but all in the same color. You do this to place a control marker (nicely stackable pagoda-style plastic pieces) on a section of the map matching the color of the top card you play in your set.</p>

<p>Which card you choose to be the top of your stack of Ally cards, or to "lead" the set you play, also triggers' that top card's special ability. If you have more Ally cards than the amount of control markers present in any given color-coded territory, you place your marker.</p>

<p>This creates a really interesting gameplay loop of trying to build sets of cards in your hand, and determining the right time to lay down your sets of cards to place control markers. If it weren't for the cards' special abilities, this would be a very, very simple game - but each clan can do its own thing to slightly tweak the rules, opening up layers upon layers of strategy.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-card-sets.jpg?itok=o3RrwLZe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-card-sets.jpg?itok=4frAjCFH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Ethnos 2nd Edition&nbsp;</em>Clan Abilities Add A Dash Of Complexity</h2>

<p>As I'd mentioned above, there are twelve different animal-themed clans in the game. You'll play with six of them present during your play through, and each one has different goals, can offer additional scoring opportunities, and more!</p>

<p>These abilities are all vastly different, and I won't lay them all out here, but I'll give a few examples. The Owl Summoners Clan allows you to play an additional party of Ally cards from your hand when you play a party with an Owl as leader (normally you have to discard the rest of your hand). The Tiger Samurai Clan needs one less card than usual to place a control marker in a region. The Monkey Nomads Clan has a separate board you'll set up when they're in play, allowing you to place markers to gain additional points.</p>

<p>That's just scratching the surface, with some clans being more complicated, or requiring extra components, while some are more straightforward. We've played&nbsp;<em>Ethnos 2nd Edition</em>&nbsp;over and over again in the past month or so, and the combinations we've come across, and fun interactions, never cease to amaze. It truly feels like an entirely different game each time I play it.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-game-board.jpg?itok=Aan1-cwX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-game-board.jpg?itok=XmDpF1Zy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What's New With <em>Ethnos 2nd</em> Edition?</h2>

<p>As you can tell from the game's title, this is a brand new edition of the game, and it comes with some quality of life changes... and an entirely new clan! The entire game has been given an overhaul visually, with all new clan names, brand new artwork on the board and cards, and new balance tweaks for Prestige points (formerly known as Glory points).</p>

<p>I'd never played the original&nbsp;<em>Ethnos</em>, but looking at&nbsp;<em>Ethnos 2nd Edition</em>&nbsp;it's clear what a difference these graphical changes make. The game board is easier to read, and the cards now feature bright, anthropomorphic animals vs. old fantasy creatures in the original edition. They've also done away with any text on the cards, instead using symbols to communicate each clan's special ability.</p>

<p>Though a bit daunting at first, after a few plays of the game we were familiar with the meaning of the symbols, and happy to not have lots of text cluttering the cards.</p>

<p>Then there's the new Clan, the Raccoon Merchants Clan - this clan adds coins - which serve as extra points when scoring - to the region they're played in. It provides a nice additional twist, and can begin to ramp up competition for particularly valuable regions pretty quickly.</p>

<p>The new edition also boasts a solo mode, where you can play alone against the game itself. The rules for solo mode look detailed and well-thought out, with tight mechanics around how the game's antagonist, Chief Bruno, draws and plays cards.</p>

<p><em>Ethnos 2nd Edition</em>&nbsp;is one of the more easy-to-grasp set collection and area control games I've played in a while. And in our playtesting we found the gameplay extremely satisfying once you have a firm grasp on what each of the clans on the board can do.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;<em>loved</em>&nbsp;2023's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/archeos-society-review-is-this-years-best-board-game" rel="nofollow"><em>Archeos Society</em></a>, which was also designed by Paolo Mori and features similar gameplay mechanics. And overall, I do prefer&nbsp;<em>Archeos Society</em>&nbsp;over&nbsp;<em>Ethnos</em>, as I feel it&nbsp;refined the gameplay elements Mori worked through with this game.</p>

<p>But here's the big question: if you already own <i>Ethnos</i>, do you need to pick up this second edition? If you found the text-heavy cards, overall theme of the game, or map not to your taste, then this version of the game makes marked improvements in all three areas, and might make what is a very fun play experience even more to your taste.</p>

<p>And whether you already own it or not, there's certainly something nice about playing this streamlined set collector - and if you haven't tried the game before, and like what you've read so far, it's definitely worth checking out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-controversially-lets-you-mix-and-match-history-and-not-everyone-loves-that-but-firaxis-says-its-just-moved-historical-accuracy-around<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> features some of the most significant gameplay changes the long-running strategy series has ever seen. Chief among them is the ability to, for the first time, mix leaders with civs they have nothing to do with, going by real-world history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In previous Civ games, the civilizations themselves are tied to a specific leader, usually a famous head of state, in such a way as to make historical sense. Elizabeth I, for example, leads the English. Gandhi leads the Indians, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Civilization 7, however, lets players mix and match history for some crazy combinations, and while some players have said they are enjoying the gameplay possibilities this system unlocks, others have bemoaned what they consider to be an assault on historical accuracy — a quality the Civilization franchise is known for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A full campaign in Civilization 7 is one that goes through all three Ages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. Once the Age is completed, all players (and any AI opponents) experience an Age Transition simultaneously. During an Age Transition, three things happen: you select a new civilization from the new Age to represent your empire, you choose which Legacies you want to retain in the new Age, and the game world evolves. The Civilization games have never had such a system.</p><div id="best-civ-7-leaders" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN, Civilization 7 lead designer Ed Beach explained Firaxis’ thinking here, and defended the gameplay changes as they relate to historical accuracy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think what we actually did is moved it around to a different place,” Beach said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So if you look at previous Civ games, you would have historical anomalies such as America existing in 4,000 BC or Sweden and Canada in 4,000 BC. And none of those things actually made any sense. They were just accepted parts of the Civ canon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But now if you're going to get to America, you're going to start somewhere else. You're going to start with Rome and go to the Normans and then go to America. I just did a Harriet Tubman playthrough where I was trying to honor her African heritage, and so I played as Aksum and then as the Songhai and then came over to America. So these are all valid pathways through history. You can set them up so that the leaders make good sense with this one, and arguably the history is more solid this way than it was before.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beach acknowledged, however, that Civilization 7 opens up the possibility for players to create combinations “that seem like we’re breaking history even more than before,” but insisted its fresh take on video game history “is a healthy one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are ways you can take the game that we're putting together with Civ 7 and mix up the history in an even more scrambled fashion than you ever had before,” Beach said. “So you can take Confucius and you can have him lead Spain, or you can take Xerxes from Persia and have him lead the Mayan civilization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So absolutely, there are crazy combinations that seem like we're breaking history even more than before, but there are some problems that we fixed. So I'd like to look at as we've moved it around. It's a new way for players to experience and think about history, and I think that kind of fresh take is a healthy one.”</p><div id="best-civ-7-antiquity-civs" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Antiquity Civs</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Antiquity Civs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally speaking, Civilization 7’s changes have divided the franchise’s fanbase, although the game’s ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam has more to do with launch deficiencies Firaxis is working to address. Beach told IGN he never set out to deliberately cause a furore within the Civilization community, but insisted the changes came from a desire to have more players actually finish a game of Civilization 7 compared to previous titles in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Anyone who knows me, that's really not sort of in my personality or DNA to purposely try to shake people up,” Beach said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are people that do that for sure, but that's not where I usually come from. We really just wanted to, I think, accomplish two things. One, we needed to really think about the Civ formula and what was working and what wasn't working. And it's not just the Civ formula, it's the 4X strategy formula in general. There is this exponential explosion of objects in the world and decisions forced on the players. And in most 4X games that just sort of continues linearly from the beginning of the game, exploding outward in all directions. But it's really hard to finish a 4X strategy game because the end of the game is so tedious to get through usually that it's just a problem. So it was really that was the number one thing that we were trying to address.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, I'd say the second point is that every time we do a new version of Civilization, it's not okay for us to take the exact same gameplay that we had before, put a fresh coat of paint on it, sharpen up the units models and the way the game world looks and say, Hey, we're done. We really want each version of Civilization to have sort of a signature element that people associate with it. And so if breaking the game up into big chapters where each chapter has a climactic finish to it and then you take a breath and reset and go into the next stage, if we felt like that was going to be an improvement to the whole 4X strategy formula, we wanted to do that. And it also gives a signature element for Civ 7.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Executive producer Dennis Shirk chimed in to say Firaxis didn’t want to take the Madden team approach putting out an “iterative release” with Civilization 7. “We've got a highly polished Civilization 6 planted there right now,” Shirk said. “We've got a ton of players playing it. Ed and his team… every time they do a version of the game, everything is put on the table. We put everything into it as a team to make a new experience. It's not something where we strategize over the next few iterations the kind of things that we want to do from version to version. It just gets all on the table.”</p><div id="best-civ-7-exploration-civs" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Exploration Civs</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Exploration Civs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps in the shorter term, Firaxis will be working to address Civ 7’s ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, which stems from various community complaints around the user interface, a lack of map variety, and a feeling that the game has launched without a number of key features fans have come to expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN ahead of the release of its third quarter financial results, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-legacy-civilization-audience-will-eventually-come-around-on-civilization-7-amid-mixed-steam-user-reviews"><u>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledged that Civilization 7 had received some negative reviews from press and players</u></a>, but insisted that the “legacy Civ audience” will come around the more they play, and called Civilization 7’s early performance “very encouraging.” Oh, and if you’re wondering, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-dev-firaxis-says-theres-hope-for-gandhi-yet">there’s hope for Gandhi yet</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for tips to help you take over the world?

                <p>Bandai Namco has announced Mobile Suit Gundam Seed: Battle Destiny Remastered and it is set to launch on May 22 for PC and Nintendo Switch. The original game was released in 2012 for the PlayStation Vita, but had not been released outside Japan.</p><p>In this game, players will be able to tackle its story missions and relive moments from the Mobile Suit Gundam Seed and Seed Destiny anime. There are three factions to choose from: Earth Alliance Forces, ZAFT, and the Archangel.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX1GfnTWz-w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NX1GfnTWz-w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This remaster will have enhanced visuals and revamped user-interface readability, as well as new quality-of-life features like lock-on mode and improved tuning. The announcement trailer goes over the basic premise of the game and it also seemingly reveals that while the text is in English, the voice dub will remain Japanese-only.</p><p>Over 100 suits will be available as well, and they come from various other Gundam anime spin-offs such as Mobile Suit Gundam Seed C.E.73 Stargazer, Astray, X Astray, VS Astray, MSV, and Destiny MSV.</p><p>This isn't the first Vita game that Bandai Namco has brought over to modern platforms.

                <p>Nightdive Studios finally gave us a long-awaited update on its remaster of System Shock 2. Previously known as System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition, this modernized remaster of the iconic and influential 1999 sci-fi shooter is now titled System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster, and we'll learn its release date next month.</p><p>Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock-2/" data-ref-id="5000-278">System Shock 2</a> is a sci-fi shooter in which players explore and try to survive on a starship that has been taken over by an evil AI called SHODAN. While it wasn't a commercial success at the time of its release, it was trailblazing for narrative storytelling in video games, setting design standards that would go on to influence games like BioShock. It's also the game that put Nightdive Studios on the map, as it acquired the rights to the series and re-released it on Steam in 2013.</p><p>Since then, Nightdive has made a name for itself by remastering PC-shooter classics like Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, Quake, Rise of the Triad, and Star Wars: Dark Forces with its game engine KEX. While Nightdive retained ownership of the System Shock IP and even developed a full-on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock/" data-ref-id="5000-453538">remake of the first System Shock</a>, a KEX Engine remaster of System Shock 2 has taken a while to come out. Nightdive Studios first teased that it was working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-announced-and-in-d/1100-6469015/" data-ref-id="1100-6469015">System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition in 2019</a>, but updates on this project have been spotty over the years.</p><p>Now, Nightdive Studios is ready to talk about it again. It promises to reveal a specific release date at GDC 2025's Future Game Show Spring Showcase. That means it should be out quite soon -- certainly before the game turns 26 this August.</p><p>Whenever System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster does come out, it will be available for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infold Games has announced that an <i>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</i>Steam release is on the way, so you're in luck if you've been wanting to add the cozy open-world adventure to your library on Valve's app.</p>

<p>In a press release, Infold confirms that the game, which has attracted more than 20 million downloads since launching in December, will support cross-progression, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off on Steam.</p>

<p>It does sound like that feature will require an Infold Games account, though, so if you were hoping to check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on Steam without signing up to another third-party account, it looks like you'll be out of luck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-balloons.jpg?itok=PHDGykfy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-balloons.jpg?itok=KjRwbbsJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is floating its way onto Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only will&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>be available on Steam, but it'll also boast "the full range of features unique to the platform", according to Infold Games. That means widespread controller support, Steam achievements, and "social integration".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1890262857750905235" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on X, Infold says that each <em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Steam wishlist milestone it reaches will result in more rewards for players. Getting 10,000 wishlists will grant players some "live wallpaper", while hitting 50,000 will reveal some new concept art.</p>

<p>At 100,000 wishlists, Infold will reveal "more surprises", while 200,000 wishlists will result in "the final surprise" being granted to players. That sounds pretty ominous, but given&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s cozy vibes and cutesy aesthetic, I'm sure it'll be something light-hearted.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-wishlists.jpg?itok=CNySqrzm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-wishlists.jpg?itok=AbpvQSXJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wishlisting&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on Steam could lead to something good.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, it's an open-world adventure that emphasizes platforming, minigames, and general cozy vibes rather than action-packed setpieces or tense combat.</p>

<p>The game sees Nikki and her companion Momo exploring the world of Miraland, and while there is a story (and it's got some pretty high stakes at that), the focus here is much more on enjoying the game however you want to.</p>

<p>Since release,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has proven pretty popular, attracting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">over 10 million downloads in just a few days</a>. Two major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-1-1" rel="nofollow">updates</a> have been released for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-12-release-date" rel="nofollow">so far</a>, bringing new outfits, story content, and more.</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is available now on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam right here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Sometimes it's nice when city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builders</a> look like stratospheric views of actual cities, and sometimes it's nicer when they look like a collection of animated postage stamps. Behold <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnfolk">Dawnfolk</a> - a pixelart fantasy town grower packed full of minigames that describes itself as "charmingly dark and minimalist", much like a potential hook-up on some highbrow dating service. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The premise is that you're running a tile-based kingdom lost to malevolent shadows. Fortunately, you've got a fireball friend called Lueur who can light up tiles for you, providing you keep it topped up by producing glowdust. Upon these liberated tiles you shall grow crops, breed animals and build things like taverns, temples and sawmills. It's all very trim and tidy, as I've just learned from the Steam demo - perhaps a bit too trim and tidy. Here's a trailer.

"Not everyone has time to invest hundreds of hours into learning how to play a grand strategy game," comments the Steam page. Oh my word! "You can dive right in and start building your settlement immediately, going from a handful of tents to a big city in less than an hour," it continues. Stop! Stop! My mouth can only produce so much drool!</p>
<p>The price of such convenience, naturally, is that this isn't massively elaborate by city-builder standards. It feels like more of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> puzzle boardgame, with adjacency bonuses shaping your choice of buildings in addition to the need for certain resources. 
</p>
<p>
Still, there's a pleasant liveliness to this murky world. Tiles burble with marketplace chatter, animal noises, and the like. There's also a military component, with Orc camps to flatten, and irregular battles with the aforesaid malevolent shadows. This takes the form of a minigame, nested within the tile at stake, where you angle a sword towards threats.
</p>
<p>
I can live without a lot of Dawnfolk's minigames. While the idea of a Warioware company town is fun, the ones I've sampled were rather perfunctory and unimaginative - sliding a bow and arrow around to shoot deer for a few seconds when harvesting meat, for example. Still, Dawnfolk has the makings of a sweet diversion between rounds of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/farthest-frontier">Farthest Frontier</a>. It's out now and the demo is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308630/Dawnfolk/">still live on Steam</a>.

<p>Rockstar has yet to confirm a GTA 6 PC release date; however, Corsair’s CEO believes the game could arrive for the platform in early 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corsair’s CEO, Andy Paul, recently mentioned GTA 6’s PC release window during the company’s <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757670-corsair-gaming-inc-crsr-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2024 Q4 earnings call</a>. The developer first spoke about how enthusiasts are “lining up” to purchase components to support the newly released Blackwell 50 series GPUs. Their “gaming business has never looked so strong”, with GTA 6, “the most anticipated and hardware-demanding game”, on the horizon.</p>



<p>Paul then discussed GTA 6’s PC release window, stating that, according to his understanding, “it’s going to come out in the fall for console, and then early ’26 for PC.”&nbsp;The CEO mentioned this release window when asked if GTA 6 would be a game that could “spur purchases of either peripherals or components.”</p>



<p>Take-Two’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about</a> GTA 6 not coming to PC, stating that it will first be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S and then branch out to other platforms. However, Zelnick added that he’s observed the PC platform become a “more and more important part of what used to be a console business.” He understands how big the market is, stating that PC versions of games can “result in up to 40% of a game’s total sales.”&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fantasy-life-i-release-date-confirmed-for-may-additional-platforms-revealed.1109583/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced the&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>release date, with the long-awaited JRPG landing not only on Switch but also on other platforms in May.</p>

<p>That's right: after numerous delays,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>finally has a concrete release date, and it's May 21st. Not only that, but the game will be arriving across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox as well as Switch.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>was first revealed during a February <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/february-2023-nintendo-direct-here-are-all-news-announcements" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Direct presentation</a>, at which point it was given a release window of 2023. That release window later proved to be overly optimistic, though, as in November of that year, Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed the game to 2024</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-release-date-dragon-characters.jpg?itok=64Wg7ErB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-release-date-dragon-characters.jpg?itok=kKa7QJEQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, a release date of October 10th was settled on for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, but it was then announced that the game wouldn't make that date either, with Level-5 delaying its "slow life" RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">indefinitely in August last year</a>.</p>

<p>Now, however, Level-5 has announced a release date for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, and it looks like the studio is serious about this one, although there's every chance it'll be delayed again before May 21st rolls around.</p>

<p>The release date was revealed as part of a brand new features trailer for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, showing off the things you can do in the game. If you're a fan of the original 3DS&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life</em>, then it's likely you'll find a lot to like here as well.</p>

<p>Not only can you adventure across a "vast open world" and choose which one of a variety of jobs you want to pursue, but you can also create and maintain your own island, delve into "endless dungeons", and even play the game in split-screen co-op.</p>




<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10013482/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/FANTASY-LIFE-i-The-Girl-Who-Steals-Time-2339978.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on May 21st (assuming it doesn't get delayed again). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Pledges More Cost-Cutting Measures After Tough Third Quarter]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-pledges-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-tough-third-quarter.1109580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed that it plans to implement yet more cost-cutting measures into the next financial year in order to exceed its cost reduction targets "by a significant margin".</p>

<p>In its latest financial <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2GbdOQTUuRZV3mqGXgTfeK/520f2262c4f60b4bc13f0f3a59ec37e7/Ubisoft_FY25_Q3_PR_English_vFinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which covers the period between October and December 2024), Ubisoft reveals that its "net bookings" - essentially net sales sans fees and other cancellations - fell by 34.8% when compared to the same period last year.</p>

<p>The company points to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">cancellation of first-person shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>and the closure of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three</a> Ubisoft locations as major cost reduction initiatives, and CEO Yves Guillemot says Ubisoft isn't done yet, although he doesn't clarify exactly what's coming next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-finances-cost-cutting-xdefiant.jpg?itok=6spiOGKj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-finances-cost-cutting-xdefiant.jpg?itok=bhcu7Nf7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft canned first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>in December.</figcaption></figure><p>Guillemot says that Ubisoft "plan[s] to pursue [its] efforts" with regards to cost-cutting measures into the 2025-26 financial year, "going beyond the initial target by a significant margin".</p>

<p>It's not entirely clear what he means by that, but given that previous cost-cutting measures have involved layoffs and studio closures, it's not unlikely that we'll see more of that kind of thing in the year to come.</p>

<p>He also says that the "formal review process of [Ubisoft's] strategic options" is ongoing, with a view to "unlock[ing] the best value from our assets for our stakeholders" and fostering the "best conditions to create great games in a fast-evolving market".</p>

<p>For context, a Ubisoft shareholder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">called for "strategic and structural change"</a> at the company back in September, reportedly prompting Guillemot and major stakeholder Tencent to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">consider taking the company private</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-snow.jpg?itok=We_M_-tE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-snow.jpg?itok=y0jZGoJS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is probably banking on&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>to do well.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to Ubisoft's future, Guillemot says the company is "fully focused on the upcoming launch of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">on March 20th</a>", echoing the studio's comment when approached about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">rumors of Saudi-funded&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-says-the-plan-is-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games-year-after-year/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, during a followup Q&amp;A session, Guillemot told investors that Ubisoft is committed to "open-world action adventure" games and "game as a service-native experiences" for the foreseeable future, so if you were hoping for a&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>sequel, you may well be disappointed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/612715/elden-ring-nightreign-game-director-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>My <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">first time playing <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, I was stressed the hell out. My team and I were in an underground dungeon, trying to make our way past traps and dangerous blind corners, all while knowing there was an invisible clock ominously ticking down above our heads. If we were still underground when it hit zero a deadly storm called Night’s Tide would close in, potentially trapping us. That kind of anxiety was exactly what <em>Elden Ring</em> combat designer and <em>Nightreign</em>’s game director Junya Ishizaki had in mind.</p><p>Speaking with Ishizaki after my time with the game, I was surprised to learn one of the main inspirations for <em>Nightreign</em> – a co-op focused PvE action game – was the board game <em>Pandemic</em>. Ishizaki said that one of the things he enjoyed about <em>Pandemic</em>, which he later incorporated into <em>Nightreign</em>, was the idea of playing under pressure. “When you come up against these seemingly insurmountable odds, it’s up to the player to choose how to use their time in order to overcome the seemingly impossible challenge,” he explained.</p><p>The tension between whether to continue through the dungeon as the HP-draining Night’s Tide storm slowly closed in, or to cut bait and run, was one of the most satisfying feelings I had during the hands-on. But I also felt another, far less pleasing type of tension – the one between me and my companions. I was scared I wouldn’t be able to hold my own against bosses or that a decision I made would turn out to be a waste of precious time. Since I play FromSoftware games as a strictly solo enterprise, that anxiety was new to me. But according to Ishizaki, that anxiety is also part of the plan.</p><p>He explained that the development team’s approach to <em>Nightreign</em> was a desire to incorporate elements learned from <em>Elden Ring</em> reconfigured into a new experience. Since FromSoftware is known for games with punishing combat, they focused their ideas on revamping the combat system including tweaking the number of combatants. “One of the ways we could make [combat] really exciting and interesting was having co-op be the main focus, and having players have to work together,” Ishizaki said. </p><p>This approach was interesting because one of the things many people enjoyed about <em>Elden Ring</em> was that it’s a very solitary and lonesome game. It’s also a difficult one. You are subject to violent death over and over and it’s powerfully satisfying when you’re able to take what you learned from those deaths to beat a tough encounter. But the goal of <em>Nightreign</em> isn’t to replicate the experience of <em>Elden Ring</em> with a multiplayer modifier: it’s to make something fundamentally new.</p><p>“We wanted to break from this feeling of loneliness and isolation and overcoming things on your own.” Ishizaki said. Since the team wanted to make <em>Nightreign</em> feel fresh and exciting that meant doing away with the creature comforts players expect from <em>Elden Ring</em>. </p><p>“Part of that means working together,” he said. So while my two favorite aspects of <em>Elden Ring</em> are totally absent in <em>Nightreign</em>, I don’t feel alienated by the game. The good internal tension I experience as a solo player is replaced by an external tension – learning to work together in a group – that I could learn to love once I get my hands on the full game.</p><p>But Ishizaki understands that there still might be other players who look at <em>Nightreign</em> and can’t get past the game’s frenetic multiplayer focus. “Existing fans may seem quite bewildered at first when it comes to <em>Nightreign</em>,” he said. “But we feel like once players get it in their hands and actually start playing, it’s actually not too big of a hurdle to overcome.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/14/is-this-seat-taken-preview-a-cosy-puzzler-that-plays-with-the-stress-of-human-interaction/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sometimes, a game can live rent-free in your head, despite never having played it. That’s been “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/is-this-seat-taken-is-a-polite-and-cosy-puzzler-where-you-have-to-consider-other-peoples-feelings/">Is This Seat Taken?</a>” for me. Announced just a couple short weeks ago, I’ve watched the trailer a bunch of times, forced other people to watch it a bunch of times, and even taken it upon myself to force my phone on acquaintances to watch it a bunch more. So, it might have caught my attention. Is This Seat Taken? is a puzzler built around the idea that people don’t like sitting next to most other people. You have to balance the needs of everyone, despite the fact that they smell, they’re messy, and hell, they might pull their phone out and make you watch random game trailers. The monsters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Is This Seat Taken? Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5Nw0qzomec?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Each level of Is This Seat Taken? presents you with a setting, and then a batch of people you need to place within it. The first level is a taxi, getting you used to dragging and dropping your little folks onto the available seats, while their desire card pops up at the bottom of the screen.</p>


<p>Things start out simple enough – Jordi wants a window seat, when there’s two available, and Aurora prefers to sit alone, so she can sit on the other end of the row. They’re both very reasonable about it too, and there’s no pushing or shoving which tells you this must be a fantasy world.</p>


<p>Then you find yourself dealing with a limousine. Suddenly, there’s five people to deal with, the seats all face different directions, and each person has two needs rather than one. After various roles in hospitality, I’m all about making customers happy, but I’m already sweating the details. Given that you’re essentially doing this for reviews or likes – a thumbs up shows you’ve picked a good seat – I’m now beginning to worry about being reviewed on SeatAdvisor. This isn’t supposed to be stressful is it?</p>
<p>Juggling the different needs of each person becomes increasingly tricky, and through the demo you find the numbers of people you’re dealing with steadily increase. A bus journey proves really interesting, with people getting on and off, and a bunch of new needs like wanting to sleep or – the horror – wanting to play loud music. I mean, there should be an option to forcibly eject those people at the bus stop, but anyway.</p>
<p>There’s little snippets of storyline woven into some of the scenes, with indie movie director Alexis helping their actor friend Nat to feel at ease, while we learn all about Hat Wars fandom, where the movies are great but the fans are awful. It seems as though Is This Seat Taken? has an awful lot to say about the world, despite being a game about little shape people being polite and sitting in the right seats. It’s a great combination.</p>

<p>Despite the complicated human interactions, Is this seat taken? is a joyful and upbeat game. The laidback tunes help to ease the trickier puzzle moments, and you’re helped along the way by the changing expressions of each sitter, telling you whether they’re content or not.</p>
<p>You can check out Is This Seat Taken for yourself right now, with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/">demo available to download on Steam</a>, ahead of its release on PC and mobile later this year.</p>

However, what people selected for the trial would have been hoping for was to experience some co-op online <em>Elden Ring</em> goodness, rather than error messages and a broken server. Back in the halcyon days of two hours ago, at the start of the first test, FromSoft were telling players to “try matching again after a while.” And try they did.</p><p>That was until 20 minutes later, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1890366552681120222&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1890366552681120222" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when the next notification</a></span> informed people the plan was to restart the server, and asked “all players to please log out of the game.” It added that there would be no penalty for logging out “at this time.”</p><p>Since then, the entire first three hour session has been completely given up on, with the most recent update explaining, “Today’s network test will end at 11pm (Japanese time) as scheduled.” It adds,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We are considering holding additional tests for today.</p></blockquote><p>The three-player co-op game is supposed to offer a new way to play <em>Elden Ring</em>, reshaping the game as a roguelite, facing waves of enemies in random locations from the game’s map. However, today’s main boss has been the game’s main menu, past which no player managed to reach. </p><p>The next test is due to start at 10 p.m. ET tonight, which at least gives FromSoft and Sony a chance to meddle with servers and check code ahead of the next attempt. And, as we say, this is <em>why</em> you do network tests of online games, and why you should never, ever charge for them (which FromSoft has not). These sorts of disasters will hopefully iron things out ahead of the official (as yet unannounced) release.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
