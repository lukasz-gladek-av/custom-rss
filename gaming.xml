<p>According to journalist <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-yves-guillemot-driver-skull-and-bones">Stephen Totilo</a>, the production company behind the show, Binge, has closed down, taking the Driver series with it.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean the series itself is dead, however. Totilo says Ubisoft promises it is "actively working on other exciting projects related to the franchise".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-dungeonborne-cost/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Ever since the ever-growing popularity of titles such as Dark and Darker took the extraction genre by storm, we’ve witnessed firsthand as a subgenre blooms and flourishes. Now, the first-person medieval extraction game is becoming ever more popular, with titles such as Dungeonborne launching soon. But how much will Dungeonborne cost?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-price-of-dungeonborne">What is the Price of Dungeonborne?</h2>



<p>As of right now, there is no official word on how much Dungeonborne will cost. We do not have a price tag for the game. There are rumors that the studio will include a free-to-play, limited experience for new players to test out, similar to Dark and Darker.</p>



<p>Honestly, that’s likely a smart choice solely because of Dark and Darker. When the latter launched on Steam, it did so as a free-to-play “demo” of the main game, with limited mechanics and progression, to let new players test the experience before paying full price.</p>



<p>Dungeonborne may wish to do the same to entice the same crowd, as they’re direct competitors. That said, even if they don’t offer a free trial version, I suspect the game will be priced around the $30 mark, give or take. Of course, this is only a guest currently. We’ll know more shortly, as Dungeonborne launches on July 18!</p>







<h2 id="h-who-is-making-dungeonborne">Who is Making Dungeonborne?</h2>



<p>Dungeonborne is the first game of developer Mithril Interactive, a Singaporean video game studio. It’s their first commercial title to launch worldwide, or anywhere, for that matter, and is shaping up to be quite the success.</p>



<p>I played in one of the game’s testing phases, and despite losing out on a ton of loot due to werewolves and ghosts around every corner, I found it immensely fun. In fact, I’d go so far as to say the combat feels better than in Dark and Darker, which is a huge boon for the newcomer!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24197477/valve-employs-few-hundred-people-payroll-redacted<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve is a famously secretive company with an enormous influence on the gaming industry, particularly because it runs the massive PC gaming storefront Steam. But despite that influence, Valve isn’t a large organization on par with EA or Riot Games’ thousands of employees: according to leaked data we’ve seen, as of 2021, Valve employed just 336 staffers.</p><p>The data was included as part of an otherwise heavily redacted document from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413196/valve-steam-lawsuit-wolfire-games-humble-bundle-app-store-cut-epic-apple">Wolfire’s antitrust lawsuit against Valve</a>. As spotted <a href="https://x.com/thexpaw/status/1811727326138310962">by SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik</a>, some data in the document was viewable despite the black redaction boxes, including Valve’s headcount and gross pay across various parts of the company over 18 years, and even some data about its gross margins that we weren’t able to uncover fully.</p><p>The employee data starts with 2003, which is a few years after Valve’s 1996 founding and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870270/steam-20-birthday-2003-2023">the same year Valve launched Steam</a>, and goes all the way up until 2021. The data breaks Valve employees into four different groups: “Admin,” “Games,” “Steam,” and, starting in 2011, “Hardware.”</p><p>If you want to sift through the numbers yourself, I’ve included a full table of the data, sorted by year and category, at the end of this story.</p><p>One data point I found interesting: Valve peaked with its “Games” payroll spending in 2017 at $221 million (the company didn’t release any new games that year, but that spending could have gone toward supporting games like <em>Dota 2</em> and developing new games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314103/valve-ending-development-artifact-tcg-dota-2"><em>Artifact</em></a>); by 2021, that was down to $192 million. Another: as of 2021, Valve employed just 79 people for Steam, which is one of the most influential gaming storefronts on the planet.</p><p>“Hardware,” to my surprise, has been a relatively small part of the company, with just 41 employees paid a gross of more than $17 million in 2021. But I’m guessing Valve now employs more hardware-focused staffers following the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954205/valve-steam-deck-multiple-millions">runaway success of the Steam Deck</a>. In November 2023, Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais told <em>The Verge</em> that he thinks “we’re firmly in the camp of being a full fledged hardware company by now.”</p><div><p>Wolfire alleged Valve “...devotes a miniscule percentage of its revenue to maintaining and improving the Steam Store.”</p></div><p>The small number of staff across the board seemingly explains why Valve’s product list is so limited despite its immense&nbsp;business as basically the de facto PC gaming platform. It’s had to get help on <a href="https://www.andrews-cooper.com/tech-talks/valve-partnership-gaming-hardware-development/">hardware</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022#">software</a> and has worked with other companies to have them build Steam <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9705234/valve-steam-machines-controller-link-launch">boxes</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186645/valve-steam-controller-officially-licensed-wireless-horipad-announcement-specs">controllers</a>. (The company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2964991/valves-handbook-for-new-employees-leak">flat structure</a> may have something to do with it, too.)</p><p>Valve’s small staff is also something that’s been a sticking point for Wolfire. When it filed its lawsuit in 2021, Wolfire alleged that Valve “...devotes a miniscule percentage of its revenue to maintaining and improving the Steam Store.” Valve, as a private company, doesn’t have to share its headcount or financials, but Wolfire estimated that Valve had roughly 360 employees (a number likely sourced from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-misses-deadline-to-respond-to-washington-state-gambling-regulator-but-says-its-coming-soon/">Valve itself in 2016</a>) and that per-employee profit was around $15 million per year.</p><p>Even if that $15 million number isn’t exactly right, Valve, in its <a href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf">public employee handbook</a>, says that “our profitability per employee is higher than that of Google or Amazon or Microsoft.” A document from the Wolfire lawsuit revealed <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-tim-sweeneys-epic-rant-to">Valve employees discussing</a> just how much higher — though the specific number for Valve employees is redacted.</p><p>While we haven’t seen any leaked profit numbers from this new headcount and payroll data, the figures give a more detailed picture of how much Valve is spending on its staff — which, given the massive popularity of Steam, is probably still just a fraction of the money the company is pulling in. </p><p>Valve didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. After we reached out, the court pulled the document from the docket.</p><p><em>Sean Hollister contributed reporting.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-is-free-to-play-until-19-july-for-foundation-festival/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Courtesy of Cloud Imperium, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-alpha-3-23-update-is-live-adding-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr/">Star Citizen</a> once again offers free access to anyone who wants to test out the game from 12 July through 19 July. This comes with the annual Foundation Festival, so it's the perfect time to try out the game.</p>
<p>This festival introduces an expanded player experience for new and returning players. It features an inclusive Guide system that connects seasoned players with newcomers so that they can feel safe and included during their play time at Star Citizen. These players will be responsible for showing the newbies the ropes and helping them learn how to explore space.</p>
<p>Additionally, for those who decide to enjoy Star Citizen during the free-to-play period, three starting bundles will be discounted so that you don't have to grind for ages to get resources. These bundles are perfect for those who want to get a bit of a head start.</p>
<p>The Foundation Festival is a "civic program in-lore" designed to bring players together and create a positive community spirit. It runs from July 13 to July 31. The new guide system will be available to players from wherever they start within Star Citizen. It will slowly ease players into the game before introducing them to more advanced techniques.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is also a referral program. If you are already a player of Star Citizen, and there is someone you want to invite to play the game during Star Citizen's free-to-play period, you can give them your unique referral link to use so that as they register, any progress they make or any time spent in-game will give you rewards for convincing them to sign up to the game. It also benefits them, as they will be given 5,000 UEC (United Earth Credits), which can be spent on various customizations.</p>
<p>However, you will only reap the rewards once someone who has used your referral link purchases a bundle for the game worth at least 40 USD. From this, you'll earn 1 Recruitment Point. <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/referral-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Robert Space Industries website</a> explains all the reward tiers and what you will be given to convince another player to take to the skies.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Foundation Festival is already live, meaning you can get stuck into the game using the free-to-play install on Steam if you choose to. While it may seem overwhelming to get stuck into such a gigantic game, there are plenty of resources available on their website to help you track your progress, as well as the new guide system where you can team up with Star Citizen veterans to get the best tips and tricks out there.</p>
<p>Cloud Imperium aims to release the long-awaited Pyro star system later in 2024, which is governed by gangs and clans. As for Squadron 42, the campaign mode of Star Citizen <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been in the polishing phase since last October</a>. Fans are certainly hoping to get an update at this year's CitizenCon, scheduled at Manchester Central on October 19-20.</p>

			<p>A new stable build of the PCSX2 PlayStation 2 emulator was released online, introducing a huge number of changes and improvements over the previous stable build released back in 2020.</p>
<p>The 2.0 build, which can be downloaded from the emulator's <a href="https://pcsx2.net/downloads">official website</a>, introduces, among other things, an improved interface, automatic game fixes, per-game settings, a big picture mode for couch players, support for community-sourced translation, improved patch format, and more.</p>
<p>The new version of the PCSX2 emulator also introduces a couple of new features that should improve emulation for all users, such as the Automatic Renderer, which automatically chooses which renderer works best for different GPU architectures. The new version of the emulator also brings graphics and performance improvements, thanks to improvements to blending and ghosting issues present in multiple titles and texture replacements, which allow users to dump textures from any game, enhance them, and then load them back.</p>
<p>Finally, PCSX2 2.0 also brings emulation improvements for some problematic titles like Burnout, Ratchet and Clank, Destroy All Humans!, Ace Combat, and others. Rounding up the huge list of improvements are also sound and controller mapping enhancements, which include a very handy automatic mapping function.</p>
<p>More information on the PCSX2 2.0 build can be found on its<a href="https://pcsx2.net/blog/2024/pcsx2-2-release/"> official website.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-3-quests-extended-mod-adds-15-brand-new-quests-to-the-rpg.926457/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-quests-extended-mod-adds-15-brand-new-quests-to-the-rpg/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new mod called The Witcher 3 Quests Extended has been uploaded today <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9360?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nexus</a> by modder PaulR0013. As hinted by its name, it will add fifteen brand new quests to CD Projekt RED's best-selling action RPG. Here's how they work, according to the modder:</p>
<p><em>These quests activate at different times and involve a variety of activities. Some are fairly quick to complete, while others can span large chunks of the game.</em></p>
<p><em>It is important to understand what this mod does. There are many activities in The Witcher 3, and while these activities often result in rewards and sometimes unique interactions and dialog, they are not tracked in the journal and do not have notifications to help the player complete them. Also, some of them are highly missable. What this mod does is turn these activities into quests by wrapping brand-new (unique) quests around the activities. When the activity is triggered, this mod will open the quest and provide tracking via objectives, maps, and new lore in the journal descriptions. This is intended to increase immersion and engagement for the player.</em></p>
<p>Two of the quests are related to Gwent (the card minigame later spun off <a href="https://wccftech.com/gwent-the-witcher-card-game-support-will-end-in-2023-cd-projekt-red-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">into its own standalone game</a>), while others are enabled by crafting oils, potions, and decoctions. To install The Witcher 3 Quests Extended, download the content from Nexus, extract the contents of dlcW3QE to your Witcher3\DLC folder and the contents of modW3QE to your Witcher3\Mods folder.</p>
<p>The installation process hasn't been tested with a mod manager, so your mileage may vary if you want to use that method. Moreover, the mod was crafted for the Next-Gen version of The Witcher 3, but the author believes it should work with the old version, too.</p>
<p>Both The Witcher 3 DLCs (Hearts of Stone and Blood &amp; Wine) are mandatory to play The Witcher 3 Quests Extended. Translations from English are available in all languages supported by the game, although only Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Czech, and Russian were made manually, while the rest were created via Google Translate. The modder recommends installing these mods to get the optimal experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7329">Brothers in Arms</a></span></li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7488">DLC Events</a></span></li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7185">Grammar of the Path</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Following CD Projekt RED's release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REDkit modding tool</a>, there might be a wealth of The Witcher 3 content mods on the way from the community. That's great for franchise fans, as the official new game from the studio, codenamed Polaris, is probably still at least a couple of years off; full production with a massive team of over 400 developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/witcher-4-polaris-production-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is just starting</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-saudi-arabia-in-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The International Olympics Committee only recently established the Olympic Esports Games, and it will vote on its establishment on the eve of the Paris Olympics 2024. Additionally, it has proposed that the Olympic Esports Games be held in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The partnership between the IOC and the Saudi NOC will last 12 years, and the Olympic Esports Games will be hosted regularly. "By partnering with the Saudi NOC, we have also ensured that the Olympic values are respected, in particular, with regard to the game titles on the program, the promotion of gender equality, and engagement with the young audience, which is embracing exports," says IOC President Thomas Bach.</p>
<p>This partnership is good news for <a href="https://wccftech.com/saudi-arabia-to-spend-38-billion-on-creating-local-gaming-hub/">Saudi Arabia</a>, which has been working steadily to change its socioeconomic status under Vision 2030. Since 2018, they have been responsible for hosting some of the most significant sporting events for both male and female athletes, as well as multiple esports events.</p>
<p>Now that the decision has been made to host the Olympic Esports Games in Saudi Arabia, the country will begin the process of choosing a city and a venue for the event. It must also consider what game titles to include and a specific date and time for the inaugural event.</p>
<p>In previous events, there has been an uproar about hosting them in Saudi Arabia due to their restrictive LGBTQ+ laws, as it is illegal to be homosexual in Saudi Arabia, and any public displays of affection can lead to lashings or the death penalty. Large organizations have previously been unable to secure the safety of LGBTQ+ players in Saudi Arabia, and it comes as a questionable choice to host the Olympic Esports Games in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>For example, if they choose to add Apex Legends to the program, it will be hugely controversial and contradictory, as the game is full of LGBTQ+ characters and plenty of pride. Additionally, there are many talented eSports players within the community, and at present, it remains unknown whether or not they can participate in the Olympic Esports Games or whether they will even be safe in such a country.</p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee has released <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a complete statement</a> on the official Olympics website detailing its plans for the agreement with Saudi Arabia and its commitment to equality for gender rights across the Olympic Esports Games.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat Remasters Possibly Teased by Eyeballistic CEO]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-remasters/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-remasters-possibly-teased-by-eyeballistic-ceo.926439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-remasters/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mortal Kombat Remasters might be in the works at New York-based studio&nbsp;Eyeballistic.</p>
<p>At least, that's what the studio's CEO appears to <a href="https://x.com/calactyte/status/1811469074695692764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hint</a> at via X. For those in the unknown - Eyeballistic consists of several developers, designers, artists, programmers as well as enthusiasts responsible for the MKHD fan project from several years back. Unfortunately, this fan project never saw the light. "We're the team behind the MKHD fan project where we infamously appealed to series co-creator, Ed Boon, to remake the original MK games in HD", the team <a href="https://www.eyeballistic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains</a> on the studio's website. "Though MK IP owner Warner Bros. initially gave our team the green light to work on the project, they abruptly changed their minds based on evidence it might cannibalize sales of their main line 2019 MK game thus ending Eyeballistic's involvement."</p>
<p>On X, however, CEO Joe Tresca has recently been sharing screenshots of, what looks to be, remastered versions of both the original Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat II. We've included these shots below. "I'm not saying, but just saying, we might be cooking up something special over at Eyeballistic", the CEO <a href="https://x.com/calactyte/status/1804358945915510879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X last month.</p>
<p>Some days ago, Tresca <a href="https://x.com/calactyte/status/1811469074695692764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>: "Who can forget the game that started it all?", showing a screenshot of an AI-upscaled first Mortal Kombat. Granted, although visuals are vastly improved, there are plenty of issues with the character models. When asked about this on X, the CEO wrote that the project is still a 'work-in-progress'. He added that the issues will be "fixed". "It's all just WIP. I can point out at least 100 other issues with it. We'll fix it", Tresca <a href="https://x.com/calactyte/status/1811476024682549733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>.</p>

<p>While this doesn't mean that Warner Bros. has now approved the remasters of the original Mortal Kombat games, it will be interesting to see how things go from here. We'll update you as soon as learn more about this project from Eyeballistic.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-esports-world-cup-groups/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rainbow-six-esports-world-cup-groups-revealed.926430/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-esports-world-cup-groups/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Rainbow Six Siege’s portion of the Esports World Cup is fast approaching, and now that every team has qualified, they’ve been added to one of two groups. It’s an intense roster, with the best Rainbow Six teams in the world finding a place front and centre at the most ambitious and valuable esports event in history. </p>



<p>From July 31 to August 4, Rainbow Six Siege will be one of the most talked-about games at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-ewc-groups-confirmed">Rainbow Six EWC Groups Confirmed</h2>



<p>It was a rocky qualification period for some teams. There were high expectations that C9 Beastcoast, the winners of the recent BLAST R6 Manchester Major, would qualify – but that wasn’t the case. The teams that they beat on their way to the trophy did, though.</p>



<p>Here are the groups:</p>



<p><strong>Group A</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>Luminosity</li>



<li>w7m Esports</li>



<li>Spacestation</li>



<li>Team Bliss</li>



<li>Talon Esports</li>



<li>Team Cruelty</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group B</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>DarkZero</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>Wolves Esports</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Into the Breach</li>



<li>Bleed Esports</li>



<li>SCARZ</li>



<li>Geekay</li>
</ul>



<p>Team BDS narrowly missed winning the Manchester Major, falling short against Beastcoast in an intense grand final showdown. As one of the most storied and successful teams in Rainbow Six esports, there are some solid beliefs that Team BDS can go all the way in Riyadh.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that other teams don’t have a shot. Group B houses FURIA, the Brazilian side that recently re-entered the Rainbow Six Siege scene after acquiring the dropped w7m Esports roster that won this year’s Six Invitational. FaZe Clan also sits in Group B – the runner-up at this year’s international tournament that took place in Sao Paulo.</p>



<p>It’s a veritable plethora of top-tier talent – by the start of August, we’ll know which team is the victor.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PCSX2 Team Reveals 2.0 Version of Emulation Software]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pcsx2-2-0-emulation-software-upgrade/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pcsx2-team-reveals-2-0-version-of-emulation-software.926427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pcsx2-2-0-emulation-software-upgrade/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>PCSX2 was released in 2002, emerging as a fledgling PS2-focused emulation platform. Today, it’s one of the leading emulators in the gaming world, but as a recent blog post from the core team supporting the open-source software recognised, ‘it has been over four years since the last stable PCSX2 revision released.’</p>



<p>With that in mind, a budding team of developers have taken PCSX2 and <strong>finally </strong>created a 2.0 version of the client, making several critical improvements to the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-retro-time">Retro Time</h2>



<p>If you’re able to get your hands on a PS2 BIOS (hint: it’s illegal to download one), then you can throw it onto a computer and configure it in PCSX2, getting access to a library of top retro titles. That’s the core selling point of PCSX2, which is completely open-source and free to use.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pcsx2.net/blog/2024/pcsx2-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post</a> on the PCSX2 site, it was revealed that so many updates have been done or lined up for the platform that it’s effectively a 2.0 version of the client. Here’s a snapshot list of everything detailed in the blog post:</p>



<ul>
<li>Refreshed UI</li>



<li>Removed Plugins</li>



<li>Automatic Game Fixes</li>



<li>Per-Game Settings</li>



<li>Wider Compatibility</li>



<li>Big Picture Mode</li>



<li>Community-Sourced Translations</li>



<li>Improved Patch Format</li>



<li>Graphics Improvements</li>



<li>FFMPEG Video Capture</li>



<li>Improved Audio</li>



<li>Better Controller Mapping</li>



<li>RetroAchievements Integration</li>
</ul>



<p>If that’s not enough to make the application worthy of a 2.0 title, I don’t know what is. It can be a little tricky for some users to figure out how to get their hands on a PS2 BIOS, which is the biggest sticking point when it comes to the adoption of PCSX2, but it’s certainly doable, provided you have your own PS2 console to rip the BIOS from. It’s well worth doing – there’s nothing like going back in time to play your old favourites.</p>

        <p>"We have...ensured that the Olympic values are respected", says the IOC.</p>

            <p>
Following its half-hearted, widely derided <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-dance-gran-turismo-feature-in-the-olympics-latest-stab-at-esports">stab at an esports event in 2023</a>, the International Olympic Committee has <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia">announced</a> the inaugural Olympic Esports Games in partnership with the Saudi Arabian Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee, to be held in Saudi Arabia next year.
</p>
<p>
Tethering its future esports success to a regime that's been widely criticised for its poor human rights record - which includes the criminalisation of homosexuality, fewer rights for women, and the use of the death penalty - is certainly a bold opening move for the IOC, but not unexpected given the Saudi government's heavy financial investment in esports over the last few years.
</p>
<p>
Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth Public Investment Fund is, for instance, financing this year's Esports World Cup, and its involvement has continued to cause controversy. Apex Legends fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-wont-censor-game-for-saudi-arabia-esports-tournament-respawn-says">expressed disappointment</a> when the game was confirmed to be part of the Esports World Cup earlier this year, for instance, with many noting the battle royale game's inclusive outlook was deeply at odds with the Saudi government's anti-LGBTQ+ stance.

<p>
The UK's national body for competitive video gaming, British eSports, was also compelled to release a statement defending its actions last year after announcing a partnership with the Saudi eSports Federation, insisting inclusivity was "fundamental" to the growth of esports.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say that next year's inaugural Esports Olympic Games will undoubtedly come with its own fair share of controversy, but that hasn't stop the IOC's efforts, as unconvincing as they might be, to paint its new initiative in a positive light. "By partnering with the Saudi [National Olympic Committee]," it said, "we have also ensured that the Olympic values are respected, in particular, with regard to the game titles on the programme, the promotion of gender equality and engagement with the young audience, which is embracing esports."
</p>
<p>
"As a 'first' ever Esports Olympic Games, obviously there is still much to consider and plan with the IOC," Saudi Arabia's minister of sport and Olympic committee president Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal added, "but we are committed to hosting a special event that respects and celebrates the Olympic values while boldly seizing the momentum to drive esports forward with the international platform the sport and its athletes deserve."
</p>
<p>
The deal between the IOC and Saudi Arabia's Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee is set to run for 12 years, and the plan is to hold Esports Olympic Games "regularly" in that time. It's certainly a radical change of heart for the IOC, given the organisation was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/esport-killer-games-arent-right-for-olympics-yet-says-ioc">insisting</a> esport "killer games" were "contradictory to the Olympic values" just six years ago.
</p>
<p>
There's no word on when next year's Esports Olympic Games might be held, but it's a safe bet we'll be hearing plenty more about them before things get underway.
</p>

                <p>Xbox has announced major changes to its Game Pass subscription and truthfully, they're so muddled even I struggle with laying them all out. But let's try.</p><p>Starting in September, new members to the Xbox ecosystem will not longer be allowed to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass for console. However, those <em>currently</em> subscribed will be allowed to maintain their subscription, which will include the program's back catalog as well as day one game access, as long as they maintain their subscription. New Xbox Game Pass users, then, will get a choice of a few different subscription tiers, the first being Game Pass Standard. This tier will be priced at $15 a month and gives users access to a back catalog of games and Xbox Live Gold, which is now referred to as Game Pass Core. However, Standard will not include any day one releases or Xbox Cloud gaming.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate's features will not be changed and will still include PC Game Pass, but is seeing a price hike and will now be $20 a month. Similarly, PC Game Pass remains the same but will now be $12 a month. For those looking solely for access to online multiplayer, Xbox Game Pass Core (formerly Xbox Live Gold) will now cost you $75 a month. And, just for good measure, Microsoft has also implemented a new rule in which existing users can only stack up to 13 months of Xbox Game Pass for console, though users who have currently stacked more than that will not be effected.</p><p>If that sounds like a lot, it's because it is.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4eRASQz_Eo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B4eRASQz_Eo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>From its console naming convention to its subscription service's pricing structure, Xbox has a habit of making things overly complicated. But the big question we have is: Is this going to come back to bite them? On this week's Spot On, Tam and Lucy go over the new pricing model and discuss if they think Xbox is making the right move. With thousands of layoffs and studio closures so closely behind them <em>and </em>a new Call of Duty and hot first party lineup ahead, is now the time for such a dramatic restructure and price hike?</p><p>Spot On is GameSpot's weekly news show in which managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest game news. Given the massive video game industry's highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle, there's always something to talk about. Unlike most news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic instead of recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/forgotten-gems-kirbys-brother-from-another-mother<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>Forgotten Gems is a regular column about notable games that have moved out of the public eye and may not be easily accessible anymore. To see all the other games I've covered so far, be sure to check out the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/columns/forgotten-gems"><em>12 previous issues of Forgotten Gems</em></a><em> in our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/columns"><em>Columns</em></a><em> section.</em></p><p>In an alternate universe, HAL and Nintendo’s beloved Kirby series never made it out of Japan. As the pink puffball conquered one platform after the other with his adorable pals, the Kirby games slowly emerged as the more forgiving, kid-friendly alternatives to Mario. If Mario missed a jump, he was a goner. Kirby? Just pump the button to float and you’ll get another chance at redemption. Kids had no problems jumping into Kirby games and completing the main campaigns – but older players looking for a little more also found some surprisingly devious challenges on the path to 100% completion.</p><p>But in our timeline, Kirby’s Dream Land hit Game Boy in the US and Europe a mere months after Hoshi no Kirby debuted in Japan in 1992. While the original game was a huge sales success that subsequent releases couldn’t quite replicate, Nintendo stuck with Kirby. The faith it placed in the franchise designer Masahiro Sakurai (of Smash Bros. fame) built paid off. A full 30 years later, Kirby Star Allies and then Kirby and the Forgotten Land blew up on Switch, selling almost 12 million copies between them. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/densetsunostarfy-pic-1720812819500.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>The Legend of Starfy: The Diminished Chap</h2><p>Which brings us to The Legendary Starfy. The series shares more than a passing resemblance to Kirby's. Its cute, starfish-like hero looks like he’s ripped straight out of a Kirby or Mario game. The developer, Tose – like Kirby’s creators at HAL – appear to share rights to the character and games. And Starfy games are very easy to get into and easy to complete. But unlike Kirby, Starfy has been one of those Nintendo franchises mostly released and promoted in the Japanese market. </p><p>My first experience with Starfy goes back all the way to the year 2000. At Nintendo’s annual Space World expo, also known as Shoshinkai, the publisher showed a playable demo of a game named "Densetsu no Stafy" for Game Boy Color. I recall playing it briefly at the time, of course unaware that that game would never see the light of day. With the release of its next handheld hardware a mere year away, the developers retooled the game for release on GBA instead. </p><p>Developer Tose ("toh-seh"), headquartered in Kyoto not far away from Nintendo’s own HQ, has been around for more than 40 years. IGN’s database lists more than a hundred titles across a dozen platforms that Tose has worked on, from wrestling games to anime-licenses, to titles Nintendo fans will instantly recognize, like Game &amp; Watch Gallery and Super Princess Peach. Many publishers, such as Square, enlisted Tose’s help during the GBA and DS eras to help port their classics to the handhelds, including Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, Front Mission, and Dragon Quest. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Legendary Starfy: Complete Playlist</h3><p>Whether you know him as Starfy or as Stafy, here's Nintendo and Tose's cute platform game series from first to last game. </p></div><p>But the real tally of games Tose has worked on is likely much higher. Tose is one of a few Japanese development studios that have signed away their development credit on games it’s worked on – a practice that essentially obfuscates the real authors of games in favor of pushing the publisher brand. See also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sky-odyssey-the-indiana-jones-adventure-you-never-played">my piece on Sky Odyssey</a>, a game that was in greater parts made by phantom devs CAProduction and Future Creates. This sometimes leads to awkward gameography entries on their Japanese corporate pages, listing their past works as “action game for major publisher” or “game design for PlayStation 4 game”. </p><p>This is all to say, Tose may not be a household name, but it’s an experienced team with more than four decades of experience designing games or working on adapting and converting games. That experience shows in the Starfy games. They feel and look like Nintendo games – or, more accurately, a mixture of HAL games and Capcom’s SNES platformers. If you haven’t played one of them yet (which, you likely haven’t – this is Forgotten Gems, after all), you’ll notice how much Starfy looks like Kirby’s brother from another bubblegum mother.</p><h2>Yellow Submarine</h2><p>Instead of relying on the ability to float, Starfy’s adventures are mostly aquatic. You pump the A-button to swim faster underwater, use spins to destroy blocks, and you can of course dash upwards to catch some air and soar above the waves as well. What starts with simple block-pushing and platforming puzzle challenges eventually gets more complex, with Breakout-style mini-games, auto-scrolling stages, and even vehicles. You’d be hard-pressed to call the first Starfy game – Densetsu no Starfy (or Stafy, see sidebar), a top-tier platformer in Nintendo’s overall library, but it’s competently made and enjoyable.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Densetsu no Starfy Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Densetsu no Starfy was successful enough in Japan to get a sequel. And another one. And another one. Despite not seeing a release in the west, Starfy gained some appreciation from import gamers, with the third GBA game in particular turning heads and leading to questions why the series continued to be landlocked in Japan despite the popularity of platform games on Nintendo’s handhelds and consoles. With Densetsu no Starfy 3 in 2004, Tose had seemingly perfected its formula. Although developed in record time in just a year, Starfy 3 feels like something HAL would’ve made – from the clever puzzles and adorable characters (Starfy’s sister is playable in this one – and looks even more like Kirby!) to mini-game multiplayer challenges and even Wario appearing and giving Starfy quests. There’s no doubt that Starfy 3 would’ve released to positive reviews in the west, but Nintendo made us wait another four years for his stateside debut.</p><h2>Stafy Becomes Starfy</h2><p>Starfy – and the confirmation that, yes, there’s an “r” in his name – started his world tour in earnest in 2009 with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legendary-starfy">The Legendary Starfy</a> for Nintendo DS. Despite the title being a literal translation of the first game’s name, it is not a remake. First released in 2008 in Japan, The Legendary Starfy for DS is an all-new quest that uses the dual screen setup for tutorial and character interactions on the bottom screen as well as for expanded playfields during mini-games, but other than that, it’s vintage Starfy gameplay. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/09/the-legendary-starfy-review">Our reviewer loved it</a> when he first played it and said that it unified the “best elements from games like Kirby, Donkey Kong Country, Little Nemo, and Mario himself”. But there were already signs that Nintendo hadn’t forgotten about Starfy when the little yellow star made his debut as assist trophy in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. </p><p>Despite the positive reviews, Starfy did not ascend to become a mainstream hit on Nintendo’s DS. In Japan, it sold fewer copies than its predecessors – perhaps a sign that interest in lesser-known, traditional platformers was waning in favor of new, touch-screen-centric experiments. Or perhaps the mascot platformer genre was just too crowded on Nintendo’s handhelds. Whatever the reason, instead of being the start of a beautiful friendship, the Legendary Starfy ended up becoming the last bow for the  series.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The surprise is that all three also got added to the US and European GBA collections on Nintendo Switch.&nbsp;</p></div><p>But don’t count a good platformer out. This week, Nintendo surprisingly added the first three GBA Starfy games to its Nintendo Online with Expansion Pack tier. The surprise isn’t that these games returned to the spotlight in Japan – after all, nostalgia is fueling an ongoing barrage of rereleases, remasters, and remakes the world over.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/ign-segmentation-2024-1720815148664.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>This slide, from IGN's biennial Segmentation Study that I frequently take on the road and share with IGN clients, shows player sentiment towards sequels and nostalgia for their childhood game experiences.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The surprise is that all three also got added to the US and European GBA collections on Nintendo Switch. </p><h2>Where can you play it now?</h2><p>As of July 11, 2024, Densetsu no Starfy is back in active distribution after more than two decades. Pour one out for game preservation, folks! Physical copies of the five existing Starfy games are not hard to find via auction services on eBay, but with the exception of the 2008 Nintendo DS release, you should know that they’re all in Japanese and do contain quite a bit of Japanese text. Now, the Nintendo Switch Online releases aren’t localized, either. Nintendo is expecting players to put up with quite a lot of expository text from NPCs in Japanese, but the core game is easy to grasp even if you don’t read kana. So this is definitely an instance of not looking at the proverbial gift horse’s teeth too closely. And if you’re looking to learn Japanese, know that the language used in the games is simple: you don’t need to learn kanji to be able to read what is being said. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/starfyonline-1720815475814.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Nintendo's Online interface is struggling to keep up with its strategy to add unlocalized games to the library.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Giving Starfy wider exposure is a wonderful thing to see. I wish it was a more concerted and serious effort – surely, localization of games without voice acting and cartridge space constraints isn’t all that expensive. Plus, dropping three very similar games at once isn’t exactly a carefully curated introduction to an unknown franchise. But as a lover of the obscure and forgotten, I’m excited to see Nintendo experimenting with its back catalog more and daring to bring back the stuff of even the tiniest legends. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/PeerIGN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peer Schneider</a><em> heads up IGN's Guides, Tools, and Map Genie teams and is excited about Nintendo's recent additions to Nintendo Online.

Yet, while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-remaster-remake-capcom-teaser-frank-west-1851561484&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-remaster-remake-capcom-teaser-frank-west-1851561484"><em>Dead Rising</em></a></span> might not be as famous or beloved as <em>Resident Evil,</em> its quirky characters, oddball tone, endless hordes of zombies, and tension-building ticking clock made it feel unique and helped it develop its own fanbase. </p><p>It all started with <em>Dead Rising</em> in 2006, which was unlike any other zombie game released before that time. It let people live out the fantasy seen in George Romero’s iconic <em>Dawn of the Dead. </em>Finally, you could explore a zombie-infested mall and test your various strategies. Over time the franchise would evolve and change, in good and bad ways. After <em>Dead Rising 4</em> in 2016, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-sly-cooper-titanfall-splinter-cell-left-4-dead-1851506835/slides/20&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-sly-cooper-titanfall-splinter-cell-left-4-dead-1851506835/slides/20">series went dormant for a bit</a></span>.<br></p><p>But good news: The franchise is returning later this year, though not with a new sequel.

So before people start hopping into this new spin on an Xbox 360 zombie classic, let’s dive into the entire franchise and figure out which games are good, meh, and bad.</p></div></div><div><p>While on paper this is meant to be a port of the original Xbox 360 game, in reality, it’s an awful, ugly, and barely playable version of <em>Dead Rising</em>. Remember how the big selling point of <em>Dead Rising </em>was the impressive number of zombies on screen? Well, that’s missing, as is most of what made the original game good.</p></div><div><p>Porting<em> Dead Rising</em> to the Wii was always going to require some cuts. But unlike the phone port, <em>Chop ‘Till You Drop</em> at least plays, looks, and sounds like <em>Dead Rising</em>. Sure, it’s basically just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/fgi8Rw-8BMc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/fgi8Rw-8BMc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capcom’s <em>RE4</em> Wii port re-skinned</a></span> as <em>Dead Rising</em>, but it mostly works, even if, like in the mobile version, the amount of zombies on screen is still pretty low.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b837dc81e4a01545c54b4d3a72224269" data-recommend-id="image://b837dc81e4a01545c54b4d3a72224269" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Frank and Chuck overlooking a facility in the desert.

Sure, it’s cool that Frank West (the protagonist of the first game) meets up with and helps Chuck Greene (the protagonist of <em>Dead Rising 2</em>). I also like the way this tiny standalone DLC moves the franchise’s narrative forward a bit. But beyond that, <em>Case West</em> is a pretty forgettable, but thankfully very short, experience.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1906794d262a7238205209dcab018e44" data-recommend-id="image://1906794d262a7238205209dcab018e44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Frank West as he appears in Dead Rising 4.

But sadly, this winter-themed sequel is mostly a flop, and it comes down to the fact that it doesn’t really feel like a <em>Dead Rising </em>game anymore. </p><p>What made the older entries great wasn’t just all the zombies. It was the way the worlds felt believable but weird, the photography mechanic, and the challenge of balancing a ticking clock with exploration. <em>Dead Rising 4 </em>strips away the clock, makes it easier to carry around weapons, and turns the wacky knob past 10 and breaks it off. This leads to an experience that feels disconnected from the best games in the series, even though I was happy that Frank could still take photos of giant zombie hordes using his phone.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c3f00396656dd24cee0b6fcbf6fb7799" data-recommend-id="image://c3f00396656dd24cee0b6fcbf6fb7799" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a large zombie horde as seen in Dead Rising 3.

Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoy this installment. Its gritty, open-world city is a perfect setting for a zombie apocalypse, its main character (Nick Ramos) is a likable guy, and the weapon and vehicle crafting (first introduced in <em>DR2</em>) isn’t too outrageous or game-breaking yet. So it’s a better game than <em>DR4</em>, but it also marks the beginning of the end for the franchise as it shows the series shifting focus to wacky weapons while downplaying the ticking clock that added so much tension to the older games.</p></div><div><p>Sure, it’s not as big as<em> Dead Rising 2 </em>or the original, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-2-case-zero-review-the-case-of-the-zombie-5623108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-2-case-zero-review-the-case-of-the-zombie-5623108"><em>Case Zero</em></a></span>—a standalone prequel to <em>DR2</em> released before the game’s launch—is a lot of fun.

In <em>DR1</em> it was such a neat feature that as you survived the zombie invasion of the mall you could take photos of your adventure, both documenting your journey while also earning XP to level up. </p><p>Removing the in-game camera was a mistake, but hey, Capcom added co-op and the crafting system—letting you combine weapons to make better zombie-killing tools—in this entry. So in the end, <em>Dead Rising 2 </em>is mostly a win with just a <em>few </em>frustrating flaws.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e9e7dc3ee6a2a612876272973cd9d207" data-recommend-id="image://e9e7dc3ee6a2a612876272973cd9d207" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Frank West in front of a horde of zombies in Dead Rising.

And yet, <em>Dead Rising</em>’s oddball tone, as well as the way it uses the zombie horde and a ticking clock to always pressure you to take risks, is wonderful. Being able to pick up nearly anything in its large, highly detailed mall and use it as a weapon was incredibly fun and impressive at the time. Want to toss plates at a zombie? Go ahead. Wanna use a chair as a weapon? You can! </p><p>Sure, a lot of people complained that the ticking clock ruined the game, making it hard to just have fun. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-2-off-the-records-new-sandbox-mode-is-all-i-5834783&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-2-off-the-records-new-sandbox-mode-is-all-i-5834783"><em>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record</em></a></span> would “fix” this by adding a sandbox mode with no clock.) But while I get the frustration of missing a mission because time ran out or you got trapped behind a giant horde with no good weapons, I think that’s part of the game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-timer-makes-dead-rising-2s-zombies-scary-1792225419&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-timer-makes-dead-rising-2s-zombies-scary-1792225419">It’s what makes it work</a></span>. Besides, you should restart <em>Dead Rising</em> at least once or twice, taking your experience and skills into a new playthrough. In a way, it’s almost a roguelike experience.</p></div></div><div><p>What an odd video game! <em>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record</em> is a non-canonical retelling of the events of <em>Dead Rising 2</em>, but this time you play as Frank West. It’s strange to play a spin-off alt-reality sequel, but it works! That’s because <em>Off the Record</em> keeps all the stuff that was good in <em>DR2</em>—the setting, improved controls, more zombies, weapon crafting, etc.—but brings back Frank and his camera. </p><p>In a lot of ways <em>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record</em> feels like Capcom let some <em>DR </em>fans mod the hell out of <em>Dead Rising 2</em> and then sold it to people as a new game and…I love it! And it’s easily the best game in the series. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/once-human-review-in-progress.926250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/once-human-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Once Human is surprising. It’s a free-to-play open-world survival crafting game, a word salad of flavor-of-the-month genres if ever there was one, and it takes those well-worn ideas and simplifies them into relatively basic forms. And yet, here we are a few days after launch and I find that I can’t put it down. It’s still early, but so far it’s so fun, and so <em>weird</em>. </p><p>There’s no shortage of post-apocalyptic survival games out there, whether you’re talking about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-76-review-2024">Fallout 76</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/24/rust-review">Rust</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review">7 Days to Die</a>, or the many, many other options. But Once Human makes its take on that setup feel unique and interesting by wrapping the end of the world around an alien infestation rather than your classic zombies or nuclear war scenarios. It’s a fun approach that, in hindsight, seems underused in the genre, and Once Human puts it to use in some really clever ways. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Once Human Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>This alien organism has the ability to turn basically anything into a grotesque monster, living or otherwise. Sure, that shuffling and snarling person may seem like a zombie, but then it turns around and reveals it has a blinding stage light for a head. I’ve fought lightbulbs that have turned into giant spiders, evil trees, and even a bus that sprouted a really unfortunate number of giant legs and trotted up and down the road like the biggest, yellowest, and strangest centipede that has ever existed. I did not see those enemies coming, and that has kept Once Human full of surprises.</p><p>Your weaponry is fairly basic, consisting of simple melee weapons like blades and bars, as well as your general pistol, rifle, and shotgun small-arms options. They are pretty unremarkable, but it’s hard to be bored with a baseball bat when you are beating on a monster with a traffic cone for a head or trying to snipe at a massive shadow-beast boss that just as easily could have been fighting Kratos in God of War. Sure, most of the fights are resolved by flailing your melee weapon or running around in circles and shooting as you drain health bars, but the boss fights do a nice job of mixing in unique mechanics, like forcing you to kill monster spawners to make the boss vulnerable. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Once Human makes forming pick-up parties for dungeons easy.</p></div><p>The creatures are the best looking things in Once Human, with organic and inorganic meeting in a strange, body horror aesthetic. That said, the rest of the world is pretty bland. Forests aren’t particularly lush and the same trees repeat a noticeable amount of the time. Urban areas are largely covered in drab concrete that shows signs of decay, but not to the degree that stands out in something like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review">Last of Us</a> series, which seems like a missed opportunity to lean even further into the alien infestation look. </p><p>The biggest monsters are reserved for instanced dungeons, similar to classic World of Warcraft design. These fights are geared towards groups of up to four players, and Once Human makes forming pick-up parties easy. A click of a button brings up a server-wide team finder where you can browse what sort of groups other people are looking for, or start your own. Just pick what activity you are doing and interested parties will apply to join you, and you can give them the thumbs up or down at your leisure. Even as a relatively shy gamer when it comes to queueing up with randoms (I typically bring my own group of friends), I’ve had a lot of success getting groups together, and the fact that no words or other back-and-forth is necessary makes it painless even for online introverts like myself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Outside of combat there’s a simple linear questline to follow that, so far, is a loop of going to different places and then activating things, finding things, and fighting things. Roughly 6 hours in, it seems mainly geared towards making me visit important landmarks and introducing me to Once Human’s fundamental mechanics, which is fine for now, though it will need to pick up the pace soon if it’s going to keep my interest. I do, however, appreciate how it leans into the strangeness of the world, like the time I was sent to hunt the monster that kept turning pregnant people into trees (seriously). </p><p>I haven’t uncovered the full map yet, but even in the early going it’s big enough that running from one end to the other can be a chore. Thankfully, there are a number of ways to speed that up. An early quest gave me a motorcycle that I can summon anytime, and it’s fun to zoom around on. There are also Transportation Towers to unlock, which act as fast travel points, and even a glider, which all help make the distances much more manageable. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The survival-crafting aspects benefit from being very simple.</p></div><p>The survival-crafting aspects have me very motivated to explore, too, as Once Human benefits from being very simple and straightforward here. At the start you have very few things you can craft, but as you accumulate XP and level up you get Memetic Cyphers, which let you unlock nodes on four upgrade trees. There aren’t any gaps, and as long as you have Memetic Cyphers and materials you can progress quickly to making quality food and equipment. It’s a less-is-more approach that makes it easy to get back to the action, which I appreciate. </p><p>Gathering materials is still done via the tried and true “run around and punch trees” method, but at least early on supplies are abundant enough that heading out for some mining doesn’t feel laborious. Resources seem to grow back quickly, and there are upgrades down the line that look like they can even automate some potential time sinks. Aspiring to things like that is so important in this genre, and although how well those more advanced options are executed remains to be seen, the early stage does a good job of requiring some effort to acquire materials without being tedious. </p><p>Right now my home base is pretty rudimentary, as you’d expect for someone just getting started. It’s a wooden foundation big enough for my bed and some crafting tables – it may not be fancy, but it was easy to put together with the simple point-and-drop building system.  But, since this is a shared-world crafting game, I’m able to browse other players' structures, which range from rundown shacks that make my place look like a palace, to two-story mid-century modern homes that would fit right in on HGTV. I haven’t yet channeled my inner Frank Lloyd Wright, largely because I haven’t invested the upgrade points that unlock the more interesting construction options, but I’m eager to give it a go soon. </p><p>So far I haven’t had any temptation to spend any real money on Once Human to speed that process up, either, as the monetization strategy mostly revolves around cosmetic items like weapon skins and home decorations. There is a battle pass with a premium and free track, but from what I can tell all the premium rewards are also cosmetic, while the free rewards contain some useful crafting components mixed in. Importantly, it doesn’t seem like there is much in the way of pay-to-win concerns, but I’ll be keeping an eye on that as I continue my playthrough. </p><p>Naturally I’m still well short of the endgame, both from a story and a survival crafting standpoint, but my initial impression of Once Human is surprisingly very positive. It’s simple and straightforward mechanically, which lets the absolutely bizarre world of this alien post-apocalypse shine. The creatures are horrifying in a fun way, and I’m thoroughly caught up in the loop of being ever so slightly able to craft better and better things. I don’t know where we will end up as I continue to play over the next week or so, but Once Human is off to a really solid start. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the ancient Chinese game of <em>Go</em>, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence has generally been able to defeat the best human players <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/google-ai-begins-battle-with-humanitys-best-go-player-tonight/">since at least 2016</a>. But in the last few years, researchers have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/new-go-playing-trick-defeats-world-class-go-ai-but-loses-to-human-amateurs/">discovered flaws in these top-level AI <em>Go</em> algorithms</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/man-beats-machine-at-go-in-human-victory-over-ai/">give humans a fighting chance</a>. By using unorthodox "cyclic" strategies—ones that even a beginning human player could detect and defeat—a crafty human can often exploit gaps in a top-level AI's strategy and fool the algorithm into a loss.
</p><p>Researchers at MIT and <a href="https://far.ai/">FAR AI</a> wanted to see if they could improve this "worst case" performance in otherwise "superhuman" AI Go algorithms, testing a trio of methods to harden the top-level <a href="https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo">KataGo algorithm</a>'s defenses against adversarial attacks. The results show that creating truly robust, unexploitable AIs may be difficult, even in areas as tightly controlled as board games.</p>
<h2>Three failed strategies</h2>
<p>In the pre-print paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12843">"Can <em>Go</em> AIs be adversarially robust?"</a>, the researchers aim to create a <em>Go</em> AI that is truly "robust" against any and all attacks. That means an algorithm that can't be fooled into "game-losing blunders that a human would not commit" but also one that would require any competing AI algorithm to spend significant computing resources to defeat it. Ideally, a robust algorithm should also be able to overcome potential exploits by using additional computing resources when confronted with unfamiliar situations.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cyclic.png" data-height="800" data-width="800" alt="An example of the original cyclic attack in action."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cyclic.png" data-height="800" data-width="800">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> An example of the original cyclic attack in action.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The researchers tried three methods to generate such a robust <em>Go</em> algorithm. In the first, they simply fine-tuned the KataGo model using more examples of the unorthodox cyclic strategies that previously defeated it, hoping that KataGo could learn to detect and defeat these patterns after seeing more of them.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>This strategy initially seemed promising, letting KataGo win 100 percent of games against a cyclic "attacker." But after the attacker itself was fine-tuned (a process that used much less computing power than KataGo's fine-tuning), that win rate fell back down to 9 percent against a slight variation on the original attack.</p>
<p>For its second defense attempt, the researchers iterated a multi-round "arms race" where new adversarial models discover novel exploits and new defensive models seek to plug up those newly discovered holes. After 10 rounds of such iterative training, the final defending algorithm still only won 19 percent of games against a final attacking algorithm that had discovered previously unseen variation on the exploit. This was true even as the updated algorithm maintained an edge against earlier attackers that it had been trained against in the past.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-109417607-scaled.jpg" data-height="1707" data-width="2560" alt="Even a child can beat a world-class <em>Go</em> AI if they know the right algorithm-exploiting strategy."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-109417607-scaled.jpg" data-height="1707" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Even a child can beat a world-class <em>Go</em> AI if they know the right algorithm-exploiting strategy.</p><p>Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In their final attempt, researchers tried a completely new type of training using <a href="https://medium.com/@hansahettiarachchi/unveiling-vision-transformers-revolutionizing-computer-vision-beyond-convolution-c410110ef061">vision transformers</a>, in an attempt to avoid what might be "bad inductive biases" found in the convolutional neural networks that initially trained KataGo. This method also failed, winning only 22 percent of the time against a variation on the cyclic attack that "can be replicated by a human expert," the researchers wrote.</p>
<h2>Will anything work?</h2>
<p>In all three defense attempts, the KataGo-beating adversaries didn't represent some new, previously unseen height in general <em>Go</em>-playing ability. Instead, these attacking algorithms were laser-focused on discovering exploitable weaknesses in an otherwise performant AI algorithm, even if those simple attack strategies would lose to most human players.</p>
<p>Those exploitable holes highlight the importance of evaluating "worst-case" performance in AI systems, even when the "average-case" performance can seem downright superhuman. On average, KataGo can dominate even high-level human players using traditional strategies. But in the worst case, otherwise "weak" adversaries can find holes in the system that make it fall apart.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>It's easy to extend this kind of thinking to other types of generative AI systems. LLMs that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/chatgpt-vs-google-bard-round-2-how-does-the-new-gemini-model-fare/">succeed at some complex creative and reference tasks</a> might still <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/chatgpt-math-problems">utterly fail when confronted with trivial math problems</a> (or even get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/ai-poisoning-could-turn-open-models-into-destructive-sleeper-agents-says-anthropic/">"poisoned" by malicious prompts</a>). Visual AI models that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/microsoft-unveils-kosmos-1-an-ai-language-model-with-visual-perception-abilities/">describe and analyze complex photos</a> may nonetheless <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/07/can-you-do-better-than-top-level-ai-models-on-these-basic-vision-tests/">fail horribly when presented with basic geometric shapes</a>.
</p><figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-11-115243.png" data-height="297" data-width="1080" alt="If you can solve these kinds of puzzles, you may have better visual reasoning than state-of-the-art AIs."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-11-115243.png" data-height="297" data-width="1080">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> If you can solve these kinds of puzzles, you may have better visual reasoning than state-of-the-art AIs.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Improving these kinds of "worst case" scenarios is key to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">avoiding embarrassing mistakes</a> when rolling an AI system out to the public. But this new research shows that determined "adversaries" can often discover new holes in an AI algorithm's performance much more quickly and easily than that algorithm can evolve to fix those problems.
</p><p>And if that's true in <em>Go</em>—a monstrously complex game that nonetheless has tightly defined rules—it might be even more true in less controlled environments. "The key takeaway for AI is that these vulnerabilities will be difficult to eliminate,” FAR CEO Adam Gleave <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02218-7">told Nature</a>. "If we can’t solve the issue in a simple domain like <em>Go</em>, then in the near-term there seems little prospect of patching similar issues like jailbreaks in ChatGPT."</p>
<p>Still, the researchers aren't despairing. While none of their methods were able to "make [new] attacks impossible" in <em>Go</em>, their strategies were able to plug up unchanging "fixed" exploits that had been previously identified. That suggests "it may be possible to fully defend a <em>Go</em> AI by training against a large enough corpus of attacks," they write, with proposals for future research that could make this happen.</p>
<p>Regardless, this new research shows that making AI systems more robust against worst-case scenarios might be at least as valuable as chasing new, more human/superhuman capabilities.</p>
