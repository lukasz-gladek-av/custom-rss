            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-update-112<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>update 1.1.2, and it's intended to address some of the more pressing concerns players have had with the game, including frustrating insta-fail stealth sections and more.</p>
<p>According to Ubisoft, highlights for this update include "tweaks and improvements on some challenging stealth moments", as well as cross-progression, PC performance improvements, and a fix for one of&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>' PS5 trophies.</p>
<p>Those stealth fixes include a lowering of the likelihood you'll be detected while you're rolling, as well as an adjustment to the "level of detection" depending on where you are. Details are a little vague, but hopefully, stealth should be a bit less punishing now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-update-1.1.2-stealth.jpg?itok=rvbuNWUq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-update-1.1.2-stealth.jpg?itok=Xobve-uG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Stealth in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>should be a little easier now.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, if you happen to be playing&nbsp;<em>Outlaws&nbsp;</em>on multiple platforms, you should now be able to access your save no matter where you are thanks to the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/star-wars-outlaws/gameplay/article/cross-progression-in-star-wars-outlaws/000109498" rel="noopener" target="_blank">magic of cross-progression</a>, which has been implemented in this update.</p>
<p>In terms of performance updates, you're getting nebulous "improvements and optimizations" on PC, as well as improvements for some scenes that cause FPS drops. You're also getting "higher graphic fidelity" for ray reconstruction and frame generation tech.</p>
<p>PS5 players will be happy to learn that the Old School Cool trophy is now unlockable too, meaning that it's now possible to score the Platinum for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. As Anakin himself might say, yippee.</p>
<p>The full list of patch notes contains a bunch of other fixes and improvements as well, so if you want to see everything that's new in this&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>update, then <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/PCOasRfTRCek2FfFirser/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-112" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can do so here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is, according to Ubisoft at least, the first open-world&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>game. It revolves around outlaw Kay Vess, who must navigate the galaxy's seedy underbelly and decide whether she's going to stay on its gangs' good side or disrupt the status quo.</p>
<p>The game is available right now for <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review">read our review of it right here</a>.</p>

On September 10th at 11AM ET, PlayStation is holding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24237361/ps5-pro-playstation-technical-presentation-stream-mark-cerny">a “technical presentation”</a> that appears set to confirm the console’s existence and souped-up specs, like a buffed GPU and faster CPU speeds. </p><p>The presentation will be hosted by PlayStation architect Mark Cerny and last a brisk nine minutes. </p><p>The rumor mill picked up steam last month with French tech site <em>Dealabs</em> claiming to have seen packaging for the Pro and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231231/is-this-the-ps5-pro">sharing an illustration</a> of what it supposedly looked like. Then, last week, Sony itself may have accidentally or on purpose shared <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236967/sony-ps5-pro-design-leak-image">what looked to be a PS5 Pro</a> in its post celebrating 30 years of PlayStation history. </p><p>But now, Sony may put those rumors to bed.

Those three black strips can be clearly seen in Sony’s montage image, looking rather Adidas-like and unlike the stripe you can find on the PS5. In fact, the existing PS5 model is also in the montage, with a single stripe through the middle.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236967/sony-ps5-pro-design-leak-image">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-11f8ba20-f702-4fc0-8824-0d48ad637785"><div><p>Is this the PS5 Pro?</p><p>We know <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130716/sony-ps5-pro-specs-release-date-rumors">the PS5 Pro is real</a> and developers have been getting ready for it for months, but now <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">Dealabs claims</a> to have seen the packaging for the new console.

Sources familiar with Sony’s plans tell me that developers are already being asked to ensure their games are compatible with this upcoming console, with a focus on improving ray tracing.</p><p>Codenamed Trinity, the PlayStation 5 Pro model will include a more powerful GPU and a slightly faster CPU mode. All of Sony’s changes point to a PS5 Pro that will be far more capable of rendering games with ray tracing enabled or hitting higher resolutions and frame rates in certain titles. Sony appears to be encouraging developers to use graphics features like ray tracing more with the PS5 Pro, with games able to use a “Trinity Enhanced” (PS5 Pro Enhanced) label if they “provide significant enhancements.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130716/sony-ps5-pro-specs-release-date-rumors">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-7eb88c1b-3670-4c98-91d9-60c80e6b6745"><div><p>Go read Digital Foundry on the PS5 Pro.</p><p>The most trusted source for console analysis has just corroborated and analyzed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102378/sony-ps5-pro-leak-specs-release-date-rumor">the leaks</a>.</p><p>“Those hoping that PS5 Pro will turn CPU-limited 30fps titles into super-smooth 60fps experiences will be disappointed,” <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet">writes Richard Leadbetter</a> — but he thinks PS5 Pro “should be able to deliver a far higher perceptual increase in resolution vs PS5 than the PS4 Pro did against its junior variant.”</p><p>Lots more nuance here, including how PS5 Pro has 1.2GB more RAM for games:</p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-c5947753-10a9-4448-a738-38e5bb7f52e0"><div><p>More rumored specs for the PS5 Pro.</p><p>Tom Henderson at <em>Insider Gaming</em> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-specs-2024/">reported</a> GPU specifications and performance targets for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102378/sony-ps5-pro-leak-specs-release-date-rumor">a “PlayStation 5 Pro”</a> on Friday, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-more-specs/">now he says</a> that just like the recently revised PS5, the Pro will also have a detachable disc drive.</p><p>Other new details include rumors of faster memory running at 576 GB/s (a 28 percent boost over the PS5), better audio performance, and a new “High CPU Frequency Mode” that boosts performance by 10 percent over the standard PS5. </p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-d46b9f16-cff2-4a48-b6e9-4578239472d1"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102378/sony-ps5-pro-leak-specs-release-date-rumor">Sony’s PS5 Pro is up to three times faster, may arrive holiday 2024</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></figure></div><p>Sony is reportedly working on a PlayStation 5 Pro model that may well include a far more powerful GPU that’s up to three times faster for certain tasks than the existing PS5 models. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSV7BJKnZfP8">YouTuber Moore’s Law is Dead</a> claims to have gotten access to a technical overview document for the PS5 Pro, codenamed Trinity, and now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-specs/">Tom Henderson at <em>Insider Gaming</em></a> reports that the leaked specifications are accurate and the console is currently set to release during the holiday 2024 period.</p><p>Screenshots from the technical document include a mention of 67 teraflops of 16-bit floating point calculations, which works out to around 33.5 teraflops of single-precision compute. That reportedly works out to a 45 percent rendering performance improvement over the PS5. The existing PS5 is a 10.28-teraflop console, but comparing teraflops directly between these consoles is complicated due to changes in AMD’s RDNA architecture.

<p>A week after its first title update of the season, Madden 25 <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/General-Discussion/Madden-NFL-25-Title-Update-September-10th/td-p/14030420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has received another</a> update to address various defense concerns within the game. </p>



<p>The new update fixes issues with zone coverage, speed boost when using custom stems, and more. You can check out the full notes below, courtesy of EA Sports.</p>



<h2 id="h-madden-25-title-update-details">Madden 25 Title Update Details</h2>



<ul>
<li>Addressed the issue with Smart Routed Custom Stems resulting in a Speed Boost off the line at the snap</li>



<li>Tuning to decrease the effectiveness of a specific QB-rollout speed boost exploit</li>



<li>Addressed an issue preventing the Curl Flat zone depth coach adjustment from working properly when set at less than 15 yards</li>



<li>Addressed an issue causing Curl Flat defenders to continue to drift away from an eligible receiving threat in close proximity</li>



<li>Addressed an issue causing outside Deep Third defenders to get out of position when covering corner routes, or giving up too much cushion vs. corner routes.</li>



<li>Addressed an issue in Squads causing the QB control to switch to a teammate at the snap</li>
</ul>



<p>While it’s not the largest update, it is focused on multiple gameplay fixes on defense that players have expressed frustrations over since Madden 25 launched. More updates will be coming over the next few weeks and months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-giving-flame-weapons-one-hell-of-a-buff<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead is lifting the lid on the game’s hotly anticipated 01.001.007 update with an early look at the patch notes.</p><p>The explosive shooter broke records when it launched earlier this year, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time. But Arrowhead has suffered a torrid time of late as it struggles to satisfy Helldivers 2’s fanbase, with recent months in particular resulting in a ‘mostly negative’ recent user review rating on Steam. It's now up to 'mixed,' and Helldivers 2's overall Steam user review rating remains 'mostly positive.'</p><p>Most of the negativity revolves around a feeling that Arrowhead has been heavy handed in nerfing Helldivers 2’s various weapons and stratagems as it balances the game. The constant nerfs have caused some players to accuse Arrowhead of stripping all the fun out of Helldivers 2, a game that revolves around blowing alien bugs and robots to bits with over-the-top guns and bombs.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Helldivers 2 Escalation of Freedom Update Gallery</h3></div></output><p>This patch, which Arrowhead hopes will make significant changes to the PC and PlayStation 5 co-op action game and bring its disgruntled community back on-side, launches September 17. But before then, we now know Arrowhead’s plan to rebalance Flamethrowers, one of the more contentious weapons in the game.</p><p>Flamethrower damage is increased by a huge 33% with the release of the patch, Arrowhead confirmed, and flame weapon armor penetration is increased. “Flamer mechanics will be reverted to the state before the Escalation of Freedom update and flame based weapons can now damage heavier enemies like Chargers, Bile Titans, Impalers, and Hulks,” Arrowhead explained.</p><p>That last change is key: with an armor penetration increase, flame weapons will now be a viable option against some of Helldivers 2’s toughest enemies, such as the aforementioned Hulks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This Flamethrower change is just one of what is expected to be a series of buffs to Helldivers 2’s various weapons and stratagems.  Arrowhead has said it will reveal more about the patch each day running up to its release, so it won’t be long before fans find out what other buffs are coming their way. For now, here’s what Arrowhead has said about it:</p><h2><strong>Here’s what to expect from Helldivers 2's upcoming update, per Arrowhead:</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>We are reworking Armor Penetration, Anti-Tank weapons and enemy armor and health values. As a key part of the rework we have done an initial balancing pass on over 30 weapons and stratagems.</li><li>We are overhauling a number of different enemies to make them feel more rewarding to kill when you use the proper tools to handle them but ensure they still feel formidable. Enemy bots, including Hulks, will have lower armor, and the number of rockets fired by enemies like the Devastator and Gunship will be limited, making combat more balanced. The armor values of particularly tough bug enemies like the Charger, Impaler, and Bile Titan will also be reduced.</li><li>Weapons such as the Autocannon, Heavy Machine Gun, and Anti-Material Rifle will be more effective, providing greater loadout versatility. We are also working towards additional improvements for the flamethrower weapons.</li><li>We’re taking this opportunity to consider new player fantasies and design goals for these weapons and stratagems based on the feedback we’ve received and the trends we’re observing during gameplay.</li></ul><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/25-hardest-bosses-black-myth-wukong<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Much like the source novel Journey to the West, where the Monkey King Sun Wukong must overcome 81 trials to complete his adventure, the Destined Hero in Black Myth: Wukong must conquer over 80 boss fights to fulfil his destiny .</p><p>With so many boss fights to tackle – all of which you can learn the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">best strategies to beat in IGN’s Black Myth: Wukong guide</a> – we figured it was time to rank the hardest boss fights in the game. With so many to choose from it was hard to whittle down the list of 25, but ultimately these are the bosses that pushed us to nearly break our controllers.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>25 Hardest Bosses in Black Myth: Wukong Slideshow</h3></div></output><h3>25. Mad Tiger</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-59-46-am-1725910536233.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Okay, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Mad_Tiger">Mad Tiger</a> is one of the easiest bosses on this list, but he’s still no cake walk if you’re not a ninja monkey ready kick ass. There’s no finesse to fighting Mad Tiger, – the big fella charges straight at you and can  take big chunks of your health if he lands a hit, so time your dodges to perfection and then attack. Simple. Well, kinda.</p><h3>24. Wandering Wight</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-23-05-am-1725910536233.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Wandering_Wight">The Wandering Wight</a> is an early optional boss that just sort of wanders (hence the name) around the first area of the game. What gives the Wandering Wight a spot on this list is not so much the fight itself but how he’s just just sort of <em>there, so much so</em> you might mistake him for a regular, tough enemy until you attack and realize he has a boss health bar. </p><p>It’s therefore likely you’ll die at the hands of the Wandering Wight on your first couple tries, but he’s a sign of things to come. Boss battles in Black Myth: Wukong are sometimes hidden but often they’re very much in plain sight and can happen at any time in the game. Don’t say we didn’t warn you!</p><h3>23. Kang Jin Star</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-58-30-am-1725910536232.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Kang-Jin_Star">Kang Jin Star</a> is an unassuming boss at first. Her glowing eyes are kinda weird but surely she can’t be <em>that</em> dangerous, right? Oh holy shit, she can turn into a giant dragon that spits lightning death from the skies! In fact all of her lightning attacks deal a ton of damage, and because she has both long- and close-range attacks it’s actually pretty tricky to land a decent hit on her.Plus, like Black Myth’s other lightning-based bosses, her attacks are rapid-fire so you better nail your timing, otherwise you’ll get hit by a thunder blast that’ll fry Monkey’s fur in a flash.</p><h3>22. Supreme Inspector</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-49-00-am-1725910536232.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>When I first saw the Supreme Inspector I mistook him for a giant rooster but the reality is much worse – he’s a winged man with a hand for a head, and it’s every bit as gross as it sounds. He – it? – is tough too, and has a bunch of attacks that slowly chip away at your health unless you’re able to quickly stun him. And watch out for his burning ring too, which by the way, you can blow away with the Plantain Fan.</p><h3>21. Zhu Bajie</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-30-51-am-1725910536234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This adorable warthog carries a rake and looks like something from a Disney movie, but he’s actually a ferocious little shit. He wallows in a giant pool of mud, which makes it really hard to move around and dodge his attacks. Worst still, he ditches the cuteness for the second phase of the fight, transforming into a grotesque boar that gouges with foot-long tusks. Survive that and the final part of the battle sees him melting into the mud and charging you down as a huge amorphous rhino thing that does massive damage. No thank you.</p><h3>20. Red Loong</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/wukong-redloong-7-1725912530830.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Despite ditching its human form and going full dragon right from the start, Red Loong is the easiest of the dragon bosses. Like Kang Jin Star and the other dragon bosses, he wields devastating lightning attacks but it's his speed you really need to watch out for. Keep dodging and focus attacks on  the bells on its back to stun him temporarily, giving you a few seconds to tear him a new one.</p><h3>19. Black Loong</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/wukong-blackloong-3-1725912530829.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>What do Red Loong and <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Black_Loong">Black Loong</a> have in common? Apart from being a giant pain in the butt when it comes to fighting them not much, but one is a long slithering dragon and this guy is a chubby pig-man with a dragon head.</p><p>Dual-wielding lightning maces, Black Loong is an optional boss in Chapter 2 but trust us, you should level up before you even think about challenging him. His electrical attacks are more than just visually stunning and do heavy damage whether you’re close or far away, so dodge through his attacks, roll up behind him and stick your staff where the sun doesn’t shine.</p><h3>18. Whiteclad Noble</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-24-51-am-1725910536233.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Whiteclad Noble is the first multi-stage boss in Black Myth: Wukong, so just when you think he’s down he gets right back up again. He also looks like an old man first time around, but then comes back as a crazy-looking half snake man thing. Shudder. </p><p>The key to beating Whiteclad Noble is patience – rushing head on is almost a guaranteed death wish, but dodging his attacks from afar and waiting for the right moment to strike is a sure-fire way to put him down… twice.</p><h3>17. Tiger Vanguard</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-11-00-53-am-1725910536234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Whereas the last tiger boss was all brawn and not much else, this guy has bags of style. <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Tiger_Vanguard">Tiger Vanguard</a> is a badass tiger martial artist who you fight in a pool of blood. Yes, it’s as cool as it sounds. Hed hits harder and faster than any of the bosses you’ve previously met too,so make sure you have strong gear and a load of buffs to help in the fight.</p><h3>16. Emerald-Armed Mantis</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-51-48-am-1725910536233.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Have you ever played against someone in a fighting game like Tekken that just button mashes and seems like they never give you a chance to actually press a button yourself? That’s kinda like what it’s like fighting the Emerald-Armed Mantis. This boss attacks extraordinarily fast and is extremely aggressive, granting you precious few opportunities to turn the tables and land hits yourself. Fortunately, all of your spells work great here: Immobilize can stop it in its tracks, giving you opportunities to stagger, most of its attacks can be reflected with Rock Solid, and Pluck of Many allows you to overwhelm it with clones that can all deal big damage. </p><h3>15. The Duskveil</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-33-39-am-1725910536234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If The Duskveil was a member of your family, it’d be the creepy relative no one wants to sit next to. I mean, look at it. No thanks. This skeletal, Wendigo-like monster has ferocious, unrelenting attacks that make this boss fight far more challenging than it has any right to be. His wild swings and combos are difficult to read too,  making him a particularly tricky boss to get the better of. Also, every attack, particularly in the second stage, has some kind of twist to it. Dodged his swing? Doesn’t matter, the spikes that shoot out of his arms will tear you to shreds while you’re busy feeling smug.</p><h3>14. Cloudtreading Deer</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-53-10-am-1725910536235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Honestly, it’d be great if you could just leave the Cloudtreading Deer well alone. It’s just there, minding its own business in the middle of a grassy field. But he stands in the way of the Destined One becoming a legend, and so, it must die. This four-legged giant hits like a horse — literally, its hind legs kick out with enough force to break your spine in a split second. What makes it extra challenging though is the fact that the first phase has you dealing with potentially getting frozen by its frost enhanced attacks, and the second phase switches gears to force you to handle poison, so you gotta be prepared to deal with both status ailments.</p><h3>13. Stone Monkey</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-55-03-am-1725910536235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Unlike some bosses on this list, Stone Monkey isn’t what you would usually call a two-phase boss. Rather, it’s a boss that evolves into the Great Sage’s Broken Shell. And while its second form is the more formidable of the two, the Stone Monkey is no pushover either. For starters, he’s more than twice the size of our furry hero and is super aggressive too, but his attacks are crude and can be dodged fairly easily. He’s <em>way</em> tougher after he becomes The Great Sage’s Broken Shell, and his ranged attacks like the ring of fire are <em>nasty</em>. What is it with this game and burning rings?</p><h3>12. Yellow Wind Sage</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/wukong-yellow-71-1725912530828.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Okay, this guy looks freaking scary. He’s properly huge and carries around a Bhudda head the size of a SUV. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Yellow_Wind_Sage">Yellow Wind Sage</a> will be a proving ground for a lot of players, as it’s the first properly tough boss in Black Myth Wukong. Wandering Wight was tough for an early optional boss that just wanders around, the Whiteclad Noble was tough because it’s your first time having to pace yourself for a two phase fight, but The Yellow Wind Sage is difficult in just about every way. It hits like a truck, it varies up the timing of all of its attacks to make the difficult to dodge, and if you don’t have the Wind Tamer Vessel, you’ll have to deal with encroaching sandstorms throughout the second phase as well that make it even harder to land hits on him. </p><h3>11. Captain Wise-Voice</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/wukong-pagoda-78-1725912530829.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>We’d shake this guy’s hand for having such an awesome name if he wasn’t such an asshole. <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Captain_Wise-Voice">Captain Wise-Voice</a> is a weird looking thing, with horns and arms and legs sticking out in every direction. It’s insanely tough too with even your strongest attacks barely touching his health bar. </p><p>But the real thing that makes this battle difficult is the fact that he can shrink your maximum life bar by half, giving you a smaller margin of error and dramatically reducing the effectiveness of your healing gourd. Oh, and don’t forget that about the laser that shoots out of its metal-orb-brain-thing. So yeah, great name, and also one of the toughest and most annoying bosses you’ll encounter.</p><h3>10. Yellowbrow</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-11-03-17-am-1725910536235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Now we’re in the top 10, things are starting to heat up. While many might mock <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Yellowbrow">Yellowbrow’s big, bushy eyebrows</a>, we’re going to give him the respect he deserves because, frankly, he’s a dick.</p><p>Armed with an electric mace and an ornate flask, Yellowbrow has hard-hitting area-of-effect attacks that send shockwaves across the entire arena. But the real challenge comes later, when Yellowbrow turns to solid gold, making him practically impervious to attacks. It’s a long and grueling battle, compounded by the fact that his attacks take chunks out of your health while it feels like you’re barely even hurting him, no matter how good your build is.</p><h3>9. Yaksha King</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-43-55-am-1725910536232.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Welcome to one of the hardest fights in the whole game. The Yaksha King wields two extremely large blades, which sprout out of his arms and grow bigger as the fight goes on. His movements are weirdly timed, which means it can be tough to build up a rhythm and timing your dodges. Even worse, a single hit is enough to take a good chunk of your health, so good luck surviving for more than a few minutes.</p><p>The Yaksha King excels at close-quarters combat, which is bad news because you have to get right in his grill to do damage. Between sharp area-of-effect attacks that force you to dodge backwards, and large swings of his sword arm, the Yaksha King is a battle that requires precision and patience to come close to beating.</p><h3>8. Cyan Loong</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-11-05-29-am-1725910536234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Do you always pick a fight with fishermen sitting peacefully by the edge of a lake, waiting for the next bite? If so then <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Cyan_Loong">Cyan Loong</a> is right up your alley. This optional boss is a large, sword-wielding dragon swordsman who can fly through the air – majestically I might add, he really is a sight to behold. His sword strike is also hard to dodge, meaning the window to land a good hit is small, so don’t waste your opportunity to hit him when the arise.</p><p>Like the other Loong fights, Cyan Loong also has electrical attacks, giving him a deadly edge both close- and long-range. Despite all that, he’s still not the toughest Loong fight in the game…</p><h3>7. Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-47-57-am-1725910536232.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But before we get to that, this fearsome Yaoguai is a fiery berserker whose nonstop attacks means you’ll be spending more time dodging than hitting. Similar to The Duskveil, Bishui incessantly comes at you with his mighty fists and fire breath, leaving you with hardly any breathing room. Honestly, this guy never gives it a rest and it genuinely feels like there’s no opening to retaliate.  But if you fancy having a little fun with this hot-headed monster, bait him into a nearby ice cave to cool him off. This changes his fire attacks to ice, which are much easier to deal with.</p><h3>6. Yellow Loong</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/wukong-yellowloong-9-1725912530829.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>And here he is, the hardest Loong in Black Myth: Wukong. Like his peers, Yellow Loong has wildly tricky attacks that are tough to dodge, but that’s not the main reason you’ll struggle. During his second phase, Yellow Loong will constantly make it seem like you need to dodge, only to hold his attacks a few seconds before the real swing of his halberd comes. If you haven’t mastered dodging then you’re gonna be stuck on this brute for hours.</p><h3>5. Yin Tiger</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-11-06-32-am-1725910536234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you thought Tiger Vanguard and Mad Tiger were tough, you haven’t seen anything yet. Yin Tiger is a giant tiger-headed warrior who carries a greatsword the size of a bus. No, seriously, look at that thing. </p><p>The duel that ensues is a total epic and, unsurprisingly for the number five on the list, is also one of the hardest fights in the game. Yin Tiger’s large swings are fast and hit like a truck – a common theme for Wukong’s best boss fights – but Yin Tiger’s speed is what sets him apart from similar bosses. His ability to disappear then reappear out of nowhere makes this challenging boss fight also one of the best in the entire game, and trading blows with Yin Tiger feels like pure kung-fu cinema. It’s hard but man, it’s so good.</p><h3>4. Scorpionlord</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-2-13-15-pm-1725916572893.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Scorpionlord is a giant scorpion-man. Yeah, count me out. Like the nasty little arachnid he’s based on, Scorpionlord’s giant tail, topped with a poisonous sting, is his deadliest attribute, and he’s able to swing it to hit you. He also has a single giant pincer, but while he might only have one it’s powerful enough to pop your head like pus-filled pimple, so don’t let him get a grip. </p><p>That’s easier said than done because Scorpionlord is aggressive with a capital AARGH, and if you make a single mistake you’ll be severely punished. </p><h3>3. Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-39-09-am-1725910536235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Hey, you know what? Screw the Hundred Eyed Daoist Master. This half-centipede <em>abomination</em> not only murders a spider-mom in front of her own daughters, his second phase becomes nearly impossible without the help of a sacred side-quest item. Armed with magical abilities, poison breath, a giant sword, and a bad attitude, Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master is one of the hardest bosses in Black Myth: Wykong, and that’s saying a lot because you literally get help from giant spiders when you fight him.</p><h3>2. Great Sage’s Broken Shell</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-56-22-am-1725910536231.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Some of the best boss fights in video games are ones that tell a story through gameplay and mechanics, and that’s exactly what the final boss battle  –not counting the true ending – of Black Myth: Wukong does so effectively. It’s a passing of the torch between the empty shell of the old Sun Wukong and the Destined One. </p><p>The fight begins with you fighting what is essentially just a husk of Wukong, but as the fight continues more of the old Wukong starts to return to the Stone Monkey, until eventually you’re fighting a near carbon copy of the Monkey King, who uses all of your own abilities against you, to great  –and often amusing – effect. During our playthrough there was a moment where I tried to take a sip from my flask, only for the  boss to immobilize me  mid-drink, before slowly walking over, grabbing the flask and drinking it himself. It’s one of the coolest moments of any boss battle in recent memory, even if its appeal does wear thin after you’ve been stuck for hours on end without a way to skip the animation. </p><h3>1. Erlang, the Sacred Divinity</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-54-18-am-1725910536235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Finally, we’ve made it to the hardest boss in Black Myth: Wukong. Erlang, the Sacred Divinity, is the, <em>shh,</em> secret final boss of the entire game, but you probably also recognise him from the tutorial boss from the opening cinematic. But this isn’t a tutorial anymore. As the final, <em>final</em> boss, Erlang comes at you full power, summoning huge weapons while remaining relatively unharmed thanks to his durable shield. Since Erlang summons numerous, gigantic weapons beyond just his spear, it’s hard to predict his movements; he might summon a giant ax to pummel you into the ground, a giant lightning sword that deals massive area-of-effect damage. He can even take a swipe at you as a freaking tiger.</p><p>Erlang has a near limitless arsenal of weapons and spells, and it’ll take a level of cunning on your part to counter, dodge, and survive all of them, which is why we’ve ranked him the hardest boss in Black Myth: Wukong</p><p>That is our list of the top 25 hardest bosses in Black Myth: Wukong. Game Science went above and beyond to craft epic, and difficult fights to pit against our Destined Hero, but overcoming each fight also comes with immense satisfaction, and some really great loot. So it’s worth steeling your resolve to try and defeat all the bosses in Black Myth: Wukong.</p><p>If your favorite boss isn’t on this list, let us know which ones we missed in the comments. And be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong guide</a> for tips on how to defeat these enemies if you’re feeling stuck.</p><p><em>All image credit to Game Science.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The second and third chapters of cult horror game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> will arrive on Xbox later this month, ahead of other consoles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-1-a-tight-squeeze-coming-to-xbox">first chapter was released on Xbox</a> back in July and now the story will continue on 20th September. The new chapters will be available to pre-order just beforehand from 13th September.</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Fly in a Web will cost $9.99 and Chapter Three: Deep Sleep will cost $14.99 - UK pricing for both is yet to be confirmed. Both will be available in nine different languages.</p>

<p>Poppy Playtime first released on PC in 2021, but it's taken some time for consoles to follow suit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-is-coming-to-ps4-ps5-and-switch-heres-when-you-can-play-it">first chapter arrived on PS4, PS5, and Switch last December</a>, but the latest chapters are yet to be released on these consoles.</p>
<p>That means Xbox will be in-line with PC by the end of September, but PlayStation and Switch players are still without the complete experience.</p>
<p>The third chapter released on PC at the start of this year as the scariest and longest chapter of all. The varied pricing of all three chapters on Xbox is reflected on PC too.</p>
<p>What's more, there's plenty of speculation about a potential Poppy Playtime Chapter Four, though developer Mob Entertainment is yet to confirm any release details.</p>
<p>Poppy Playtime proved popular with Eurogamer's video team, you can check out their playthrough below.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/empire-of-the-ants-preview-stirring-up-a-stunning-ants-nest/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/empire-of-the-ants-preview-%E2%80%93-stirring-up-a-stunning-ants%E2%80%99-nest.976794/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/empire-of-the-ants-preview-stirring-up-a-stunning-ants-nest/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a fascinating side to our natural world that we can only imagine. From the dark depths of the sea, to the leafy jungle canopy, and the uninhabited spaces in between, the world of Empire of the Ants might be closer to home, but it’s no less mysterious and unknown. You take control of ant 103.683e, planning, surviving and strategising in the midst of a micro-environment: the outdoors.</p>
<p><iframe title="Empire of the Ants – Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gayRYRZoU-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Based on the best-selling novels by Bernard Werber, Empire of the Ants charts a story set within the same world, putting you in direct command as leader of the antennaed forces.</p>


<p>What we’ve got here is fundamentally an RTS, though there’s a sleek fluidity and stripped-back feel to proceedings that should help it to be more accessible and approachable than some of the genre’s stalwarts. There are also different mission types that play with the formula, or even discard it completely, taking you away from commanding the army to go exploring the environment, collecting items, capturing creatures or even platforming, hopping from vibrant leaf to leaf.</p>


<p>There are three core troop types – Workers, Warriors and Ranged – with an ant-infused weapon triangle meaning that each is strong against one and weak against the other. That means that encounters and skirmishes require more than simply sending every ant in your nest in the same direction, placing the emphasis on choosing the correct unit to fight against the correct enemy.</p>
<p>It’s all very clearly orchestrated and organised, despite the myriad ants scurrying across the dirt. Each unit in your army and your enemy’s is indicated by a large, recognisable icon, and it’s these that you target rather than the ants that make up the units on the ground. You begin with five units, raising that number to seven once you’ve progressed, and once again there’s a focus on tight and controlled skirmishes rather than an overwhelming force. Admittedly, just one unit is made up of a multitude of ants, so it would otherwise get immediately overwhelming.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s the garden setting, or the micro scale you’re working in, but there’s more than a hint of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/19/pikmin-4-review/">Pikmin</a> at work here. With a controller in hand and the simplified but robust controls, you can command your minuscule minions with ease, but just like in Nintendo’s exceptional but approachable series, there’s still clear tactical depth, even in our short hands-on.</p>
<p>One of Empire of the Ants clearest selling points is its incredibly lifelike visuals. Unreal Engine 5 is being used here to spectacular effect, and everything we were shown through our hands-on was in-engine. Watching the inhabitants of an ant nest scurrying to and fro, foraging for food and material, looks stunningly realistic. As part of that, the animators have meticulously observed the movement of ants and the other creatures in the game, and faithfully replicated it, and the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I particularly liked the way in which Tower Five has baked in the UI and menu systems into the landscape, and your ant commander must access the upgrade trees and building options for each nest by physically moving around them, highlighting the required option while doing so. It’s little touches like this that make the game more grounded and less game-like, and it feels like that’s more important here than it might be elsewhere, despite the sci-fi and fantasy leanings of its source material.</p>

<p>Empire of the Ants has the potential to be a great success this winter, appealing to fans of the book and the RTS genre, as well as insect aficionados who won’t often find this level of detail in gaming. The timing seems perfect as well, with Empires of the Undergrowth, a more faithful RTS that’s drawing on many of the same inspirations, having just had its final update, leaving its raft of players looking for the next ant-filled epic. In Empire of the Ants, they might well have found it.</p>
<p><em>Empire of the Ants releases for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on November 7th.</em></p>

<p>There are two types of finishers Noob Saibot can perform in Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns, both using the help of his shadows. The first one has Saibot dismembering the enemy’s skull through simultaneous flying kicks to their neck. The next one is a bit more gory, with Noob Saibot’s shadow ripping out the enemy’s skeleton from their flesh.&nbsp;</p>

Players can pre-order to try out the story expansion and six new playable characters through Kombat Pack 2 and 1 Week of Early Access for 2 Guest Characters.&nbsp;Here are all the characters that are currently playable in the <a href="https://www.mortalkombat.com/en-gb/roster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">roster</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ender-magnolia-bloom-in-mist-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Binary Haze has announced the&nbsp;full&nbsp;<em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist&nbsp;</em>release date, and the Metroidvania platformer is heading to PC and consoles for its 1.0 launch at the start of next year.</p>
<p>Per a new release date trailer, the game will be launching on January 22nd (or January 23rd, depending on where in the world you happen to be). It's already available for PC via Steam Early Access right now, but it'll be launching on consoles in January as well, although it's seemingly not getting an Xbox One release.</p>
<p><em>Ender Magnolia&nbsp;</em>was originally announced back in February as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-january-2023-recap-find-all-news-and-announcements">that month's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a>, and was subsequently released on Steam in March, garnering an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2725260/ENDER_MAGNOLIA_Bloom_in_the_Mist/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Overwhelmingly Positive rating</a> across more than 3,700 reviews since then.</p>

<p>This time around, you're playing as Lilac, and together with the mysterious Homunculi at your side, you must explore the Land of Fumes, a kingdom which has fallen and in whose fall the Homunculi are "closely involved".</p>
<p><em>Ender Magnolia&nbsp;</em>features a "revamped battle system" that improves some of&nbsp;<em>Ender Lilies</em>' mechanics, as well as lots of unique skills, Homunculi companions, and pieces of equipment to collect and use.</p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</em>, which also gives a sense of the game's (and, indeed, the franchise's) rather unique art style, right here.</p>

<p><em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist&nbsp;</em>arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2725260/ENDER_MAGNOLIA_Bloom_in_the_Mist/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ender-magnolia-bloom-in-the-mist/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on January 22nd (or January 23rd in some regions). The game is currently available for PC via Steam Early Access if you want to check it out early.</p>

                <p> Sony's ill-fated multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/" data-ref-id="5000-589443">Concord</a> has been removed from sale and had its servers shut down, while players across PS5 and PC are receiving refunds. Now, Concord content is being removed from consoles that had it installed. </p><p>Players who bought the digital version of Concord from the PlayStation Store are now being notified that Sony has deleted the game from their console. A message prompt reads, "Thank you for being a valued PlayStation customer. Live services for Concord went offline on [September 9, 2024). The game is no playable and as a result, we have removed this content from your account."</p><p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/playstation-deleting-concord-consoles/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a> reports that physical copies of Concord continue to allow players to boot the game to the title screen, but players cannot progress further. For digital copies, though, it seems PlayStation is simply wiping the game entirely.</p><p>When Sony announced that Concord would shut down, the company signaled that this would happen. Sony told fans that once their refund went through, they would "no longer have access to the game." </p><p>Many online are pointing out how Sony's ability to wipe content from your console is yet another example of how people do not own digital content but merely license it and are beholden to the whims of a giant, multi-national company like Sony. This is nothing new, of course, but the situation surrounding Concord is reminding players of this fact. </p><p>Concord launched in late August and failed to find an audience, peaking at fewer than 700 concurrent players on PC. PS5 player data was never made available, but whatever the case, the situation was so dire that Sony made the dramatic decision to stop sales, close the servers, and refund players after less than two weeks on the market. </p><p>Concord is the debut title from Firewalk Studios, which is owned by Sony. Game director Ryan Ellis said the game's "initial" launch "didn't land the way we intended." As such, the team is now looking at "options" for how to "better reach our players." Some believe Concord could return as a free-to-play game or as part of the PlayStation Plus catalog, but one expert believes <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1831039618122174707" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game is simply doomed no matter what.</a></p><p>Not long after Concord's failure, Sony found more success with its platformer Astro Bot, which is getting rave reviews, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">9/10 here at GameSpot. </a></p>

            <p>PlayStation is currently riding high following the release of its adorable platformer Astro Bot. Unlike the God of Wars and The Last of Us' of this world, Astro Bot is a family focused title, suitable (and definitely enjoyable) for players young and old.</p>
<p>Reflecting on Astro Bot's recent success, Hermen Hulst - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">PlayStation's recently appointed joint CEO</a> - has now said the family market is "really important for us to focus on".</p>

<p>Hulst was speaking on the official <a href="https://soundcloud.com/playstation/official-playstation-podcast-episode-493-the-joy-of-astro-bot?utm_source=blog.playstation.com&amp;utm_campaign=wtshare&amp;utm_medium=widget&amp;utm_content=https%253A%252F%252Fsoundcloud.com%252Fplaystation%252Fofficial-playstation-podcast-episode-493-the-joy-of-astro-bot">PlayStation podcast</a>, in a joint interview with Astro Bot's creative director Nicolas 'Nico' Doucet. During the discussion, the show's host asked if PlayStation would now consider putting more of its resources behind these games with a more family friendly feel, noting Lego Horizon is also set to release in just a few short months.</p>
<p>"I think it's massively important that PlayStations Studios develops games in various genres, and the family market I think is really important for us to focus on," Hulst replied.</p>
<p>"It's interesting that Nico and I at the beginning of [Astro Bot] talked a little bit about, you know, platformers. So many great ones have come out of Japan, and I was kind of joking with him like... some of those best games [are] coming out of the country that you operate out of - Let's see that as the bar."</p>
<p>Hulst went on to state Team Asobi has delivered a "massive" game with Astro Bot which, in his opinion, "plays like some of the best in the genre". The CEO complimented the game's accessibility, adding he believes the audience will "range from new players to young players, but also to players of my age" (Hulst is, I am going to say, in his 40s/50s).</p>
<p>"Astro is very, very important to PlayStation," the Sony executive continued. "Obviously, we had the pre-install [Astro's Playroom] on the PlayStation 5, that millions and millions and millions of people have embraced and loved, and I think that's become a little bit of a platform to launch this new game now.</p>
<p>"It's remarkable that a relatively small team - actually a very small team - is able to deliver a game that is so big now and it's really become a great game in itself."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-is-available-in-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-evotinction-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has confirmed several newly released PC games that include day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 3, the most anticipated of which is undoubtedly Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown.</p>
<p>The third installment in the open world racing series and the first since 2011's Unlimited 2, Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown was announced over four years ago and suffered several delays throughout its development, first from 2022 to 2023 and then from 2023 to 2024. Developed by KT Racing (formerly known as Kylotonn and primarily known for making the WRC games until a couple of years ago), Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown is set to launch on Thursday, September 12.</p>
<p>Its PC system requirements were <a href="https://wccftech.com/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-gets-steam-demo-and-pc-requirements-rtx-4090-needed-for-4k60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> over three months ago and looked pretty demanding, with the 4K@60FPS target requiring a GeForce RTX 4090. We can only hope this was a reference to native rendering; if so, NVIDIA DLSS 3 should be able to provide much higher frame rates.</p>
<p>Another game out this week with NVIDIA DLSS 3 support is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005090/EVOTINCTION/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVOTINCTION</a>. This third-person stealth game puts players into a dystopian sci-fi setting. EVOTINCTION is out this Friday on PlayStation 5 and PC, and the latter version is enhanced with ray traced reflections as well as the aforementioned NVIDIA upscaling and frame generation technology. According to NVIDIA, the combined usage of DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation can boost frame rates by 3.9x on average at 4K resolution and 2.6x on average at 1440p/1080p resolution.</p>
<p>This Friday will also see the debut of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843310/Funko_Fusion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funko Fusion</a>, a funny third-person action game featuring lots of irreverent humor and, of course, NVIDIA DLSS 3 (and DLAA) support. In late August, Evil Raptor and PLAION released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843540/Akimbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Akimbot</a>, an action platformer game that also supports DLSS 3 and DLAA. Lastly, the high-speed on-foot racing game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1273560/DeathSprint_66/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeathSprint 66</a> will launch this Thursday with DLSS Super Resolution support. As a reminder, there are more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">600 games and applications</a> that support NVIDIA RTX technologies.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-sony-boss-says-laid-off-industry-staff-should-just-drive-an-uber.976722/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-sony-boss-chris-deering-comments<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Sony boss Chris Deering has suggested that those laid off from their jobs in the gaming industry should "drive an Uber" or "go to the beach for a year".</p>
<p>Appearing on writer Simon Parkin's <a href="https://x.com/SimonParkin/status/1833418977944514798" rel="noopener" target="_blank">podcast My Perfect Console</a>, Deering says he doesn't think it's "fair" to say the widespread industry layoffs, which have seen companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">Take-Two</a> affected, are the result of "greed".</p>
<p>He goes on to say that "if the money isn't coming in" from gamers on the games Sony - or any company - is making, then it's "hard to justify spending the money for the next game".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ex-sony-boss-chris-deering-comments-ratchet-and-clank.jpg?itok=fWTe7LwW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ex-sony-boss-chris-deering-comments-ratchet-and-clank.jpg?itok=nzxi_F1B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony Interactive Entertainment reduced its workforce by about 900 employees earlier this year, including cuts to Insomniac and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Deering says it's "probably very painful for the managers" when employees are laid off. Rather tellingly, he doesn't acknowledge that it's also probably pretty painful for the employees themselves.</p>
<p>He then says having skills in game development won't result in a "lifetime of poverty or limitation", and that employees who are laid off should "take a few, figure out how to get through it, drive an Uber or whatever, go off to find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year".</p>
<p>Following these comments, Deering says he assumes those who were laid off from Sony "were paid some kind of a decent severance package", and when that package runs out, "well, you know, that's life".</p>
<p>I don't think you need me to tell you why these comments are raising eyebrows right now. At best, Deering comes across as out of touch, and at worst, he comes across as actively callous and unfeeling in the face of thousands upon thousands of job losses.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-i-joel-sony.jpg?itok=1zYwqYEF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-i-joel-sony.jpg?itok=wWmFrLtk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hey, Naughty Dog employees! Did you lose your job this year? Don't worry; just go "drive an Uber"!</figcaption></figure><p>Deering's comments come after several months of brutal job cuts across the industry. At last count, industry layoffs had already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">surpassed those across the entirety of 2023</a>, and that was in June; there have been more since.</p>
<p>Both major companies and indie studios have been affected. Several smaller studios have closed down entirely, and so have bigger studios like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition"><em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer Volition</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report"><em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>developer Piranha Bytes</a> (reportedly, at least).</p>
<p>As you might imagine, this doesn't really feel like the right time for Deering to make the comments he made on Parkin's podcast, but hey - perhaps he'll have a Scrooge-like epiphany sometime soon. We can but hope!</p>

IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review"><u>Star Wars Outlaws review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: "Star Wars Outlaws is a fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration, but it’s hindered by simple stealth, repetitive combat, and a few too many bugs at launch." Outlaws isn’t the only game seemingly impacting Ubisoft shares. Free-to-play Call of Duty rival <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/xdefiant"><u>Xdefiant</u></a> also appears to be having a tough time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>AJ Investments, a hedge fund that holds less than 1% in Ubisoft, urged the board of directors to take the company private or sell it to a strategic investor. The group clearly wants to see Guillemot out as CEO, and threatened to gather similarly disgruntled minority shareholders for a “proxy fight” that would brute force a sale if its demands are not met. It also called for further layoffs at the company, despite the brutal state of the video game industry for developers.</p><p>“Ubisoft at current state is mismanaged and shareholders are hostages of Guillemot family members and Tencent who take advantage of them,” the open letter reads. There’s further and somewhat bizarre commentary on pretty much all of Ubisoft’s games, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">the cancelation of free-to-play shooter The Division Heartland</a>, pirate game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>, which the investment group says “was not a success,” single-player adventure <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> (“was okay but not very impressive as nobody talks about the game anymore”), and ongoing live service multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a>, which the group admits “is doing great.”</p><p>However, franchises such as Rayman, Splinter Cell, For Honor, and Watch Dogs “are sleeping for years.” And on Star Wars Outlaws, it’s “expected to bring good numbers, but recent reviews shows that game was not 100% ready to release, despite the fact that [sic] whole world was waiting for open world game under the Star Wars franchise.” The group pointed to Outlaws’ 76 Metascore and even IGN’s review, “which is quite good rating in our view."</p><p>IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p>Ubisoft has yet to comment on Star Wars Outlaws’ commercial performance. Ubisoft has said it enjoyed a “solid” start to its financial year (April to June), and looked forward to a “strong upcoming release slate” with Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin’s Creed Shadows. “We are excited about the future and confident in the sustained progress of our turnaround throughout the year,” Guillemot said at the time.</p><p>The pressure is now on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows"><u>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</u></a>, due out in November, to make a big impact on Ubisoft’s bottom line.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Layoffs in the video game industry have been extremely high in 2024, with an estimated 11,500 workers laid off from companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/" data-ref-id="1100-6525488">Bungie</a>, and many others. But now, former Sony executive Chris Deering is coming under fire for claiming that these layoffs are not the result of corporate greed.</p><p>Deering, who is the former President of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, recently appeared on Simon Parkin's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-not-the-result-of-corporate-greed-and-those-affected-should-drive-an-uber-says-ex-sony-president" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer podcast</a>, My Perfect Console. During his conversation with Parkin, Deering shared his perspective about the massive layoffs that are rocking the industry.</p><p>"I don't think it's fair to say that the resulting layoffs have been greed," noted Deering. "If the money isn't coming in from the consumers on the last game, it's going to be hard to justify spending the money for the next game."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY5O8yx_rNw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IY5O8yx_rNw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There is some truth in Deering's comments. The recent failure of Sony's hero shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/" data-ref-id="1100-6526235">Concord</a> means that eight years of development costs are irretrievably lost and the studio behind the game, Firewalk Studios, could potentially face layoffs because of that title's poor reception. Having made his initial point, Deering proceeded to make additional remarks that may not paint him in the best light.</p><p>"I think it's probably very painful for the managers, but I don't think that having skill in this area [of game development] is going to be a lifetime of poverty or limitation," said Deering. "It's still where the action is, and it's like the pandemic but now you're going to have to take a few…figure out how to get through it, drive an Uber or whatever, go off to find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year. But keep up with your news and keep up with it, because once you get off the train, it's much harder."</p><p>Suffice to say, driving an Uber or going "to the beach for a year" aren't viable options for everyone, especially skilled professionals who have dedicated themselves to this industry. Executives may be able to more easily weather the turbulence in their careers than the rank-and-file workers, but that doesn't mean they can simply dismiss what everyone else is going through. That's why Deering is currently being roasted on social media. <strong>Warning:</strong> There is some very strong language used in the following posts.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/RetroAli93/status/1833463691070632334" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I had to shake my head with some of the quotes from Chris Deering in this article. some proper boomer shit this one really made me mad. <br>"go off to find a cheap place to live" <br>MOTHERFUCKER THERE ARE NO CHEAP PLACES TO LIVE!!!<br>like seriously, so out of touch! <a href="https://t.co/zQ8LVjxOba" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/zQ8LVjxOba</a></p>  — Harún Ali (@RetroAli93) <a href="https://twitter.com/RetroAli93/status/1833463691070632334?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/IWGB_GW/status/1833456962404557000" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">22000 game devs have been laid off.

What inspired the creation of this game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Giafferi</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I had the idea for the game while watching The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>X-Files</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for the 10th time… There's this scene where Mulder and Scully find a strange sample in a body and ask a lab technician to analyze it. When the technician gives them the results, he's shocked and asks where they found the sample. At that point, I thought it would have been great to see the action from this person's perspective instead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to have players act as assistants rather than the agents in the field? How did that affect your design for solving crimes in the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think it was just more original. One of the strongest constraints I had was my skill set. I can't do art per se, so I had to do something different. I quickly came up with the idea of doing a UI-only game, and it made sense that the player would be the assistant rather than the actual agent. I really like to use my constraints as a creative tool.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The biggest consequence of this decision is that the player has a better overview of the cases than the agents themselves, so it became clear that there must be a conspiracy somewhere. It also works better because I can present a situation directly to the player, with limited access to a subset of evidence, and ask them to solve a specific problem. It basically turned the game into a puzzle game.</span></p><p>Image via Bureau 81.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the interface for the game? How did you design the overall look of the game to make players feel like they're working with complex, high-tech investigation systems?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My goal was to mimic a real OS. Since I work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, I took a bit from each. The interface was designed one step at a time, and for each part, I tried to think about how the software would actually work. For instance, with a chemical analysis software, it made sense to have a place somewhere in the FDI where the samples would be stored and an automated system that would take this sample and put it into a very sophisticated machine where you'd have to input settings based on your sample. This would both create gameplay and serve the story. Since immersion was one of my pillars for this game, I really tried to ensure the interface and software would be as credible as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you choose the analysis systems players would use in the game? What ideas went into their design and how they would make evidence-checking more interesting?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I chose the systems based on the ideas I had for each sequence. Most of the time, the ideas for a specific sequence were based on story goals, and they had to be different from the previous ones. I didn't want to use the same system the same way twice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, in the first case with Agent Andrews, my story goal was to show that the FDI was censoring information, and that it was the first time we worked with HAL and Agent Andrews. The only objective for this sequence was to prove that the accidental fire that cost the life of Mia Cole was not an accident in order to reopen the case. With that in mind, I looked for a way to prove a fire wasn't an accident. The best idea I had was to analyze an ash sample and discover that gasoline was used to start the fire (not much of an accident…). I then created the chemical analyzer just for that use case.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges did you face in making those systems interesting to the player without overwhelming them with options on how to proceed with a case?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I really wanted to make sure the game was accessible to everyone. I didn't want to include gameplay that required complex knowledge. Some things are deliberately difficult and overwhelming, like the bomb defusal, but that serves the story. For the bomb, the goal was to make you feel helpless. It's your first day, you're not even supposed to be there, so of course defusing a bomb is hard without the proper knowledge!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the hardest part was dealing with my own limitations when it came to polishing the game. A lot of the ideas I had were just too complicated to polish. Because of that, I focused first on the mandatory evidence. If a sequence was too easy or just too obvious, I'd obfuscate the evidence a bit or add more easy-to-make evidence to help hide the important parts. Depending on how the information is presented to the players, it's really easy to hide the key information or make something more obvious.</span></p><p>Image via Bureau 81.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges do you face when creating the evidence you give the player in the game? How do you give them enough clues to figure things out without telling them too much?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be honest, the biggest challenge I faced was my own ability to polish. I had to cut a lot of "flavor" evidence because it was simply too hard to polish. When I started developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Operator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, AI was just starting to get really great results. For a small creator like me, it was a really great tool, allowing me to go much further. But as development progressed, and as ethical concerns around AI rose (especially with the data used for training said AIs), I decided to remove AI-generated content entirely. However, some evidence simply couldn't be replaced without a proper budget (like burnt photos of an apartment, for instance) and had to be cut.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for the "clue distribution," since I knew exactly what the player would know in each sequence and what I wanted them to understand, once I found a gameplay or puzzle for the sequence, I decided what piece of evidence to put there. As for what the players understood, a lot of playtests were done!</span></p><p>Image via Bureau 81.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you walk us through the process of how you design a case for the game with a specific example? Take us from start to finish on how you came up with the concept and how you figured out how to relay the story through narrative moments and evidence.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I started with the plot twists I had in mind and the sequence ideas I really wanted to create. For instance, I knew I wanted a sequence where you help an agent defuse a bomb over the phone (a bit like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). I then created the story and the characters to combine those sequence ideas and twists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, in the Evidence Room sequence, the story goal was to retrieve hidden evidence from a previous case. It was a good opportunity to create an entirely new interface, as we had to break into the FDI's evidence room to access this evidence. I decided to go for an MSDOS-inspired UI. In terms of gameplay, since the goal was to stray as far as possible from the base UI, I decided to use keyboard-only navigation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For experienced players, it's easy, but for non-technical players, this is the first challenge of the sequence. Every available key is displayed under the window, so even if you're not used to this kind of interface, you can still do a bit of trial and error to understand how it works. It also made sense for this interface to be highly technical, so it's harder to find what we're looking for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>There is also an overarching storyline contained within the investigation systems themselves. Can you tell us a bit about how you wove the story into the analysis systems in a way that would make players feel clever for finding those "secret" elements?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think it's actually the other way around. I wove the systems into the story. Because the story was laid out first, I knew exactly what I could hide and where so it would seem like an unimportant element. Some players probably noticed those details and figured out some plot twists sooner than they should have, but that's okay. For instance (spoilers), at some point at the beginning of the game, you can ask Mike (your "friend," except that he's not) about his wife, and Mike tries to act like it's a fact, but if you check the database at this point, you'll see that he doesn't have a wife. It's a hidden detail that almost nobody notices, but if you do, you really feel smart.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
