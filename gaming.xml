		<p>It’d be a brave person to suggest to their other half that they’d like to play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a> as a Valentine’s Day game. Yes, it’s co-op, but you’re also running and sneaking through the world trying to avoid horrifying modified animal monstrosities. Then again, maybe that’s preferable to the tensions that head-to-head game of tennis can bring, even if’s a bright, colourful <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis</a> game. Maybe it’s best for couples to avoid both of this week’s biggest releases?</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>After Nintendo last week and Xbox in January, Sony’s now held their first State of Play for 2026, with a rapid-fire showcase of what’s coming to PlayStation 5. There were a lot of fan-pleasing announcements in this one, and we’ve got a big round-up of everything, as well as the biggest takeaways (and the other news from the week).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>For a long time, the episodic adventure game as established by Telltale Games has been declared dead and buried. Which is a shame, because at their peak, Telltale produced some of my favourite ever games; The Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead – Season 1, heck, I even have a weird soft spot for mega-flop Batman: The Telltale Series. So, I was delighted as much as anyone when Dispatch released last year to rave reviews and went on to sell millions of copies. Conclusively proving that the episodic choose-your-own-adventure narrative formula still had an audience, fans just needed a decent game that released on time and to schedule for them to reach for their credit cards again. And surely Switch gamers would love a slice of that too, wouldn’t they?</p>
<p>Well yes, of course they would, but maybe not like this. If you’ve glanced at the score before reading this review, please, let me reassure you, I don’t think for one moment that Dispatch is only a slightly better than average game. You see, Dispatch itself is great. The problem lay elsewhere.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dispatch | Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/flCnsbSrYuw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For those who haven’t heard of Dispatch, it’s basically a modestly interactive feature-length animation divided into eight episodes. Segmenting the story are a series of puzzle elements. The first sees retired superhero Robert Robertson the Third in his new job as a superhero dispatcher, though he’s tasked with sending a group of reformed supervillains to time sensitive emergencies. Looking at a map screen, you assess the crises before sending the best member of the Z-Team to deal with the problem. This is a pleasant enough diversion but is lightweight and far too easy, with the game signalling so blatantly which member of your hero squad to use that you really can’t fail.</p>
<p>The second puzzle element involves hacking into various computers, which is far more interesting. You guide your hacking bot through a veritable maze, dodging viruses and cracking codes as you go. With mechanics that meaningly develop from episode to episode, this is a challenging and satisfying mini game, with genuine thrills delivered by racing against time to rescue one of your teammates, hack into a safe, or access some vital CCTV footage.</p>


<p>The story of Dispatch is brilliantly told, it’s a delightful superhero yarn providing memorable characters, whip-smart dialogue, laugh out loud tomfoolery, and some surprisingly emotional moments too. Voice over performances are off-the-chart fantastic, with a veritable who’s who of actors delivering the most believable and absorbing dialogue I’ve ever experienced in a video game. Visually, Dispatch looks phenomenal too, with slick sumptuous visuals and smooth animation, ensuring the characters will live on in your memory long after the story has finished.</p>
<p>Less successful? Well, there’s the slightly pathetic QTE inputs during fight scenes, that are so half-hearted they feel like an afterthought. Then there are the dialogue choices themselves. Now, this genre has always required a hefty amount of smoke and mirrors for the player to believe that any of their choices really matter. That was true in The Walking Dead and it’s true in Dispatch. More often than not, whatever time-sensitive dialogue option you make, the story briefly deviates from its prescribed path before re-joining the overall narrative again. Nothing really changes, certainly nothing important. Dispatch suffers from the fact that most of the choices you make are so blatantly inconsequential that you can just leave the game to play itself and you’ll make it to the end of the episode unscathed. But every now and again, the game throws an absolute dozy of a moral choice at the player; and these are worth the price of admission alone. When Dispatch finally stops pulling its punches, it hits hard, resulting in the kind of uncomfortable ethical moments that will prompt hours of conversation between players, just what did you decide to do?</p>
<p>Overall, the Switch conversion is excellent, playing equally well docked or handheld. So, what’s the big problem? As you might have already gathered if you’d paid attention over the last couple of weeks, it’s all down to the bizarre censorship.</p>

<p>Dispatch is an adult game. It’s eighteen-rated and explores grown-up themes. It’s violent, sweary, and includes full-frontal nudity and sex scenes. Unfortunately, it’s the last of these two distinctly adult things that is getting the redacted documents treatment with some of the clumsiest censoring we’ve ever seen. You know how beautiful the visuals and animation of Dispatch are? We’ll get ready for them to be ruined by enormous black censorship rectangles being stuck on top of them!</p>
<p>A character raises a middle finger? Well, dear person over eighteen, you’re not permitted to see that – look at a big black censorship rectangle instead. Someone’s naked bum is revealed? I’m afraid, person over eighteen, despite you having a bum too, you can’t see that. Breasts? That’s not OK either. A flaccid penis? Simply unacceptable. That’s right, natural bits of a human body cannot be looked at, but gratuitous swearing and bloody violence are apparently not a problem.</p>
<p>The reason for the censorship is a little unclear, with AdHoc saying <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-is-censored-on-nintendo-switch-due-to-platform-content-criteria-developer-says">they worked with Nintendo to meet platform ‘content criteria’</a>, Nintendo then saying AdHoc could have taken a different approach <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much">so long as games meet guidelines for ratings bodies</a>, and AdHoc then <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/people-have-a-right-to-be-pissed-dispatch-developer-apologizes-to-fans-over-nintendo-switch-censorship-says-disclaimer-wasnt-visible-enough">not exactly explaining what happened or if there’s a real path forward</a>. The speculation is that a single version of the game was submitted for all regions, meaning that they adhered to the CERO D rating in Japan and that this version was shipped everywhere. Other games, like Cyberpunk 2077, have multiple versions, but even with a single global approach, the method here is far too heavy-handed.</p>
<p>AdHoc Studio could have elected to edit the scenes in question, they could have chosen to pixelate or blur, but instead they elected to stick black rectangles everywhere, taking the player out of the moment entirely. One moment, I kid you not, the entire screen was covered in one enormous rectangle. The effect of this decision is calamitous; jokes are regularly ruined and it becomes difficult to tell what’s going on sometimes. Worse still, an incredibly affecting twist in the penultimate episode is entirely ruined by the big black censorship rectangle of doom. With Dispatch on Switch, AdHoc Studio had an open goal. Somehow, they’ve managed to perform an elaborate bicycle kick and hoofed the proverbial football into their own net.</p>
<p>While we hope there is some kind of remedy for this down the line, there’s no real indication that there will be.</p>

Yes, it's the weekend, and we're gazing at our stack of games with wistful longing. We can't let them go unplayed, can we?</p>

Our headline review was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, but we also checked out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a>.

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was greedy and wrapped up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> way quicker than I was expecting last weekend, so I am officially <em>Between Games TM</em> at the moment. I’ve been enjoying working my way through some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario’s Super Picross</a> on the NSO library to chill out, and I imagine this weekend will bring more of the same!</p>
<p>While I can’t really believe that I’m saying it, I’m also quite keen to check out some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/overwatch">Overwatch</a> this weekend. I missed the boat when it first launched, but all of this new content has me intrigued.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>This week, I have jetlag. I tried to play games that required even a little bit of brain, and it did not go well (it was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, for the record. Not even a particularly cerebral game! I'm just very tired).</p><p>

I've been making my way through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a>, as I will be for the rest of my life, and now I'm somewhere around 25 endings. Maybe more. Also, <strong>Titanium Court</strong>, which is not out yet, but I have an early code because I'm a jammy lad, and it's VERY good, so look forward to that one (although... I'm not sure if it's due out on Switch. Sorry). Also, some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cobalt_core">Cobalt Core</a> (which IS out on Switch, and you should play it) and watching my partner play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/1000xresist">1000xRESIST</a>, after a year of me going PLAY IT PLAY IT PLAY IT. So that's very fun.</p><p>

But I'm looking for something meaty to play after finishing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy VI</a>. Another JRPG, perhap? Recommendations always welcome.</p></div>

<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I’ve not had much time to play this week as I’ve been under the weather, however I predict this weekend will be spent gaming in bed. It’s only fitting with it being Valentine’s Day on Saturday that my fiancee and I replay <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a> together.</p>
<p>Saying that, I’m still on the mission of becoming less of a wimp and with the recent <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a> trailer, I might just jump into a horror game from my backlog. I’m sure I can dust off something from my collection. Perhaps <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_4_wii_edition">Resident Evil 4</a> on Wii? Wish me luck…I think motion controls are scarier than Las Plagas!</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still completely addicted to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> at the moment, though I did briefly test out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid_master_collection_vol_1">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</a> after its recent update, and I can confirm that MGS2 and 3 now run like a dream on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>So yes, it's likely that I'll be spending a bit of time with Solid and Naked Snake this weekend, playing their two best adventures as intended. It took a while, but Konami finally pulled through.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>That's our plans for the coming weekend. Now it's your turn to tell us yours, so make sure to get busy with our poll, and let us know all about your weekend gaming plans in the comments!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Maelstrom is a part of the <em>40K</em> universe where real space meets the madness of the Warp. The area is in constant flux, which makes it the perfect hiding place for xenos, heretics, traitors, and the various pirate raiders that call it home. Following on from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-500-worlds-titus-review-titus-and-friends" rel="nofollow">500 Worlds Titus</a> books, The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant brings a new campaign, new enemies, and pushes the narrative one step closer to something huge for <em>Warhammer 40K</em>. In this article, we check out the new <em>Warhammer 40K</em> The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant campaign books, and the new pirate forces of the Red Corairs and Eldritch Raiders.</p><p>We've been covering <em>Warhammer 40K</em> for a while on the site, and you can check out our full <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-40k-guide" rel="nofollow">Warhammer 40K Guide</a>, our preview for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-leviathan-first-look" rel="nofollow">Leviathan box</a> that launched the latest edition of the rules, or the most recent wave of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/crux-terminatus-battleforce-marneus-calgar-and-friends-review-codex-compliant" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Ultramarines and Space Marine reinforcements</a>.</p>
<p>The Maelstrom is a large region of space that several factions share. The largest force of inhabitants is the Red Corsairs under Huron Blackheart. Huron was once a loyal Space Marine of the Emperor, now a traitor, and commander of his own vast legion of ships that he uses to plunder the Imperium, the xenos, and even other Chaos Space Marine factions.&nbsp;</p><p>Huron suffers others to share the Maelstrom, simply because he either hasn't gotten around to eliminating them yet, they're proving hard to remove, or their presence offers him and his forces something they need. One of these threats, who sees the riches of the Maelstrom as ripe to plunder, along with Huron's resources and fleets, are the Aeldari Corsairs, the Eldritch Raiders. These two corsair factions share much in common, with their members made up of those who leave the structured formats of their previous lives, for plunder and destruction, free from the constraints of laws and moral codes.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>The Campaign Books</h2><p>The Maelstrom is a lawless place, full of factions vying for power, wealth, and plunder. The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant campaign books bring to life this area of the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> universe, with background and lore, new units and army compositions, and a new campaign. The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant is a set of 4 linked books, the first details the background for the Maelstrom, and the forces it contains, focusing on the Chaos Space Marines, the Red Corsairs led by Huron Blackheart, and the Aeldari, Eldritch Raiders led by Prince Yriel.</p><p>The second book, The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant - Crucible of Champions, lets you build a unique champion for your faction, with options to build 62 different champions across 21 factions, with additional options for 4 specific Space Marine chapters (Space Wolves, Dark Angels, Blood Angels, and Black Templars). Each included faction has 3 archetypes (except Drukhari, who have 2) to begin building your champion. Once selected, you add in a specialism, ability, and weapons to complete the build.</p><p>We built a Raven Guard Champion of the Chapter, with a heavy jump pack and Mk X Gravis armor, the tactical precision ability to make them accurate with the Forge Boltter we armed them with, and topped it off with a Power Fist in case they need to engage in close combat.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The third book, The Malestrom Raid and Ruin, includes a campaign for players to simulate warlords vying for power in the Maelstrom. Players in Raid and Ruin campaigns fight to gain notoriety points (NP) across 7 different challenges, like destroying your opponent's warlord in a battle. The first time you do this, you gain the Vengeful title and 3 NP, and by the third time you complete it, you gain the Imperious title, and your NP count rises to 5. The player with the most NP at the end of the campaign wins.</p><p>But being a space pirate isn't just about fame and glory, there are spoils to be taken too, and for each objective you control at the end of the battle, you can roll on the Spoils of War table. You can only choose to keep one result, of which there are 36 spoils of war to be won, and you keep it until the end of the next battle, when you will get the opportunity to roll again if you score objectives. Some of the spoils grant you bonus NP at the end of a battle, others special abilities like the Chart of Shadows that lets you bring a unit out of strategic reserves earlier, and the rest are weapons, like the Tyrant's Sceptre, which has 5 attacks, Ap -2, 3 damage, and strength equal to your NP.</p><p>The final book, The Maelstrom Lair of the Tryant - Detachments, is a booklet with new Detachments for Chaos Space Marines (Huron's Marauders and Renegade Warband), Aeldari (Eldritch Raiders and Corsir Coterie), Orks (Freebooter Krew), and the Leagues of Votann (Mercenary Oathband). All of these Detachments are available in the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/downloads/warhammer-40000/" rel="nofollow">downloads section</a> of the Warhammer Community site. Detachments are new with this edition of <em>40K</em> and give unique special rules for your forces, significantly changing the way factions play between detachment choices, and usually some restrictions on the units you can take.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Red Corsairs</h2><p>Alongside the Maelstrom campaign books, the Red Corsairs sail into <em>Warhammer 40K</em> with 2 new boxes, Huron Blackheart and the Masters of the Maelstrom, and the Lords of the Maelstrom battleforce.&nbsp;</p><p>Huron Blackheart and the Masters of the Maelstrom is a box similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-500-worlds-titus-review-titus-and-friends" rel="nofollow">Titus and the Wardens of Ultramar</a>, in that it contains the character Huron, who can deploy by himself, or attached to the rest of his retinue and another unit. Huron boosts the objective control of nearby Heretic Astartes infantry units and comes armed with the Tyrant's Claw and exalted power weapon, which have 6 attacks, strength 8, -3 AP, and 3 damage.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/40k-lair-of-the-tyrant-4.jpg?itok=sChsyQyW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>The Masters of the Maelstrom are a 5-model unit that contains 3 Chaos Space Marine specialists, a xenos, and a human fleet officer. They all come on a single datasheet, but each adds their own unique ability. The 3 Chaos Space Marines are Garreon, an apothecary who can return removed models to his unit or gain CP if a nearby unit is below starting strength. Garrix, a character hunter, comes armed with the Axe of Ending, which has anti-character 2+, scoring critical wounds on a roll of 2 or more, and precision, so they can target characters, even if they're hiding within a unit. Garlon, a psyker, whose Mind Wrench power also has precision to target characters, with 1 attack, -2AP, and D6+1 damage.</p><p>The Masters of the Maelstrom xenos is The Enforcer, a Tarellian, a race that has been mentioned several times in 40K lore, but doesn't have a faction of their own. The Enforcer can release her Barghesi companion (which also gets a miniature in the box), that once per battle, deals D3+1 mortal wounds to a unit within 12 inches, on a 2+. The final member of the Masters is Captain Sargotta, who allows you to redeploy up to 3 units from your force after deployment, better placing them to deal with the enemy threats after seeing their placement.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The Lords of the Maelstrom battleforce allows you to kickstart your Red Corsairs army, and includes a new Reave-Captain and 10x Red Corsairs Raiders, alongside 10x Legionaries, 5x Terminators, and 10x Traitor Guardsmen, which can all be upgraded with the included Red Corsairs upgrade kit (which has 5 Terminator and 10 Legionnaire shoulder pads and some new head and arm options) and transfers.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The Red Corsairs Raiders are experienced pirates, used to surging forward to plunder. This is represented through the infiltrator's special rule, which lets them set up further ahead of the rest of the force, and an objective control of 2, which rises to 3 after they destroy an enemy unit. They also have 3 wounds each, and for every 5 models, can add a power fist and melta gun to the unit, to give them some real staying power on objectives.</p><p>Leading the Lords of the Maelstrom is the new Reave-Captain, who loves to get into combat. After they charge, for the rest of the turn, their melee weapons gain 1 to strength and armor penetration, and they can reroll the charge roll if the target is within range of an objective marker. They can also join Raider units, and come with the infiltrators' special rule so they can set up ahead of the main army with them. They come armed with a power sword and bolt pistol, which you can swap for a power maul, which loses 2 attacks to the power sword but does double the damage, and a plasma pistol, which is just superior in every way to a bolt pistol.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Eldritch Raiders</h2><p>Trying to out-pirate the Red Corsairs and releasing alongside them are the Aeldari Eldritch Raiders, led by Prince Yriel in a new battleforce. The Eldritch Raiders Battleforce contains a whole host of new miniatures, including a new miniature for Prince Yriel and a new Vyper, the brand new units Kharseth and 10x Corsair Skyreavers, and 10x of the existing Corsair Voidscarred.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Prince Yriel can join either of the units that come in the box, and has a Piratical Hero ability that makes it easier for the unit he's in to hit and deal extra damage when they roll critical hits. Yriel is also pretty devastating in combat themselves, with the Spear of Twilight giving Yriel 5 attacks at strength 7, -3 AP, and dealing 3 damage. Accompanying Yriel is the Void Dreamer Kharseth, who can also join both units in the battleforce. Kharseth has an anti-infantry psychic attack with D6+2 attacks, which, along with dealing damage for the attack, can give a unit that it hits the Riven status, which increases the strength of attacks by Aledari units against them.</p><p>The new Corsair Skyreavers are crazy fast, with Scout 7 to get them moving straight away, and then a standard move of 12 inches. For every 5 models in the unit, you can take 2 special weapons from a selection of 4 (with no duplicates with 5 models, and a max of 2 per weapon at 10 models). They also have a Raid and Ruin special ability that lets them move D3+3 inches if not in combat at the end of the fight phase, or fall back D3+3 inches if they are in combat, making them very difficult to pin down, as you can withdraw ready to relocate next turn.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The new Vyper kit can be built as a Vyper armed with a bright lance, scatter laser, or starcannon, or it can be built as the new Starfang, which has the same core stat line as the Vyper, but also has scout 7 to move them up the board at the start of the game. The Starfang comes fitted with a fixed loadout of disintegrator cannon and Starfang grenade launcher. The Starfang can also give a friendly unit stealth at the start of your opponent's shooting phase with their hallucinogen grenades ability to make that unit slightly more difficult to hit.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Warhammer 40K The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant Final Thoughts?</h2><p>The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant pushes us ever closer to the narrative hook that will launch us into <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> 11th edition, gives us the Cruible of Champions rules for making your own hero, and the awesome Raid and Ruin campaign, which works perfectly for the 2 new piratical battleforces that release alongside this set. I've always been a fan of Huron's narrative, and the new Red Corsair's look awesome, and come with new great detachments to play. Hopefully GW release a Red Corsair boarding actions detachment soon, because they were absolutely made for it, and it would be a travesty if that opportunity was missed.</p><hr><p><em>The copies of</em> <strong>Warhammer 40K The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant, Red Corsairs, and the Eldritch Raiders&nbsp;</strong><em>used to produce this review were provided by Games Workshop.</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-maelstrom-lair-of-tyrant-review-pirate-vs-pirate]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apart from a new trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, Capcom's new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> also made an appearance at PlayStation's 'State of Play' this week.</p>
<p>The brand new trailer titled 'World View' gives us another glimpse at a recreation of New York, and also adds some backstory about the game's protagonist Hugh. This trailer ends on a bit of a shocking note, with Hugh and his android companion Diana being chased by an enemy threat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hugh and Diana as they traverse a 3D printed Times Square-like area, dominated by massive structures. What mysteries await them in this twisted lunar cityscape?"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven't already tried it out, there's a demo for Pragmata on the Switch 2 eShop that you can download right now. Capcom also announced earlier this week that this same demo has now reached one million "combined" downloads across all platforms.</p>
<p>This new hacking and shooting game will arrive on the Switch 2 on <strong>24th April 2026</strong>. Will you be picking it up on release? Have you tried out the demo yet? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>As part of Pokémon's 30th anniversary celebrations, Stern Pinball has now officially revealed its new Pokémon pinball machine.</p>
<p>It's available right now in "pro", "premium" and "limited edition" models. The limited edition is "limited" to 750 units globally, and prices range between $6,999 - $12,999, depending on the model. If you're interested, or happen to be a business owner, you can <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">contact Stern on its website</a> to find out about the availability of these machines and more details.</p>

<p>This machine promises to take trainers on an "unforgettable journey" across four distinct habitats as they battle their way through rival trainers and Team Rocket. It also integrates video clips from the original animated series, including the official theme song.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game begins with the player entering a random biome: forest, water, mountain, or desert. By hitting the ball at the proper targets on the board, you’ll discover, catch, and train new Pokémon partners. Occasionally, you’ll encounter the troublesome Team Rocket, and you’ll need to prevent them from capturing Pokémon during a frantic multiball sequence.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve scored enough points and completed specific activities in a biome, you’ll be able to take on a Gym Battle against a rival party of Pokémon. Complete all the biomes’ Gym Battles, and you’ll enter the Pokémon Arena. There’s even an opportunity to face off against Team Rocket’s boss, Giovanni, but only the most skilled pinball wizards are likely to make it that far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The premium and limited edition versions of the machine also feature an interactive electromagnet that "adds chaos" to the battle arena.</p>
<p>As part of the whole experience, trainers can use Stern's app to document the Pokémon they catch. Here's a bit about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Utilizing Stern Pinball’s award-winning Insider Connected, <em>Pokémon</em> by Stern Pinball elevates the experience by connecting Trainers and their adventures across machines and locations. When Trainers play Pokémon by Stern Pinball signed in with their Stern Insider Connected Account, the Pokémon they CATCH will be added to their Insider Connected Pokémon Collection, which can be viewed in the Insider Connect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're curious to see it in action, <a href="https://youtu.be/mJKxHwMiCJM">YouTube channel The Pinball Company</a> has gone hands on with the new Pokémon machine. The <a href="https://youtu.be/Z-g8SDhfWVc">YouTube channel Foxcitiespinball</a> has also uploaded a video of the Stern team explaining the new machine and the design.</p>

<p>YAPYAP sold half 1 million games in its first week on the market.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/yapyap/" id="3501">YAPYAP,</a> a co-op horror game where players use microphones to cast magic spells and wreak havoc in enemy wizards’ towers, was released on Steam in early February 2026. Within a week of its release, the game had sold 500,000 copies. This is despite the game still smoothing out some rough edges.</p>



<h2 id="h-maison-bap-reacts-to-yapyap-s-major-milestone">Maison Bap Reacts to YAPYAP’s Major Milestone</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/maison-bap/" id="3502">Maison Bap</a>, the game’s publisher and developer, shared a message of gratitude upon reaching the milestone. They noted that over the coming weeks, they will continue to fix bugs and polish the game. They will then focus on additional content once all edges are smoothed.</p>



<p>“We also know many of you are eager to hear about future updates, but before jumping into new features and content, we want to make sure the game is fully stable and smooth for everyone. Once that’s locked in, we’ll start planning the fun stuff,” the team said in a message that was shared on Steam on February 9.</p>



<p>The game is still on a small introductory discount. It is currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3834090/YAPYAP/">Steam for $7.99.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/reanimal-review</link>
            <guid>1435972</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>“Hell is not other people. Hell is yourself.” - Ludwig Wittgenstein</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It begins with a group of children looking down a hole. A boy in a hood, the remains of a hangman’s noose around his neck, pilots a boat adrift at sea. I do not know where he has come from or where he is going or if he was one of the ones staring into that well’s abyss. I only know the way forward. Red lights peak through the dark and fog. They are my compass, and I follow them. Buoys. Where they guide me, I do not know, but there is no other path. The ocean is so vast, and my boat is so small. For a time, I am alone. At the fourth buoy, the boy stops the boat and pulls aboard a girl. When he reaches for the hare mask covering her face, she pins him to the small outboard’s wooden bottom, her hands ripping at his mask until he kicks her away. They stare at each other from opposite ends of the boat. It might as well be a chasm. “I thought you were dead,” the boy offers. “Where are the others?” the girl asks. The boy doesn’t know. She takes a lantern and stands at our boat’s bow. The buoys are still our guide, but the girl lights the way forward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time I reach the end of Reanimal, the latest horror puzzle platformer from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review">Little Nightmares</a> developer Tarsier, I have forgotten all of this, and lost track of what parts of this opening are most important. I am too busy trying to make meaning from what I have seen, too focused on trying to connect the pieces of Reanimal’s puzzle, to understand how we got here. But stories, at least the good ones, the ones that know what they’re doing, tell you what they’re about from the beginning. And Reanimal is a very good story. Remember this, it tells you. Remember <em>all of this</em>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Together – I play the boy, my co-op partner plays the girl. There is no way to select who plays who; it simply works out this way – we sail through jagged cliffs, past mines larger than our boat, bisect a forest of jagged, barren trees. Then the banks of the river we have followed fade, and a large industrial building looms out of the fog ahead of us. It is a remarkable image in a game of remarkable images. Reanimal certainly knows how to set a scene. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is very little overt explanation.The boy and the girl are brother and sister, but this fact is never told to you. You learn it through the way they help each other up, comfort each other when things go wrong. Their relationship is something you experience, the questions largely left for you to answer. Why does she attack him after he fishes her out of the sea? What happened to them before they were in the boat? Reanimal unspools its story slowly, and asks you to fill in the gaps yourself. To remember what you’ve seen, to put together the imagery, the symbols, notice patterns in the shapes throughout its world. I’m unsure of what they’re after until we find another child separated from us by steel bars blocking a drain pipe. “You came back,” he whispers. “I knew you would. You should leave… while you still can.” But we don’t. The girl’s earlier question is the answer to mine. We are here to save the others. Our friends.</p><p>Reanimal can be played alone, but it's more meaningful to take the journey with someone else.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We navigate broken buildings, push through dark forests, leap across gaps, crouch into places only a child can fit. Often, we need to work together. The world is so big, and we are so small. It takes two of us to lift a metal trapdoor. I hold a lever to still a rotating metal shaft so my partner can pilot the girl across. On the other side, she knocks down a piece of wood so I can cross a gap. Reanimal is simple, elegant. You walk, run, jump, interact with and carry objects, boost one another to ledges neither of you can reach alone, and occasionally fight off foes in the clumsy way a child might. Little distinguishes the boy from the girl, save that she can attach her lantern to her hip while carrying something else. The boy’s lighter, on the other hand, is only usable if his hands are free. It’s a subtle distinction, but an important one, and my partner and I often made significant choices about who would do what based on how much light it would cost us, and whether we felt we could sacrifice it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reanimal can be played alone, but I found it more meaningful to take the journey with someone else, to coordinate and work together, to congratulate ourselves on our success and discuss our failures before trying again. Like the boy and the girl on screen, we are experiencing this together. Like them, we are not alone. That subtle distinction – of working with a living, breathing person – made it much better than it would have been had I spent the whole experience with a computer-controlled girl who always did exactly what she was supposed to. That’s not what this story is about, and I am deeply grateful that, in an era which has largely abandoned local co-op, Reanimal offers it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Reanimal Switch 2 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Reanimal’s gameplay and the choices it offers are satisfying, but simple. It is less a game you play and more a world you move through and experience without the obvious artifice of a video game. There is no HUD, no meters, no minimap. The camera is often fixed to show you exactly what Tasier wants you to see, and the sense of visual composition here is remarkable. Even horror can be beautiful when framed the right way. Often, the answers to the gameplay questions Reanimal presents are obvious – though not less satisfying for it – and the only way forward, though occasionally we get lost. What carries us ahead are not the puzzles themselves, but the desire to see what’s next. If you are expecting great leaps from the studio’s work on the first two Little Nightmares, you will not find it here, and I’m not bothered by that. You don’t return to your favorite restaurant angry the menu hasn’t changed, and here the chef is a master of his craft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The environment is not our only obstacle. We start to notice the horrors as we search for the missing wheels to a handcar. A body leans against a wall, its belly a gaping hole left by something that forced its way out – or in. A plunger applied to a clogged toilet reveals a key and the deformed, deflated skin of what was once, perhaps, a man; his features are off, deformed, his face caught between that of a person and a pig.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we’re up against isn’t obvious until we come across the second of the wheels we need for the handcart, and the man/animal skins around us come to life, slithering after us like snakes. We do the only thing we can do: we run. It gets worse from there; the first living human we encounter is impossibly tall, his face a Halloween mask of sagging skin, empty eye sockets, a maw that is always open. He skitters after us like a spider, biting our heads off if he catches us. He is not the worst of it; not even close. We spend most of Reanimal running from something. I don’t want to say more. These are terrors you really should see for yourself. </p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Puzzle Games</h3><p>I just reviewed The Talos Principle 2. Here's how it stacks up against my favorite puzzle games.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/edgarallanbro/lists/wills-favorite-puzzle-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">But I can say this: the place the boy and girl have returned to is wrong. There is a theory that hell is the worst moments of your life, replayed over and over again, without ceasing, simultaneously something you recognize and fresh at the same time. What does it say that the boy and girl have seemingly returned here by choice after having escaped? “I told you to leave,” the boy we encountered tells us later. Or are they all trapped here, together, in a hell we can’t leave? Only one thing is certain: we are off the edge of the map. Here be dragons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we continue, the world opens up to us. We navigate dark forests, the flooded ruins of cities, active warzones, and until the end, whatever shattered this place is only partially clear. Our journey is only partially linear. Returning to the boat allows us to explore, to explore this flooded place and find what lies off the beaten path. It is here that Reanimal is most obviously a video game, rewarding the curious with new masks, collectible concept art, and so on, but it never feels out of place or forced, and doesn’t detract from the atmosphere. Nor does the occasional replay of a chase sequence because you don’t initially know what to do or where to go, which is enough to spell your end. Reanimal’s atmosphere, its art, its sense of place and character and mystery carry the day at every turn, through the odd confusion, annoyance, or visual bug. It compelled us to see it through to the end, to understand the tale it was trying to tell in its roughly six-hour journey through hell. I think I understand. But I know there is much we missed, and I want to return to see it through, and see what, if anything, changes as a result.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Remember this, Reanimal says as it shows you something. All the pieces matter. It is a horror story, a journey through hell made up of the simple, elegant gameplay that Tarsier has honed to a feather's edge over the last decade. There are occasional frustrations: a chase where the way forward is not obvious, a path that is easy to miss. What will keep you going is the story, the world, the characters, the sense that beyond all of this lies answers, the act of working together in a world where the scariest things are often not monsters, but other people, and what we are capable of inflicting on one another. What kept me going was playing it with another person, sharing that experience, and working together to discover what was at the bottom of that hole, and how that boy ended up in a boat, and his sister nearly drowned at sea. Going through hell together, wondering if it was something that happened to them, or the world they – we – had made.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/reanimal-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega </a>says <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/sonic-rumble/" target="_blank">Sonic Rumble</a>&nbsp;underperformed and that, overall, the value of the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/angry-birds/" target="_blank">Angry Birds</a>&nbsp;developer&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rovio-entertainment/" target="_blank">Rovio&nbsp;</a>was written down, resulting in an impairment loss of more than</span> $200 million.</p>



<p>Sega Sammy Holdings Inc., Sega’s parent company, recently <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported its Q3 earnings</a> for fiscal year 2026. Noted in the earnings that, as it pertained to Rovio’s business, there was a recognized impairment loss of approximately 31.3 billion yen. As of this writing, that amounts to about $205 million.</p>



<p>Sega completed<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/angry-birds-acquisition/" id="6935"> its acquisition of Rovio</a> in August 2023.</p>







<h2 id="h-factors-surrounding-rovio-s-underperforming-quarter">Factors Surrounding Rovio’s Underperforming Quarter</h2>



<p>In the Q3 presentation, Sega attributes Rovio’s performance falling short of initial expectations to “rapid changes in the market environment and other factors.” One of those factors was the collaborative mobile title Sonic Rumble, which struggled to meet key performance indicators.</p>



<p>Moving forward, Sega plans to reverse this momentum by focusing specifically on Angry Birds and Sega IPs, including Sonic, for future games. They also see the release of the third Angry Birds movie, set for December, as another factor driving hopeful increased traction for the brand.</p>







<h2>The Future of Sonic</h2>



<p>Sonic Rumble, which is also available for free on Steam, may have underperformed, but the blue blur always bounces back. It’s Sonic’s 35th anniversary this year. So far, no official game releases have been scheduled in celebration, but the Sonic Team has put out a new audio drama in the Sonic universe. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-unveils-noir-sonic-audio-drama-the-chaotix-casefiles/" id="171225">here</a>.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the filings, Sega announced plans to make mainstay IPs a focus not just in mobile releases but also in traditional console releases. Read more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-plans-four-major-mainstay-ip-releases-in-next-fiscal-year/" id="176620">here</a>.</p>

Featuring a variety of game modes that ranged from standard team deathmatch to a unique encounter that saw one player assume the role of Old Snake – the offshoot tied together elements from the fourth mainline Metal Gear Solid game for players to enjoy in an online setting. It received several post-launch expansions through the years before Konami <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/15/metal-gear-online-ending"><u>shut down the servers</u></a> in 2012.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bringing back MGS4 multiplayer for Master Collection Vol. 2 seems to be too tall an order for the publisher, but the second installment in its series of collections won’t be completely without an online component. Konami’s website also confirms that, unlike the first half of the bundle, its Peace Walker port will support online multiplayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details on its returning Co-Ops mode promise classic team gameplay for the Big Boss era of the series, allowing two-to-four players to complete missions together. Versus Ops is for the more competitive-minded fans and features matches for up to six players. Local wireless play is also included, but only for the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 versions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the lack of Metal Gear Online support for MGS4 may come as a sad surprise for fans of the original PlayStation 3 release, other tweaks coming to the base experience may pique their interest.

It’s unclear if Peace Walker will also benefit from visual adjustments, but it will at least come with custom controls. Ghost Babel, a bonus Game Boy Color entry from 2000, will not see the return of its two-player Vs. Battle mode, but it will come with screen filters, pixel-perfect screen settings, a rewind function, and custom controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 has an August 27, 2026, release date for PC via Steam, Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S.

<p>When Ubisoft announced that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake was canceled</a>, it was also revealed that five other games were ending. Insider Gaming has learned the six games that have been cancelled at Ubisoft.</p>



<p>First reported on Insider Gaming Weekly, Insider Gaming understands that the following six games were canceled:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</strong> – Canceled after being first announced in 2020.</li>



<li><strong>Project Ether</strong> – In development since 2019, which was canceled, but has morphed, in a way, into a newer project. Believed to have been in development at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" id="168333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Halifax</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Project Pathfinder </strong>– Known previously as Project U</li>



<li><strong>Project Crest</strong> – A World War 2 extraction shooter</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</strong> – Stopping support</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Singularity </strong>– A new mobile Assassin’s Creed Game</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with the game cancellations that were previously announced—confirmed above—there was also a multiplayer Assassin’s Creed that had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-assassins-creed-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly been shuttered</a>. That game, however, isn’t a part of this group. </p>



<p>One game that is still coming is the Assassin’s Creed: Blag Flag Remake. The latest rumors suggest that a reveal will take place in April after being delayed out of the current fiscal year.</p>



<p>If you want to go directly to the moment in the show below, it takes place <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/rZcgQAfLRd4?si=k8dedz7N5aQ7E0D9&amp;t=3247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around the 54:07 mark</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Seven years ago, this would have been my weekly recommendation of what to play – after all, I did put over 1,000 hours into the original Overwatch – but if you told me coming into 2026 that I'd be back into it, I would have laughed at you. But here we are; Overwatch's recent complete overhaul, which saw the game stripped of the "2" in its title, made me curious enough to jump back in. As a regular player from 2016 to 2019, Overwatch sits near the top of my personal favorite games of all time, but following the announcement of Overwatch 2 back in 2019, the title fell off hard. Content slowed to a drip as the team focused on Overwatch 2's story content, most of which never saw the light of day. Then, when Overwatch 2 arrived, I still enjoyed it (I <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/overwatch-2/a-heroic-return">gave it an 9 out of 10</a>, after all), but it was a far cry from the novelty and excitement surrounding the original game during those first several years.</p><p>This reworking of the entire game is so much more than just a simple title rebrand; in addition to a more prominent story, complete with Blizzard's famously great cinematics, it's also refocusing on what players love. A permanent 6v6 mode is there for those who favor the original Overwatch team compositions. A ton of new heroes are joining the roster this year (including five heroes just this week), completely flipping any existing Meta on its head. And speaking of Meta, the new Conquest Meta Event has you pick a faction and fight for it over the course of a five-week event, earning rewards every step of the way. As someone who hasn't played the game for several years now, I'm struggling to not only rewire my rusty muscle memory, but also relearn my favorite heroes, as many of them have received reworks in my absence. It's a little overwhelming, and many of my old strategies now fail, but I'm having a blast dipping my toe back in. And when I am able to go on a run as one of my old favorites, I'm reminded precisely why I fell in love with this game in the first place.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/13/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-13]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-devs-know-safeguard-has-problems-and-are-looking-into-it-2000668703</link>
            <guid>1435834</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over a decade ago, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em> introduced a new multiplayer game mode to the franchise: <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Safeguard_(game_mode)">Safeguard</a>. This team-based mode had players pushing and defending a walking robot from another team tasked with stopping it. It was very good. But the mode’s last appearance in a main game was in 2018. So I was over the moon to see the mode return as part of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s second season. And while I have some issues with it, Safeguard is still a lot of fun in 2026.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">Booting up Safeguard in the new season of <em>COD: BLOPS7</em></a> was like returning to an old friend’s house after years away to hang out. Something I’ve always appreciated about the mode was how it gave the defense a way to fight back that wasn’t just “Kill the other team.” You can instead focus your damage on the robot, and if you do enough, it will stop moving and have to reboot. This gives less skilled players a way to help without having to hunt down highly skilled <em>COD</em> pros each match. It also leads to an interesting dynamic where a defending team can over-focus on taking out the bot and let the attackers flank them and wipe them out. But focus too much on the attackers, and the bot will walk its way into the checkpoint, and you’ll lose before you realize it.</p>

  <p>This time around, the robot you are defending is a four-legged Boston Dynamics-like mechanical dog. The bots were previously bipedal humanoids, which was fine, but I’m far more into guarding a robo dog than a random mechanical man. But it felt to me as if this robot dog might be moving faster than the past bots had in Safeguard. So I talked to the devs behind the mode, and they confirmed that, no, the bot is moving at a “pace consistent with previous” versions of Safeguard.</p> <p>However, “<em>BO7</em>’s tighter map layouts, updated pathing, and the new animation set can make its movement feel faster, even though the underlying speed hasn’t changed much,” said a Treyarch spokesperson. They also confirmed they are looking at data to decide if the bot should move a bit slower.</p>

 <p>Another issue with the current version of Safeguard in <em>Black Ops 7</em> is that you can sometimes win, but still lose. Basically, the game mode is built around how fast you get the bot to the checkpoint. Each team gets a shot at pulling this off. If the first team does it in let’s say two minutes, then the other team goes, and if they get the bot there in two minutes and three seconds, <a href="https://youtu.be/LegP5qViODY">they’ll lose despite the bot making it to the checkpoint</a>. This feels bad, and Treyarch tells me they are looking into this.</p>

 <p>“We’re evaluating options to end the second round early in situations where the attacking team hasn’t pushed the Robot far enough in time,” Treyarch told <em>Kotaku</em>. “And we’re looking at this alongside the broader UI improvements already in progress. Our goal is to make the rules and win conditions as clear and intuitive as possible for all players.” The team is also open to bringing back overtime, which isn’t included in Safeguard right now.</p> <p>Besides those issues, and an odd bug that let people knock the bot out with a combat axe that has already been patched, I’ve really enjoyed playing Safeguard again. I think it’s a great example of how <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s gunplay can be incredibly successful in modes that aren’t simply about killing each other.</p>

 <p>I hope the mode sticks around past season two and, like Kill Confirmed and other fan favorites, return in future <em>Call of Duty</em> games. You don’t even have to have a robot for this mode to work. If the next <em>Call of Duty</em> isn’t set in the future but instead WW2 or something, fine, use a jeep. That would still let me enjoy this mode with my friends, even those who aren’t great at FPS games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Rovio's performance "fell significantly short of initial forecast"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="a8a7a553b8c1b"><a title="Sonic Angry Birds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a8a7a553b8c1b/sonic-angry-birds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>SEGA Sammy has published its <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf">Q3 2025/26 financial report</a>, and it's a pretty mixed bag for the multimedia giant, with losses reported in multiple different areas.</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest piece of news comes from Rovio's side of the business. Sega acquired the Angry Bird developer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/04/its-official-sega-is-buying-angry-birds-maker-rovio">in 2023</a> Sega reports has fallen "significantly short of initial forecast due to rapid changes in the market environment and other factors".</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_forecast_e.pdf">reported an impairment loss</a> of ¥30.4 billion ($198.6 million), citing increased competition and the rapid deterioration of user bases. This meant that "Rovio found it difficult to advance its initially planned business development".</p>
<p>A number of titles haven't met Sega's own internal targets, with development delays and cancellations also a factor. <strong>Sonic Rumble</strong>, the mobile game which Rovio co-developed, also fell short of expectations, particularly around customer acquisition.</p>
<p>It's not just with Rovio, though — while net sales remain steady and are 4% up year-on-year, operating income and ordinary income are both down, 54.6% and 51.8% respectively. Entertainment Contents has also dropped 31%.</p>
<p>Sega only reports two full game releases for the third quarter: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> on Switch 2, and <strong>Football Manager 26</strong>, the latter of which needed "a series of updates to address post-launch bugs, etc. and improved the gameplay environment". And in general, full game titles have reported "stagnant growth".</p>

<p>It's not all bad news, though: Sega is planning to release "four major new titles for mainstay IPs" next financial year, with a continued focus on expanding the trans-media business (movies, TV shows, merch, etc.). Daniel Svärd, once King's head of live game studios, will be appointed as Rovio's COO.</p>
<p>All in all, not a great showing for the company, and Sega has revised its net sales expectations to rise slightly — ¥490 billion / $3.2 billion, up from ¥475 billion / $3.1 billion — while operating income expectations have been lowered to ¥40 billion / $261.5 million, from ¥53 billion / $346.6 million.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> has <em>just</em> launched, and that will be included in the final report for the fiscal year ending March 2026. So that may help turn the tides a little. And 2026 marks the 35th anniversary for the Sonic series, so the future should be blue — in a good way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that user-submitted <strong>Steam Reviews</strong> have often been <strong>quite controversial</strong>, especially during so-called "<strong>review bombings</strong>". In these instances, specific games have been targeted with a deluge of negative reviews, thus <strong>crashing the overall user review score</strong> on Valve's platform.</p>



<p>One of the earliest scenarios was the review bombing of <strong>Firewatch</strong>, <strong>Campo Santo</strong>'s acclaimed adventure game released in 2016. The following year, YouTuber <strong>PewDiePie</strong> <strong>racially insulted a player</strong> during a livestream in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (<strong>PUBG</strong>), and Campo Santo's founder <strong>Sean Vanaman</strong> asked YouTube to remove all of PewDiePie's videos from the platform. However, in retaliation, PewDiePie's legion of followers went en masse on Steam to <a href="https://wccftech.com/firewatch-negative-reviews-pewdiepie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>leave negative reviews on Firewatch</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Just a week after the controversy, Valve <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-histograms-help-review-bombing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>added histograms to user-submitted Steam Reviews</strong></a> to help them make sense of these situations. However, review bombings continued:</p>



<ul>
<li>In 2018, SEGA's <strong>Total War: Rome II</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/tw-rome-ii-review-bombed-female-generals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got review bombed</a> <strong>due to the presence in the game of too many female generals</strong></li>



<li>In 2020, CAPCOM's <strong>Monster Hunter World</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-world-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-due-to-racist-joke-in-the-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a temporary blast of negative reviews</a> from Chinese players following what they perceived to be <strong>a racist joke in the Monster Hunter movie</strong></li>



<li>In 2023, Blizzard's <strong>Diablo IV</strong> was <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-is-already-being-review-bombed-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately review bombed when it launched on Steam</a>, with many user reviews blatantly criticizing the studio <strong>without even touching the game's actual content</strong></li>



<li>In 2024, Sony Santa Monica's <strong>God of War: Ragnarök</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was briefly the target of a review bombing</a> when Sony still <strong>required users to register for a PlayStation account to play single player games</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>That said, in some instances, negative Steam reviews <strong>can be helpful to the developer if they point out actual problems with the game</strong>. One such scenario is whenever there are performance issues. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/505101717860253962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">With the latest Steam Client Beta</a>, Valve has introduced the "<strong>option to attach hardware specs when writing or updating a Steam User Review on a game's store page</strong>", which could be really useful for developers as they diagnose performance problems mentioned in their game's Steam reviews. </p>



<p>The new Steam Client Beta also introduced another option: to send "<strong>anonymized frame rate data</strong>" to Valve. This data will be stored "without connection to your Steam account, but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on." Valve claims <strong>it will help </strong><span><strong>improve Steam and overall game compatibility</strong>, with a focus on devices running&nbsp;<strong>SteamOS</strong>, such as</span> the Steam Deck.</p>
