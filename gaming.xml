            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/607646/world-of-warcraft-player-housing-details<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After 20 years, <em>World of Warcraft</em> is finally adding player housing. During its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/0rEfOTxr59o?si=pyWkjBlqsZZ0IuAa"><em>Warcraft</em> 30th Anniversary Direct</a> last year, Blizzard delighted players with the surprise announcement that the feature — a long-time staple in other MMOs — was on the way. Now the studio has revealed a bit more information <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24176592">with a new blog</a> explaining how it’s all supposed to work.</p><p>In the past, <em>WoW</em> has obliquely flirted with the concept of player housing with the garrison feature from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/26/7297125/world-of-warcraft-warlords-draenor-review-pc-mac-mmo"><em>Warlords of Draenor</em></a> expansion in 2014. Players had their own home base or “garrisons” that they could customize from a pool of buildings, but they couldn’t invite others in to see them or have any say over decor. Player housing, on the other hand, is meant to give players greater control over everything.</p><p>According to Blizzard there are three principles driving the development of player housing in Azeroth: self-expression, sociability, and longevity. The team wants players to be able easily customize their houses and socialize with their friends and guildmates within a feature that’s meant to last for expansions to come.</p><p>Initially, Blizzard plans on implementing only two housing areas, one for each faction. These houses will be arranged into neighborhoods that are either public with everyone free to come and go as they please, or private neighborhoods established and maintained by friend groups or guilds. Decor for these homes will be obtained either by questing or purchasing and are meant to reflect all the different aesthetics of the game’s numerous races, cultures, and locations that make up <em>WoW</em>’s ever expanding world. </p><p>Interestingly,<em> WoW</em> has also said it wants to make player housing available for everyone which included a very pointed shot across the bow at one of <em>WoW</em>’s biggest competitors —<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em> — which has had player housing for several years. As a player of the “critically acclaimed MMORPG,” I can tell you the requirements for obtaining housing (and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/buying-a-house-in-final-fantasy-14-left-me-a-broken-woman/">the hoops you have to go through to actually get and keep one</a>) <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24115574/how-to-get-a-house-apartment-lottery-wards-plots">are so onerous</a> that it’s never been worth pursuing. It’s good that Blizzard is differentiating its housing initiative from others by making it clear what players can expect in that regard.</p><p>“If you want a house, you can have a house,” Blizzard’s post read. “No exorbitant requirements or high purchase costs, no lotteries, and no onerous upkeep (and if your subscription lapses, don’t worry, your house doesn’t get repossessed!).” </p><p>Blizzard hasn’t given a timeline on when housing will be implemented. The company released its latest expansion <em>War Within</em>, last year as the first part of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2023/11/3/23945426/blizzard-announces-the-next-three-wow-expansions">three-expansion long continuous story</a> dubbed “The Worldsoul Saga.” Housing could come as soon as a <em>War Within</em> patch or when the next expansion, <em>Midnight</em>, releases likely sometime in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A select group of players were invited to take part in Larian Studios' stress test for Patch 8, which is still ongoing. However, Larian has already put together an update that addresses some of the bugs that have been uncovered in Patch 8.</p><p>As laid out in <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/stress-test-update-1_135" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new post by Larian Studios</a>, there don't appear to be any game-breaking bugs in Patch 8. But there are issues that have come up in several areas, including the newly added Photo Mode. Now, creatures will supposedly obey the "look at the camera" command, and dragonborn won't lose their tails in the pictures. </p><p>Cross-play is another big addition of Patch 8, which is meant to connect players from consoles and PCs. This update only has a small number of fixes, but Larian notes that "we are still investigating instances of cross-play not working as intended." Other changes are meant to smooth out unintended effects, including an "issue causing the Flaming Fist armor to clip and generally freak out a bit."</p><p>Patch 8 Update 1 is expected to go live later today, but only for Baldur's Gate 3 players who were invited to take part in the stress test. Everyone else will get the complete Patch 8 after it receives refinement from Larian. After Larian wraps up its work on Patch 8, the studio will turn its full attention to its next project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>. Baldur's Gate 3 is almost certainly going to get a sequel, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">will be developed by another studio</a>.</p><p>You can find the Patch 8 Update 1 notes below.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Fixed containers inside inventories not scattering their contents when they get destroyed, which could potentially lead to key quest items getting lost for good.</li><li>Fixed a bug causing Oath of the Crown paladins to lose spell slots instead of gaining them when levelling up.</li><li>Fixed an issue where picking up items from the ground in multiplayer could then block movement via the controller stick.</li><li>Fixed the Wild Shape: Panther's Prowl action and Prowling condition not working correctly.</li><li>Fixed a bug where items getting added to the inventory would lose their conditions. This could cause, for example, the Elemental Cleaver buff to disappear when the imbued weapon is thrown.</li><li>Shadow Blade will now retain the behavior of being locked to the caster when upcast.</li></ul><h3>Photo Mode</h3><ul><li>Added an in-game pop-up for Photo Mode that triggers at the beach at the start of the game and can be found in the Journal.</li><li>Updated Photo Mode's screenshot function on Steam Deck so that it uses Steam's proprietary screenshot function, so you can access your photos more readily from the Steam Screenshots page.</li><li>Prevented characters from being able to pop into private cutscenes while activating Photo Mode when playing in multiplayer.</li><li>Hid the 'Toggle Photo Preview' legend while taking screenshots via Steam's screenshot function.</li><li>Fixed Photo Mode making the screen go blurry when opened on split screen.</li><li>Added camera shutter SFX when taking a photo in Photo Mode.</li><li>Fixed the Attacking and Jumping poses for wolves.</li><li>Fixed a cross appearing in the middle of the screen when the Vignette is at its thickest setting.</li><li>Fixed some creatures not listening when you select the 'Look At Camera' option.</li><li>Fixed the game sometimes freezing when switching quickly between tabs in Photo Mode.</li><li>Improved the Depth of Field sliders so the strength and distance scale in proportion to the slider itself.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing dragonborn tails to appear detached from the body.</li><li>The Grasping Vine's poses now work correctly.</li></ul><h3>Cross-Play</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue that could get the client stuck in a loading screen if the client unfriends the host and then clicks 'Join Party' after re-adding the host.</li><li>Fixed some of the PS5 splashscreens not showing up when they should.</li><li>Fixed a crash at the start of combat.</li></ul><h3>Subclasses</h3><ul><li>The Booming Blade tooltip now updates its values when upcast.</li><li>Fixed an inaccurate bonus value in the Rakish Audacity tooltip.</li><li>Updated Toll the Dead and Bursting Sinew to work with Potent Cantrip and deal half damage on saves.</li><li>Fixed Pact of the Blade's Extra Attack being added to Deepened Pact even if you didn't choose Pact of the Blade.</li></ul><h3>Art</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue causing the Flaming Fist armor to clip and generally freak out a bit.</li></ul><h3>UI</h3><ul><li>Fixed a bug with Gale's donation UI preventing you from feeding him magical items.</li><li>All of the Hexblade's class actions and subclass features are now shown correctly in Character Creation.</li><li>Fixed button or keyboard shortcut inputs in the UI sometimes not working.</li><li>Fixed some Reaction tooltips like Divine Allegiance not showing some values correctly in the description.</li><li>Fixed a bug causing the UI to lock up when rapidly switching between keyboard and mouse input and controller input.</li><li>Fixed a bug where opening the Main Menu on controller wouldn't automatically select the 'Resume' option at the top of the menu.</li><li>Fixed the condition icons on the party line getting duplicated when transitioning between acts during cross-play.</li><li>Fixed some settings that were missing their wrap-around navigation functionality on controller, preventing you from looping from the last option back to the first option with the same button input.</li><li>Fixed a bug where you'd have to deselect your current passive when respeccing a character before selecting a new one. Now, you can just click the new one.</li><li>Fixed a bug that caused the toggleable Illithid Powers to disappear from the Character Sheet and be uninteractable in the Illithid Powers UI.</li><li>Fixed player avatars not showing up in the multiplayer/cross-play lobby.</li></ul><h3>Scripting</h3><ul><li>With 12 new subclasses arriving in Patch 8, we’ve rechecked some achievements, including ensuring the armed version of Stunning Strike no longer counts as an unarmed attack for the Fists of Fury achievement, and its unarmed variant now does.</li><li>Monks' Unarmed Strike bonus action now also correctly counts toward the Action Surge achievement.</li></ul><h3>Crashes</h3><ul><li>Fixed a crash when trying to start a game from a lobby multiple times.</li><li>Fixed several crashes and freezes related to the UI.</li><li>Fixed a crash on Vulkan when taking a photo in Photo Mode.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/esa-iicon-e3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the minds that brought you the alliterative Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), the ESA today announced the Interactive Innovation Conference, which they are calling "iicon" and not I2, and which is set to take place in Las Vegas in 2026.</p><p>According to the ESA’s <a href="https://www.theesa.com/entertainment-software-association-unveils-iicon-game-changing-thought-leader-summit-to-harness-the-power-of-interactive-entertainment-and-shape-the-future-of-business-and-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, iicon will be “a first-of-its-kind event designed to connect visionaries, thought leaders and innovators from across industries to harness the power of interactive entertainment.” Who are those visionaries? Participants confirmed so far include EA, Epic, Microsoft, Sony, Take-Two, Ubisoft, Square Enix, and Nintendo, among others. What are the industries these visionaries hail from across? Video games.&nbsp;</p><p>You might now be asking yourself what about this is, as the ESA states, first-of-its-kind, and not just a more embarrassingly-named E3. It looks like the “invitation-only” conference aims to focus on where video games connect to other fields, with the event’s <a href="https://www.iicon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> saying that “iicon promises to bring together a broad spectrum of sectors that converge with interactive entertainment, including film, television, and music, as well as sports, healthcare, education, finance, and more.” The site promises that “attendees will gain exclusive access to visionary keynotes, engaging discussions and workshops, and elite networking opportunities,” which would suggest more of a DICE or GDC-style event than E3’s presentations and show floor.&nbsp;</p><p>The press release quotes several game industry execs sweatily insisting that video games are interesting to fields outside of video games. “The games industry is constantly evolving, and the intersection with other disciplines is more pronounced than ever before,” says <a href="https://aftermath.site/amazon-lays-off-180-employees-in-its-games-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Games</a> VP Christoph Hartmann. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ubisoft-closes-another-studio-announces-layoffs-at-3-more-as-part-of-ongoing-efforts-to-prioritize-projects-and-reduce-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a>’s Laurent Detoc says that “video games push the boundaries of technology and creativity, extending far beyond entertainment.” With companies like <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros.</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/editorial/playstation-goes-to-the-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> desperately trying to turn their games into everything that isn’t games in order to make lines across the world go up, it feels like iicon is an attempt to pivot away from E3’s gamer reputation, with the iicon site encouraging potential attendees to go “beyond entertainment” and “align your brand with a rapidly growing industry… being used to drive positive growth in the areas that matter most.”&nbsp;</p><p>E3, which began in 1995, was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2023/12/12/e3-permanently-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially cancelled</a> in 2023, after several years of decline and the impact of covid on the games industry and live events. <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geoff Keighley</a> has done his best to give E3 a run for its money and fill the space left by its absence, with the leg up of “Keigh-3” being a much more fun name than “iicon.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The fluctuating map pool of Counter-Strike keeps the iconic first-person shooter from getting stagnant, but CS2 players have not gotten to (officially) experience Cache yet. In fact, Cache has not been in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-adds-train-to-map-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the “active duty map pool”</a> for years, and the last time it was played at a Major was before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>So where is Cache?</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-cache-not-in-counter-strike-2">Why Is Cache Not in Counter-Strike 2?</h2>



<p>Cache is not in CS2 yet because the the original map creator, Shawn “FMPONE” Snelling, is still remaking it. According to the creator’s Discord, a portion of the map areas are complete, but this update was last made in July 2024. The areas that are supposedly complete are the A site, A Main, A Long, B Halls, B Checkers, B Site, Garage, Middle, and the T Spawn. This leaves areas like CT Spawn, A Truck, Highway, Z, Heaven, and Tree as potentially still being worked on.</p>



<p>FMPONE is one of the three original creators of Cache for CS:GO, along with Sal “Volcano” Garozzo and Lenz “penE” Monath. While the other two have gone on to other projects, FMPONE has created other maps such as Santorini and Thera. However, those maps never reached the active duty map pool, and fans continued to clamor for a remade Cache.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Back in late 2023, after CS2 was originally announced, FMPONE <a href="https://x.com/FMPONE/status/1645147213205520385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did confirm</a> that he would remake Cache. However, he opted to focus on creating his new maps first. Still, throughout 2024, FMPONE released a series of images teasing the return of Cache and showing progress on the remake. Every update that’s been posted has been met with a wave of excitement from long-time players who are eagerly awaiting the debut of a new look Cache.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-cache-coming-to-cs2">When is Cache Coming to CS2?</h2>



<p>The last public update fans saw of Cache though came back in October, with a collection of screenshots showing T spawn, the CT truck angle of A site, and other areas. Prior to this update, fans were treated to new screenshots every month. But as of February 2025, it’s been more than three months since the last Cache update. Is FMPONE focused on other things at this time? Or is the radio silence building to a soon-to-be-revealed surprise launch?</p>

            <p>
Entrepreneurially minded <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> players are about to get a whole new set of options, courtesy of the new Businesses &amp; Hobbies expansion - which'll enable the likes of player-run pet cafes and tattoo parlours when it launches on 6th March - depending what other DLC you own.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's Businesses &amp; Hobbies Expansion Pack - the 18th major expansion since its release back in 2014 - is, as its name suggests, focused on two key areas. Starting with hobbies, there's talk of Hobby Meet-ups, where Sims can socialise with like-minded individuals, learn to master their chosen craft from mentors during Classes and Lecturers, and perhaps even become mentors themselves if they become sufficiently skilled.
</p>
<p>
Business seems to be where the bulk of the new expansion's focus lies, however, with players able to establish a small business to bring in the Simoleons. It's possible to create a dedicated space on a residential lot to sell your wares to passing customers, or you can build on the new Small Business Venture Lot instead. There's also a new Ticket Kiosk, providing a way to charge customers either one time or by the hour, and players have the choice between hiring staff or running their fledgling enterprise as a family unit.
</p>

<p>
As a business grow, Sims earn Business Perks - unlocking new interactions and effects - and there's a Business Renown system enabling players to either run things by the book or to indulge in their unscrupulous side. However, EA notes that becoming a Dreamer or Schemer can impact Sims' lives outside of work.
</p>
<p>
And as for the type of small business players can run, that'll depend on the Sims 4 expansions and game packs they own. With just Businesses &amp; Hobbies installed, players can build business around either the new tattoo skill (which introduces a Tattoo Paint Mode to create custom designs using a growing collection of stamps and stencils) or the new pottery skill. The latter adds a pottery wheel and kiln for Sims to utilise, with players able to make either decorative or functional pieces, and glaze them for the finishing touch.
</p>
<p>
However, if the idea of running a tattoo parlour or pottery shop doesn't appeal, Cats and Dogs expansion owners can open pet cafes, while the Get Together expansion unlocks the ability to run dance clubs and game arcades. City Living unlocks karaoke bars, Get Famous unlocks acting classes, Laundry Day makes it possible to run a laundrette, and Bowling Night is for those that want to open their own bowling alley. And finally, Spa Day is the game pack you'll need if you want to wring your customers dry in the name of relaxation.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's Businesses &amp; Hobbies Expansion Pack - which also includes a new world in the form of Nordhaven - launches for all platforms on 6th March. Anyone that picks it up before 18th April gets the Practice Makes Perfect Priscilla Statue, Sweetest Treat Display Case, and Beautiful Flaws Lamp, as <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/businesses-and-hobbies-expansion-pack">detailed in EA's announcement</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/former-bioware-ea-devs-reveal-new-arpg-cloudheim/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cloudheim is a brand-new multiplayer action RPG from the independent studio Noodle Cat Games. This game comes from a studio comprised of veteran developers from Epic Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">EA</a>, Codemasters, Disney, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-leaving/">Bioware</a>. To celebrate the reveal of Cloudheim, the developers have released a gameplay trailer that you can see down below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cloudheim - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHnpo84ybmM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This debut title will be set to launch in Q3 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. You'll be in for a fun and chaotic time, as there is physics-based combat, as well as plenty of exploration, looting, and base creation in a Norse-inspired world.</p>
<p>"Cloudheim blends the exceptional talent of a veteran team with an experimental, iterative development process informed by science and modern psychology. Every member of the team has a meaningful creative impact, allowing us to push exceptional gameplay quality for our team size, budget, and development time. I'm proud of what we've built, and how the team has proven this process is ultimately better for the ones who matter most - our players," said David Hunt, CEO and Founder of Noodle Cat games.</p>
<p>Cloudheim is set to stand out from the crowd, with a ton of chaos to unleash on the world, as it's a fully breakable world where players can chain together their abilities with other teammates to defeat enemies. Whether this means pulling down pillars to crush enemies, lassoing enemies into tornadoes, or shooting monsters out of cannons, there's plenty of chaos to be had around every corner.</p>
<p>You are given the option to play solo, or you can join forces with up to three of your friends in online co-op, where you will share every weapon and ability unlocked and can work together to explore, uncover secrets, and discover new playable characters as a team.</p>
<p>"Our core gameplay began with a simple question - what if we take the juggling from fighting games and make it the combat foundation in a co-op action RPG?" said David Hunt. "Mix in a hauntingly beautiful world, a chaotic symphony of physics combos, and base customization - that's Cloudheim."</p>
<p>While you will be defeating monstrous foes and goblins, there will also be opportunities to team up with creatures such as a Swordcupine, Blins, and a Gnasher to help you through tough conquests when you need them.</p>
<p>As stated above, this title is set to release later this year. If you want to be kept up to date on this title, the Cloudheim <a href="https://cloudheimgame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> will provide all the info you could need on this upcoming ARPG.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-to-launch-on-steam-early-access-on-march-6/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-to-launch-on-steam-early-access-on-march-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Polish developer The Farm 51 announced the early access release date of their upcoming title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-open-world-sequel-announced-for-2025-pc-requirements-already-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone</a>. The game, which is currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thefarm51/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-an-open-world-sci-fi-rpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Kickstarter to gather funds</a>, will be available on Steam starting on March 6. They also shared a CGI story trailer where we can first glimpse the game's narrative.</p>
<p>Cole Grey, a former military and security guard, lives in a reality where the economy and industry are entirely based on a substance called Chernobylite. With its help, humans have made a real leap forward in civilization. However, the construction of this utopia has been paid for by massive unemployment, pushing people like Cole to the margins of society.</p>
<p>Faced with severe financial problems, he joins the mysterious 'Planewalker' initiative to provide for his family. It soon becomes apparent that there is a shortage of Chernobylite in Cole's universe, and the solution is the morally questionable initiative, which involves traveling to parallel worlds in search of the mineral and obtaining it by any means necessary.</p>
<p>The Planewalker service also requires genetic modifications. Cole must, therefore, physically absorb the essence of the Chernobylite and lose part of his humanity to enhance his physical and intellectual abilities. Seeing no other option for himself, he agrees to the bloody and dangerous service, which results in him being trapped in the most sinister place in the world: the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. There, he meets a Black Stalker, the Zone's dark leader and silent ruler. Cole's ultimate goal is, of course, to escape the sinister Exclusion Zone and return home.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Early Access Announcement CGI Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEoeb1g88e0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone is going well so far. With a week left, the game has already surpassed the minimum funding goal while unlocking a few stretch goals, such as the optional first-person combat mode, the return of all guns from the first Chernobylite, weapon customizations, and new locations for both solo play and cooperative missions, one of the sequel's new features. The next stretch goals would unlock a customizable interface for both first-person and third-person views, and a customizable dialogue camera.</p>
<p>The system requirements are also available on the Steam page, so we've embedded them below for those interested.

For example, if you want to save your game in <em>Deliverance 2</em>, you have to either find a bed and sleep in it or brew a special potion that lets you save anywhere. Another example is that you get dirty as you explore and fight, and people react to that, which can cause problems if you’re covered in mud and stink. And while the studio behind the RPG deliberately designed the game to have all this friction and realism, many fans on PC have quickly responded: No, thanks! </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/that-was-fast-a-modder-already-added-an-unlimited-save-game-feature-to-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/that-was-fast-a-modder-already-added-an-unlimited-save-game-feature-to-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span>, over on <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus Mods page</a></span>, you can see that two of the most popular mods—with over 50,000 downloads combined—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simply let you save wherever you want</a></span>, no potion or bed needed. </p><p>Another popular mod with nearly 12,000 installs makes your character <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/59&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stay cleaner for longer</a></span>.

                <p>The Halo series has some of the most iconic and beloved original soundtracks in gaming history, so it's fitting that the franchise is getting such an elaborate vinyl box set. Fans can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMPKSPLJ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder the Halo Original Trilogy Soundtrack Box Set</a> for $200 (was $211) at Amazon ahead of its April 11 release. The box set includes the soundtracks for the first three Halo games across eight discs. If you are partial to one of these soundtracks, you can preorder each one individually instead. Soundtracks for Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, and Halo 3 also release on April 11.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMPKSPLJ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Halo Original Trilogy Original Soundtrack Box Set</a> -- $200 (<del>$211</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Combat-Evolved-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B0DMPKFLJX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Halo: Combat Evolved Original Soundtrack</a> -- $48 (<del>$51</del>) </li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Original-Soundtrack-Salvatori-Michael-ODonnell/dp/B0DMPKTYY2?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Halo 2 Original Soundtrack</a> -- $72</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Original-Soundtrack-Martin-ODonnell/dp/B0DMPK6NQL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Halo 3 Original Soundtrack</a> -- $72 </li></ul><div title="6529287 - Halo Original Trilogy Vinyl Soundtrack" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3144" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6529287 - Halo Original Trilogy Vinyl Soundtrack" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMPKSPLJ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DMPKSPLJ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMPKSPLJ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Halo Original Trilogy Vinyl Soundtrack Box Set</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMPKSPLJ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DMPKSPLJ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMPKSPLJ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$200 (was $211) | Releases April 11</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Each piece of music has been specially remastered for this collection, and in total, there are 83 tracks here from composers Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-esa-announces-new-iicon-conference-for-visionaries/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) may be gone, but the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) isn’t done putting on events centered around the games industry. The ESA announced on Thursday the creation of the Interactive Innovation Conference, or iicon.</p>



<p>Billed as an “essential convening for changemakers across industries”, <a href="https://www.theesa.com/entertainment-software-association-unveils-iicon-game-changing-thought-leader-summit-to-harness-the-power-of-interactive-entertainment-and-shape-the-future-of-business-and-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the inaugural event</a> will take place in Las Vegas from April 27-30, 2026. </p>



<p>“For decades, video games have been at the forefront of technological and cultural innovation,” ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis said. “With iicon, we are creating a space for visionaries across industries to come together, connect and reimagine what’s possible through interactive entertainment.”</p>



<p>“The Entertainment Software Association and its member companies are among the innovators and leaders shaping the future of culture, business and human connection,” ESA’s Chairman of the Board Doug Bowser said. “It’s a natural role for ESA to host and support an event that fosters an open exchange of new ideas with our peer industry leaders. Iicon is bringing together changemakers from across industries to envision how the strengths of the interactive entertainment industry can break entirely new ground.”</p>



<p>As far as what organizations will take part in the event, the ESA revealed that Amazon Games, Disney, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Microsoft, Nintendo of America, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Square Enix, Take-Two Interactive, Ubisoft and Warner Bros. Games. will  all have a presence.</p>



<p>“Iicon will bring together some of the brightest minds from the games industry to navigate present challenges and harness the opportunities ahead,” Christoph Hartmann, vice president of Amazon Games, said.</p>



<p>Despite being run by the same organization, this event isn’t being touted as a replacement for E3, which was often filled with large presentations  and, in its later years, thousands of gamers. The ESA says that iicon is “tailored to visionaries, thought leaders and innovators across industries that intersect with interactive entertainment.”</p>



<p>More details on the event such as speakers, general access, and more will be announced at a later date. Attendance will be invite only.</p>

        <p><em>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone</em> is a story of people who try to accomplish an impossible mission and survive in the sinister Chornobyl Zone.</p><p>Cole Grey, a former military and security guard, lives in a reality where the economy and industry are based entirely on a substance called Chernobylite. With its help, people have made a real leap in civilization. However, the construction of the utopia has been paid for by massive unemployment, pushing people like Cole to the margins of society. Due to severe financial problems, he joins the mysterious “Planewalker” initiative to provide for his family.</p><p>It quickly becomes apparent that there is a shortage of Chernobylite in Cole’s universe, and the solution is the morally questionable initiative that involves traveling to parallel worlds in search of the mineral and obtaining it by any means possible. In addition, the Planewalker service requires appropriate genetic modifications. Cole must, therefore, physically absorb the essence of chernobylite and, to increase his physical and intellectual capabilities, lose a part of his humanity. However, seeing no other options for himself, he agrees to the bloody and dangerous service, which results in him ending up trapped in the most sinister place in the world: the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. There, he meets a Black Stalker, the Zone’s dark guide and silent ruler.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Open World Exploration</strong> – Explore the big and realistic open world of the real Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. Chernobylite has taken over the zone, transforming many of its elements, and people are trying to defend themselves against it using prototype technology.</li><li><strong>Character Development</strong> – Create and develop your hero.

Or a smart sniper who always finds the right arguments? The choice is yours.</li><li><strong>Diverse Combat</strong> – Fight for survival with an advanced melee combat system, or keep your enemies away with a diverse arsenal of firearms. You can also use the <a title="Genres > Stealth [74 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> approach or ask others for help.</li><li><strong>Team Building</strong> – Embark on the exciting journey of team building. Each of your mates is a potential teacher, ready to impart their knowledge and skills. Assemble your team and discover the unique strengths and abilities they bring. The question is, will you earn their trust and unlock their full potential?</li><li><strong>Planewalking</strong> – Adapt your build and equipment to the situation with planewalking, which allows you to change things on the fly. You’re free to develop more than one character skill set. Are you encountering a situation that your previously prepared heavy melee build will solve better than your current ranged sniper? Planewalk and use another one.</li><li><strong>Base Development</strong> – Develop your base. There, you can create valuable items and upgrade your weapons every day. Assign your people to tasks, and they will take care of your equipment and supplies.</li><li><strong>Factions</strong> – Fight for influence and negotiate with factions.

magic, Dungeons of Hinterberg casts you as Luisa, an office worker looking for an escape from reality. Imagine Tintin meets The Legend of Zelda, and you'll have a good idea of what to expect from the game. Combat and dungeon exploration form a key part of the experience, as players have to use their accumulated skills to progress through these puzzling locations.</p><p>While that's the main draw of the game during its daylight hours, nighttime allows you to walk around town, meet new people, and forge relationships that can help Luisa overcome new challenges in future runs, like dangerous monsters and a bad case of burnout. Dungeons of Hinterberg currently has a "generally favorable" <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dungeons-of-hinterberg/">metascore of 80</a> on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic, as a number of outlets praised the game for its charming design, relatable story, and fun gameplay.</p><p>Meanwhile, another big game from Xbox Game Studios is also on its way to PS5 as part of Microsoft's multiplatform strategy. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/">Forza Horizon 5 races onto the Sony console in spring</a>, and this year will also see the release of the strategy games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-longtime-microsoft-exclusive-franchise-makes-its-playstation-debut-in-march/1100-6529235/">Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition and Age of Mythology: Retold on PS5</a>.</p>

                <p>The big game is almost here, and for most of us, that means disappointment, as your team probably didn't make the cut. (Unless you're a dirty Chiefs bandwagoner). Fortunately for those of us who aren't interested in playing yet another season of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-629476">Madden NFL 25</a> to celebrate, there are other football games on the market that'll scratch that itch. And of them, Mutant Football League 2 is certainly the bloodiest, and it's coming to Xbox Series X|S's Xbox Game Preview program on February 6.</p><p dir="ltr">As part of the Super Bowl proceedings, Mutant Football League 2 is available for a discounted price of $25 on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mutant-football-league-2-game-preview/9p72ljj5srx0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Game Preview</a>. It's coming to the console for the first time in Fall 2025, but this preview will give you a chance to try out the mayhem for yourself ahead of its release. As shown in the below trailer, the sequel allows you to create your own Mutant Dream Team, so you can make sure to always beat your friends, as well as the Doom Field Designer, which allows you to create the perfect home field advantage for your motley crew of misfits. Note that Mutant Football League 2 has no NFL license, so don't expect real teams or players here.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BTOLCesx7I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1BTOLCesx7I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">First released in early access on PC in May 2024, Mutant Football League 2 is a return to the heady arcade days of games like NFL Blitz. With plenty of blood and gore, a focus on local multiplayer, and special "dirty tricks" plays that allow you to literally injure and kill your opponents, this is your chance to get your revenge on that annoying Chiefs fan in your life. Then again, it's just a good time, particularly if you're willing to customize your own orc to look as twisted as possible. It also supports online multiplayer and features a robust dynasty mode.</p><p dir="ltr">For those of you who prefer a more realistic football experience, there's always the PC game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1106340/Legend_Bowl/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legend Bowl</a>, which hits a level of complexity somewhere between Madden and classics like Tecmo Super Bowl. The latest Madden is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-xbox-game-pass-titles-revealed-for-february-2025-including-starfield-for-standard-tier/2900-6219/" data-ref-id="2900-6219">also on Game Pass</a>, so it's easier to jump in than ever before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/i-went-into-eternal-strands-expecting-indie-dragon-age-but-i-got-indie-dragons-dogma<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hot on the heels of an unsuccessful 25-hour attempt to enjoy <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, my first couple hours with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Eternal Strands</em></a>, the new action-adventure game from a studio co-founded by <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-first-anniversary-you-are-all-way-too-kind-thank-you" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted Aftermath reader</a> and <em>Dragon Age</em> creative director Mike Laidlaw, did not inspire confidence. In both games, I encountered dialogue that was a hair too quippy, a cast of characters that felt so kind and considerate as to be inoffensive, and ample talk of dragons and veils. But then I got kicked by a giant, and everything changed.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Eternal Strands</em> starts out feeling like a modern-day BioWare game, but moment to moment, it’s really nothing like that at all. You play as Brynn, basically a wizard in a world where wizards are regarded with suspicion, and after you and your crew get stuck inside the walls of a magic mega-city that sealed itself off following a mysterious cataclysm, you realize the only way out is through. This means expeditions to various maps – a lush forest, a swamp, a gilded city that’s been partially reclaimed by nature – whose scale makes you seem like an ant in comparison.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Yellow Brick</figcaption></figure><p>There, you fight enemies and collect resources that, in a unique twist, alter the makeup and appearance of your weapons and armor on a per-item basis. Slot in some animal fur that raises cold resistance, for example, and your garment will also gain a blue hue. It’s neat! The changes aren’t just cosmetic, though. Depending on the in-game day and time, <em>Eternal Strands</em>’ maps can take on entirely new complexions, blazing hot one moment, freezing cold the next, or pocketed with concentrations of magic known as “tangles” that’ll swallow you whole if you’re not careful. Crafting sets of armor that meet the moment is key.</p><p>Even so, these hazards would be easily navigable if not for <em>Eternal Strands</em>’ centerpiece: In addition to regular-sized enemies who irritate more than they challenge, each map contains some manner of colossus who seeks, with determination that sometimes borders on comical, to absolutely wreck your shit. The first of these, basically just a really big guy, got my heartbeat up by forcing me to climb him and attack weak points while he shook and scratched like a fleabitten dog, but I never felt like I was in any real danger during our knock-(him)-down, drag-(me)-out fight.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Yellow Brick</figcaption></figure><p>It was only once I took on my second towering goliath that everything clicked. What made this one special is that, prior to our throwdown, I was just minding my own business, climbing a sky-scraping tower in the center of a swamp and picking it clean. Then I saw a particularly large silhouette out of the corner of my eye. Initially, I figured “Oh, that’s a Later Me problem,” but Later happened just a few seconds after that, when I realized that the floorboards of the level of the tower I’d climbed to were on fire. I frantically rounded a corner as a dragon narrowly missed me with a gout of angry flame. “What the fuck!” I yelled in my dark apartment, jolted out of a pre-bedtime haze. A lengthy health bar appeared at the top of my screen. “Ashpeak Drake,” it read.</p><p>While I managed to deal some meager damage with my bow and arrow, I ultimately decided to beat a hasty retreat to a portal back to camp; I’d collected quite a few resources and didn’t want to risk losing them by dying. After upgrading my gear a bit, I returned to the same map – which, keep in mind, was large, open, and multifaceted – with the intention of completing a portion of the main quest. I’d been tasked with investigating a conspicuously frozen village in the middle of the swamp, so I chugged a cold-protection potion and prepared to comply. But then, as I poked and prodded and, at one point, knocked down houses in search of information, I heard the flap of house-sized wings overhead. Fireballs soon followed. The first time, I chalked it up to coincidence. This time, it was personal.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Yellow Brick</figcaption></figure><p>What ensued was a 25-or-so-minute brawl that called to mind the best moments from <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>. I got swatted around like a fly, such that there were natural points when we disengaged and I could scurry away and recover, or other enemies decided to attack me, the dragon, or both of us. I ended up kiting the dragon around the base of the tower from before, which went from looking like a relic from an older, better time to a smoking ruin. It felt vaguely poetic, given where all of this had begun.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, after I got tired of dodging fireballs, I charged straight at the dragon and climbed onto the back of its neck. As I hacked away at its armor-like scales in furious desperation, it stood up on its hind legs and began to immolate <em>itself</em>. Then it flew, with me on its back, to the frozen village, causing us both to take ice damage. We were both, it seemed, so sick of each other that we’d simultaneously decided mutually assured destruction was worth it.</p><figure></figure><p>I won the fight, emerging from the fray so exhilarated that I couldn’t sleep for hours. That’s pretty much the highest praise I can give a systems-driven game: Everything came together just right to create an unforgettable moment that will always be mine. This is not undercut by the fact that I later learned how to bring down the dragon with greater ease – or that, in one of the game’s cooler twists, I had to fight it again in a more specific, puzzle-like way to upgrade my magic powers. Those subsequent chapters only add to the larger narrative of that terrifying first time.</p><p>I guess the real<em> Eternal Strands</em> were the hulking, unforgettable enemies we made along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esa-iicon-e3"><h3>Vowels Are Back As ESA Announces New Conference</h3></a><p>The Interactive Innovation Conference will focus on where games connect to other industries</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/entertainment-software-association-unveils-iicon-game-changing-thought-leader-summit-to-harness-the-power-of-interactive-entertainment-and-shape-the-future-of-business-and-culture/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its website, the ESA (which stands for Entertainment Software Association) describes iicon as an event aiming to "connect visionaries, thought leaders and innovators from across industries to harness the power of interactive entertainment".</p>

<p>In short, it sounds like iicon is much more corporate-minded than E3; it's more for business executives and industry figures than the general public, so don't expect to see any jaw-dropping game or console reveals.</p>

<p>According to the site, iicon promises "visionary keynotes, engaging discussions and workshops, and elite networking opportunities" with execs "shaping the future of entertainment, business, and technology".</p>

<p>The event won't just be about gaming, either; it also promises to incorporate other industries adjacent to gaming and interactive media, like film, TV, and music, as well as "sports, healthcare, education, finance, and more".</p>

<p>The ESA says that attendance will be "by invitation only", so it doesn't sound like you'll just be able to buy a ticket and rock up as a member of the public, which seems like it's in keeping with iicon's more exclusive approach.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/e3-2019-esa.jpg?itok=_bGvK2N_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/e3-2019-esa.jpg?itok=7r0mPMqU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ESA's new iicon event does not sound much like E3.</figcaption></figure><p>Companies like Take-Two, Ubisoft, and Xbox have already signed up for iicon, which should provide another clue that the event won't be anything like E3; after all, some of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-wont-actually-be-at-e3-2023-but-will-still-host-live-event-in-los-angeles" rel="nofollow">companies</a> confirming their attendance publicly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-nintendo-sony-skipping-e3-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shunned</a> E3 in the years before its demise.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the ESA officially killed E3 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/e3-is-officially-dead" rel="nofollow">in December 2023</a>&nbsp;following a chaotic couple of years that included show cancellations and studios turning down appearances at the convention.</p>

<p>That's another reason iicon will almost certainly be nothing like E3; it would be a very unusual (and arguably foolish) business move to create an event exactly like one that was canned not even a year and a half ago.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in ESA news, meanwhile, the trade body recently took President Trump to task over his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments" rel="nofollow">newly-introduced tariffs</a>, which the organization says could cause "significant harm to everyday Americans". Trump has paused tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but has gone ahead with a 10% tariff on China-imported goods.</p>

<p>In any case, the inaugural iicon event will take place between April 27th and 30th next year at the Las Vegas Fontainebleau Resort. Stay tuned for more.</p>

During your time with the game, though, you’ll have a bit more to do than just deliver packages, especially if you’re trying to earn all of theTrophies or Achievements. If that’s the plan, you’ll need to destroy a sand castle Godzilla-style. Here’s where to find the sand castle in <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> and send it to its doom.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h2159"><a id=""></a>Where to find the sand castle in <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em></h2><p>If you’re looking to score the “MIKAstle” trophy or achievement, or you’re just a bully at heart, you’ll want to find the sand castle and destroy it like a ravenous monster with no respect for labor. Luckily, it’s pretty easy to find if you know where to look for it.</p><div><h4> <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> has a free demo on Switch!  </h4><p> If you’re enjoying Mika’s chill, cozy adventure  and are looking to recommend it to friends, you’ll be happy to know the  game offers a free demo on the Switch. And while the Steam version  doesn’t offer up a demo to try out, it is verified on Steam Deck, for  those who like to take their PC library on the go.  </p></div><p>The sand castle is located on the beach in Orilla Town. You’ll find a little fellow putting in some hard work to build it, which should make you feel terrible for knocking it down. But since you’ve gotta do what you’ve gotta do, walk over his creation and leave it a pile of sand. </p><figure id="" data-id="9f740c24d6e4a29d3a9ca0326b01b98a" data-recommend-id="image://9f740c24d6e4a29d3a9ca0326b01b98a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows a circled location on a beach." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map shows a circled location on a beach." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Chibig / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f740c24d6e4a29d3a9ca0326b01b98a" data-recommend-id="image://9f740c24d6e4a29d3a9ca0326b01b98a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows a circled location on a beach." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, keep in mind that the sand castle can only be trampled during the first half of the game. Once you’ve completed the party near the end of the adventure, it will be secured with cement to stop you from being a jerk, meaning you’ll need to start the game over to get a chance to stomp on it again. </p><p>But that’s probably okay with you because you just <em>love</em> to kick over little kids’ sand castles, you sicko.</p><hr><p><em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> is available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and Windows PC via Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
