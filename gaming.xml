            <p>
UK high street chain GAME will no longer offer Xbox All Access to new subscribers beginning later this month, Eurogamer can confirm. 
</p>
<p>
Xbox All Access, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-all-access-the-best-way-to-buy-an-xbox-series-x-or-xbox-series-s">which lets you pay for an Xbox Series X or S console via 24 monthly installments</a>, is available through only a handful of partner retailers globally, and just three in the UK. 
</p>
<p>
GAME is by far the largest chain to have supported the subscription, but Eurogamer understands it is now dropping the offer as part of an ongoing series of changes as many of its high street stores are replaced by concessions in other Frasers Group chains, such as Sports Direct.

<p>
Earlier this week, Eurogamer reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">GAME was scrapping its long-running GAME Rewards membership scheme</a>, including its premium Elite tier. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">we also reported that GAME was set to drop its trade-in program</a>, too. 
</p>
<p>
In each case, Eurogamer understands this is to streamline the offerings GAME provides as the brand operates increasingly out of concessions.
</p>
<p>
"GAME is simplifying its credit offering and, as of 26th June, will no longer be offering Xbox All Access," a GAME spokesperson confirmed to Eurogamer. "This decision will not impact any of our existing Xbox All Access customers. 
</p>
<p>
"We continue to offer our full range of Xbox products and customers will be able to apply for flexible financing options through Frasers Plus."
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has separately confirmed it will continue to offer Xbox All Access in the UK. Currently, the scheme is operated here by GAME, Smyths Toys and 4Gadgets.
</p>
<p>
"Xbox All Access - which allows players to purchase Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass for a monthly price - will continue to be available at participating retailers throughout the UK,"  a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
It's been a year of change for GAME, as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-told-to-expect-redundancies-as-most-workers-move-to-zero-hours-contracts">moves staff to zero-hour contracts and makes others redundant</a>, while the company shifts to operate from fewer high street outlets.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/summer-game-fest-to-be-good-for-horror-fans-with-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-more-teased.890406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-good-for-horror-fans/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The big <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> kickoff show is only a couple days away, and, as you would expect, the teases for what we can expect at the show have begun. It seems like Summer Game Fest will be particularly good for horror fans, as a majority of the things teased for the show thus far have been horror related.</p>
<p>First up, Remedy has posted this teaser, which seems to be a reference to the upcoming “Night Springs” story DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dark Triangle Coffee. Just coffee, nothing else. Have a sip at Night Springs' One and Only Coffee World.</p>
<p>Join the percolation on June 7th... in Night Springs.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NightSprings?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NightSprings</a> <a href="https://t.co/qzXEwVxDWB">pic.twitter.com/qzXEwVxDWB</a></p>
<p>— Alan Wake 2 (@alanwake) <a href="https://twitter.com/alanwake/status/1798006904150458559?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For those who haven’t been keeping up, here’s how Remedy has <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-story-dlc-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously described the Night Springs DLC</a>…</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Visions and dreams. Fiction is written and coming true. Fiction collapses and remains just words on a page. These are those stories… in Night Springs.</em></li>
<li><em>Play as several familiar characters from the world of Alan Wake and experience the unexplainable in multiple self-contained episodes of Night Springs, a fictional tv-show set in the world of Alan Wake.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Second, Geoff Keighley has promised Blumhouse Games will be officially unveiled. Blumhouse is, of course, the biggest name in horror cinema right now, and some movie production companies, like Annapurna, have had quite a bit of success in the realm of video games recently, so this is something to watch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Excited to reveal the first details about <a href="https://twitter.com/BlumhouseGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlumhouseGames</a> live on stage with <a href="https://twitter.com/jason_blum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jason_blum</a> this Friday! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SummerGameFest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SummerGameFest</a> <a href="https://t.co/je3j1KY0Ne">https://t.co/je3j1KY0Ne</a></p>

<p>Finally, for those who perhaps aren’t feeling the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-new-2024-trailer-gameplay-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, many of the original creators of that series will finally show off first gameplay of their new horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/slitterhead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slitterhead</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Don't miss the gameplay world premiere of SLITTERHEAD, from the mind of Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama and <a href="https://twitter.com/BokehGameStudio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BokehGameStudio</a> during <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SummerGameFest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SummerGameFest</a> live this Friday.</p>
<p>Catch the global livestream at <a href="https://t.co/59xiIzf5AN">https://t.co/59xiIzf5AN</a> at 2p PT / 5p ET / 10p BST / 11p CEST. <a href="https://t.co/qxTQhO9DcS">pic.twitter.com/qxTQhO9DcS</a></p>
<p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1798367846449430889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Summer Game Fest kickoff show will be livestreamed this Friday (June 7) at 2pm PT. Geoff Keighley has cautioned that the show may be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-2024-will-be-quieter-when-it-comes-to-shocking-announcements-says-keighley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bit light on “shocking announcements,”</a> but at least for horror fans, it looks like there’s still going to be plenty of reason to tune in.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24171995/killers-game-trailer-release-date-cast-dave-bautista-action-movie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dave-bautista-takes-on-the-entire-assassin-underworld-in-the-killer%E2%80%99s-game-trailer.890400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171995/killers-game-trailer-release-date-cast-dave-bautista-action-movie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YKh9Sx">It’s finally Dave Bautista’s time to shine as a bona fide action lead. The first trailer for <em>The Killer’s Game</em>, an assassin comedy with a star-studded cast and action royalty behind the camera, has dropped. The movie, based on the novel by <em>The Walking Dead</em> comics co-writer Jay Bonansinga, is coming to theaters September 13.</p>
<p id="v3THfO">Bautista plays an assassin diagnosed with a terminal illness who decides to put out a hit on himself for a quick death, rather than have him and his partner suffer through the deterioration of his health. But when he finds out his doctor made a mistake and he’s not actually dying, he has to fend for his life against some of the deadliest killers in the world. It’s a bit similar to the set up of last year’s <em>King of Killers</em>, starring Frank Grillo as an assassin who put out a hit on himself, but with a more fun twist and a much more exciting lineup.</p>
<p id="8vnwrD">Bautista has been largely relegated to side roles in the action genre, and here’s a real chance for him to shine in a genre well-suited to his considerable skills. And you can bet he’ll shine, with the support around him. <em>The Killer’s Game </em>is directed by legendary stunt performer and action director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23301622/action-horror-comedy-movies-like-day-shift-watch-streaming">J.J. Perry</a>, who has been involved in a significant percentage of the great American action movies of the past 30 years, from <em>Blade </em>to <em>John Wick</em>. Perry’s feature debut as a director, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23301934/day-shift-review-netflix-vampire-movie-jamie-foxx-scott-adkins"><em>Day Shift</em></a>,<em> </em>was a fun vampire action comedy starring Jamie Foxx with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23301720/day-shift-vampires-netflix-contortionists-jamie-foxx-jj-perry">creative action choreography and camera work</a>. </p>
<p id="zmu4hf">Bautista will also have more support than just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23835899/blue-beetle-flight-scenes-action-director-interview">Perry</a>. <em>The Killer’s Game </em>has a tantalizing cast, with Ben Kingsley (I’m obsessed with how he says “There are only two ways out of the killer’s game, Joseph”), Pom Klementieff, Sofia Boutella, Terry Crews, and WWE wrestler Drew McIntyre all involved. For the action diehards, the presence of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2021/1/29/22256482/scott-adkins-breaks-down-video-game-fights-mortal-kombat">Scott Adkins</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23664737/fist-of-the-condor-movie-review-marko-zaror-martial-arts">Marko Zaror</a> (who features heavily in the trailer), and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22973113/hell-hath-no-fury-hulu-thriller-movie-watch">Daniel Bernhardt</a> is especially appealing. All three are legends in their own right, and Bernhardt in particular has made a career of making movie stars look god at kicking his ass (<em>Atomic Blonde</em>, <em>Nobody</em>).</p>
<p id="nXbyhO">The project’s been in the works pretty much since Bonansinga’s novel came out in 1997. At different points over the past few decades, Wesley Snipes, Michael Keaton, and Jason Statham were each attached in the lead role. But ultimately, it’s Bautista who got the part, and it seems like a promising vehicle for his combination of charm, humor, and physical ability as a former professional athlete.</p>
<p id="SoAoJh">The trailer advertises lots of action and plenty of gore, as Bautista shoots, stabs, and garrotes his way through a bevy of targets. The comedy’s a bit hit-or-miss for me in the trailer, but that’s how trailers go sometimes. The lineup of talent and the teases of great action are more than enough for me to be counting down the days to September. </p>

There’s lots of characters, motivations, plot twists, and proper nouns to keep track of.

This makes it a bit messy, but there’s something deeply moving about how much <em>The Final Shape </em>wears its heart on its sleeve, too.</p><p><em>The Final Shape </em>has the unenviable task of having to close out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305">this book of <em>Destiny</em>’s history</a></span>. I worried about how it might begin to tackle such an immense task, which seems impossible to accomplish to the satisfaction of everyone playing.

That honor’s reserved for the most highly esteemed and messy fireteam in <em>Destiny</em>’s history, the Vanguard. Commander Zavala, Ikorra Rey, and the returning Cayde-6 make <em>The Final Shape </em>thrum with an electric and uneasy energy as their painful reunion gets swept up into the larger crisis of the end of the world.</p><figure id="" data-id="2da72661542cfdf73c45dde382db2a66" data-recommend-id="image://2da72661542cfdf73c45dde382db2a66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot showing some of The Final Shape's more distorted and dark environments." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot showing some of The Final Shape's more distorted and dark environments." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2da72661542cfdf73c45dde382db2a66" data-recommend-id="image://2da72661542cfdf73c45dde382db2a66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot showing some of The Final Shape's more distorted and dark environments." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Upon entering the Pale Heart of the Traveler, a destination that reuses and distorts several environments from <em>Destiny</em>’s past, things feel immediately off. The Pale Heart is often beauteous, especially where nature seems to have reclaimed long-forgotten locales, but pockets of it tout these vast veiled statues of ghastly figures that <em>Destiny 2 </em>players have become familiar with, and calcified hands seem to jut from the ground and caves. As you push deeper into the festering wound the Witness has cut here, the environments grow more tortured and agonized faces protrude from walls. <em>The Final Shape </em>leans into pain, fear, and anger, and it especially comes through in the Pale Heart. If I may, it looks good on <em>Destiny.</em><br></p><p>This expansion’s central cast is going through it just as much as the world appears to be. Ikorra and Zavala’s reunion with their best friend Cayde-6 is…less than joyous. His appearance, as well as the current, urgent state of things, prompts crises of faiths that see some characters pushed beyond their breaking points, and here is where I’d like to give a nod to <em>Destiny</em>’s stable of voice actors. Everyone from Keith David (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-zavala-keith-david-lance-reddick-1851497272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-zavala-keith-david-lance-reddick-1851497272">taking over as Zavala</a></span> from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lance-reddick-death-age-actor-john-wick-destiny-horizon-1850238254#:~:text=Reddick%20was%20a%20particularly%20big,the%20beloved%20in%2Dgame%20character.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lance-reddick-death-age-actor-john-wick-destiny-horizon-1850238254#:~:text=Reddick%20was%20a%20particularly%20big,the%20beloved%20in%2Dgame%20character.">late Lance Reddick</a></span>) to Kirsten Potter as Mara Sov clearly understood the assignment, and their line readings in this expansion are some of the most emotive and expressive stuff I’ve ever heard in the series. Mara Sov’s anguished cries for her brother haunted me the entirety of the campaign, and Zavala, Ikorra, and Cayde in particular have some emotionally resonant and tough conversations. They verbally spurn each other like jilted friends that never got over the sour end of a cherished relationship, but they also have the most tender moments of the whole experience too. Their performances help ground the finality of the events occuring throughout <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p><h2 id="h1406"><a id=""></a><strong>Growing pains</strong></h2><p>The strength of these various performances helps mask the fact that little else seems to be going on for all of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s countless ongoing threads outside of the Pale Heart. While I’m grateful for the emotional weight of the beats <em>The Final Shape </em>does deliver for some beloved characters, I can’t help but be let down that this doesn’t feel like <em>Destiny 2</em>’s “Avengers, assemble” moment. I will likely be proven wrong by the time the raid rolls around—and there’s a seasonal story appended to <em>The Final Shape </em>that’ll likely tease out some of those secondary plots—but it’s a bummer that more of the allies and friends we’ve made along the way haven’t figured in more prominently.</p><figure id="" data-id="345c86b6fcac85901294f7fcd5e0c30f" data-recommend-id="image://345c86b6fcac85901294f7fcd5e0c30f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a fireteam taking on The Final Shape's great new strike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a fireteam taking on The Final Shape's great new strike." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="345c86b6fcac85901294f7fcd5e0c30f" data-recommend-id="image://345c86b6fcac85901294f7fcd5e0c30f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a fireteam taking on The Final Shape's great new strike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Final Shape</em>’s missions are a bit uneven, too. Though they’re certainly a step above <em>Lightfall</em>’s campaign, which felt tonally confused from the get-go, they don’t quite reach the highs of <em>The Witch Queen</em>, either. <em>The Final Shape </em>gets the stakes, at least, but fails to make immense moments or mechanical setpieces of them. Which isn’t to say I didn’t have a blast, because I did, especially as <em>Destiny </em>campaigns continue to borrow mechanics from its endgame raids that deepen the story experience. While most of the campaign missions came and went, a thrilling strike and the final mission were the biggest standouts, boasting a mixture of environmental design and mechanics that recalled the highs of <em>Destiny</em>’s very best encounters. But whereas I felt I could point to numerous landmark moments in <em>The Witch Queen </em>campaign, like a certain boss encounter in a sprawling maze-like environment, I mostly found approximations of some of <em>Destiny</em>’s greatest hits, including that very same encounter, in <em>The Final Shape</em>.<br></p><p>It also struggles to make the new Prismatic subclass stand out, though this isn’t exactly new to <em>Destiny </em>expansions. Prismatic blends all of the previous elements (Void, Arc, Solar, Stasis, and Strand) and turns players into a super-powered warrior capable of using them all simultaneously. It is the definition of a power trip, and yet, the campaign deploys the new subclass as more of a gimmick than a new part of the player’s arsenal, though I’m sure that will give way to radical builds once players clear the story and get into <em>The Final Shape</em>’s postgame.<br></p><p>I still really enjoyed <em>The Final Shape</em> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-servers-1851519144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-servers-1851519144">despite server issues</a></span>) and I’ll admit that some of the cheap nostalgia plays it pulled successfully made me teary-eyed. Even if it doesn’t entirely land, it’s got so much heart, and wrings so much from a cast and world I love, that I can’t fault it too heavily for its missteps. It is at least as focused as <em>Destiny 2 </em>has ever been, and as the twists and turns kept piling up, I couldn’t wait to see where folks wound up. It’s a little hard to believe, but an era of <em>Destiny 2 </em>is ending, and true to itself, <em>The Final Shape </em>is an appropriately uneven but endearing close to one chapter and the beginning of a new one.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Never underestimate the fans who want to see more Shenmue. After raising over $7 million to partially crowdfund Shenmue III in 2018, passionate followers of the franchise haven't given up on pushing for Shenmue 4. Now, six years after the latest game in the series, Shenmue fans have ramped up their efforts by purchasing a 15-second ad on a Times Square video billboard to campaign for a sequel.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shenmue-fans-rented-a-times-square-billboard-to-campaign-for-shenmue-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, the ad was placed by a fan site, <a href="https://shenmuedojo.com/letsgetshenmue4-trending-at-new-yorks-times-square/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shenmue Dojo</a>. The stated goal of Shenmue Dojo's campaign is to "support the continuation of the series and attempt to spread global awareness to find [developer] Ys Net a potential partner for Shenmue 4." The Times Square ad also included the hashtag #LetsGetShenmue4.</p><p>In the short term, the campaign successfully managed to get Shenmue trending on X. However, getting a fourth game in the series may still be an uphill battle. Shenmue III debuted to mixed or negative reviews in 2019, and the sales weren't high enough to immediately warrant a sequel. Regardless, the team behind the Shenmue 4 campaign remains optimistic about the franchise's future, as explained in the following message posted on the site.</p><p>"Thank you to everyone that helped to show their support with the timed mass tweets/posts today. It was very much appreciated and proves that together, as a collective, we can spread the awareness that we are not going to sit back without a fight. We will continue to strive until Shenmue 4 is a reality."</p>

                <p>The Last Of Us Part 2 is one of the most-acclaimed games of the past few years, but it has stubbornly remained a PlayStation exclusive for that time. A leaker with a proven track record of reliably releasing game info ahead of time recently said that the PC port of The Last Of Us Part 2 Remastered has been finished for more than six months.</p><p dir="ltr">That leaker--Billbil-kun, over at <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mais-quand-sortira-la-version-pc-de-the-last-of-us-part-ii-52283" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs Magazine</a>--claims that development on The Last Of Us Part 2 started way back in 2021, and that it concluded prior to this year, perhaps in November 2023. The leaker notes that the remastered version of the game was released on PS5 in January 2024, which perhaps means that Sony is deliberately holding back the PC port. Billbil-kun then speculates that it may release with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-window-cast-and-everything-else-we-know-so-far/2900-4679/" data-ref-id="2900-4679">season 2 of the HBO TV adaptation</a>, which is set to come out in 2025.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As with all leaks of this nature, we recommend you take it with a grain of salt. However, it has been almost four years since The Last of Us Part 2 came out, which means Sony's had plenty of time to work on a PC port. Over the past few years, Sony has released PC ports of its big exclusives months or even years after their launch on PS4 or PS5. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a> came out in May of this year, almost four years after its 2020 console launch.</p>

        <p>Check out our panel featuring Shawn Layden, Michael Pachter and Van Burnham</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Where will gamers be playing in the future? That's the question we're going to try and answer during a special panel at <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/">IGN Live on Sunday.</a>
</p>
<p>
<em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> head Christopher Dring will lead a panel featuring former PlayStation exec, and current advisor to Tencent, Shawn Layden, veteran games analyst Michael Pachter and author, curator and historian Van Burnham. It takes place at 2pm local time in Los Angeles, with coverage on IGN and GamesIndustry.biz. 
</p>
<p>
During the 30-minute session, we will discuss the role of consoles, the trends on mobile and PC, and look to the potential impact of areas such as game streaming, Netflix and 'metaverse' titles such as Fortnite and Roblox.
</p>
<p>
IGN Live is one of several games events taking place in LA this week, during a period previously occupied by the E3 trade show. Other events include Summer Games Fest, Play Days and Ubisoft Forward, while Xbox will also be on the ground meeting with media following the close of its Games Showcase.
</p>
<p>
There are also a string of digital events scheduled over June, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/summer-games-showcases-what-to-watch-and-when">which you can read all about here. </a>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eso-best-one-bar-pve-magicka-sorcerer-build-elder-scrolls-online.890385/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/eso-best-one-bar-pve-magicka-sorcerer-build-elder-scrolls-online/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=eso-best-one-bar-pve-magicka-sorcerer-build-elder-scrolls-online<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="357" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-scheduled-eso-event-ongoing-and-scheduled-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elder Scrolls Online</a></em> has a great deal of customization options among its classes, so it can be overwhelming. It uses a dual bar system where you can quickly swap between weapons and skillsets at the press of a button. But that’s just more complications. Thankfully you can create builds that just use one bar, like this one bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer Build.</p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">There isn’t really one single “one bar” build. Finding out the best one that works for you is often a matter of experimentation. So, try this, but if it doesn’t work for you, change what doesn’t work. However, you will definitely be able to get a capable defense/attack from this build.</p> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">If it isn’t clear, as you level your character and decide on where to put your stats and Champion Points, you’re going to want to <strong>focus mainly on improving magicka</strong>. Build your Health and Stamina only as secondary.</p>
 <h2 id="h-skills-for-one-bar-pve-magicka-sorcerer-build" data-injectable="false">Skills for One Bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer Build</h2> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">We’ll start with what skills you need for a One Bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer Build. I feel it’s easier to explain the gear you’ll want if you know what you’re slinging. So, my recommended one bar build looks like this:</p> <p data-characters="23" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false"><strong>Weapon: Lightning Staff</strong></p> <figure data-found-rows="7" data-current-count="825" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Skill</strong></td><td><strong>Skill Line</strong></td><td><strong>Base Skill</strong></td><td><strong>Use</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mystic Orb</strong></td><td><strong>Undaunted</strong></td><td><strong>Necrotic Orb</strong></td><td><strong>Attack</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Unstable Wall of Elements</strong></td><td><strong>Destruction Staff</strong></td><td><strong>Wall of Elements</strong></td><td><strong>Attack</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Critical Surge</strong></td><td><strong>Storm Calling</strong></td><td><strong>Surge</strong></td><td><strong>Damage buff</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Summon Volatile Familiar</strong></td><td><strong>Daedric Summoning</strong></td><td><strong>Summon Unstable Familiar</strong></td><td><strong>Passive damage/damage mitigation</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Summon Twilight Tormentor</strong></td><td><strong>Daedric Summoning</strong></td><td><strong>Summon Winged Twilight</strong></td><td><strong>Passive damage/damage mitigation</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Greater Storm Atronach</strong></td><td><strong>Daedric Summoning</strong></td><td><strong>Summon Storm Atronach</strong></td><td><strong>Passive damage/damage mitigation</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">This build provides a great deal of passive damage from your summons, gives you two straightforward attacks to keep you engaged, and a buff to keep your damage high enough to take down difficult targets.</p> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Your rotation should start by summoning your familiar and twilight tormentor. Once they’re at your side, it’s time for Critical Surge. Throw a Mystic Orb, then an Unstable Wall of Elements. It’s then time to mix in your heavy attack. Whenever one of your skills expires, recast it. Once your Ultimate is charged, unleash it.</p>
 <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="115" data-injectable="false"><strong>Summon Volatile Familiar&gt;Summon Twilight Tormentor&gt;Critical Surge&gt;Mystic Orb&gt;Unstable Wall of Elements.</strong></p> <h2 id="h-gear-for-one-bar-pve-magicka-sorcerer" data-injectable="false">Gear for One Bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer</h2> <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">Get your crafting character ready to work out some upgrades for the One Bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer’s best gear.</p> <h3 id="h-sergeant-s-mail" data-injectable="false">Sergeant’s Mail</h3> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true">This is going to sound somewhat strange for a magic-centric character, but my recommended set Sargeant’s Mail. That means it’s heavy armor. It gets dropped in the Wayrest Sewer Dungeons (1 and 2). It might sound bulky (you can always change its appearance at an Outfit Station if it interferes with your drip), but the helpfulness of its bonuses are apparent:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>(2 items)</strong> Adds 1206 Maximum Health</li> <li><strong>(3 items)</strong> Adds 129 Health Recovery</li> <li><strong>(4 items)</strong> Adds 129 Weapon and Spell Damage</li> <li><strong>(5 items)</strong> When you deal damage with a Heavy Attack, you gain a stack of Sergeant’s Focus for 5 seconds, increasing the damage of your Heavy Attacks by 645 per stack. This effect can occur once every second and stacks up to 4 times.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">Not hard to gain, upgrades your heavy attack (which you’ll be using, er, heavily), your spell damage, and Health. Very effective.</p> <h3 id="h-deadly-strike" data-injectable="false">Deadly Strike</h3> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">If you’re willing to do some PvP in Cyrodiil, you can supplement with Deadly Strike gear. This is useful, because you don’t need to pile on the equipment in order to get some useful effects:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>(2 items)</strong> Adds 129 Weapon and Spell Damage</li> <li><strong>(3 items)</strong> Adds 657 Critical Chance</li> <li><strong>(4 items)</strong> Adds 129 Weapon and Spell Damage</li> <li><strong>(5 items)</strong> Increase the damage your damage over time and channeled attacks do by 15%.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">As mentioned, you can find Deadly Strike in Cyrodiil.</p> <h3 id="h-oakensoul-ring" data-injectable="false">Oakensoul Ring</h3> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">For any One Bar build, the Oakensoul ring is indispensable. It prevents you from swapping between your weapon sets, but… that’s the point of this build. That was already our objective. So, why not just take that option a way in favor of some of these terrific perks.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>(1 item)</strong> While equipped, you are unable to swap between your Primary and Backup Weapon Sets and gain Minor Berserk, Minor Courage, Major Brutality, Major Sorcery, Major Prophecy, Major Savagery, Minor Force, Minor Protection, Major Resolve, Minor Mending, Minor Fortitude, Minor Intellect, Minor Endurance, Minor Heroism, Minor Slayer, Minor Aegis, and Empower.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="189" data-injectable="false">Damned right. You can get the Oakensoul ring through the Antiquities system. You’re going to need to focus your search around High Isle and Amenos.</p> <h2 id="h-other-considerations" data-injectable="false">Other considerations</h2> <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">Beyond what has already been listed here, there are a few other things you’ll want to consider.</p> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">In terms of the race you choose for your character, <strong>High Elf (Altmer) is probably your best bet</strong>, as its passives are magicka and destruction staff-based. Breton is the next best, as they also receive Magicka Bonuses. Dunmer also gets bonuses to spell damage, but the Dual Wield proficiency and Stamina boosts are largely wasted.</p>
 <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="154" data-injectable="false">Otherwise, the race of your character <strong>isn’t a crucial decision</strong>. Choose the one you want to play as or build around the suggested ones. It’s up to you.</p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">As for the Mundus sign you’ll want to align with, the build provided here doesn’t depend too much on it. However, I’d recommend either <strong>The Lover for additional attack damage or The Steed for better survivability</strong>.</p> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">For your potions, I’m a simple person. I usually just go with something that boosts your Health/Stamina/Magicka (I always have a glut of one type or another after so many years of playing.) However, you probably also want something that can heal you since you don’t have any direct healing skills to keep yourself topped up.</p>
 <p data-characters="177" data-current-count="177" data-injectable="false">Finally, if you’re playing by yourself. Your survivability can be increased dramatically by keeping a companion with you. Also, they’re fun. I mean, I find them fun.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-creator%E2%80%99s-slitterhead-to-get-gameplay-reveal-at-summer-game-fest.890358/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Game Fest organizer Geoff Keighley has announced that one of the games being showcased during this Friday's presentation will be Bokeh Game Studio's&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead</em>, which is the brainchild of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>creator Keiichiro Toyama.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1798367846449430889" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Keighley says that the "gameplay world premiere" of&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>will be shown during the Summer Game Fest opening presentation, which will be happening at 5pm Eastern on Friday.</p>

<p><em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>was first unveiled back in 2021 as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021">that year's Game Awards ceremony</a>. A teaser trailer for the game was shown, revealing its art direction and some of its creature design (although, crucially, no gameplay was demonstrated).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bokeh-game-studio-slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-monster.jpg?itok=Vg5z8l5C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bokeh-game-studio-slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-monster.jpg?itok=_9aDKxRn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>has some pretty evocative-looking art direction.</figcaption></figure><p>The game was actually teased earlier than that year's Game Awards, though. It's possible to see some concept art for what would eventually become&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-creator-keiichiro-toyama-founds-bokeh-game-studio">a video announcing the foundation</a> of Bokeh Game Studio from back in late 2020.</p>

<p>After the Game Awards reveal, Bokeh began to tease more information about&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead</em>.</p>

<p>The company has released a series of dev diaries showing off the development process for the game, including one in which we <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-slitterhead-dev-diary">get to see some user testing phase footage</a> (and a very brief snippet of rather early-in-development-looking gameplay).</p>

<p>In addition to these videos, Bokeh has also released several Q&amp;A sessions with horror luminaries and industry legends, including chats with horror manga icon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stzQrcyzyTU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Junji Ito</a>,&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nzd6ZESIkE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kazutaka Kodaka</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma&nbsp;</em>head honcho <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yEUS1VDwzo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hideaki Itsuno</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bokeh-game-studio-slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-motorcycle-helmet.jpg?itok=yocmT8WF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bokeh-game-studio-slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-motorcycle-helmet.jpg?itok=fYUjaloR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will this be&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead</em>'s protagonist?</figcaption></figure><p>It's not clear exactly how far along the development pipeline&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>actually is, but the fact that Bokeh is showing gameplay this Friday is encouraging, at least.</p>

<p>We still don't have a release date or even a release window for&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead</em>, but perhaps we'll learn more about when we can expect the game to land later this week. Stay tuned for all the news from Summer Game Fest as and when we get it.</p>

This week we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hollows-out-everything-you-loved-about-elden-ring-and-its-brilliant">finally got our raging bear gauntlets on Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>, an even dingier and danker edition of 2022's best and dankest open worlder, but perhaps you'd rather play a Soulslike with a Florentine flounce and the warmth of a Mediterranean sunset on its brow. A brighter, stagier variety of action-role-playing, which deepens the connection between Italian folklore and Soulsliking established by last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a>. Well then: cast aside those ursine mitts, slip on a pair of immaculate white theatre gloves and get your thumbs into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enotria-the-last-song">Enotria: The Last Song</a>, which has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102450/Enotria_The_Last_Song/">a demo on Steam</a>. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The work of Milan-based Jyamma Games, it takes place in a world overtaken by a "twisted eternal play", in which everybody has a mask that determines the role they are doomed to perform indefinitely - the latest plot justification for the classic Dark Souls tragicomic ritual of everything and everybody resetting when you die.</p>
<p>You don't have a mask, however. Rather, you're the Maskless One and as such, free to wear any dang mask you choose and make use of its esoteric powers. Each mask is a set of stat modifiers and special abilities which you can switch between with D-pad down. Land a finishing move in a brawl and your equipped mask will "awaken", sprouting additional bonuses. My favourite of the two I've discovered so far is the Piercing Wit Mask - yes, mostly because it sounds dashing, but also because when I Pierce somebody with my Wit (impale them with my longsword), my ranged "Mask Lines" or spells recharge instantly, making this a great piece of headwear for budding battlemages.

The complexities of the mask mechanic notwithstanding, the first few minutes and opening tutorials for Enotria are interchangeable with those of most other Soulslikes. You've got light and heavy attacks, a stagger bar of sorts, a parry and dodge (but no block), a distressingly finite flask of health replenishment, and a branching corridor map pegged down by bonfire-equivalents which here take the form of pluckable, glowing cords.</p>
<p>
During those opening sections I was concerned that the game's cultural influences would prove grafted-on, with terms like "fast" and "slow" archly swapped out for "allegro" and "adagio" in a bid to wow stupid tourists like, yes, myself. Perhaps that'll be my conclusion after 40 hours of play, Enotria's estimated minimum completion time. But the set dressing is undeniably appealing. The sun-drenched landscape (available in several parallel incarnations, I understand, though I haven't unlocked the associated plane-shifting mechanic) feels like the ambience of Dark Souls 2's Majula smeared across a continent. There are fields of sunflowers along the shores and piles of broken stained glass in the catacombs which doubtless have a tale attached. And there are some promising mechanical wrinkles beyond the first few scuffles.
</p>
<p>
Take "primal elements". These aren't the usual water-beats-fire gambit, but a curious medley of positive and negative status modifiers. There's Vis, which inflicts Dizziness, boosting damage and stamina regen while lowering defence. There's Fatuo, which makes you Wicked, amplifying your Elemental abilities while also letting attackers heal themselves by hurting you. Malanno is a source of Sickness, which (more predictably) erodes your health over time and spreads to nearby characters. And then there's Gratia, which renders you Radiant, regenerating your health, but also causes you to explode when struck.</p>
<p>You can make out the dim traces here of conventional elemental systems and status effects like Berserk, but they've been intriguingly defaced. I'm keen to see how impactful these disfigurations are, as somebody who's very bored of beating fire with water, water with earth, and so on. But in the shorter term, I have to confess that I'm just happy to be out of the shadows and enjoying the sun.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172050/hades-2-patch-notes-chronos-weapon-upgrades<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="s60J7D">If you’ve been struggling to beat Chronos, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151266/hades-2-early-access-content-hecate-scylla-bosses"><em>Hades 2</em></a>’s final boss, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4191241567727414432?l=english">Tuesday’s patch</a> might give you a boost. Don’t get me wrong, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/hades-2-guides/24153678/chronos-boss-fight-how-to-beat-best-build">Chronos will still be hard to take on</a>, but developer Supergiant Games made some tweaks that decrease the likeliness that the boss will be “patently unfair.”</p>
<p id="vtmnUP"><em>Hades 2</em>’s second patch is pretty big — it’s got a whole slew of general changes, UI and menu updates, and weapon upgrades alongside changes to different foes. Supergiant Games said player feedback was used to “inspire” the changes brought forth in Tuesday’s patch. Boon updates, which give players increased abilities, will be included in the next patch, Supergiant Games said. The full patch notes are included at the bottom of this post, but let’s go over some of the biggest ones.</p>
<p id="qq43k0">Supergiant Games will allow players to encounter one more Olympian each night, just like in <em>Hades</em> — that means one additional boon. You’ll also be more likely to find another boon or reward in Erebus. Melinoë’s weapons, Nocturnal Arms and Daedalus Hammer, have been updated; for instance, Nocturnal Arms’ Argent Skull channels attacks faster and “hits a larger area,” according to the patch notes. The Daedelus Hammer had a ton of upgrades outright removed from the game, replaced with new stuff. One instance is the removal of Double Cataclysm, which has been replaced by Mirrored Thrasher, which lets all attacks hit twice (but you take more damage).</p>
<p id="9hgtWi">Beyond Chronos, several other bosses were tweaked, like Infernal Cerbeus, which got attack pattern changes. The Chaos Trials, which are basically challenge runs, also had their difficulty reduced.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero might include split-screen multiplayer for up to 2 players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the latest revelation, Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero might just be the true Budokai Tenkaichi successor we have been waiting for. Discovered through the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10007902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a> listing for the game, it has been found that 2 types of multiplayer experiences will be offered to players, online and offline. </p>



<p>Both multiplayer modes will allow up to 2 players. The offline mode might offer a split-screen option, similar to what we’ve seen in the previous titles. It is worth noting that this could be a mistake on their end, but we hope it’s not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero was revealed at The Game Awards 2023. The devs promised to provide players with an improvement on the iconic gameplay of the iconic Budokai Tenkaichi series while adding new characters and maps to the roster. Moreover, the game involved fast-paced battles, featuring the narrative and characters from the late Akira Toriyama’s iconic anime series. </p>



<p>From the already-released gameplay trailer, it has become clear that the combat mechanics, visuals and authenticity of Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero have greatly increased.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Since then, we have received a few trailers on the game, showcasing the diverse characters and unique movesets we can expect to see. Most recently, Bandai Namco released the Fused Warriors Trailer, which included characters like Gogeta, Vegito, Gotenks, Kefla and Fused Zamasu. Furthermore, a recent leak revealed the Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero might have an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-leak-teases-special-edition-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultimate Edition</a>. with more details about pre-orders and release date arriving at Summer Game Fest 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you feel about Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero adding a split-screen mode? Let us know in the comments. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/arco-is-a-minimalist-beautiful-pixel-art-tactics-game-set-in-the-american-frontier<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It's been a while since I've felt so captivated by such a minimalist game as Arco. A simple but effective revenge tale set against the backdrop of early colonial Mesoamerica, it presents its snappy combat and distinctive worldbuilding with an art style that almost looks like something out of the 8-bit era. Yet the sweeping landscapes are never lacking for detail. And the tale woven across them had me hooked from the start.</p><p>Nearly all media about the American frontier focuses on the settler experience, so it's refreshing to see that Arco presents a rich, thriving, and diverse Native world as the player's point-of-view, with European "Newcomers" representing a looming, somewhat enigmatic threat. Everything is slightly fantastical, with groups and nations that take inspiration from Mesoamerican and South American indigenous groups, but not too directly modeled after any one real-world society.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Arco Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>And the tapestry they form is treated with the same nuance and depth as the myriad pseudo historical fantasy settings we're used to based on other parts of the world. The hero of the first two chapters, Tizo, is from the Iyo tribe, who are nomadic nature-worshippers traversing green valleys that reminded me of Central California. The Onem are a monastic community with great monasteries built onto the side of a mountain, reminiscent of Andean societies. The mighty Kanek live in massive temple cities in the jungle, reflecting elements of Aztec, Maya, and Toltec cultures. These groups, collectively, are not treated as culturally monolithic, politically unified, or as one-note stereotypes, and fit together in fascinating ways.</p><h3>Vendetta</h3><p>In keeping with the tradition of Western storytelling, however, Arco is ultimately a tale of revenge. Tizo was kidnapped as a child by Newcomers and grew up on a Spanish mission. The first chapter is a brief episode from his early life, when the Newcomers were mostly a subject of rumor and superstition. The second picks up with him as an old man wandering the land, seeking justice for wrongs done to him and his people. It's fascinating to see how the setting evolves in this time as well, with many of the Native groups adopting more European-influenced ways of life, including one settlement even having their own windmill.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Rather than a cattleman's revolver, Tizo uses a traditional native bow, the titular "arco", with which he can quite capably best even gun-toting opponents. Arco's combat system is a turn-based hybrid, in which you plan out an action while paused, then watch it play out in real time over the course of a few seconds. Movement and positioning are key to success, and there's also an engaging action economy, where attacks and special abilities generally cost "magia", which can be refilled a little at a time by moving or much faster by standing still to take a breather.</p><h3>Let's Dance</h3><p>Tizo has to tangle with a troupe of fantastical wildlife inspired by the region, like giant insects and monitor lizards, as well as sometimes bandits and soldiers. He's joined at various points by allies like the mercenary Zoka and the Kanek prince Kaax, who add an additional element of tactical depth. They each have their own skill trees, too. While Zoka and Kaax specialize in one type of fighting each, Tizo's skill tree is fairly expansive, and you can choose to focus him more on ranged, melee, or movement-based abilities.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Tizo is also a haunted man, though. Literally. Certain choices you make throughout the story can increase your Guilt, which causes ghosts to spawn during combat who, unlike other enemies, can chase and attack you even when the action is paused and you're thinking about your next move. This was a little annoying at first. But aside from being a very literal manifestation of how Tizo can't escape from the regrets of his past, it also trained me to play Arco in a more free-flowing, fast-paced style, which ended up being more fun than agonizing over every move for a long time. It has a nice rhythm to it when you treat it more like an action game.</p><h3>Fantastical Frontier</h3><p>In addition to all the different combos and fighting styles that are possible using Tizo's array of skills, the encounters in Arco never get too stale, either. Many feature enemies with unique mechanics you need to learn, and environmental features that can really turn the tide of battle. I never felt like I was being thrown into samey trash fights just as an excuse to inject some action. From dodging sandworms in the cactus-decked drylands to exploring an ancient, abandoned temple under attack by treasure-hunters, Arco always seems conscious that variety is the spice of life when it comes to environment and encounter design.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I found I was often rewarded for exploring every little corner with hidden loot, memorable side quests like tracking down some poachers, or even a simple fishing minigame. The world isn't only richly imagined. It's also full of stuff to do.</p></div><p>There are lots of little touches, too. Each individual area is fairly small, but the world altogether is actually quite large. And I found I was often rewarded for exploring every little corner with hidden loot, memorable side quests like tracking down some poachers, or even a simple fishing minigame. The world isn't only richly imagined. It's also full of stuff to do.</p><p>I look forward to making my way through the remainder of Arco's stories, which focus on different characters, and learning Tizo's eventual fate along the way. This is one of those somewhat unassuming indie games that surprised me with the grandeur, imagination, and affection present in its storytelling, offering a totally new perspective on some classic elements of the Western genre. I already think it will be close to the front of my mind when I talk about the hidden gems of 2024. You'll be able to saddle up and give it a try yourself later this summer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-90s-board-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-90s-board-games-to-play-in-2024.890334/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-90s-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The 90s was really the birthplace of the modern <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> hobby. Yes, timeless artifacts such as Go, Mahjong, and even Cosmic Encounter pre-exist the post-Cold War decade, yet the groundswell of fresh titles with radical ideas really built the foundation for modern design principles. Germany was popping off with hits left and right, while the collectible card game format changed everything. Beyond the greats, there are several nearly forgotten releases that deserve recognition.</p><h3>TL;DR The Best '90s Board Games</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/yNZVw" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/OwYND" target="_blank">Twilight Imperium</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/pPl0o" target="_blank">Catan</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Nx0KE" target="_blank">Robo Rally</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Ow7jE" target="_blank">Modern Art</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/lnYed" target="_blank">Paths of Glory</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/mLP8y" target="_blank">For Sale</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/lOJ8R" target="_blank">Blood Bowl</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/kv8j3" target="_blank">Tichu</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/vw2AP" target="_blank">High Society</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/kvWN0" target="_blank">El Grande</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/6yr4Z" target="_blank">Ra</a></li></ul><h2>Magic: the Gathering</h2><div id="165420"><p><h3>Magic: The Gathering Arena Starter Kit</h3></p></div><p>Where else to start than with the game that started the collectable card craze and revolutionized games and game stores in the nineties? There was a time when almost every role-playing and board gaming club switched to playing Magic: the Gathering. And it’s easy to see why with the lure of finding powerful rare cards in hidden packs, planning a deck to construct around them and thrilling to the mix of random draw and strategic combinations during play. It’s a recipe that’s still almost as intoxicating today and the game remains in good health. With high prize money tournaments, online play, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Km3pV" target="_blank">regular expansions</a> to collect there’s never been a better time to get involved.</p><h2>Twilight Imperium</h2><div id="158887"><p><h3>Twilight Imperium 4th Edition</h3></p></div><p>Many fans of Twilight Imperium would not even recognize its first edition. Fantasy Flight Games founder Christian Petersen brought his vision of a 4X board game to life way back in 1997. Flush with cardboard chits instead of plastic, the spirit of its later iterations was present in this inspired asymmetrical space conflict. Faction favorites such as the Jol-Nar and Emirates of Hacan were there right from the beginning, and the game was packed with an immense amount of setting. Its systems are slow and clunky by today’s standards, but this original release established a legacy that would prove the foundation for one of the strongest board game publishers of the early 2000s. The current fourth edition remains one of the most immersive and rich titles available.</p><h2>Catan</h2><div id="159921"><p><h3>Catan</h3></p></div><p>Catan, known in the ’90s as Settlers of Catan, didn’t sweep the popularity stakes like Magic. Nor has it aged quite as well. But in many respects, it had as much -- if not more -- long-term influence on the gaming scene. Before Catan, almost all tabletop games were variations on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board games</a> or dungeon crawling. But Catan’s mix of trading resources that players used to build a network of roads and settlements in an attempt to secure as much territory as possible showed us a whole new side to gaming. There was rich interaction without direct fighting or ganging up and rich <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> while still rolling a pair of dice and drawing random cards. It also introduced us to the novel paradigm of board games that existed in Germany, and gaming has never been the same since. </p><h2>Robo Rally</h2><div id="196201"><p><h3>Robo Rally</h3></p></div><p>Richard Garfield is known for more than just Magic: The Gathering. Robo Rally has players programming bots to dart around the factory in a ludicrous race. Each participant secretly chooses which cards they will play simultaneously. Then they are revealed and the robots start zipping around as chaos ensues. The goal is to pass through all of the checkpoints in order, which can prove more difficult than it initially appears. While many games would later nick Robo Rally’s programmed action approach, this was one of the first designs to lean into this creative and zany system. It still holds up and even just received a brand new reboot courtesy of Renegade Games.  </p><h2>Modern Art</h2><div id="165421"><p><h3>Modern Art</h3></p></div><p>Among the top designers who worked in German gaming, the most talented and prolific is Reiner Knizia. His oeuvre is so large that he’s worked on almost every genre but his particular love is for auction games, and his best auction game is Modern Art. Players take the role of dealers bidding to secure artworks based on five different methods of auction, from open bids to hidden values. But there’s a catch: your purchases will only be valuable if they’re popular: in other words, if other players are also collecting paintings by the same artist. This heady mixture of strategy and pointed satire on the art world is leant extra depth in the latest edition, which uses pieces by real-life artists.</p><h2>Paths of Glory</h2><div id="196202"><p><h3>Paths of Glory</h3></p></div><p>This wargame arrived at the end of the decade with a splash. Boasting a harrowing playtime of up to eight hours, this beast attempts to simulate the entirety of the First World War. This is one of the early card driven games where players spend cards for flexible action points or to trigger specific narrative events. There is a fascinating element of deck manipulation as participants race to attain new cards, while also thinning their deck through playing events. This creates an interesting ecosystem of turnover that has subtle implications over the length of play. While some may criticize this design as being too complex, and there is a certain truth to the notion that Twilight Struggle later perfected this format, this is still quite the evocative experience that remains available through continual print runs over the years.   </p><h2>For Sale</h2><div id="165423"><p><h3>For Sale</h3></p></div><p>You’ll rarely see so much game in such a small package as you will in For Sale. The game involves two decks of cards, one of real estate and the other of cheques, which are used in the two phases of play. In the first a selection of real estate cards is revealed each turn and the players bid on them using a limited supply of money. In the second, a selection of cheques is revealed and players secretly choose real estate from their hands to sell for those cheques, the most valuable getting the biggest payout. This simple game is a setup for endless agonising moments of not knowing whether you're going to be outbid in an auction, or outclassed in the secret hunt for cheque payouts. It’s excitement all the way down to the wire, but is simple enough for kids to play and still rewards canny strategizing.</p><h2>Blood Bowl</h2><div id="165424"><p><h3>Blood Bowl</h3></p></div><p>Adding this game here is a bit cheeky: you may have fond memories of the first edition of this crazy game of violent fantasy football, but the current edition is a complete redesign. The good news is that it’s even better: leaner, better looking and more strategic while still being just as crazy and just as violent. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcry-heart-of-ghur-brings-big-changes-to-the-tabletop-game">Warhammer</a>-esque underpinnings have been jettisoned in favor of a whole new game concept where your turn ends when you fail an action. That leaves every choice teetering on the precipice of risk and reward as you struggle to decide whether it’s worth prioritizing a dangerous action to advance your game plan. Plus, the old cardboard standees have been replaced with super-detailed plastic miniatures that look amazing on your tabletop. </p><h2>Tichu</h2><div id="165426"><p><h3>Tichu</h3></p></div><p>If Tichu didn’t require exactly four to play, it would have conquered the world. It’s not much to look at, essentially a rebranded deck of standard playing cards with four special extras, but there’s a reason for that. It’s actually a tweaked, commercialized version of a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family</a> of playing card games widely played in China. You play with a partner and the idea is to try and clear your hand by laying out a higher-value Poker style card combo than is currently on the table. But this basic formula is full of fascinating wrinkles because it’s rarely clear when it’s worth splitting a combo in your hand just to take what’s on the table, especially given the partner element. There’s also a pivotal bidding aspect because calling “Tichu” -- betting you’ll be first to empty your hand -- is where the bulk of points are won. Accessible, engaging and scarily addictive, Tichu deserves a much wider audience.</p><h2>High Society</h2><div id="165427"><p><h3>High Society</h3></p></div><p>Given this is the second Reiner Knizia auction game on the list you may gather that the good doctor (he’s got a PhD in mathematics) is keen on the mechanic and good at delivering it. This is the lightest and fastest of the three (see one more below) but it still delivers thrills, spills and biting social commentary. Each round is a sequence of bids on some fancy item that indicates you’re part of monied culture. But while your cash reserves range from small to high value, you can’t get change: you’re forced to choose between creeping up your bid or risking being left with only high-value notes to fritter on paltry wins. The other twist is that some cards are negative; for these, bidding works in reverse, with the first player to pass “winning” and everyone else throwing away their cash. You’ve got to keep up with your social circle by spending vast sums on trifles without beggaring yourself, a point of view that’s as fun to play as it is alienating to observe in reality. </p><h2>El Grande</h2><div id="159923"><p><h3>El Grande</h3></p></div><p>Of all the games published in the ‘90s, El Grande is perhaps the most enduring and the one that still feels freshest and most relevant today. Which makes it surprising that it hasn’t seen a reprint and remains expensive on the second-hand market. The secret of its success is posing players with a series of circular, but interactive, conundrums to solve as they seek to maximise influence on a map of Spain. You can go early or gain more influence to spend, not both. You can take a powerful action, or you can put lots of influence on the board, not both. And of course you can’t possibly have the majority in all the regions of the board, you’ve got to pick and choose your battles. It’s so well done and pushes so many gaming buttons that it remains thrillingly playable 25 years after it was released.</p><h2>Ra</h2><div id="165422"><p><h3>Ra</h3></p></div><p>Now, we come to another Reiner Knizia classic involving auctions. In Ra, you’re bidding on the history of ancient Egypt. Not in terms of artefacts but the far more abstract concepts of events, monuments, pharaohs and the like. Each type of tile has its own convoluted scoring mechanic, so you want to collect -- or avoid -- certain combinations. On your turn, you either add a tile to the stack available or start an auction, but currency in Ra is very limited and the winning amount becomes part of the next lot for auction. This makes every tile draw and every bid an excruciating elevator of excitement as you try and force players to bid on tiles they’d prefer to avoid while not getting caught in that trap yourself. This is back in print with a deluxe new edition that is gorgeous to behold.</p><h2>Why Highlight Games from the 90s?</h2><p>Well a lot of adults nowadays grew up in the 90s, so there's a big nostalgia factor for the decade! But on a more serious and interesting note, the decade was a particularly important and fertile one for board game design. Before the 90s, board games were either solidly commercial offerings of dubious quality for families, or adjuncts to the role-playing and wargaming hobbies. The 90s was when they came of age as a hobby and a media niche in their own right. There were two key reasons for this. </p><p>The first was an influx of designs that were translated into English from Germany and bought onto the international markets. Germany has a long, strong tradition of game playing as a mainstream passtime and that, together with an aversion for the kind of conflict games that used to dominate elsewhere, had lead to the growth of mechanical concepts that were almost unheard of outside the country. The first such game to gain much traction was known in German as Adel Verpflichtet which doesn't have a direct translation and so appeared under several different titles, the best known of which was Hoity-Toity. It combined bluffing and set collection into a package that was both exciting and strategic. It's designer was one Klaus Teuber who would, of course, go on to give us the game that changed everything in this regard, Settlers of Catan, after which the floodgates opened.</p><p>The other arrival on the scene was Magic: the Gathering in 1993. Part of the reason for its success is that it was inspired by, and was a distillation of, some of the biggest and most innovative games of earlier years such as Wiz-War, Titan and, most importantly, Cosmic Encounter. But the really fresh idea that it bought to the table was to combine a strategic card game with collectible trading cards into something where you could build your own decks leveraging your own strategies from your own collections. That gave it an incredibly addictive quality that allowed it to sweep the hobby sector. By the mid-90s a lot of role-playing game clubs were spending a lot of time playing Magic instead!</p><p>These two major changes saw a huge upsurge in creativity in the board game design space that would rocket over the next ten years, leading to a slew of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">all-time classic board games</a> in the mid-00s. But that's a whole other list.</p><p>For more, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">best engine-building board games</a>, as well as our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/root-board-game-buyers-guide">Root buying guide</a>.

<p data-characters="276" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re taking on <em>Fortnite</em>‘s Season 3 Weekly Quests, then you’ll know that the second set tasks you with healing in an Oasis Pool. If you don’t know where to find one, then never fear, as I’m here to help you with a map showing their locations.</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">While it’s not the toughest challenge in Season 3’s Week Two Quests—that honor goes to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-get-mythic-nitro-cars-in-fortnite-season-3-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">driving the Mythic Nitro Cars</a>—this still isn’t super straightforward, especially if you don’t know where the Oasis Pools are. Jumping in any old water you see isn’t going to cut it, so you need to be certain that you know where you’re going. </p> <h2 id="h-every-oasis-pool-on-the-fortnite-map" data-injectable="false">Every Oasis Pool on the <em>Fortnite</em> map</h2> <p data-characters="98" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">There are five Oasis Pools in <em>Fortnite</em>, all found in the wasteland biome in the south of the map. </p>

It’s not the first time that an Oasis Pool has saved me after a gunfight against a sharp opponent, so keep them in mind even when you complete the Week Two challenge. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodstained-ritual-of-night-classic-2-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ArtPlay and 505 Games have announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em>Classic 2 DLC, and it's just around the corner.</p>

<p>Classic II: Dominique's Curse, to give it its full title, launches on June 11th. It follows on from the game's first Classic mode, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodstained-classic-mode-release-date-set-for-next-week">released back in January 2021</a>.</p>

<p>The new DLC picks up where the main story of&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em>left off. You play as Dominique, who finds herself in Limbo after the events of the original game. She must acquire the power of the demon Bael for herself and attempt to escape.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-classic-2-dlc-dialogue.jpg?itok=KTWxBDAf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-classic-2-dlc-dialogue.jpg?itok=go47HM0j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em>'s second Classic mode follows Dominique on her journey through Limbo.</figcaption></figure><p>This mode will feature the same retro-inspired gameplay as the original Classic mode, which was in turn inspired by the original&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>games (although not quite to the same degree as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodstained-curse-of-moon-2-brings-back-castlevania-nostalgia">the&nbsp;<em>Curse of the Moon&nbsp;</em>spinoffs</a>).</p>

<p>It'll offer a huge new map to explore, as well as new abilities and artifacts to acquire, all of which will boost Dominique's power.</p>

<p>As you play, you'll encounter friendly demons who will give you hints, but beware: when night falls, those demons will become your enemies, and you'll have to vanquish them to proceed. If you're a fan of&nbsp;<em>Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest</em>, then it sounds like you'll get a kick out of this new mode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-classic-2-dlc-map.jpg?itok=2D-BpW4D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-classic-2-dlc-map.jpg?itok=fV0TQjDf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ritual of the Night</em>'s Classic 2 map is "massive", according to ArtPlay and 505.</figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em>yet, it's a 2.5D Metroidvania masterminded by&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>&nbsp;legend Koji Igarashi, and it's heavily inspired by that series, to say the least.</p>

<p>It features a huge, non-linear map to explore, plus a mechanic by which you can absorb the souls of defeated enemies, giving you new abilities in battle. Throw in a soundtrack that boasts the involvement of&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>'s Michiru Yamane and you've got a game&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>enthusiasts should be very excited about.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em>right now on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-file-size/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-file-size/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The file sizes for the next <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">Elden Ring</a> patch and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion were revealed today after being added to the PlayStation Database.</p>
<p>As reported on X/Twitter by PlayStation Game Size, the <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1798322189818876215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.012 patch</a>, which will introduce support to the highlight anticipated expansion, will bring the total file size to a little over 54 GB, around 3 GB more than the current version's size of around 51 GB. The<a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1798320557706076525" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion will obviously weigh more, as it will be over 16 GB big. The total file sizes will be different depending on the platform, but this gives a rough idea of how much free storage space will be needed on PC and consoles to install the new patch and the expansion. That extra 3 GB getting added to the total file size of the base game may also suggest that something new could be coming to Elden Ring besides the expansion later this month.</p>
<p>It has been over two years since FromSoftware launched its latest game to critical and commercial acclaim, but soon enough, Tarnished will be able to experience more of the Elden Ring's brutal world with the aforementioned Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. You can learn more about the massive DLC launching on June 21st on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hands-on-preview-the-erdtrees-light-casts-the-longest-shadow/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>Two hours was only enough time to get a brief taste of the smörgåsbord of new content Miyazaki and his team had been cooking up. However, it was just enough to get a proper feel for the trials and tribulations against a variety of bosses, explore a new legacy dungeon, and walk away with more questions than answers about Miquella’s true role in the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. Besting a giant floating Chinese lion dance that constantly shifted its elemental affinity around rewarded me with a pretty sweet lion helm to wear around the Shadowlands, so that was a nice bonus.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171654/star-wars-acolyte-series-jedi-sol-force-powers-mind-reading<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="4MiXWn"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23935413">The High Republic is a time</a> of relative peace in the Star Wars universe. Sure, there are still plenty of problems, and plenty of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23935633">people who want to threaten the galaxy</a>, but without the Sith to occupy them, the Jedi can be on top of these other dangers in a way they couldn’t during <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/13/20959862/star-wars-watch-order-disney-plus-movies-shows-chronological-skywalker-saga">the Skywalker Saga</a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23845775/star-wars-old-republic-hella-tight">the Old Republic</a>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23672528/star-wars-movies-tv-schedule-calendar-upcoming"><em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em></a> gives us a glimpse of the Jedi as galactic peacekeepers, but it also shows us a darker side of the Jedi, and a hint that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23673259/star-wars-high-republic-explained">their High Republic incarnation</a> could be more like the Sith than they’d like to admit — particularly when it comes to their use of the Force. </p>
<p id="cxgSCY">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This post contains spoilers for the first two episodes of <em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em>.]</p>
<p id="PvOIgA">Anyone who has spent time thinking about the Jedi, especially as they are in the prequel trilogy, will essentially understand them as the Star Wars galaxy’s police force. Ostensibly agents of the peace, they’re sent into difficult situations with the purpose of de-escalating them, but somehow — sometimes through their fault and sometimes not — the situation escalates to violence anyway. The Jedi must then, in spite of showy faux-monastic protestation, violently end the conflict, usually with the death of one or a few sentient beings. </p>

<p id="DQeQqr">Despite all this, the Jedi are generally (and not without reason) seen as the good guys in the Star Wars universe, thanks in part to their counterpart the Sith. The exact lines between the two factions have always been murky, but among the most important concerns their use of the Force. The Jedi use it to push and pull their foes, but there are clear delineations between what they deem good and bad. Using the Force to choke someone, turning it into lightning, reading someone’s mind, or holding their body in Force-induced paralysis are all seemingly frowned upon in almost every era of Star Wars. </p>
<p id="FEL9so">But <em>The Acolyte</em>’s first two episodes suggest that this might not be true in the High Republic. Late in the second episode, Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) ends a fight with Mae (Amandla Stenberg), the show’s titular acolyte and the assassin who’s been hunting down Jedi, by freezing her body in the air, rendering her completely unable to move. Then he reads her mind. </p>
<p id="ATcwAf">The show doesn’t treat the moment with much regard, but to a longtime Star Wars viewer it’s an unambiguous change in the Jedi’s usual code of conduct. In fact, the most memorable time we’ve seen Force mindreading in live-action, the character to use it was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2020/1/5/21050442/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-ending-kylo-ren-prequels-anakin">Kylo Ren</a>, not exactly a beacon of ethical Force use. In some ways this makes sense. </p>

<p id="nsVhki">With no Sith to compare themselves against, it seems reasonable that the Jedi’s actions would slip closer to their counterparts’. There’s no similar-but-bad group running counter to them, and the Jedi essentially have free rein over how the Force is defined. In the High Republic, it seems that means mind-control by way of Force stasis is a tool of the good guys. Or at least a tool of those that see themselves as the good guys — not entirely unlike Obi-wan Kenobi’s gray-area mind trick in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/13/20959862/star-wars-watch-order-disney-plus-movies-shows-chronological-skywalker-saga"><em>A New Hope</em></a>. </p>
<p id="VjNSBA">While <em>The Acolyte</em> is only just getting started, it certainly seems like it’s going to be a show about the faults of the Jedi, both in the High Republic era and beyond. After its first two episodes, the show is still playing most of its cards close to its chest with regard to what exactly happened to Mae and what the Jedi’s role in it was. But we certainly see that at least one Jedi is carrying so much guilt that he hasn’t spoken or done anything but meditate in years. If the rest of the show really is about the failings of at least some of the High Republic’s Jedi, then showing the ease with which they use the same tactics as the Dark Side of the Force, while still claiming to be working for good, would certainly be a compelling way to demonstrate that. </p>

<p id="D631rM">Of course, all of this involves a lot of “if”s, particularly for a Star Wars project. Star Wars’ live-action track record on meaningful themes isn’t so good, particularly of late. Ever since the prequels’ suggestion that the Jedi’s strict ban on emotions could push people toward evil rather than prevent it got reduced to a bizarre series of misunderstandings that pushed Anakin to the Dark Side, Star Wars has frequently been enamored with bringing up big ideas and important themes, only to drop them when things get complicated. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/22929592/book-of-boba-fett-hero-vs-villain"><em>Book of Boba Fett</em></a> took a character with the potential to explore themes like regret in the face of aiding fascism and turned him into a mayor instead. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23896100/star-wars-ahsoka-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>Ahsoka</em></a><em> </em>flirted with giving Ezra a non-violent appreciation of the Force after his accidental exile, then <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23903596/ahsoka-season-1-review">abandoned that without a second thought</a>. The sequel trilogy is perhaps the best example of this, with each movie gesturing toward something important before the next movie dropped it entirely. Only <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23473565/andor-season-1-review"><em>Andor</em></a><em> </em>has actually managed to find a voice and say something truly compelling, and those are awfully big shoes to fill. </p>
<p id="emdQma">Nonetheless, this is the position that <em>The Acolyte</em> has put itself in. And whether it succeeds or not, showing us an otherwise noble and upstanding (so far) Jedi who also happens to use the Force to torture someone is a pretty compelling starting point for the misdeeds of the Star Wars galaxy’s most powerful cult.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1798367846449430889?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X from Geoff Keighley, the world premiere gameplay trailer for Slitterhead will debut during Summer Game Fest 2024.</p>



<p>Slitterhead is the upcoming game from Keiichiro Toyama and Bokeh Game Studio. Toyama has been an industry giant for decades, and fans widely recognize them for creating Silent Hill.</p>



<p>Bokeh Game Studio first announced Slitterhead during The Game Awards 2021, with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyUGYL9aSww" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very brief teaser trailer</a>. </p>



<p>There have been very few notable updates since then, aside from a dev diary featuring some pre-alpha user tests. The devs posted that video in July 2023, showing more horror and potential combat mechanics.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The previous Slitterhead trailer featured tiny glimpses of gameplay, but it was mostly cinematic. It kept an aura of mystery and suspense throughout. </p>



<p>In fact, there wasn’t even a trailer description with minor details, which sometimes accompany big reveals. However, the teaser did mention that Slitterhead will include music from Akira Yamaoka.</p>



<p>At this time, Keiichiro Toyama and Bokeh Game Studio have not confirmed a release window or date for Slitterhead. Summer Game Fest would be an excellent opportunity to confirm a release window, if not a concrete date.</p>



<p>Slitterhead joins many other anticipated titles at Summer Game Fest 2024, which will include at least <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2 hours of game showcases</a>. The event begins on June 7, 2024, at 5 pm EST / 10 pm GMT.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Hidden Side Of Octopath Traveler's Combat</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It's important to take the news with a grain of salt, as Octopath developer Square Enix hasn't yet announced the release of Octopath Traveler for PlayStation consoles the way it announced the Xbox release last September. But the fact that it has been rated at all is likely indicative that the PlayStation release is indeed happening.</p><p dir="ltr">Giving PlayStation users access to the sequel without giving them access to the original game doesn't make a whole lot of sense, so despite the lack of any official announcement from Square Enix, the fact that the game has now been rated for PlayStation in Taiwan certainly gives fans of the franchise (and those who have been looking forward to playing it) a reason to celebrate. That being said, the second game is not a direct sequel to Octopath Traveler, so you don't need to play the first game in order to enjoy it</p><p>Although Square Enix did announce Octopath Traveler II's arrival on Xbox consoles, it has yet to announce exactly when that arrival will happen, but according to a report from <a href="https://exputer.com/news/xbox/octopath-traveler-2-xbox-release-june/" rel="nofollow ">Exputer</a>, it's likely to be sometime this month. It's possible that the PlayStation versions of the original Octopath Traveler could become available around the same time, since the Xbox versions of the sequel were rated by the Taiwanese committee alongside the PlayStation versions of the original game.</p>

<p data-characters="109" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy continues to expand on the small screen, specifically on the Disney+ streaming service. </p> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Following up such titles as <em>The Mandalorian</em>, <em>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</em>, and <em>Star Wars: Visions </em>comes <em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em> from showrunner Leslye Headland. Based on promotional material for the series so far, it’s safe to say that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-acolyte-how-the-series-was-inspired-by-star-wars-games/">the <em>Star Wars</em> RPG-inspired program</a> is quite a departure from most recent franchise endeavors.</p> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true">Set long before the events of <em>Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace</em>, <em>The Acolyte</em> sees a period of relative peace interrupted in the worst way. Mysterious forces are conspiring against the Jedi, killing those within its ranks. Thus, it’s up to a few brave members of the Jedi Order to figure out who is responsible for these heinous acts and put a stop to them before it’s too late.</p>
 <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true"><em>The Acolyte</em> puts a host of new characters front and center for this mystery, from Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen) to Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae). However, it’s no secret that <em>Star Wars </em>loves nothing more than tossing viewers cameos of their favorite legacy heroes and villains. In fact, it has come to light that a staple of the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/star-wars-how-to-read-the-high-republic-era-in-order/">Star Wars: The High Republic</a></em> multimedia initiative, Vernestra Rwoh (Rebecca Henderson), will appear on the program. Can fans expect more preexisting characters to appear?</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">Though it takes place far ahead of the Skywalker saga, one might think that characters with long lifespans like Yoda (Frank Oz), Yaddle (Bryce Dallas Howard), and potentially Plo Koon (James Arnold Taylor) could appear on <em>The Acolyte</em>. In reality, however, this isn’t the case. Headland herself revealed to <a href="https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/the-acolyte-creator-major-star-wars-cameos-yoda/">ComicBook.com</a> that cameos from such characters, specifically Yoda, who has appeared in <em>High Republic</em> stories already, aren’t on the table.</p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">With that said Headland did mention that she and the <em>Acolyte</em> team pulled from existing <em>Star Wars</em> material to fill out the show’s roster. “We are pulling characters from the <em>High Republic </em>and characters from the EU, but that’s it,” she said. So, one has to wonder which other <em>High Republic</em>-era characters besides Rwoh could pop up, and, more intriguingly, who from the Expanded Universe could do the same.</p>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">This time period could allow for Emperor Palpatine’s (Ian McDiarmid) Sith Master, Darth Plagueis, or even his master, Darth Tenebrous, to appear. After all, <em>The Acolyte</em> is about the sudden and violent reemergence of the Sith to the galactic forefront, so if there were ever a production for them to make their live-action introductions, this seems to be the one.</p> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="false">Time will tell which <em>High Republic</em> and Expanded Universe names could be on the table as <em>The Acolyte</em> unfolds across its eight-episode debut season. For those curious, here’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-release-schedule/">the series’ release schedule</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-online-summer-update-info<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar has released new information about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>summer update, which will let you engage in your very own brand of vigilante justice.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/1774797o5ka358/coming-this-summer-a-new-brand-of-vigilante-justice" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new blog post</a>, Rockstar says the update, which doesn't have a release date yet, will allow you to start up and run "your very own bail enforcement and bounty hunting business" in order to "clean up the roving reprobates of Southern San Andreas".</p>

<p>Even if you're not interested in dispensing the San Andreas version of frontier justice, though, there's still plenty for you to look forward to in this summer's&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>update.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-online-summer-update-2024-cars.jpg?itok=jVKMj2HE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-online-summer-update-2024-cars.jpg?itok=xt2Gf_Wz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of new goodies are coming your way in this summer's&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll get the chance to help Vincent with a "range of off-the-books enforcement activities", for instance, and if you're into racing, you can also look forward to new cars to collect.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of using&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>'s Creator feature, then you'll be pleased to know that this summer's update is bringing the opportunity to create custom Drag and Drift Race circuits. More units will be added across all tracks too, including crowd animations and "bouncing lowriders". Nice.</p>

<p>Testing races should also be easier, since you'll be able to test your races from any checkpoint you choose. In short, if you like creating&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>races, you should be looking forward to this update.</p>

<p>A number of smaller updates and tweaks are on the way too, including a boosted Sell Mission timer, buffs to the Sparrow and Bombushka aircraft, and more. We'll likely get more info as we get closer to the release date, whenever that happens to be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-online-summer-update-2024-new-car.jpg?itok=Pm2hsOvw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-online-summer-update-2024-new-car.jpg?itok=ZplG5ra5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Seriously, the new&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>update really hopes you love cars.</figcaption></figure><p>More info is coming soon, so make sure to keep an eye out on Rockstar's socials and other channels if you want to learn more about this summer's&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>update.</p>

<p><em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>may still be going strong, but its days in the sun may be numbered, at least in its current form. Rockstar is currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a>, the next mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>series, and it's not clear how that new game will affect&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>yet.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more news on all things&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>, as well as all things Rockstar in general.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/enshrouded-releases-melodies-of-the-mire-update-adding-musical-instruments-for-fireside-jamming-sessions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The team at Keen Games has released its second update for Enshrouded, known as Melodies of the Mire.</p>
<p>As you may have surmised from the name, this rather chunky update introduces musical instruments into the game, including lutes, harps, drums, and flutes. Players will be able to learn how to craft instruments from a new NPC, Valory of the Silverstrings. More instruments will be added further down the line.</p>
<p>In addition to this musical side of things, Melodies of the Mire also introduces a new area to Enshrouded: The Blackmire. This can be found in the north of the Revelwoods, with the developer stating things here are "a little bit bigger". This area holds a number of new quests, enemies, items and so forth for players to discover, as well as new floral pads which can be used as a kind of natural trampoline. You can take a little peek at The Blackmire in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Enshrouded players will also be able to get their hands on the game's first dual-wield weapon. These daggers, Keen said, are ideal for the Ranger class, adding it has also made improvements to the game's combat more generally.</p>
<p>"We can also confirm that the <em>number one most requested feature</em> on Feature Upvote currently will be included: player progression and world progression," Keen Games added. "Now, players can complete quests already finished by admins of other servers on their own time."</p>

<p>Eurogamer contributor Emma Kent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-a-survival-game-enshrouded-feels-too-safe">took a look at Enshrouded</a> earlier this year, calling it an "ambitious project in terms of scope, made all the more impressive by the fact it's still only in early access". While at the time she felt there was room for improvement, this is something today's update will perhaps address.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorry-were-closed">Sorry We're Closed</a>, an axe-murdering entrepreneur called Jenny is described in newspaper clippings as both a serial embezzler and as the city's "wealthiest bachelorette". Aside from being a dry reflection of tabloid reporting on women who commit crimes (bad woman! sexy, bad woman!) this is also the kind of incidental character-building you can expect in this perky, retro-styled survival horror. It plays like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a> charged with the hot pink body horror of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/porpentine">Porpentine</a> interactive fiction. And judging by my hour of unsettled strolling through the decrepit tube station of the game's demo, it's a powerful combo.</p>

<p>You play a moping break-up victim called Michelle in her "final days" as she becomes cursed with a third eye. Soon enough she is stumbling through grotty corridors and taking panicked potshots at twisted monsters that simply will not die. It's all given that late-90s Resident Evil look with cameras both fixed and following. By the time you encounter Jenny, she has already killed a man, ripped the paper money from his pockets, and shoved them into her mouth, yelling "MAXIMISE PROFITS!" She's a real catch.</p>

<p>I'm not the first of us to crawl through the demo, of course. "Its layers of London are like Silent Hill by way of Persona and Paradise Killer," said Alice O (RPS in peace) when she added it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-75-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2024">our 75 most anticipated games of 2024</a> list. She was not wrong. </p>
<p>It gets the feel of those old games spot on. What's more, it's adept at survival horror's old habit of understatement (aka. the <a href="https://i.redd.it/lze4f0atwue21.jpg">"doghouse"</a> effect). In one room, a portrait of a terrifying woman looms over you, her white eyes and noseless face staring into your soul. "She is well-dressed," says the game. In another room, you find the twisted corpses of some otherworldly creatures hanging from the walls, perhaps they are even humans, mutilated beyond recognition. "This display has a strong smell," it says.</p>
<p>I love this. The detached narrator voice that accompanies environmental moments in old horror games, aside from being incredibly comical, suggests a kind of mental shutdown. As if part of the game itself remains in denial. As if the puppet masters of this world, perhaps even the player themselves, are detached and unmoved by the terror that assails Heather Mason or Jill Valentine. You never find a pile of severed heads and bloodied torsos. You find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwkr8x1fir5g41.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D1e29729b831d1808d4c1b0e53c2f234f85b5e6c9">"nothing unusual here"</a>.</p>
<p>But I've focused on perhaps the wrong thing. When you play, you'll be too busy using our hero's third eye to change the environment immediately around your character. This is partly cosmetic; viscera-coated cages turn into simple vending machines as you pass by. A huge rusty safe, under the lamplight of your third eye, becomes a pile of ordinary luggage. </p>

</figure>
<p>It also has a practical effect. Thorny obstructions in the grimey world are reduced to spindly stalks you can pass through freely. Bathroom sinks that dispense filthy water in the disgust-dimension will spurt out clean water under the influence of the third eye's aura, restoring your health. Enemies meanwhile, will be briefly stunned when you click your fingers to activate the eye, and a weak point gets revealed when they step into the aura. Prime shootin'. So long as you remember that anything outside the aura cannot be struck.</p>
<p>There was a period in which old games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-3">Silent Hill 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-soul-reaver">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</a> were obsessed with the idea of two parallel dimensions existing within the same space. But the technical solutions applied to that idea always meant it felt like you were merely stepping from one space into another. Sorry We're Closed chases the same dimension-hopping dream as those old designers but applies the modern approach that allows you to see the difference between realms in real time. </p>
<p>This may not seem significant to many players in the post-Portal, post-Titanfall 2 world we live in today, but if the creators at Team Silent in 2003 could be shown the third eye effects of Sorry We're Closed (and, come to think of it, Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-medium">The Medium</a>), their noughties eyeballs probably would have popped out of their sockets and rolled into a fetid drain. As a developer that must be worth some pride, to know that you've got a tool in your rusty toolbox that the horror heroes of yesteryear would have loved to use, if only they'd had the chance.</p>

<strong>The death of E3
</strong></a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<p>In the beginning, it was about respect.</p>
<p>The video games industry in the 1990s didn't get any. Tom Kalinskie, who led Sega America during this time, recounts two stories that sums up the world's attitude towards gaming.</p>
<p>The first came about during the famous 1993 – 1994 US senate hearings around violent video games. Kalinskie had been called in by his own senators to talk about the issue, and he explained how games are not just for kids.</p>
<p>"They scoffed," he recalled. "They couldn't believe it. "Are you kidding me? Everyone knows video games are just children's products. You shouldn't be doing these aggressive things'. And they basically tossed me out of their offices in DC."</p>
<p>Later on, Kalinskie visited Jack Valenti, the head of the Motion Pictures Association, to ask if video games could use the same age ratings system as the film industry, especially as everyone was so familiar with it. Valenti refused. He didn't understand why the huge movie industry would lend the tiny games industry its rating system.</p>
<p>US Government scrutiny over violent video games is what ultimately led to the formation of the Interactive Digital Software Association (today called the Entertainment Software Association), a dedicated trade body set up by the games industry, initially,  to create a ratings system for games (and thus avoiding any Government legislation). The games industry had finally unified, and it was through this new organization that it would start to push back. Part of that, it became apparent, was having its own event to showcase the medium.</p>
<p>Back in 1994, the games industry would descend upon the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to showcase its games and consoles to retailers and media.</p>
<blockquote><p>"CES didn't care a jot about video games"</p><cite>Tom Kalinskie, former Sega US boss</cite></blockquote>
<p>"CES didn't care a jot about video games," recalls Kalinskie.</p>
<p>"It was bad enough they used to put us at the back of the big hall, but one year they put us out the back door under a large tent. You had to walk past all the porn sections to get to us. It rained that year in Las Vegas, and there was a leak over the Sega area and water dripped on my Sega Genesis consoles. And I said: 'That's it, we're never doing this again, we will do our own show.'"</p>
<p>The games industry tried to negotiate with CES to improve how video games were being represented, but to no avail. So the IDEA partnered with the International Data Group, an organisation that ran the GamePro magazine and the Macworld conventions, to build out a dedicated video games trade show. CES made a last ditch effort to counter the event, but the damage was done. E3 was born.</p>
<p>"Gary Shapiro [head of the Consumer Technology Association, which ran CES] called it Black Thursday, because everyone was faxing in their CES cancellations every half an hour," remembers Mary Dolaher, who effectively ran E3 from its inception until its final physical show in 2019.</p>
<p>Peter Moore, who exhibited at E3 from 1999 with Sega, Microsoft and then EA, adds: "We were craving attention and relevance. We were much maligned as a medium by Hollywood, by TV, by music. I testified in front of the senate on behalf of video games in 2000, and games were seen as the root of all evil. I always remember 'Call of Duty killer' headlines in the UK. Video games were an easy target. I was involved, working with the ESA and the industry, in building out this tentpole moment to say 'Look at us. Look at what we're doing for entertainment'."</p>
<p>The first E3 in 1995 may not have been as excessive as the years that followed, but it was a dramatic and competitive event. Nintendo, Sony and Sega were all there demonstrating their new consoles: The Ultra 64, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Nintendo's console was still a year away, so all eyes were on Sony and Sega and their CD-based machines.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Bar brief trips to Atlanta and Santa Monica, E3's home was the Los Angeles Convention Center</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sega was hugely popular in the US at the time, but there were concerns around the Saturn's technical capabilities, and there was significant buzz around Sony's machine. So Sega made the decision to surprise launch the Saturn during E3 – four months earlier than planned – and get ahead of its new rival.</p>
<p>"I was not in love with the Saturn architecture, and my head of R&amp;D, Joe Miller, wasn't either," Kalinskie tells us. "We felt it needed to be a bigger step-up than it was. And then I was forced to introduce it at that E3, and I really didn't want to. I had three titles, maybe, I didn't have enough hardware. But Japan forced me to do it."</p>
<p>Sony countered with a surprise of its own. PlayStation's US boss Steve Race took to the stage and simply said '299'. It was a killer punch. Sony's console would be $100 cheaper than Sega's.</p>
<p>"Ah, the shortest speech in E3 history," laughs Race. "Right up until that morning we were still debating the price. We were wrestling with the Japanese to get to that magic $299 price point. I have no idea what I'd have said if they'd insisted on $399. As you could tell, I didn't have a speech prepared for that situation."</p>
<h2 id="section-1">The console war battleground</h2>
<p>From that moment on, E3 became synonymous with platform battles, as the major hardware manufacturers  battled it out in Downtown LA.</p>
<p>"E3 was the battleground for the console war," recalls Moore.</p>
<p>"The question of 'Who won E3?' was always what people wanted to know. Who had the best press conferences? Who had the most engaging content? Who had the biggest crowds? It was fighting and scrapping for the leadership position in an industry that was growing exponentially. E3 was both the battleground as well as the canvas on which we painted our industry."</p>
<blockquote><p>"In the old days it was Wild West, it was what you could get away with and still get gamers to believe you were showing them real games."</p><cite>Peter Moore, former Sega, Xbox and EA exec</cite></blockquote>
<p>Moore's first taste of the console war was when the Sega Dreamcast went toe-to-toe with PlayStation 2, and it was a bruising encounter.</p>
<p>"My fight with PlayStation goes back to the Sega days, when Sony just FUDed us… putting 'fear, uncertainty and doubt' in the minds of the gamer," Moore explains.</p>
<p>"Go look at Kessen and The Bouncer. Those were PS2 games that went up against us. They were cinematics. They certainly weren't gameplay, and probably weren't even in-engine. Even 24 years later, I still remember those games. I was a layman at the time. I was just some shoe guy from Reebok who had been dropped into the video game industry. And I was thinking: 'There is no way these games will look like that'. In those days you could get away with that because there was less scrutiny from media and regulators. Now, the FTC has got involved to tell people to be honest with what they're showing. But in the old days it was Wild West, it was what you could get away with and still get gamers to believe you were showing them real games."</p>

<p>Moore got a second crack at PlayStation when he switched to Microsoft and launched the Xbox 360, and this time he was ready.</p>
<p>"They tried to FUD us with PS3, but that just didn't work. The pricing was wrong… we had our challenges, like the Red Ring of Death, but we got out ahead of them.</p>
<p>"It was a real battle. If you go back and see me with a Halo 2 tattoo, or later a GTA 4 tattoo… I was just sticking it to PlayStation with a bit of Scouse in-your-face aggression. PlayStation came up with a trailer for Killzone that was just total bullshit, and we knew it. They knew they needed to counter-punch, because we were ahead of them in terms of the Xbox 360 launch. So they created a movie and alluded that it was how the game would look, which of course it didn't."</p>
<p>The PS3 era was a low point in Sony's storied history with E3. Shawn Layden, who held numerous leadership roles at PlayStation, recalls the calamitous E3 press event in 2006 where PS3 was revealed.</p>
<p>"We were setting up the stage, and then all of a sudden everything crashed. We had engineers there, we were rebooting, we were updating code in real time to make sure these things were running. We ended up making people wait for over two hours outside in the Southern Californian heat for the PlayStation 3 press conference, because we couldn't stabilise the code on stage.</p>
<p>"And then later on when we announced that PlayStation 3 was going to be available for the low, low price of $599 for the 60GB version. And the massive groan that went around the room. I have a lot of hard memories around the PS3 years at E3."</p>
<p>Nintendo has largely separated itself from the console war these days, but it certainly enjoyed getting one over its rivals at E3. And whereas 2006 may have been an event to forget for Sony, it was quite the opposite for Nintendo.</p>
<blockquote><p>"I remembered a sea of people running through Sony's booth to get into line to try the Wii"</p><cite>Rob Matthews, former Nintendo and Xbox exec</cite></blockquote>
<p>"We were launching Wii and didn't know how it was going to go," recalls Rob Matthews, who was Nintendo’s head of consumer marketing at the time.</p>
<p>"The main way you came into the E3 hall meant that people had to walk around Sony's booth to get to ours. I was there on the upper deck as the doors opened, and I remembered a sea of people running through Sony's booth to get into line to try the Wii for the first time. I was like 'Wow. We've got something special here'."</p>
<p>"That was true," agrees Perrin Kaplan, who was Nintendo's VP of marketing and corporate affairs and now co-runs PR agency Zebra Partners. Our booths were next to each other, and people just cut through. We had a line that was wrapped twice around what was a very large booth. [Wii] was absolutely industry-shifting and it was neat to be part of that."</p>
<p>E3 was a competitive show. Rivals openly ridiculed each other (who could forget<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA"> Sony's video mocking Xbox One's game sharing options</a> in 2013?), and there were even stories of sabotage (Kalinskie claims Sony deflated his giant Sonic balloon in 1995). And that competitiveness played out in the halls of E3, where Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox could be found side-by-side.</p>
<p>"It was cool when all the big three were in the same hall together," says Matthews, who later left Nintendo to join Xbox and was responsible for the firm’s E3 efforts.</p>
<p>"It kept us all on our toes. Xbox was inevitably always right next to Sony. I remember our big green glowing wall next to their big blue glowing wall. And there is that famous picture of right down the hall with the two logos facing off.</p>
<p>"We were frenemies for that whole endeavour. We were doing something for the bigger cause of video games around the world. If you look at the smaller brands, and the accessory brands and the companies who wouldn't normally be able to make a dent in their marketing if it wasn't for the big three or four putting them on stage... We would compete vigorously with each other all throughout the year, but we also realised that we were all in the same small industry and doing something special."</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Making E3 PG-13</h2>
<p>After E3's debut year, the event went into overdrive. Companies were fighting over space in the halls, the parties got bigger and the costs just kept on going up and up.</p>
<p>"The excesses were always excessive," Layden remembers of the early E3s.</p>
<p>"The two years at Atlanta, Georgia were crazy years [E3 temporarily left the Los Angeles Convention Center in 1997 and 1998 due to building work]. The industry was making a lot of money. Back then, Tomb Raider was the biggest thing in the world and there was this huge party, which was as crazy and debauched as you might imagine. But that was the industry. We were becoming really successful. It was an industry coming out of mum's basement."</p>
<p>This level of success attracted unwanted attention. The E3 organisers had to adopt increasingly more stringent vetting processes to prevent undesirable companies getting in. Businesses would claim to have a game only to turn out to be something else entirely (such as a talent agency promoting models).</p>
<p>E3 also reflected the young, male-dominated nature of the industry at the time. Female models wearing revealing outfits were commonplace.  In 2003, Nokia even announced the price of its N-Gage games phone by having a model remove her top to reveal the price on her stomach. And things would go even further on the E3 show floor.</p>
<p>"Each year the exhibitors would push the envelope a bit further in trying to get attention," Dolaher says. "One particular company had booked a small 10x10 booth, and they had a woman who would strip down to basically nothing. We had ESA members come to us and say 'If this is what companies need to do to sell their game, then maybe they shouldn't be on the show floor'."</p>
<p>The offending company refused to leave the show when asked, so Dolaher shut off the booth's power. In protest, the company tried to auction the model's underwear online, prompting the E3 organiser to go even further.</p>
<p>"I shrink wrapped them," she laughs. "We got huge rolls of plastic wrap and we covered the entire booth. We left the top open because he refused to leave. I said 'Okay, I'll leave you some air'. It was hysterical."</p>
<blockquote><p>"One particular company had booked a small booth, and they had a woman who would strip down to basically nothing"</p><cite>Mary Dolaher, E3 organiser</cite></blockquote>
<p>The incident prompted a change in the rules over what was acceptable attire at E3.</p>
<p>"We worked with all the member companies and asked them what they thought was appropriate and how they wanted us to write the rules. I called everyone in the event industry that I knew. Most didn't have it as bad as us. It was over-the-top. We decided that everyone had to show us their uniforms and costumes in advance for approval</p>
<p>"Then we would do the searches on the show floor. It was very labour-intensive, but it was worth it. We just made the event PG-13. Dresses had to be X amount of inches, and shorts couldn't be worn, and no thongs and things like that. It seemed crazy at the time… but I tell you, the death threats I was getting were awful.</p>
<p>"People were saying I was an old ugly b*** who probably drives a minivan. And I was like 'Hey, I draw a line at minivan'."</p>
<h2 id="section-3">The Santa Monica experiment</h2>
<p>E3’s goal of attracting mainstream attention was succeeding. Politicians and celebrities would make appearances at the event, and this brought in all sorts of media to the show.</p>
<p>"In the mid-2000s, it was the mainstream, popular, TV channels, the likes of CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC… they would send film crews and correspondents to the show floor of E3," Moore says. "And that gave us that sense of relevance and deserved acclaim in what we were doing."</p>
<p>However, as E3 got bigger, noisier and more expensive, ESA members started to become dissatisfied. With 60,000 people descending upon the LA Convention Center, it was proving harder to get actual business done, and the industry insisted things had to change. This led to the creation of the E3 Media &amp; Business Summit. Between 2007 and 2008, E3 was capped to just 5,000 people in a hangar in Santa Monica, with various press events held in hotels around the area. It was a logistical nightmare (there were very few places to park trucks), and despite the smaller size, remained expensive to produce.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>"It was a disaster," recalls Moore.</p>
<p>Dolaher adds: "There was no pizazz, none of that big stuff you did with the media. And the industry felt it."</p>
<p>Despite it being a clear low point in E3's story, Dolaher credits the Santa Monica experiment as effectively saving the show.</p>
<p>"This happened during a time of transition in ESA leadership, and luckily, we were able to convince the Board to downsize the show instead of discontinuing it altogether. It was a huge challenge logistically, but in the end it kept E3 alive long enough for it to come back later at full force. In 2009 we reinvented the show back in Downtown LA and launched with 41,000 attendees."</p>
<h2 id="section-4">The famous faces of E3</h2>
<p>The excess soon returned. E3 was the games industry’s Hollywood event. In fact, part of the reason the event was held in LA was to attract the attention of the wider entertainment world, and it worked, with actors, athletes and musicians making regular appearances.</p>
<p>Most people we spoke to had a celebrity story of some description. Leon Winkler, who ran Ubisoft's E3 showing from 2014 onwards, recalls the surreal moment he pitched E3 to It's Always Sunny star Rob McElhenney (to promote his Ubisoft-backed sitcom Mythic Quest), and the time he shared a cigarette with Elijah Wood.</p>
<p>"We talked about his work and his time in Amsterdam when he did Amsterdam things. It's these human moments that create the memories," Winkler says.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/MooreSpielberg.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Peter Moore with Steven Spielberg at E3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Moore was frequently paired on stage with sports stars, or tasked with guiding Steven Spielberg around his booth.</p>
<p>"One of my favourite memories was being with Mohammed Ali backstage," Moore begins.</p>
<p>"That was during my Xbox days. EA Sports was coming hard on the platform. And because of games like Fight Night and Knockout Kings, we managed to get Mohammed to come with us. He was, unfortunately, well into his Parkinsons then. My job for a few minutes was to look after him, if you will, just off stage. There was this screen with what we were showing, and Halo was on it. And in it there was Master Chief taking down a Brute. The Brute then goes down with a crash. Mohammed couldn't speak other than a slight whisper, and his way of communicating was via little magic tricks, which were wonderful. But at that moment he leaned over to me and he goes: "Down. Goes. Fraiser". Which is a very famous boxing call from Howard Cosell that I knew very well. That was a moment I'll never forget. Then we walked out on stage."</p>
<p>Many legends and famous faces have walked the stages of E3 down the years, from Pele to The Beatles. And Keanu Reeves’s 'You're breathtaking' line at E3 2019 may go down as the show's last truly iconic moment.</p>
<p>However, arguably the biggest star of E3 remains one of our own.</p>
<p>"We had so many celebrities on our stage," says Matthews. "We had Usher. We had The Beatles. But out of all the celebrity meetings you can have, the one most impactful for me was meeting Shigeru Miyamoto."</p>
<p>Perrin Kaplan laughs: "Our biggest challenge every year was getting Mr Miyamoto from the front door of the Convention Center to the booth without being late. We loved people saying hi, or doing autographs, but getting him through that daily was really tough.</p>
<p>"Really early on, he would still wonder why all these people wanted to talk to him. I had to tell him, 'Your games inspired them. You're an original, man'."</p>
<blockquote><p>"Our biggest challenge every year was getting Mr Miyamoto from the front door of the Convention Center to the booth"</p><cite>Perrin Kaplan, former Nintendo exec</cite></blockquote>
<p>Miyamoto had a few iconic E3 moments. Probably the most famous was in 2004, when he appeared on stage with a sword and shield after the debut of the trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and was greeted by weeping fans and thunderous applause.</p>
<p>Ubisoft created a similar moment in 2017 during its reveal of Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle, where Miyamoto and Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stood back-to-back wielding replicas of the game's guns.</p>
<p>"When I first pitched that idea with Nintendo, they were not sure and thought it should be more serious," Winkler says. "And the idea of having that smoke machine when Miyamoto walked into the auditorium, with the lights in the background… they were like 'I dunno'. But we said, 'Just try it out, we'll do it on site, if he gets enthusiastic about it, we'll do it'. And on the day he was like 'Yeah, this is cool'.</p>
<p>"Now we have two legends on stage, Miyamoto and Yves, and they have guns. So let's create the picture of E3 with them back-to-back. That picture was everywhere when people were talking about E3 that year."</p>
<figure>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Yet for all the famous faces, Winkler says it was the human moments that made E3 special. That iconic Mario + Rabbids pose may have been the picture of the show, but it was the footage of the game's creative director, Davide Soliani, in tears that resonated the most.</p>
<p>"That's the cool thing about events; you can show the human side of the work that we do. I could see in rehearsals that Davide was getting emotional, and I thought 'Maybe we should get a camera moment ready for that'. Because it is important. It humanises us as an industry. It's Davide, who has been a Nintendo fan since he was a kid, and now his idol is on stage giving him props… I would cry, too."</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Giant booths, 87-piece orchestras, and Cirque du Soleil</h2>
<p>Beyond the celebrities there were the production values. E3 booths were frequently extravagant. Personal favourites of mine include Capcom's recreation of the Resident Evil 7 house, Bethesda's Fallout 76 vault experience, and the absolutely huge Mafia 3 booth, which brought New Orleans to the show floor.</p>
<p>"Game companies have always been extremely competitive, so this manifested itself in the extravagance of the booths," Dolaher says. "With that said, I didn't anticipate having to facilitate things like having Marines rappel down the outside of South and West Halls of LACC, building a full-scale boxing ring in one of the halls, constructing a castle on the show floor, and so much more."</p>
<p>Nintendo's booth was almost always a destination. It was routinely more like something you'd expect to see at Disneyland than a trade show, with its thick plush carpet and impressive set designs. During the Switch era alone, we had recreations of Hyrule, New Donk City (from Super Mario Odyssey) and even Luigi's Mansion.</p>
<p>"It was hard work and expensive, and the person who led it [Don James], led it from the very first show to the last," Kaplan shares. "He's still at Nintendo. I couldn't imagine a more passionate person leading that. For Nintendo, it was just a great creative endeavour. What do we want it to feel like? What's the theme? And we really wanted to build that out so the experience could be extremely satisfying."</p>

<p>The extravagance and expense wasn’t just confined to the E3 show floor. Layden recalls Sony's theatrical E3 2016 press conference, complete with live orchestra.</p>
<p>"They'd torn down the sports arena where we had been doing E3 for ten years, so we went to the Shrine Auditorium," he says.  "So many people go there and try to turn it into a modern event hall, but it can't be. It was built in 1927. So we said 'Let's embrace it'. We had the full maroon, velvet scrim that dropped behind the stage. We had an orchestra pit. So we went old school. I had Bear McCreary conducting an orchestra right in front of me. I hit my mark, I make my pivot, Bear pulls his arms up, I nod my head and Bear suspends the orchestra. There is no feeling in the world like walking out on stage to an 87-piece orchestra. There's nothing like that. It was fucking amazing.</p>
<p>"That will be my lasting memory of E3. That, and getting pushed out of the food line by Macy Gray at the PlayStation party. I was standing too long in front of the mash potato, and Macy needed her potatoes."</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>If that sounds expensive, consider Microsoft's E3 2010 showcase for Kinect.</p>
<p>"In one of the planning meetings, I kept on saying that we needed to do something different and more unique than just a press conference," remembers Matthews. "I said 'It's about movement and motion. We need to do something like Cirque Du Soleil would do'. And I remember walking out of that meeting, stopping and looking at my head of events and saying 'Heck, we're Xbox, why don't we just call Cirque Du Soleil?'</p>
<p>"We gave them a call the next day. We flew out to see them the next week. We were up in Montreal. We told them the story of Kinect and the vision, and they flew down two weeks later. We were in a conference room at Microsoft, and the creative director of Cirque Du Soleil comes in with several of his staff. He hits play on a sound system, and this crazy surreal music starts to play. They turn down the lights, they light these twinkling lights around the room, and then he starts with 'It's beyond the beginning of time', and he throws a bucket of sand onto the conference table 'And the people of the world are primitive'.</p>
<p>"And that was our show. I stood in that arena after we did it live, and I called my wife and said: 'This is one of those moments in your career that you never thought would happen, but I am always going to remember'."</p>
<p>The 'live' element of E3 was often a terrifying experience. During the Cirque Du Soleil rehearsal, Matthews remembered how the rotating stage wasn't moving at the right time, the screens were out-of-sync, the scoreboards in the arena randomly turned on at one point… but that was the only rehearsal. The next time it was performed, it was live (and thankfully, it went 'flawlessly').</p>
<figure>

<p>Outside of performances, the other challenge was making sure the game demos didn't break.</p>
<p>"Shit goes wrong all the time," Moore says. "We would always ghost ride behind a game… so you'd have another console running the demo in parallel. I remember Gears of War crashed… but it was almost unknown to the audience because we clicked the input and the ghost rider took over. A few people might have gone 'What just happened?', but not many. We were a pretty well-oiled machine in all my three iterations of Sega, Xbox and EA."</p>
<p>Matthews adds: "I can't tell you how many back-ups upon back-up systems that we would run to make those shows go."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no amount of back-up systems could prepare for human error.</p>
<p>"One time, I played Rock Band live with Harmonix, and I accidentally paused the game, and I think a million people laughed at me," Moore recalls fondly. "In rehearsal it was fine, but when we went live I realised there was a slight lag from where I was looking at the screen and bizarrely I… I think of that and I smile, but also feel a bit of horror."</p>
<h2 id="section-6">EA, Sony, and Microsoft leave the LACC</h2>
<p>E3 was expensive and a huge amount of work. The whole industry was geared around it. Companies held back announcements for that week, developers would build dedicated game demos, and there were teams working on it all year long.</p>
<p>"We basically produced the equivalent of the Grammys every year with the main press conference and show," Matthews says. "There was a big part of my team where that was what they did for the best part of a year."</p>
<p>Layden adds: "The planning was immense, which is why taking E3 out of the schedule has opened up thousands of man hours across the industry. Quite often when you build demo code for E3, it's not game code, it's a discrete piece of work that you create just for that show. And then you throw it away and you go back to working on the main game.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We basically produced the equivalent of the Grammys every year with the main press conference and show"</p><cite>Rob Matthews, former Nintendo and Xbox exec</cite></blockquote>
<p>"The people who organise our E3 show are the people who organise shows for Disney and the networks… TV producer people, basically. It's a high-wire act, and it can be incredibly frightening."</p>
<p>And the financial cost was enormous. "It was in the tens of millions of dollars," Moore says. "Whether that's building out the booth or attending… in those days we were taking 300, 400, 500 people to E3.</p>
<p>"But also you had to look at the productivity cost of taking people away from their day jobs for months to work on booth development, marketing tools, digital assets… everything."</p>
<p>The cost of E3, whether we're talking time or money, was proving harder to justify. E3 was a media and retail event, but the role of retail was becoming smaller in the face of digital distribution. Plus, as the industry evolved, June was often too late to be selling to retailers anyway.</p>
<p>"You had to sell Christmas business in February," Layden explains. "You couldn't wait until June. So by the time E3 came around, you're not selling anything anymore."</p>
<p>Then there was the role of the media. Although still important, publishers were increasingly going direct to consumers with their messaging. Nintendo stopped doing its press conference in 2013 in favour of a pre-recorded video aimed at fans.</p>
<p>"Direct-to-consumer became a bit of the downfall of E3," explains Moore. "Folks in the media became a little less important."</p>
<p>Layden agrees: "For the big companies, it just became a peacocking event. It also wasn't so much about press anymore, because everyone was breaking embargoes anyway, and the press was publishing 24 hours a day… by 2015, E3 had really lost its meaning as a trade show because no trade was really happening."</p>
<p>EA was the first major company to leave E3 in 2016. The publisher was eager to involve fans in its event and after failing to convince the ESA to allow that to happen, it held its own event – EA Play – in the same city just before E3 opened its door.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-06-05-134446.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>EA ran its own event during the E3 period called EA Play since 2016</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"We decided to just do our own," Moore says. "You rent a hotel, and a big space, and then you see how it goes. Once we pulled out, the belief was that the other guys would, too. Maybe it would be a death by 1,000 cuts. I lived through this in my previous life. I watched Nike, Adidas and Reebok pull out of the Super Show in Atlanta, and the thing collapsed completely. It took a little longer with E3, but ultimately, as the industry changed, the need for E3 waned. And from the perspective of spending that kind of money, and not speaking to gamers directly… it seemed kind of reductive to us."</p>
<p>E3 was strict with its exhibitors. If a company dropped out one year, it risked losing its preferred spot on the show floor. That's why one year Capcom took an entire booth primarily to promote its DuckTales remaster, and why Take-Two built a whole booth for invite-only meetings. They wanted to hold their space for the following year.</p>
<p>There was very little flexibility with E3 rules. If you wanted to do something differently, such as what EA wanted to do, then tough.</p>
<p>"You have to apply the rules evenly across the board with everyone, everything down to every last detail in the contracts," Dolaher says. "You'll get someone come up and say 'We are not going to sign it this year, we don't like this clause'. And then we'll say 'Sorry, then you're out. We want you in the show, but we can't be arbitrary and capricious on all of the rules'. It's hard to say no when they're the ones signing your cheque, but it has to be a level playing field for everyone."</p>
<p>The industry was at odds with what they wanted E3 to be. Some publishers wanted a pure B2B show, while others wanted to allow the fans in.</p>
<p>The attempted solution in 2016 was to add something called E3 Live at the neighbouring LA Live complex. But the free event was announced late and the results were poor.</p>
<p>"I have a lot of grey hairs from that," says Dolaher.</p>
<p>"We only had six weeks, because the ESA didn't like the logo and kept holding things up. If we had a full year, we could have populated the whole of LA Live, so the whole campus would have felt like 'Okay, this is where E3 is, but the B2B bit is in the building'. There were so many ways to do it, and we tried a lot of them, but you have to have that industry consensus, because that's where it starts to fall apart."</p>
<p>In the end, the organisers started selling consumer tickets to the main E3 show, with 15,000 going on sale in 2017. But E3 simply wasn't built for gamers, and the next major exit from the show was Sony in 2019.</p>
<p>"E3 couldn't adapt," Layden says.  "It was like 'Well, we'll sell 15,000 consumer tickets.' And I remember fighting with the ESA Board about that. I said 'Pick a lane, you're a consumer show or a trade show, you can't be both.' The physical design of a consumer show is different to a trade show. A trade show you're trying to make it like Ikea, where people can never get out. But with a consumer show, you design it for throughput.</p>
<p>"When E3 started inviting consumers in, and they're waiting for four hours to play Breath of the Wild… that's not a good experience."</p>
<p>Sony, which had been a key part of E3 since its inception, couldn't justify the show anymore.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We promised the ESA that we wouldn't set up a competitive event. They could have their week"</p><cite>Shawn Layden, former PlayStation US CEO</cite></blockquote>
<p>"The press already has your stories, so trying to hold something back for a surprise announcement was getting harder and harder," Layden says. "And then you looked at the cost. The press conference was a tonne of money, then there was the booth on the show floor, and then you're paying drinks, hotels, flights and martinis for 400 people.</p>
<p>"Going into 2019, we looked at it and felt that June was an arbitrary date, we don't have anything in development to go into that window and tell a good story, and if you're doing E3… from January 1 until E3 is over, your dev teams are locked in making demos, and your marketing department is locked in getting the hype machine running. By not doing E3, it gave us three months back into the calendar.</p>
<p>"We promised the ESA that we wouldn't set up a competitive event. We won't do any pressers, or state of the nation addresses… they could have their week."</p>
<p>Another blow was Microsoft's decision to move its booth off the E3 show floor and into the theatre next door, which the company owned at the time.</p>
<p>"Letting Microsoft go there… that is something in the earlier days we would never have done," Dolaher says. "We wouldn't have given them free space, but we would have done what we had to to keep them on the show floor. They own the theater, so what are you going to do? Letting them go over there, letting EA leave and go across town… that was a slow painful death."</p>

<figcaption>Microsoft held its 2019 press conference and expo in collaboration with E3 but in a separate venue</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yet Matthews has a different perspective on the E3 exodus. Microsoft was still eager to support E3. Indeed, tickets to the E3 show floor also got you into Microsoft's event, too. Companies wanted different things from the show, and agreement was hard to come by, but ultimately they were all – PlayStation aside – still doing events during that same period.</p>
<p>"It was an example of the industry's commitment to E3, and commitment to that period in time to still come together as an industry," Matthews says.</p>
<p>"We didn't need to do [our event] that week. We could have done it in the Microsoft Theater at any time during the year. But we committed to doing it. Yeah, we were going to do it a little differently. It was evolution, but a commitment to showing up together and doing something bigger than ourselves."</p>
<h2 id="section-7">The death of E3</h2>
<p>By 2019, E3 was in trouble. The ESA parted company with Dolaher that year to take the event in-house, but then the pandemic hit. E3 2020 was cancelled. There was a 2021 digital event, but it proved costly and it wasn't repeated in 2022.</p>
<p>"COVID was the big proof point," Layden says. "COVID shut down E3 and the video games industry grew revenue. It didn't have the biggest video game show, but it still got bigger as a business. Ask any CFO at any big games company if they want to drop $10 – $15 million that they've not had to spend for three years on E3… and they'll say 'Are you crazy? Look at all that money we saved, and we still grew'."</p>
<blockquote><p>"The industry is in a far better place now because of E3."</p><cite>Peter Moore, former Sega, Xbox and EA exec</cite></blockquote>
<p>The ESA decided a new direction was needed, and turned to ReedPop – organisers of New York Comic-Con and the PAX video game shows (and, at the time, owners of <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>) – to help find it. It was going to be a tight turnaround. By the time ReedPop was brought in, there was less than a year to build a team, speak to the industry and put together a show.</p>
<p>"When Reedpop got involved the whole attitude was not just how do we bring it back, but also how do we evolve it to what's needed," says Guy Blomberg, who was brought in to work on the event. "That was exciting to almost everyone I spoke to."</p>
<p>However, the team encountered an industry divided. "Some wanted a pure consumer show, others just wanted B2B," Blomberg says. "Some only cared about digital, others on the fan experience. Some folks only wanted a repeat of what was before, others wanted to blow it all up and start over.  Everyone wanted something different, it was incredibly difficult to navigate, and there was an equal amount of passion and anger toward the brand – it was honestly exhausting."</p>
<p>ReedPop developed a new format, but not everyone was convinced, and some of those who were interested simply didn't have the line-up to justify an E3 booth. In the end, the 2023 event never happened and ReedPop parted ways with the ESA.</p>
<p>Six months later, E3 was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>The industry reaction online was one of sadness. Winkler described working on E3 as "a dream come true", and for many, simply going to the show was aspirational.</p>
<p>"What kills me… we did a lot of work with Make-A-Wish kids, and we would fly them in, we once had up to 30," Dolaher says. "And we would get them chaperones in the booths, and Microsoft would give them a brand new console… Parents still write to me and say thank you, and it's just soul crushing. It's all those kids wanted. There was no other show like it."</p>
<p>Matthews opines: "E3 was special. You never knew what was going to happen. There was always something that came out of nowhere, and that made it fun and interesting and nerve-wracking. That is the part I am sad about the most, because it is more traditional now. It's like every other industry. We all get our news out the same way. E3 was uniquely video games."</p>
<p>For Layden, he believes there is still a need for something in the old E3 window. But it would need to be for fans, and not take place in Downtown LA.</p>
<p>"I have had outreaches to me from larger concerns to try and figure out what it would take to resuscitate E3," Layden reveals.</p>
<p>"If you could make it a full-on consumer event… And Downtown LA is a terrible place for the show. There's not enough affordable hotels. The venue needs to move, but still needs to stay in California somewhere.</p>
<p>"Gamescom in Europe, Tokyo Games Show in Asia… we have PAX East and West in the US, but they're still minor league shows. You could do a full-on consumer show if you have the right leadership and the right amount of money to do it."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>A major consumer version of E3 in June could work, Layden believes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Indeed, Winkler points to the fact that there are still things happening during the old 'E3 week' as proof that there's still a demand for a physical event in LA. This week, Xbox, Ubisoft and IGN are holding physical events, while Summer Games Fest's Play Days event features titles from EA, PlayStation, Netflix, Amazon, Tencent, Bandai Namco, Capcom and numerous other major companies. It isn't E3. It isn't the big noisy show that echoed around the world. But it is something.</p>
<p>"Most publishers are going to be at Summer Games Fest in one shape or form," Winker observes. "So although they might not be spending the big cash, they still see the value in these in-person face-to-face moments where they can interact with peers and the community. As an events guy… that gives me hope."</p>
<p>Whatever happens next, it's worth considering E3's legacy and what it achieved.</p>
<p>To return to where we started, it was about respect. In 1995, the games industry was being ignored by the media, treated with disdain by politicians and dismissed by Hollywood. Now, video games is the biggest entertainment medium on earth, politicians are supporting it with tax breaks, mainstream publications cover games regularly and Hollywood is awash with games IP. 30 years ago, Sega was practically thrown out of the office of the Motion Pictures Association, whereas today Sonic is a blockbuster movie franchise.</p>
<p>In 1995, the games industry was desperate for attention and respect. In 2024, it now has it, and E3 was part of how that was achieved.</p>
<p>"E3 certainly served its purpose in terms of relevancy and respect," Moore concludes. "There was a time when we were just being ripped for being a waste of time, all the social ills were being blamed on gaming, and it was seen as triviality and a phase that primarily young boys went through until they got serious about life. That's not the case anymore.</p>
<p>"The industry is in a far better place now because of E3."</p>

Luckily, no matter how you play him, Sethos can be built the same way. Here are the best weapons and artifacts for Sethos!</p> <h2 id="h-sethos-best-weapons-in-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">Sethos’ best weapons in Genshin Impact</h2> <h3 id="h-hunter-s-path-best-5-star-weapon-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Hunter’s Path: best 5-star weapon for Sethos</h3> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Sethos’ best weapon is the 5-star Hunter’s Path. Despite being Tighnari’s signature Bow, Hunter’s Path has a great passive for Sethos, increasing his Charged Attack damage based on his Elemental Mastery. If you happen to have Hunter’s Path in your inventory, Sethos makes for a great user. I wouldn’t recommend pulling Hunter’s Path specifically for Sethos, though.</p> <h3 id="h-slingshot-most-accessible-weapon-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Slingshot: most accessible weapon for Sethos</h3> <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="772" data-injectable="true">Oddly enough, the 3-star Slingshot is one of Sethos’ best weapons. It has a low base ATK, but it provides a good amount of CRIT Rate as well as a DMG buff to Normal and Charged Attacks. As long as you’re not too far from your enemy, Slingshot is able to buff Sethos by a significant amount. Slingshot is easily obtained through wishes, and you should aim for Refinement Rank 5 if possible.</p>
 <h3 id="h-cloudforged-decent-4-star-weapon-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Cloudforged: decent 4-star weapon for Sethos</h3> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">If you don’t have an R5 Slingshot in your inventory, you can opt for Cloudforged instead. Its passive works for Sethos whether he’s using his Normal Attacks or Charged Attacks. Still, I recommend using Slingshot if possible. </p> <p data-characters="178" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Despite being featured in promotional material, Scion of the Blazing Sun is not worth buying for Sethos, especially since it requires spending real-life money on the Battle Pass.</p>

It provides both Elemental Mastery and an unconditional Charged Attack buff. Wanderer’s Troupe artifacts can be farmed using artifact strongboxes, though you can get additional pieces while defeating world bosses.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4pc-gilded-dreams" data-injectable="false">4pc Gilded Dreams</h3> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">4pc Gilded Dreams provides Sethos with a large amount of Elemental Mastery depending on his teammates’ elements. Gilded Dreams artifacts are easier to farm than Wanderer’s Troupe, but Wanderer’s Troupe provides more consistent buffs. Still, the two are similar enough where you can use whichever you feel more comfortable with.</p> <h2 id="h-artifact-stats-to-prioritize-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Artifact stats to prioritize for Sethos</h2> <figure data-found-rows="2" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sands</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Goblet</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Circlet</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Elemental Mastery</td><td data-align="center">Electro DMG</td><td data-align="center">CRIT Rate/DMG</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Sethos should have about 120% Energy Recharge for comfortable rotations. Just make sure he triggers a reaction with his Skill, which shouldn’t be an issue as long as you have other elements in your team. If paired with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a>, Sethos can forgo building Energy Recharge entirely.</p> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="false">Prioritize Sethos’ offensive stats, which are primarily <strong>CRIT</strong> and <strong>Elemental Mastery.</strong> ATK doesn’t hurt either, but most of Sethos’ damage scaling comes from Elemental Mastery rather than ATK.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-and-friends-will-join-super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-as-dlc.890229/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that upcoming spherical platformer&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>will be getting DLC themed around everyone's favorite blue spiny critter Sonic the Hedgehog, as well as three of his buddies.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, Sega reveals that Sonic, as well as Tails, Amy, and Knuckles, will be available to purchase as separate DLC for&nbsp;<em>Banana Rumble</em>, and they'll also be included in the game's Sega Pass.</p>

<p>It's pretty fitting that Sonic and his friends will be making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>given the game's adoption of the Spin Dash move; I guess Sonic might have considered suing AiAi and company if he hadn't been handed this opportunity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc-characters.jpg?itok=Hf14_j-T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc-characters.jpg?itok=wZXyqJC7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Four&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>characters will join&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>as DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the four&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>characters outlined above, the Sega Pass for&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>will also net you access to two more "Sega all-stars", and they've all got their own unique stats as well.</p>

<p>You'll also get some new customization items to trick out your monkeys, although we're not sure what those customization items might be yet. Hopefully, they include a nightmarish&nbsp;Sonic wig of some description.</p>

<p><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball&nbsp;</em>series, which I suppose is best described as a platforming franchise, although it's complicated. Amusingly enough, it's being developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, best-known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-has-sold-1-million-copies-fastest-selling-game-in-series">the&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>series</a>.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the games, they're essentially&nbsp;<em>Marble Madness</em>-style romps in which you must guide a monkey in a ball around a series of increasingly treacherous courses.</p>

<p>The difficulty can, in my experience, get pretty controller-breakingly frustrating, although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-monkey-ball-banana-blitz-hd-review">not every game subscribes to that philosophy</a>.</p>




<p><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is set to launch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-switch/">exclusively for Nintendo Switch</a> on June 25th. No other platforms have been announced for the game yet.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>-themed portion of the Sega Pass arrives sometime this year, so look out for it if you're a fan of the Blue Blur.</p>

And while the “serious gamer” might be enticed by the pending arrival of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23433741/the-case-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc"><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></a><em> </em>or <em>Don’t Starve Together</em> — games that have enjoyed success on other platforms — it’s interactive fiction games that are the most exciting both for Netflix and its gaming community.</p><p>“Expanding the worlds of beloved Netflix series and films is our greatest opportunity in games,” <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-reality-universe-expands-with-new-games">wrote Leanne Loombe</a>, head of external games at Netflix, in a recent blog post.</p><p>Everybody’s getting into gaming right now. <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, LinkedIn, YouTube, and now possibly even Uber are offering games as a part of their services in order to drive subscriptions and user engagement. For some, <a href="https://digiday.com/media/the-next-level-for-us-the-new-york-times-eyes-longer-play-sessions-for-games-in-subscription-drive/">it’s working</a>. For others, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378713/google-stadia-shutting-down-game-streaming-january-2023">not</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/13/23959224/amazon-gaming-layoffs-crown-content-channel">so</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23328568/facebook-gaming-mobile-app-shutting-down-october-2022">much</a>. A lot of these gaming initiatives feel like they’re just being tacked on to whatever service, like how your favorite Chinese takeout restaurant also has fries and chicken wings. Even though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152045/linkedin-games-crossclimb-queens-pinpoint">LinkedIn’s new games are entertaining</a>, it’s hard to imagine folks spending more time on the site where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/business/ceo-crying-linkedin-layoffs.html#:~:text=When%20he%20started%20bawling%2C%20moments,a%20teary%20selfie%20for%20LinkedIn.&amp;text=Braden%20Wallake%2C%20the%20chief%20executive,after%20laying%20off%20two%20employees.">CEOs announce layoffs like YouTube apology videos</a> just to play them.</p><p>But Netflix is unique in that, even though it’s not a gaming company, its products do lend themselves to a specific kind of highly popular but underserved gaming experience. “We’ve seen a lot of success with interactive fiction games like <em>Selling Sunset</em>, <em>Perfect Match</em>, and <em>The Ultimatum</em>,” Loombe said in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Reality television shows are still one of the most popular kinds of entertainment. They’re relatively cheap to produce and are uniquely positioned to create the kinds of high-drama moments that go viral on social media. And with popular shows, its audience is naturally incentivized to seek out related content. After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video">the wild success of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> TV show</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131018/fallout-games-steam-player-count-bethesda-tv-show">the games exploded in popularity</a>, appearing on bestseller lists and at the top of Steam player charts.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix’s gaming offerings are poised to take advantage of that same phenomenon. Because where a <em>Fallout</em> fan has to go outside Amazon to play the games (or, as Amazon vainly hopes, use its cloud gaming service Luna) Netflix’s games channel the enthusiasm of a show’s community right back into the app, creating what Loombe calls a seamless “connective tissue between the TV show and the game.” In this new economy of attention, where companies are competing to have as many eyeballs on their apps or services as possible, that Netflix fans don’t have to leave the app to continue their fandom experiences is potentially a huge advantage.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>MCU, meet the NRU — the Netflix Reality Universe.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Netflix</cite></p></div><p>Another advantage is the games themselves. Adapting games can be tough, with the results often failing to engage an audience with the same level of success as its original. <em>Uncharted</em> was a critically acclaimed adventure game series; the movie — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/17/22937238/uncharted-movie-review">less so</a>. That quality gap is closing with shows like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23543145/hbo-the-last-of-us-review"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>. And Netflix is strategic in how it picks which of its shows to adapt into a game to ensure an experience that faithfully recreates the essence of the show.</p><p>“Unscripted reality shows are really great because it has that fantasy element,” Loombe said. “Players are able to pretend to be one of those characters and play that fantasy out like a choose your own adventure and a romance novel combined.” </p><p>It’s a fantasy players take with them and share elsewhere. <em>Too Hot to Handle</em>, for instance,  has a dedicated community on Reddit with traditions like “Main Character Monday” in which players post pictures of their in-game avatars.&nbsp;“We have a really deep customization system in <em>Too Hot To Handle</em>,” Loombe explained. “So you can choose, from a variety of different items, to prosthetics, to different hairstyles, different hair colors, and body types. It really is quite deep.”</p><p>Netflix’s gaming library <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices">started with titles like<em> Shooting Hoops</em>, <em>Teeter (Up)</em>, and <em>Card Blast</em></a>. Three years later, it’s grown into one that includes big-name commercial powerhouses and indie-developed critical darlings. We only know what Netflix shares about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048412/gta-is-netflixs-biggest-gaming-launch-so-far">exactly how popular its games are</a>, and as a proportion of its overall user base, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-less-than-1-of-netflixs-total-subscribers-play-games-daily#:~:text=As%20reported%20by%20CBNC%2C%20this,downloaded%2070.5%20million%20times%20worldwide.">Netflix’s gaming audience is quite small</a>. And while Netflix’s interactive fiction games don’t generate the same kind of attention the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> trilogy or <em>Hades</em> might, they are quietly one of the platform’s biggest success stories.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
