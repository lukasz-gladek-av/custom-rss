  <p id="yugZzI">How’s that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a><em> </em>episode sitting with us all, huh? Things ended on a tense note there, and set up what should be a pretty compelling (if tragic) war. </p>
<p id="2BGC5y">Still, it’s not the only new TV in town, let alone the only thing to watch on Sundays this summer. This week sees the premiere of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24007774/best-new-tv-2024-release-calendar-schedule-shows-series"><em>Orphan Black: Echoes</em></a>, the spinoff of <em>Orphan Black</em>. This one won’t be bringing Tatiana Maslany back (yet) to play, well, any of the characters she played on the original show. But it does introduce Krysten Ritter as the woman at the center of a web of conspiracy and (one could <em>imagine</em>) cloning. </p>
<p id="MuqnVG">Here’s all the big TV premieres and finales this week.</p>


<hr id="IF1ehv">
<h2 id="fs6TI9"><strong>New shows on Netflix</strong></h2>

<p id="IlizaR">Six “agents of mystery” (popular Korean comedians, singers, and more) are tasked with solving a paranormal mystery within six hours. Like with most reality shows, they’ll have to think quickly and work together; also like with most reality shows, they’ll get into some hijinks as they try to riddle their way through. </p>
<h2 id="g2nDJp"><strong>New shows on Hulu</strong></h2>
<h3 id="w9cXJg"><strong>Shoresy</strong></h3>

<p id="0l3i3N">The <em>Letterkenny </em>spinoff returns, with Shoresy (Jared Keeso) and the Sudbury Blueberry Bulldogs bringing their A game to the National Senior Tournament. They’ll be facing off with teams from across Canada (so it’s an actual fierce competition, eh?). </p>

<p id="EkJy38">Lucy (Krysten Ritter) is just a regular woman trying to live her life — at least, she thinks she is. Then she gets attacked, and sets out to figure out exactly what’s so important from the memories she’s missing. Ultimately that journey leads her... to herself? As in, her younger self, walking around the present day, in a way Lucy can’t explain to either of them. </p>

To host a stream you need something interesting to stream about—in my demo that came in the form of many different haunted dolls. Once you begin the stream, your viewers will shuffle in and comment on whatever you have going on. The roguelike nature begins to show itself in these streams, as your character has a stat list that will be challenged. To win over my crowd, I decided it would be a good idea to do a silly voice for the haunted doll, hoping my audience would find me utterly hilarious. I failed a performance check and they all laughed <em>at</em> me instead of <em>with</em> me. Viewers started leaving. But after each skill check you are offered a choice: end the stream or keep going. </p><figure id="" data-id="d6a92de52fb83316f5498f9b62a227f4" data-recommend-id="image://d6a92de52fb83316f5498f9b62a227f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blog page shows the player and their about me section" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blog page shows the player and their about me section" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->We Have Always Lived In The Forest</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6a92de52fb83316f5498f9b62a227f4" data-recommend-id="image://d6a92de52fb83316f5498f9b62a227f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blog page shows the player and their about me section" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At first the answer seems pretty obvious: just keep streaming as that’s the best way to gain new subscribers who might then donate money. But then the horror parts of <em>darkwebSTREAMER</em> show up. When I kept going, I encountered things like clawing at my door, my viewers becoming getting freaked out in chat and saying they saw a phantom, and receiving an envelope filled with mysterious worm-like creatures.<br></p><p>These encounters involve more skill checks, and beyond losing subscribers, failing them can lessen your health or your sanity. The immediate comparison I made was to TTRPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/09/call-of-cthulhuwas-the-first-role-playing-game-to-drive-people-insane/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/09/call-of-cthulhuwas-the-first-role-playing-game-to-drive-people-insane/"><em>Call of Cthulhu</em></a></span>, and in many ways, <em>darkwebSTREAMER</em>’s combination of stats and responsive narrative feel inspired by tabletop games. Eventually, if you push yourself far enough, you will exhaust yourself and must end the stream. But that’s not the end of the gameplay loop. <em>DarkwebSTREAMER</em> takes place in a simulated web browser, and once a stream is over you can surf the web to find new sites, some offering items to buy that you can use for your streams. Most of these sites feature unsettling writing, and rather shockingly, beyond essential storefront sites, these are all procedurally generated by putting together building blocks of text and art created by developer Chantal Ryan, who pored over old internet sites like Geocities to get the tone just right. And she succeeded, as those sites capture the vibe of the ‘<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/videoverse-game-review-online-gaming-forums-vn-kinmoku-1850780173&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/videoverse-game-review-online-gaming-forums-vn-kinmoku-1850780173">90s internet</a></span> so well that I found myself going over every word and illustration in case it was a hint I needed. It speaks to how well the game’s world is realized through a simple monochromatic interface and well-written text. </p><p>It may look like just a computer screen, but the world beyond it is tangible. When you shut down the game’s computer to rest for the night, the horror creeps even closer. Every time I tried to sleep something would wake me up. Once time it was just a kitten in the hallway, but on another occasion I sensed a presence in the kitchen threatening my sanity.</p><figure id="" data-id="68f1adace1ef1e735de6155f9cacf3ad" data-recommend-id="image://68f1adace1ef1e735de6155f9cacf3ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spooky blog page shows two people with sheets over their heads kissing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A spooky blog page shows two people with sheets over their heads kissing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->We Have Always Lived In The Forest</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68f1adace1ef1e735de6155f9cacf3ad" data-recommend-id="image://68f1adace1ef1e735de6155f9cacf3ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spooky blog page shows two people with sheets over their heads kissing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Whether you choose to avoid or investigate these threats that don’t live within the game’s computer screen, it feels like feels like a threshold is being transgressed. This, along with the rest of the game’s horror, feeds on our inherent fear of what goes bump in the night. Even while playing it in a secluded room in the middle of the day, I found myself getting goosebumps and fighting the urge to check behind me.<br></p><p>The streaming system itself feeds into the game’s unsettling vibe, as it encourages you to put yourself in bad situations. While everyone always says they wouldn’t act like a stupid horror movie character if they were in the same situation, <em>darkwebSTREAMER</em> proves the contrary. Because of my morbid fascination with the game’s horror, I continued to stream because I simply needed to satisfy my curiosity. It often led to my death, but watching the in-game chat become equally intrigued with what could happen to me—and often subscribing and donating to encourage and support my reckless behavior—made me think it was all worth it. It’s a not-so-subtle  commentary on our morbid fascination with seeing others put themselves in harm’s way, and on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/only-up-dunk-tank-twitch-livestream-keatdawg-1850633749&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/only-up-dunk-tank-twitch-livestream-keatdawg-1850633749">voyeuristic nature of streaming</a></span>. And in <em>darkwebSTREAMER</em>, it also happens to be incredibly fun.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/habbo-hotel-origins-2005-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>I remember playing Habbo Hotel when I was young on the family PC, attempting to get a job in a prestigious room somewhere bursting at the seams with ‘furni’. If I recall, I was some kind of a greeter, spamming the same message over and over again when new people entered the room. I also remember talking to a group of strangers about Kiss in a rock-themed room somewhere. It could have been a fever dream or something, I don’t know. Habbo was weird.</p>



<p>Sulake has just revealed that <strong>from tomorrow</strong>, Habbo Hotel Origins will be available to play, taking gamers back to 2005 – and simpler times – as an ‘old version’ of the game is unlocked for all. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-blast-from-the-past">Blast from the Past</h2>



<p>In a post on the Habbo website, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After discovering an old decrepit server with some long-lost files at the beginning of this year, over the past six months or so long-time Habbo developer and player&nbsp;Macklebee&nbsp;has lovingly restored an old version of Habbo Hotel first released in 2005.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On <a href="https://www.habbo.com/community/article/34151/launching-tomorrow-habbo-hotel-origins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Habbo website</a> (from June 18), players will be able to boot the ‘original’ client of the game. It has been stressed that it’s an 18-rated game and features less stringent auto-moderation features than Habbo, which is the core game that’s still going strong today. Back in the day, Habbo Hotel was a strange enough place, but having little in the way of moderation features on this classic reimagination could be a recipe for disaster. Those pool takeovers will happen once again in true Habbo fashion.</p>



<p>Habbo Hotel Origins will be free to play and has been built to accommodate three different languages: English, Spanish, and Portuguese. </p>



<p>Are you going to leap back to 2005 with Origins?</p>

<p>Wonder Woman is currently in development at Monolith, and now it seems that the game has suffered an apparent leak due to a survey from Warner Bros. itself. </p>



<p>The information <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/online-marketing-survey-shows-wonder-woman-story-details-and-concept-art.902721/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">started appearing online</a> over the weekend and it shows off concept art from the game as well as a lengthy synopsis of the game. Concept art that has been posted on social media has been quickly removed due to copyright claims, seemingly confirming the legitimacy of the information.</p>



<p>While we won’t share the full details of the game’s story in this article, the documents suggest that the game will be available only on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It also reconfirmed that the Nemesis System from Monolith’s Middle-earth titles will return for Wonder Woman as well.</p>



<p>As far as other features of the game, Shpeshal Nick <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-latest-claims-about-monoliths-wonder-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has claimed that the game</a> will feature the invisible jet as a method for fast travel. He also said that the game’s moving feels <strong>“like a good version of Crackdown.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out the Monolith and Warner Bros. Games for comment on the leaks, and the timing of the survey they supposedly came from. All requests for comment have been declined.</p>



<p>Wonder Woman was first announced back at The Game Awards 2021. Since then, however, information has been few and far between. One thing that was confirmed, though, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wonder-woman-not-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that it will not be a live service game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/its-a-big-week-for-mmorpgs-as-pax-dei-tarisland-and-everquest-2-classic-all-debut/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=its-a-big-week-for-mmorpgs-as-pax-dei-tarisland-and-everquest-2-classic-all-debut<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="643" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If someone’s trying to convince you that the MMORPG genre is dead, don’t believe it! Sure, it may not be as lively as the years following the massive success of <em>World of Warcraft</em>—you know, when we saw <em>Lord of the Rings Online, Age of Conan, Warhammer Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, </em>and <em>Star Trek Online</em> all released within a few years of each other—but it’s still a good time to be an MMORPG fan and this week proves it. In a four-day window, we will see the release of two brand-new MMORPGs as well as the relaunch of a classic version of a popular MMORPG. Let’s take a look at what’s coming this week.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mainframe Industries</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-pax-dei-early-access-launch-june-18" data-injectable="false"><em>Pax Dei</em> Early Access Launch – June 18</h2> <p data-characters="552" data-current-count="852" data-injectable="true">It all kicks off on June 18 with the Early Access launch of the highly anticipated sandbox MMORPG <em>Pax Dei</em>. I had <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pax-dei-feels-like-a-true-medieval-life-sim-as-a-sandbox-mmo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a hands-on experience with <em>Pax Dei</em> in November 2023</a> and was blown away by developer Mainframe Industries ability to create a massive world that felt like the players truly molded it how they wanted. In a nutshell, if you’ve ever played an MMORPG and thought, “It would be cool to just be a blacksmith all day and actually be able to progress and be useful in an MMORPG”, <em>Pax Dei</em> gives you the opportunity to do just that.</p>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">Even though it’s launching into Early Access, the core meat and potatoes of <em>Pax Dei</em> are there. The 116 mi² map tasks players with finding their own slice of life to settle down and build a homestead, eventually building up to an entire village or fortress. In a purely player-driven economy, it’s up to the inhabitants of <em>Pax Dei</em> to work together or fight over resources as they build and tech up.</p>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">Mainframe Industries expects the Early Access period to last at least a year as they enhance and evolve the MMORPG based on player feedback.</p> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="193" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1995520/Pax_Dei/"><em>Pax Dei</em> launches in Early Access on Steam on June 18</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Darkpaw Games</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-everquest-2-origins-classic-server-anasthi-sul-june-19" data-injectable="false"><em>EverQuest 2</em> Origins (Classic) Server Anasthi Sul – June 19</h2> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">The very popular MMORPG <em>EverQuest</em> had a sequel release in November of 2004, though many people didn’t get the opportunity to play it then. Why? Well, just two weeks after its release, an MMORPG you may have heard of called <em>World of Warcraft</em> took the genre by storm. <em>EverQuest 2</em> is still supported today, with the <em>Ballands of Zimara </em>expansion dropping last year, and a new expansion codenamed <em>EverQuest 21</em> (indicating the 21st expansion) is set to launch in November of this year.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Back in April the new owner of <em>EverQuest</em>, Darkpaw Games, announced that a classic “origins” server for <em>EverQuest 2</em> was in the works. While the game has evolved over the years, especially to be more solo-friendly, many miss the times when MMORPG’s had a bit more of the MMO part, primarily due to mechanics being built around socializing and working with other players.</p> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">This unique server aims to bring the social back to <em>EverQuest 2</em>. The server will launch with just the base vanilla <em>EverQuest 2</em> experience, with a focus on group play. Mechanics that have become trivial over the years like relying on other players to craft gear, putting together parties to tackle dungeons, and leveling groups, will be front and center with this server.</p>
 <p data-characters="73" data-current-count="73" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.everquest2.com/news/eq2-origins-server-beta-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The <em>EverQuest 2 </em>Origins server, Anasthi Sul, is set to launch on June 19</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Level Infinite</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-tarisland-global-launch-june-21" data-injectable="false"><em>Tarisland</em> Global Launch – June 21</h2> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">At the beginning of 2023, the popular MMORPG <em>World of Warcraft</em> went offline in China due to a dispute between Blizzard and the game’s Chinese distributor NetEase. This was a big deal as <em>World of Warcraft</em> has a massive player base in China, and all of a sudden millions of players suddenly couldn’t access their account overnight.</p>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">In the midst of all the madness, Level Infinite and Tencent saw an opportunity to fill the void and announced <em>Tarisland</em>, an MMORPG with a plethora of race and class combinations where players would work together to explore, craft, and take down massive bosses in raid encounters. <em>Tarisland</em> has been developed to allow cross-platform play between PC, Android, and iOS devices all at once.</p> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">In April 2024, Blizzard and NetEase resolved their differences and came to an agreement which brought <em>World of Warcraft</em> back to China. <em>Tarisland</em> is still hoping to provide an enticing experience in a F2P format that uses the standard <em>WoW</em>-like MMORPG formula.</p>
 <p data-characters="63" data-current-count="63" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://tarisglobal.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tarisland</em> launches globally on PC, Android, and iOS on June 21</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180277/microsoft-xbox-marketing-jerret-west-leaving-roblox<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Microsoft is losing another key Xbox executive at the end of the month. Xbox chief marketing officer Jerret West is leaving Microsoft to join Roblox as its new CMO and head of market expansion. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer confirmed the move in an internal memo to Xbox employees today, which was obtained by <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>West previously spent eight years at Microsoft on the Xbox marketing side, before departing in 2011 and then eventually spending seven years at Netflix as the head of marketing. West returned to Microsoft in late 2019, leading the marketing for the launch of the Xbox Series S / X consoles.</p><p>West’s team is responsible for developing marketing plans for games, hardware, and Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft is now shuffling around some of its marketing teams in the wake of West’s departure, and there will be a new expanded central gaming marketing team under Kirsten Ward, VP of Xbox integrated marketing.</p><p>Spencer says the Microsoft Gaming leadership team has “decided to place marketing closer to the businesses they support” as a result of West’s departure. Games marketing will now sit inside the game content and studios division that’s led by Matt Booty. Xbox marketing, led by Chris Lee, will move to the Xbox org and report up to Xbox president Sarah Bond.</p><p>This is the second key Xbox executive resignation this year, after former head of Xbox emerging tech, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122208/microsoft-xbox-kareem-choudhry-leaving-xbox-cloud-gaming">Kareem Choudhry, left Microsoft</a> in early April. Choudhry’s departure triggered a similar shake-up, with his former team moving to the Xbox hardware side. A new Xbox experiences and platforms team was created after Choudhry departed, with a push to improve the Xbox experience across Windows and Xbox consoles.</p><p>This latest marketing shake-up also comes around eight months after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933447/microsoft-gaming-xbox-phil-spencer-leadership-changes-memo">a big shake-up of Xbox leadership</a>&nbsp;and amid continued changes to Microsoft’s gaming strategy. Microsoft promoted Bond to Xbox president in October, leading all Xbox platform and hardware work. Booty also got promoted to the president of game content and studios, including overseeing Bethesda and ZeniMax studios.</p><div><div><h2>Notepad by Tom Warren<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>A weekly newsletter uncovering the secrets and strategy behind Microsoft’s era-defining bets on AI, gaming, and computing.</p></div><p><a href="http://theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter">Subscribe</a></p></div><div><blockquote><p>I have some news to share with all of you: Jerret West, who has served as the Chief Marketing Officer of Xbox for four and a half years, will be leaving Microsoft to join Roblox as their new CMO and Head of Market Expansion. His last day will be June 30th.</p><p>On behalf of Team Xbox, I’d like to thank Jerret for everything he accomplished. During his time here, Jerret was instrumental in launching and growing communities like our Xbox social universe to 120M followers strong, and product expansion like Game Pass which is now available in more than 80 countries worldwide. He oversaw the creation and delivery of global marketing campaigns for numerous games, platforms (console, PC, cloud) and brand moments such as this year’s momentous Xbox Games Showcase. Roblox is an important partner for Xbox, and we look forward to working with Jerret and the Roblox team to connect more people around the world through the power of play.</p><p>As a team we are committed to growing the strong marketing capability in Gaming. Going forward, the Gaming Leadership Team and I have decided to place marketing closer to the businesses they support. Games marketing will sit inside of Studios, Xbox marketing will sit inside the Xbox team, international marketing will sit inside of the Consumer Sales Org, and our centralized marketing team will report to me. The following organizational changes will be effective on July 1st:</p><p>The Integrated Marketing team led by Kirsten Ward and the Programming and Events team led by Tina Summerford will come together as an expanded Central Gaming Marketing team under Kirsten, who will report to me as a member of the Gaming Executive Leadership Team. Chief of staff Pav Bhardwaj and executive assistant Kim Nold will report to Kirsten.</p><p>The Bethesda Publishing Marketing team, led by Erin Losi, will move to Game Content and Studios, reporting to Matt Booty.</p><p>The 1P Games Marketing Team including Xbox Game Studios and Mojang, led by Aaron Greenberg, will also move to Game Content and Studios, reporting to Matt.</p><p>The Xbox Marketing team, led by Chris Lee, will move to the Xbox Org, reporting to Sarah Bond.</p><p>The International Marketing team, led by Jim McMullin and Florian Liewer, will move to the Consumer Sales Org, reporting to Ami Silverman.</p><p>The Bethesda International Marketing team, led by Adam Carter, will also move to the Consumer Sales Org. Adam will be taking on a new role leading Business Operations at Bethesda, reporting to Jill Braff. The Consumer Sales Org will work on backfilling his role and share more at a later date.</p><p>We’re fortunate to have a deep bench of talent and experience, and I’m excited to see how our marketing will evolve under their leadership.</p><p>Phil</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-tips-guide">Starfield</a>’s first expansion, this year’s Shattered Space, won’t be the only major DLC for the sci-fi exploration game, Bethesda bossman Todd Howard has confirmed.</p>

<p>Discussing Starfield with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ew8LQFGNWU">YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>, Howard revealed that Shattered Space started “actual” development after the team wrapped up work on Starfield’s base game, meaning it’s been in the works since August-September time last year.</p>
<p>Howard also compared the scope and focus of the expansion - which largely takes place in one city on a single planet - to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>’s Far Harbor DLC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-elder-scrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a>.</p>
<p>“It allows us to build a landscape like we would traditionally do and have the city and the quest and so [on],” Howard said. “It lets us kind of do some things the way we would in previous games and give people- not completely that experience, because it's still Starfield - [but] this new kind of alien world that you're able to explore.”</p>
<p>Howard referred to Shattered Space as being in the vein of Bethesda’s other “annual story expansions”, adding that the developers hope to release additional content for Starfield for “a very long time". That means we’ll see at least one more big expansion, with Howard saying that the team “more or less” plan to put out annual DLC in a similar way to their previous games.</p>
<p>“We're planning for the one after [Shattered Space], so there will be another one,” Howard then confirmed.</p>

<p>He later added that DLC wouldn’t “answer every question” about Starfield’s universe, but would instead be approached with the perspective of “What do we want to add to the game as far as an experience or a tone or those kinds of things?”</p>
<p>Shattered Space, at least, will delve into the secretive world of House Va'Ruun and its city of Dazra, with mention of some kind of cosmic threat. There’ll be new gear and other goodies too, natch. We’ll find out more when it releases later this year, having had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfields-shattered-space-expansion-looks-to-amp-up-the-horror-later-this-year">a first proper peek during Summer Game Fest</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/honkai-star-rail-guides/24180139/version-2-3-release-maintenance-times</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-time-does-honkai-star-rail-version-2-3-release.903633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/honkai-star-rail-guides/24180139/version-2-3-release-maintenance-times<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="fIpcwd"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/honkai-star-rail-guides"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>’s new 2.3 patch is coming soon, bringing new characters and story with it. We’ll see new five-star characters Firefly and Jade, alongside Ruan Mei and Argenti, who will be rerunning during the patch. Version 2.3 also features new story, new relics, and new events to grind out for the next six weeks.</p>
<p id="e3CnpT">Below, we explain when <em><strong>Honkai: Star Rail </strong></em><strong>maintenance </strong>starts and ends, alongside the <strong>release time</strong> of version 2.3. We’ve also added some details about what to expect from <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> patch 2.3.</p>
<hr id="iEzQbJ">
<h2 id="T4eTkV"><strong>What time does Honkai: Star Rail go down for maintenance?</strong></h2>
<p id="lNoIYf"><em>Honkai: Star Rail </em>will go down for maintenance on <strong>June 18 or 19</strong> (depending on your time zone) at the following times and will be unavailable for approximately five hours:</p>
<ul>
<li id="hRirtL">
<strong>June 18 at 3 p.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="Prdg5A">
<strong>June 18 at 6 p.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="ifpyl6">
<strong>June 18 at 11 p.m. BST</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="XaeSfj">
<strong>June 19 at 12 a.m. CEST</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="TI0AFn">
<strong>June 19 at 7 a.m. JST</strong> for Japan/Tokyo</li>
<li id="GliPUK">
<strong>June 19 at 8 a.m. AEST</strong> for Australia/Sydney</li>
</ul>
<p id="IAdoB6">Make sure to burn your fuel before maintenance starts, if you wanted to.</p>
<hr id="bvHqwW">

<p id="4nhhcQ"><em>Honkai: Star Rail </em>should come back from maintenance with version 2.3 at the following times:</p>
<ul>
<li id="k7RBy1">
<strong>June 18 at 8 p.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="4FGns2">
<strong>June 18 at 11 p.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="fFEk3q">
<strong>June 19 at 4 a.m. BST</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="Qvthe3">
<strong>June 19 at 5 a.m. CEST</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="c5tLfo">
<strong>June 19 at 12 p.m. JST</strong> for Japan/Tokyo</li>
<li id="fRHGT4">
<strong>June 19 at 1 p.m. AEST</strong> for Australia/Sydney</li>
</ul>
<p id="2qpeJn">The servers may come up early or late, depending on how maintenance goes, but these are the approximate times <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> should go live. Usually Hoyoverse is pretty good by abiding by maintenance times. We don’t usually get extended maintenance, but it does end early sometimes!</p>
<hr id="47ziSN">
<h2 id="9dmzLd"><strong>What’s new in Honkai: Star Rail version 2.3?</strong></h2>
<p id="E9N9hO">In version 2.3, we’re saying goodbye to Penacony, as the story wraps up there. (There’s no doubt that we’ll end up returning for another story arc or event down the line, similarly to how we do frequently to the Xianzhou Luofu, though.) We’ll be seeing Firefly and Jade, but this will also help put a bow on Sparkle’s story, who never really got a proper conclusion in the last patch.</p>
<div id="VBI1PT"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UeYjxEqSbgw?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="QVz6DH"><em>Honkai: Star Rail </em>version 2.3 also includes a new version of Simulated Universe, called Divergent Universe that will permanently be added to the game. Alongside this, a new free five-star Erudition light cone will be added to Herta’s shop. This new version will let you get Planar Ornaments faster by skipping straight to the boss and netting your relics, rather than fighting through a bunch of levels first. </p>
<p id="nV83dS">There’s also going to be a new endgame game mode called Apocalyptic Shadow that’ll allow you to earn Jade Feathers and other good loot, as well as new relic sets to equip to characters.</p>
<p id="8BC9YM">Of course, there’ll be a handful of events scattered throughout the six-week patch, including one that allows you to pick a free four-star character from Gallagher, Hanya, Luka, or Arlan.</p>

The trailer hams up the theme by leaning into a late ‘90s television show vibe similar to the superhero series. Genji, Sojourn, Cassidy, Ana, and Wrecking Ball will star as “Underwatch,” a crime-fighting team facing Ashe, who gets this season’s customizable mythic skin. Calamity Empress Ashe gives major Rita Replusa vibes, and you can unlock that skin as you progress through the season’s battle pass.</p><p>Other big additions include the return of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pink-mercy-rose-gold-breast-cancer-research-1851538036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pink-mercy-rose-gold-breast-cancer-research-1851538036">Pink Mercy skin</a></span> to benefit breast cancer research, a purchasable mythic weapon for Reinhardt with special visual and sound effects, and a new Push Map called Runasapi, a major setting in newcomer healer Illari’s backstory. The Colosseo map will also be getting reworked to move cover and resources around like health packs. Those are the big pillars of this latest season, but Blizzard has also confirmed that it will be using the Quick Play: Hacked limited mode to test out a possible feature: pickable passives. This will allow you to choose your hero’s passive ability based on their role, rather than the ones that are usually on by default. Blizzard didn’t elaborate on what those alternate passives would look like, however.</p><p>Some final highlights include Hero Mastery levels for Soldier: 76 (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pride-event-flag-midtown-baptiste-pharah-1850488282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pride-event-flag-midtown-baptiste-pharah-1850488282">Happy Pride month to me</a></span>) and Kiriko, the return of the Summer Games event, and Lifeguard skins for Kiriko, Lifeweaver (again, Happy Pride), Junkrat, Lucio, and Roadhog. There is also a brief tease of the <em>Overwatch </em>logo turning into the <em>Transformers</em> logo, but Blizzard didn’t give any other hints as to what that collaboration might entail.

<p data-characters="445" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We all knew <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/its-official-a-june-nintendo-direct-is-happening-tomorrow-but-dont-expect-a-switch-2-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Nintendo Direct was coming this month</a>; the company <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-admits-its-making-a-new-console-in-the-most-casual-way-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said as much in May</a>. The real question is what will actually be shown. Nintendo’s release schedule for the rest of 2024 and beyond is barren (with the exception of <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-will-let-you-tackle-challenges-in-classic-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</a></em>), and the company itself has offered no hints as to what can be expected, leaving all of us free rein to predict what could be announced.</p> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">Below, we’ve collated every potential announcement we think could be made during the June Nintendo Direct, including some of the more popular rumors that have been making the rounds. Although we can most definitely rule out anything to do with the Nintendo Switch 2 (or whatever Nintendo’s next console is) being shared since Nintendo’s announcement for the Direct emphatically ruled it out, there are still plenty of games that could make an appearance.</p>
 <h2 id="h-every-rumored-or-theorized-game-that-could-appear-in-nintendo-s-june-2024-direct" data-injectable="false">Every rumored or theorized game that could appear in Nintendo’s June 2024 Direct</h2> <h3 id="h-metroid-prime" data-injectable="false"><em>Metroid Prime</em></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="741" data-injectable="true"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> still remains an enigma among Nintendo’s line-up of upcoming titles. Zero information on the game has been shared since that 2017 reveal, barring confirmation that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/retro-studios-is-taking-over-development-for-metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development had started from scratch at Retro Studios</a>. And that was five years ago. It wouldn’t be surprising if Nintendo’s opted to hold it back for the Switch 2 but, if not, maybe Nintendo will finally have something to share at this Direct.</p>
 <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">Even if <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is MIA again, there have been claims in the past of <em>Metroid Prime 2</em> and <em>3</em> seeing remasters, especially in the wake of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-metroid-prime-remastered-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first game’s remaster</a> from February 2023. Although Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb has claimed the <em>Prime 2</em> and <em>3</em> remasters won’t be as much as an overhaul compared to the first one (via <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/06/28/metroid-prime-1-remaster-out-this-year-but-not-2-and-3-says-source-16903233/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>). Still, it’d make a lot of sense for Nintendo to at least make the whole <em>Prime</em> trilogy available in the run-up to <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>.</p>
 <h3 id="h-legend-of-zelda" data-injectable="false"><em>Legend of Zelda</em></h3> <p data-characters="647" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">After the Switch release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-zelda-skyward-sword-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em>, it was widely claimed/assumed that <em>Twilight Princess</em> and <em>The Wind Waker</em> (both of which saw Wii U ports) would follow suit. Those rumors were especially popular <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/whole-lot-of-zelda-twilight-princess-wind-waker-switch-spot-dodge-podcast/">towards the end of 2022</a>, but nothing ever came of them. Still, these rumors haven’t completely gone away, with some speculating that Nintendo is simply waiting for a good time to release them. With how empty the rest of its 2024 is, this year may see at least one of them come out. At the very least, you shouldn’t expect any <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em> DLC since producer Eiji Aonuma ruled it out last year (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-moves-on-to-brand-new-the-legend-of-zelda-game-rules-out-tears-of-the-kingdom-dlc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>).</p>
 <h3 id="h-fire-emblem" data-injectable="false"><em>Fire Emblem</em></h3> <p data-characters="660" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">Another longstanding and popular rumor has been for a remake of <em>Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</em>, the fourth mainline entry in the series. To date, it was only ever released in Japan, but considering how much more popular the series has become since then, it’d make a lot of sense for Nintendo to at least re-release it. Especially since it’s considered one of the best <em>Fire Emblem</em> games ever made and introduced a lot of longstanding elements to the series. Plus, the first three <em>Fire Emblem</em> games have all seen remakes (though only the first two ever came to the West), so it only seems natural for <em>Genealogy of the Holy War</em> to follow suit.</p>
 <h3 id="h-donkey-kong" data-injectable="false"><em>Donkey Kong</em></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="628" data-current-count="928" data-injectable="true">Between Donkey Kong’s presence in <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> and Nintendo’s theme park getting a whole Donkey Kong themed area, it does feel like Nintendo’s looking to push its gorilla mascot in a big way. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mario-vs-donkey-kong-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</em> remake</a> was a quaint throwback, but DK serves as the antagonist, meaning we’re overdue a new adventure where he’s the star. This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> series and while Nintendo skipped out on celebrating the character’s 40th birthday in 2021, a new game reveal for this year would make for a great anniversary present.</p>
 <h3 id="h-xenosaga" data-injectable="false"><em>Xenosaga</em></h3> <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">This one might be the most esoteric pick on the list, but I and plenty others genuinely feel like developer Monolith Soft, the studio behind <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, could bring its <em>Xenosaga</em> games to the Switch. The reasoning for this would take a separate article to fully explain, but the short version is that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em>‘s story DLC, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-xenoblade-chronicles-3-future-redeemed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Future Redeemed</a></em>, contained direct references to the plot of the<em> Xenosaga</em> series, with its ending basically confirming ties between <em>Xenoblade</em> and <em>Xenosaga</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="867" data-current-count="867" data-injectable="true">Admittedly, <em>Xenosaga</em> is a Bandai Namco IP, so it’s not like Monolith Soft took it when it was acquired by Nintendo. However, Nintendo and Bandai Namco have a strong working relationship, with the latter aiding development on <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-super-smash-bros-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em> and making a couple of <em>Pokémon</em> spin-offs. Plus, all three worked together on the <em>Baten Kaitos</em> remasters from 2023, and Monolith likely couldn’t have had direct <em>Xenosaga</em> references in <em>Future Redeemed</em> without Bandai Namco’s involvement. Not to mention <em>Xenosaga</em> protagonist KOS-MOS already made a cameo in <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em>. It really feels like the stars are aligning for <em>Xenosaga</em> to make a return, though whether it’s at this Direct or a future one is another question entirely. Otherwise, Wii U fans are holding out hope that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>might finally make a leap to Switch.</p>
 <h3 id="h-lego-horizon-adventures" data-injectable="false"><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via The game Awards YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="814" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-worlds-of-lego-and-horizon-meld-together-in-lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lego Horizon Adventures</a></em> may be a spin-off, but Sony putting <em>Horizon</em>, one of its main IPs, on Nintendo hardware is still a big deal and was one of the standout surprises from Summer Game Fest. Given this unexpected partnership, we could see more of the game at the June Direct, if not at least a reminder that it’s happening. Then again, considering Sony withheld <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> from its own State of Play showcase, Nintendo may omit as well just so it can avoid promoting a rival company’s IP.</p>
 <h3 id="h-another-wii-u-port" data-injectable="false">Another Wii U port</h3> <p data-characters="718" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">There are still a handful of Wii U games that remain locked to Nintendo’s abandoned hardware that fans would love to see find new life on Switch. As mentioned before, some want <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-xenoblade-chronicles-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em> to get a Switch port, but a trademark from earlier this year points to another possibility. As spotted by <a href="https://www.vooks.net/new-trademarks-filed-for-kirby-and-the-rainbow-paintbrush-fullblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vooks</a> back in May, Nintendo filed a new trademark for <em>Kirby and the Rainbow Paintbrush</em>, or <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-kirby-and-the-rainbow-curse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby and the Rainbow Curse</a></em> as it’s called in the U.S., sparking assumptions that it will see a Switch release very soon. There was also a new trademark for 3DS puzzle game <em>Fullblox</em>, also known as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-stretchmo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stretchmo</a></em> in the U.S., which would be a random but not unwelcome IP for Nintendo to revisit after so many years.</p>
 <h3 id="h-sonic-x-shadow-generations" data-injectable="false"><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Sega</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="510" data-current-count="810" data-injectable="true">Moving onto third-party announcements, a trailer for the next <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> game feels like a safe bet, especially with it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-locks-in-an-october-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching in October</a>. Despite it coming to Switch, there’s been little to no focus on that version of <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em>, so it’d be nice to see how it runs on Nintendo’s hardware. Ideally, we’d even get to see details not shown in Sega’s Summer Game Fest preview, like its new open world area or maybe another new level for the Shadow portion.</p>
 <h3 id="h-dragon-quest-3-hd-2d" data-injectable="false"><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</em></h3> <p data-characters="745" data-current-count="745" data-injectable="true">The HD-2D remake of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> fell off the map after its 2021 reveal, but Square Enix finally acknowledged it was still in the works with <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1794987069531476347" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this Twitter post</a> this past May. It didn’t really confirm anything aside from it being multiplatform, but the accompanying message, “The legend of Erdrick draws near,” got people thinking the reason it’s taken so long is because it’s now a remake of the first three <em>Dragon Quest</em> games, which are regarded as the Erdrick Saga Trilogy. Considering Square Enix’s previous HD-2D games, like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-octopath-traveler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Octopath Traveler</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-triangle-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triangle Strategy</a></em>, debuted on Nintendo hardware, it’s not unreasonable to believe the <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> remake could make its return in a Nintendo Direct.</p>
 <h3 id="h-beyond-good-amp-evil" data-injectable="false"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="672" data-current-count="972" data-injectable="true">While nobody expects <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> to come out any time soon (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/beyond-good-evil-2-most-delayed-aaa-game-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if at all</a>), a remaster of the first game made to celebrate its 20th anniversary should be on its way, especially since the anniversary was last year. Ubisoft had promised it would share details on it in early 2024 and yet it’s said nothing since <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2023 reveal</a>, with the remaster also <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/both-the-beyond-good-evil-sequel-and-remaster-were-a-no-show-at-ubisoft-forward-and-fans-are-distraught/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bizarrely absent at Ubisoft’s latest showcase</a>. Recently, however, trophies for the PlayStation 5 version popped up on tracking site <a href="https://www.exophase.com/game/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-psn/trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Exophase</a>, suggesting a release is imminent. With the Nintendo Direct the only major summer showcase left, <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> will hopefully make an appearance there.</p>
 <h3 id="h-ace-attorney" data-injectable="false"><em>Ace Attorney</em></h3> <p data-characters="754" data-current-count="754" data-injectable="true">Capcom spent Summer Game Fest hyping up <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-a-first-look-at-its-gameplay-in-the-latest-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></em> and <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, but a very recent rumour points to something <em>Ace Attorney</em> related being shown at the Nintendo Direct. The series started out on Nintendo platforms so it’d be fitting for a new game to be announced during the Direct, although a comment by <a href="https://x.com/Pyoro_X/status/1802670647434424749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter user Pyoro</a> (a common and reliable source of Nintendo leaks) has some fans thinking it’ll be a collection of the two <em>Ace Attorney Investigations</em> spin-offs. While I’d personally prefer an <em>Ace Attorney 7</em>, an <em>Investigations</em> collection would be a big deal. Not only are both games not available on modern hardware like the rest of the series, but the second game never launched outside of Japan.</p>
 <h3 id="h-darkest-dungeon-2" data-injectable="false"><em>Darkest Dungeon 2</em></h3> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">Since the original <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-darkest-dungeon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Darkest Dungeon</a></em> eventually made its way to consoles after its PC launch, it was always safe to assume its sequel would follow suit. PlayStation versions of <em>Darkest Dungeon 2</em> were eventually announced in April but, just a month earlier, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1765027731715031501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gematsu</a> reported that <em>Darkest Dungeon 2</em> had been rated in Brazil for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. So, a Switch port could get a brief acknowledgement in the Nintendo Direct in-between the bigger reveals.</p>
 <h3 id="h-silksong" data-injectable="false"><em>Silksong</em></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="770" data-current-count="1070" data-injectable="false">Honestly, this is here out of obligation. <em>Silksong</em> fans can’t help but hope this long-awaited sequel to 2017’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hollow-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a> will make an appearance with every gaming related showcase, and are forced to put on clown make-up when it doesn’t show. Developer Team Cherry did <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed-team-cherry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously aim for a 2023 launch</a>, but wound up delaying it, and the last ‘real’ update was when <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-hollow-knight-silksong-listing-has-appeared-on-the-xbox-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a listing for it appeared on the Xbox store</a> this past April. This could be a sign of Team Cherry gearing up for a release, but there’s otherwise nothing to suggest <em>Silksong</em> will appear at this Nintendo Direct. By that same metric, there’s nothing to suggest it <em>won’t</em> appear, but we’ll be keeping the clown wig and face-paint on stand-by regardless.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has confirmed the next <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-direct">Nintendo Direct</a> will take place tomorrow, Tuesday 18th June, at 3PM BST (UK time).</p>
<p>You can watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct 6.18.2024 – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kX3BkD5PVUM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The stream will run for around 40 minutes and will mainly focus on Nintendo Switch games coming in the second half of 2024. Sadly for all of us impatient gamers, they also state that “There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.” – this follows up on Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa taking to <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197?t=nK-fpqaQ1GKNCALLmTvVrA&amp;s=19">Twitter</a> to say the same thing just last month, even though <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/">a Switch 2 reveal will take place this fiscal year.</a></p>
<p>So what will be featured at Nintendo Direct?</p>

<p>There’s likely to be some last second check ins for soon-to-be released games like Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition (coming 18th July), and it’d be neat to see more of World of Goo 2 ahead of August, or the adorable The Plucky Squire.</p>
<p>Given how late in the Nintendo Switch life cycle we are, and recent trends, there’s also hope for some surprise and/or rumoured remasters as well. The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker and Twilight Princess would be very welcome remasters for Switch, and since we’ve had Metroid Prime Remastered, Nintendo could continue to pad out the time before Metroid Prime 4 with remasters of the rest of the trilogy.</p>
<p>But really, we’re at the point where we don’t really know what Nintendo can announce. They’re surely trying to keep their powder dry on Switch 2 launch games, so it’s best to temper expectations, but there could be some nice surprises, regardless.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24180103/still-wakes-the-deep-review-xbox-ps5-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The sea is basically the blue skin of the world, yet we know so little of its depths. Much like the vastness of space, it is filled with mystery. With both comes the unknown — and, therefore, horror. In <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, the latest first-person horror from The Chinese Room, the sea births a mysterious terror that takes over an oil rig, and its workers must fight to survive.</p><p>Somewhere in the middle of the ocean, players are introduced to protagonist McLearly, a Scottish oil rig’s troublesome electrician. From the beginning, I was incredibly impressed by the voice acting, writing, and performance. Most of the crew are Glaswegians, who use colloquial terms and slang, which the game warns can be “translated” by turning on subtitles. McLearly (Alec Newman, who plays <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s Adam Smasher and <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>’s Beast, among others) is a very likable protagonist. When we first meet him, he’s fired for causing an onshore brawl that’d led police to the rig, much to his boss’s dismay. As he’s leaving via chopper, the rig strikes something — or something strikes the rig — far below the surface.</p><p>From there, everything turns to chaos, as bioluminescent tentacles and large leaves that look like seaweed begin covering the entire rig. But when it interacts with humans, it subsumes them, turning into horrific monsters out of John Carpenter’s <em>The Thing</em>.</p><p>McLearly must use his skills as an electrician to navigate his way out of the nautical nightmare. Environmental puzzles — involving turning levers and wheels, putting out fires, and pushing and pulling in the right sequence — make up the majority of your time, all the while the rig is groaning and coming apart and the screams of turned friends and colleagues echo through the metallic hallways.</p><p>The game is, at times, wonderfully terrifying, and I was impressed by the creature designs. Friends who you meet early in the game now scream and belt out threats and concerns they had while fully human, their flesh permanently tethered to the growing alien menace that has taken over the rig. (It’s never explained what the menace or monster or virus is, only that it comes from the sea.) When you’re stuck in these hallways with the monsters, McLearly can only hide, throw objects, and sneak past. There’s no combat and insta-death, which can prove somewhat frustrating. You’re never certain when or where a monster will hear you, and the game seems to have a very strict, internally consistent idea of how to succeed in cat-and-mouse levels.</p><p>The game is incredibly tactile. Intuitive button mapping meant I always felt embodied in McLearly, from pulling levers to climbing to sliding down ladders. The developers have done an excellent job putting you in McLearly’s shoes, allowing you to see his entire body as he climbs and crawls. McLearly unscrews vents, grabs to pull himself through dark water, slips and slides, cries out, and swears when trying to take leaps. Aside from feeling like I embodied him, McLearly’s reactions to what he was doing also seemed like he was embodying <em>me</em>: taking a huge leap meant I sometimes swore and, hilariously, found McLearly shouting the same when he landed.</p><p>As with previous Chinese Room titles, the original orchestral score is bold and loud when you eventually hear it. But unlike <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/10/9123999/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review-ps4"><em>Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</em></a>, where Jessica Curry’s score did so much to tell that story, here, it’s muted, with few waves of music rushing in. Much of the ambience comes from the rig collapsing, the sound of destruction serving as the music of annihilation rather than a powerful choir. Jason Graves (composer for Supermassive’s horror titles and <em>The Order: 1886</em>) does a good job here, even if it does not live up to Curry’s work.&nbsp;</p><p>The oil rig itself is impressively detailed, with its lifelike textures and appropriate signage, old switch-operated phones, and realistic monitors. While you can’t interact with much of the world, it still feels lived in, a place people had occupied and made their own — especially when visiting individual crew’s quarters.</p><p>The level of detail, combined with excellent sound direction, really made me feel like I was in the rig. You will be forced to double back to areas, and your familiarity will assist in navigating a level: doors and passageways you walked through untouched are now blocked by debris, or your friend has turned into a giant, tentacled monster. I appreciated the developers’ strict focus on one specific location, with limited areas, allowing them to demonstrate slow destruction in a way that was tangible.</p><p>Though it doesn’t push the genre anywhere new, <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> is a worthy addition to the horror canon — and further proof that the great void of the ocean is something I want to avoid.</p><p><small>Still Wakes the Deep <em>launches June 18th on PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A Quiet Place is a very solid horror movie that seemed primed for a video game adaptation from the off. After all, it already had all the ingredients of a video game right there: the whole film is essentially one overlong stealth mission with a punishing fail state - any crunchy glass or other noise would immediately draw the attention of deadly alien monsters - and at one point there’s a whiteboard with the narrative equivalent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>’s “CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS” graffiti scrawled on it. Lo and behold, we’re getting a Quiet Place video game.</p>

<p>A Quiet Place video game was actually announced back in 2021, though you might’ve missed its blink-and-miss-it reveal consisting of little more than a “yes, we’re making it” statement from developers iLLOGIKA and publishers Saber Interactive, who previously turned fellow horror movie World War Z into a surprisingly fun multiplayer game. At the time, the Quiet Place game was planned for release in 2022, before, erm, going silent for a few years.</p>
<p>Now it’s resurfaced with a proper name, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, a first look at gameplay and even a release date - soon! Replacing OG devs iLLOGIKA are new developers Stormind Games, known for the Remothered series of survival-horror games and hack-and-slash action-RPG Batora: Lost Haven.</p>
<p>The Road Ahead will be an original story set in the universe rather than retreading the plot of John Krasinski’s A Quiet Place, its sequel A Quiet Place Part II or this year’s prequel A Quiet Place: Day One, which is out next week. The story will follow a young survivor trying to creep their way through the apocalyptic world.</p>

<p>The reveal trailer shows off some first-person gameplay, involving the expected level of needing to keep quiet while having various objects - doors, drawers, switches, lights, that blasted floor glass - all make upsetting amounts of ruckus. You’ll have a flashlight to hand, along with something that looks like an improvised decibel measurer.</p>
<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will be out later this year, though we don’t have an exact release date just yet. Find it (quietly) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2233120/A_Quiet_Place_The_Road_Ahead/">on Steam</a> when it eventually sneaks out.</p>

That might explain why some of the models in this “new” video game look like they fell out of an Xbox 360 action game. After all, this basically <em>is </em>an Xbox 360-era video game, but with seemingly some enhanced lighting and (hopefully) solid performance. </p><p>Will <em>Captain Blood</em> be good? No idea! Technically, many people have already played a version of this game as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/storm-devs/captain-blood&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/storm-devs/captain-blood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a finished build leaked online in 2022</a></span>. From what I’ve seen of that leaked copy, I’m not expecting some groundbreaking game.</p><p> However, I’ll admit that I’m interested in playing through a linear single-player action game from the Xbox 360 era of gaming. These days, most games like this are big open-world things with crafting and live-service stuff. There’s something oddly charming about the chunky models and simplicity of <em>Captain Blood</em> that appeals to me. This is the kind of game I’d rent over the weekend as a teen and beat by Sunday afternoon. And I miss those games. So I’ll be playing<em> Captain Blood</em> when it arrives later this year. Assuming it actually does launch this time. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When mod support finally comes to Baldur’s Gate 3 in the future, it’s likely to be the last major update for the game from developer Larian Studios. The studio is going to then shift focus to other non-Baldur’s Gate projects.</p>



<p>“One of the big things for us, and the one that we’re really working towards now, is the ability for players to mod [Baldur’s Gate 3] themselves, because then they will be able to make their own things,” Larian CEO Swen Vincke said during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BAFTA’s An Evening with Baldur’s Gate 3</a> on Friday night. “And I think that will be the point where we’re going to say ‘ok, now it’s yours fully’.”</p>



<p>Development on mod support for the game is still ongoing, and there’s no firm date for its release aside from September. When it comes, though, Vincke says that the team is excited to move on to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work on its new games</a>.</p>



<p>“We’re working on our new thing, we’re super excited about the new games,” he said. “We’re creative spirits also, we don’t want to keep on doing the same thing, we really want to move forward and do new things.”</p>



<p>Despite major development and updates coming to an end sooner rather than later for Baldur’s Gate 3, support for the game won’t be ending entirely. Vincke said that the team will see support continue but limited to critical bug fixes and the like. Up to now, he said, development has continued as though the game was just launched. </p>



<p>Mod support will be a part of Patch 7 for the game. In addition to mods, Patch 7 will include bug fixes, a photo mode, improved evil endings, and more.</p>

If you like games such as Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, you're in for a real treat. I myself have put over 100 hours into the game and it is easily one of my favorite RTS games of all time. My only gripe is that I wish it was also released on the PC. Officially, IGN rated Unicorn Overload an "Amazing" 9/10 and you can read up on our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unicorn-overlord-review">Unicorn Overload review</a> to see why this is considered to be one of the best console strategy games in recent history. Here's reviewer Eric Zalewski's final verdict:</p><p>"Reflecting on the incredibly diverse and remarkably creative world I explored across my 45-hour journey, any issues I had with Unicorn Overlord ended up feeling like nothing more than nitpicks. The tactical combat system is unique and complex while also being easy to understand, expertly blending mechanics from many of its peers with smart new additions of its own. The interesting terrain across the continent of Fevrith makes every fight feel unique, with some of the best map gimmicks I’ve seen in any strategy RPG. Because the campaign is told through the eyes of a diverse and creative cast, its trope-filled fantasy story is elevated in a way that a more traditional storytelling style wouldn't manage. The shorter, more personal stories work wonderfully to support a loop of exploration and liberation that had me begging to see one more tale told, one more town rebuilt, and one more battle fought."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Check out more of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch video game deals today</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 17, 2024 4:10 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 20:single/related:823ef19cc2c0aa70a2a6ec4c118114de --><!-- empty -->
<p>At this point in <em>Star Citizen</em>'s drawn-out, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/10/wing-commanders-chris-roberts-returns-to-gaming-with-ambitious-mmo/">11-plus-year development cycle</a>, we're usually reminded of the game <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/a-complete-star-citizens-ship-collection-now-costs-48000/">when it hits some crowdfunding microtransaction milestone</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/star-citizen-devs-scale-back-roadmap-to-avoid-timeline-distractions/">updates</a> its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/star-citizen-dev-offers-roadmap-for-development-of-new-development-roadmap/">increasingly convoluted alpha development roadmap</a>. So last week's announcement that developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) has <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/an-update-on-auec-exploits-and-account-suspensions/6978548">banned over 600 cheaters from its servers</a> is a notable reminder that some people are actually enjoying—and exploiting—the unpolished alpha version of the game.
</p><p>Shortly after the May release of <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/190048/thread/star-citizen-alpha-3-23-1-9179031-live-patch-notes">Star Citizen's Alpha 2.23.1 update</a>, players <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">started noticing</a> that they could easily make extra money by storing a freight ship, selling their cargo, and then returning to the ship to find the cargo ready to be sold a second time. As knowledge of this "money doubling" exploit spread, <a href="https://gamersofflimits.com/star-citizen-3-23-1-cargo-duplicating/">players reported</a> that <a href="https://gamersofflimits.com/star-citizen-3-23-1-cargo-duplicating/">the price of basic in-game resources</a> saw significant inflation in a matter of days.</p>
<p>Now, Cloud Imperium Games Senior Director of Player Relations Will Leverett has <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/an-update-on-auec-exploits-and-account-suspensions/6978548">written</a> that the developer has investigated "multiple exploits within <em>Star Citizen</em> that compromised stability and negatively impacted the in-game economy." In doing so, CIG says it "identified and suspended over 600 accounts involved in exploitative behaviors while also removing the illicitly gained aUEC [in-game currency] from the <em>Star Citizen</em> ecosystem."</p>
<p>A ban for "over 600" players may not seem that notable when games like <em>Dota 2</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em> routinely announce <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/06/7033-2/">ban waves</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/valve-used-secret-memory-access-honeypot-to-detect-40k-dota-2-cheaters/">include tens of thousands of players</a>. Still, it's a reminder that at least a small portion of <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">the game's more than 5.2 million backers</a> are actively playing the alpha so much that they're willing to cheat to see more of what the game has to offer.
</p><p>"From zero, in two evenings, I did make about [200 million aUEC] just to buy ships that [are] unavailable for me, to try it in full!" user ZeroInsideOut <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/an-update-on-auec-exploits-and-account-suspensions/6987894">wrote on the game's forums</a>. "There [are] many things in <em>Star Citizen</em> [which] I would like to try and test, but I am short of money."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>It’s getting late for “early access” bugs</h2>
<p>Leverett wrote that exploits like these should be expected in <em>Star Citizen</em> "at this stage of development"—a stage that we hasten to once again point out is now <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/07/star-citizen-creator-calls-bullshit-on-feature-creep-and-over-ambition/">part of well over a decade of active development</a>. Finding and squashing these kinds of bugs "early" is all part of the game's crowdfunded development plan and "one of the benefits of open development and working closely with our community," Leverett wrote.</p>
<p>"We've gained valuable insights through your issue council reports, and we thank you for that," he continued. "However, once an exploit is identified and confirmed, continued abuse for personal gain will not be tolerated and will result in action on our part."</p>
<p>However, some players feel that the "open development" process failed to find this significant issue quickly enough. Commenter Nitebird <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/an-update-on-auec-exploits-and-account-suspensions/6978730">took CIG to task</a> for "allow[ing] exploits reported during [<a href="https://support.robertsspaceindustries.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013195927-Public-Test-Universe-PTU-FAQ">Public Test Universe</a>] to go to live despite many people confirming the issue in [the <a href="https://issue-council.robertsspaceindustries.com/">Issue Council</a>] and urging CIG to pause to fix it. The patch is ruined regardless for many people... What is IC good for than to prevent this?"</p>

<p>CIG <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/star-citizen-faces-major-server-outage-still-isnt-close-to-launch/">launched an important "Persistent Universe" update</a> for <em>Star Citizen</em> over a year ago and announced late last year that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/star-citizens-squadron-42-campaign-is-feature-complete-after-11-years/">spin-off <em>Squadron 42</em> had reached "feature complete" status</a>. Despite those signs of progress, though, there's still no target date for <em>Star Citizen</em> to finally transition from its extended alpha to that fabled "Version 1.0" release.
</p><p>CIG founder and CEO Chris Roberts <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/19848-Letter-From-The-Chairman">said in a March update</a> that the development team "is hard at work, heads down, driving toward the finish line" and that the leadership team has now "spent significant time looking at what <em>Star Citizen</em> 1.0 means and what it would take to get there." That includes the planned introduction of long-sought key features like base building and crafting that were apparently not a priority during the game's first 11-plus years of development work.</p>
<p>"As that roadmap [for a 1.0 release] comes together and becomes validated, we look forward to sharing with you both its vision and executional plan later this year," Roberts wrote.</p>

Not only does this allow players to use a mouse and keyboard in controller-only matchmaking, but it gives an additional advantage since any aim assist in the game will also work on mouse and keyboard, since the game thinks it's a controller. Naturally this leads to many players using the device in controller-only lobbies on console to give themselves an advantage, with cheaters running rampant in many competitive shooters on console.</p><p>The head of anti-cheat at Riot Games <a href="https://twitter.com/deteccphilippe/status/1801790659017457839">Phillip Koskinas</a> shared the video on X writing, "a satisfied first customer."

<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Bethesda Softworks has got some pretty big plans for <em>Starfield</em>‘s post-launch content, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/starfield-shattered-space-release-window-new-content-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming <em>Shattered Space</em> expansion pack</a>, which is due to launch this Fall, is just the start of it. In fact, the term “annual expansions” is already being thrown around.</p> <p data-characters="544" data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true">This information comes from a new interview held by YouTuber MrMattyPlays, who had the opportunity to spend a full hour talking about all things Bethesda Softworks with none other than Todd Howard himself. The duo discussed a whole slew of topics ranging from the future of <em>Fallout</em> all the way to the company’s immediate plans for <em>Starfield</em>. The plan, according to Howard, is to continue supporting <em>Starfield</em> for as long as possible, and a tentative second year of content is already confirmed with a premium DLC headlining its offerings.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Matty Interviews Todd Howard: Future Of Fallout, Starfield Year 2, Elder Scrolls VI Info, &amp; MORE!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-there-will-be-more-dlc-for-starfield-after-shattered-space-comes-out" data-injectable="false">There will be more DLC for Starfield after Shattered Space comes out</h2> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true">“This is the scope that works for our development and doing this kind of annual story expansion type of thing,” Howard said when explaining <em>Shattered Space</em>‘s scope and goals, as the DLC is set almost entirely on a single planet and city. </p>
 <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">MrMattyPlays was, of course, quick to ask about Bethesda’s plans for potential yearly expansions, and Howard was happy to explain what was up with that: “We’re planning for the one after [<em>Shattered Space</em>],” he said. A second major DLC is, then, good as confirmed for <em>Starfield</em>. Sadly, Howard wasn’t keen on revealing much of anything about the DLC, aside from the fact that it’s going to happen, but it’s good news indeed.</p>
 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Starfield</em> may not be entirely perfect</a>, all things considered, but it sure has been racking up some solid wins as of late. Not only has it received a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/starfield-all-may-update-difficulty-tweaks-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fairly chunky gameplay update</a> just last month, but Bethesda also managed to push out the long awaited <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/starfield-creation-kit-is-finally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Starfield</em> Creation Kit</a>, essentially opening the modding floodgates for the game once and for all.</p> <p data-characters="529" data-current-count="877" data-injectable="true">Curiously, Howard was also careful to reference Bethesda’s earlier announcement about <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bethesda-aims-to-update-starfield-roughly-every-six-weeks-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Starfield</em> update cadence</a>, wherein Bethesda promised that there’d be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bethesda-aims-to-update-starfield-roughly-every-six-weeks-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roughly six weeks between each major patch in 2024</a>. This, as Howard puts it, isn’t necessarily “helpful” in that there may be shorter and longer gaps between updates as Bethesda Softworks continues working on it. It’s not a huge deal, all things considered, but it ought to help set the correct expectations for the foreseeable future.</p>
 <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="false">So, good things ahead, that’s for sure. While we’re still some ways away from the release of the big <em>Shattered Space</em> DLC – which Todd Howard specifically compared to <em>Fallout 4</em>‘s beloved <em>Far Harbor</em> DLC – <em>Starfield</em>‘s modding scene is now burgeoning anew both via <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?platforms=XB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the in-game Creations menu</a> and through <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the usual Nexus website</a>. New armor sets, weapons, gameplay mechanics, rebalancing attempts, and even points-of-interest are already available and come highly recommended, so be sure to check those out.</p>

            <p>Remember Lords of the Fallen? No, not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen">that one</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lords-of-the-fallen">This one</a>. Last year’s reboot of the 2014 game of <em>exactly </em>the same name - despite the successor originally being a numbered sequel, then at least having a ‘The’ at the start of its title to help tell them apart a little - will now get its own follow-up in a third Lords of the Fallen game. The upcoming sequel doesn’t have a name yet, but I really hope they stick with the bit and just call it “Lords of the Fallen” again.</p>

<p>Lords of the Fallen, Lords of the Fallen 3, The The Lords of the Fallen, Lords of the Fall3n or whatever they decide to call it, before undoubtedly rechristening it later on for maximum confusion, was revealed by a bit of paperwork filed by publishers CI Games and spotted by Polish financial outlet <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/CI-GAMES-S-E-Podpisanie-Binding-Term-Sheet-z-Epic-Games-Inc-8765997.html">Bankier</a>.</p>
<p>The paperwork filed on June 14th pertains to a partnership between CI Games and Epic to give the latter lifetime exclusive distribution rights to the game - currently referred to internally as Project 3. That means you can expect it to be exclusive to the Epic Games Store, though it’ll also release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The document also notes that CI Games expects to release Lords of tres Fallen sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallen-review">our review</a>, Ed found Lords of the Fallen (2023) to be a serviceable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> waylaid by a litany of irritating issues - from an awkward camera to performance wobbles - that took away from its highlights, notably its dimension-hopping lantern mechanic.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen devs Hexworks laid off several of their team at the start of the year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-layoffs-as-behaviour-interactive-and-ci-games-adjust-scope-and-make-optimisations">as part of redundancies across CI Games</a>. Regardless, the studio have continued to support the game, capping off their patches <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallens-steam-reviews-improve-as-performance-patch-lands-devs-advise-players-not-to-use-graphics-settings-their-rigs-cannot-handle">targeting performance improvements</a> and balancing with a final update that added a randomised New Game+ mode and Ironman modifier in April <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallens-latest-update-adds-cruel-modifiers-that-turn-it-into-a-roguelike">that together effectively turn the game into a roguelike</a>.</p>

<p>Netflix’s efforts to grow its gaming front seem to be succeeding, at least in one area. According to new data compiled by <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/rockstars-gta-trilogy-hits-30m-downloads-on-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mobilegamer.biz</a>, the GTA Trilogy has been downloaded over 30 million times on Netflix Games.</p>



<p>The data, which comes from Appmagic, shows that GTA San Andreas has been installed 20.5 million times by players. GTA Vice City sits at 6.5 million installs while GTA 3 has 3.3 million. </p>



<p>As far as the devices being played on, iOS has seen 15.8 million installs of San Andreas compared to 4.7 million on Android. For Vice City, that breakdown is 4.9 million on iOS and 1.6 on Android while GTA 3 had 2.4 million players on iOS and just 929,000 on Android. Lastly, most of the players come from the United States with each game having more than 23% of a U.S. player base.</p>



<p>Netflix continues to invest in its gaming department. As of December 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-has-90-games-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 90 games were in development</a> for the platform.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MSI Raider GE78 HX Review – As Powerful As It Is Big]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/msi-raider-ge78-hx-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/msi-raider-ge78-hx-review-%E2%80%93-as-powerful-as-it-is-big.903543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/msi-raider-ge78-hx-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As the PC gaming market continues to grow, more and more players are looking for reasons to game on the go. To do that properly, however, you likely want a powerful laptop to make sure you can do what you want, when you want, and how you want. The MSI Raider GE78 HX laptop is one of MSI’s premium gaming laptops that packs the punch you want for high-end performance.</p>



<p>Retailing at $3,000, it’s a pricey computer but comes loaded with everything you’d need to make sure it’s something that will satisfy you for years before needing to upgrade. The MSI Raider GE78 HX laptop I reviewed comes with an Intel Core i9-14900HX processor, an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600 memory, and a 2TB NVMe SSD.</p>



<p>I’ve used the laptop as my daily driver for the better part of three months to get a feel for how it works under regular and heavy use. So is the MSI Raider GE78 HX laptop one worth picking up, even today, to be your PC solution?</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Specification</strong></th><th><strong>Details</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Intel Core i9-14900HX</td></tr><tr><td>Graphics</td><td>Nvidia RTX 4090</td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>17-inch at 2560×1600, 240hz IPS</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>32GB DDR5-5600</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>2TB NVMe SSD</td></tr><tr><td>Ports</td><td>Thunderbolt 4, 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C<br>2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, <br>SD card slot, and 3.5 mm audio jack</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>99.9 WHr</td></tr><tr><td>Network</td><td>Wired: Killer E3100G (2.5Gbps)<br>Wireless: Killer WiFi 7 BE1750, Bluetooth 5.4</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>14.97 x 11.73 x 1.13 inches at 6.61 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>$2,999.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-msi-raider-ge78-hx-review">MSI Raider GE78 HX Review</h2>



<h3 id="h-day-to-day-usage"><strong>Day-to-Day Usage</strong></h3>



<p>While everyone loves synthetic benchmark numbers, they aren’t usually indicative of how people will actually use their machine. So, to test this laptop, the focus was on playing games, capturing content, and editing videos.  What is it like if the MSI Raider GE78 HX was going to be your primary computer?</p>



<p>Let’s start with games. The games played for the purpose of testing the laptop were  Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, XDefiant, Cyberpunk 2077, and Doom Eternal.</p>



<p>Whatever you want to play, this laptop can handle it. Doom Eternal regularly hit 250-300 frames per second (FPS). CyberPunk 2077, a more resource-intensive game, peaked around 85 FPS while stayed at 61-66 FPS on average. Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, during the most intense in-game action with military on scree, averaged around 115 FPS. Lastly, XDefiant — the newest game on this list — was averaging over 300 FPS. All in all, it’s a great experience when gaming.</p>



<p>Video rendering was fast with five-minute, 1440p videos rendering in less than two minutes. That same video in 4K was done in less than four. Obviously the more transitions, cuts, and edits you have, the longer it might take. But for the average content creator, you will have no issues working on this.</p>



<p>Should you just want to watch movies and videos, the 17-inch 2560×1600 240hz screen is pretty good. The blacks could be better on high brightness, but you shouldn’t find too much to be upset about with the IPS display.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-some-concerns">Some Concerns</h3>



<p>It’s not all roses with the MSI Raider GE78 HX, though. One problem I do have is just how loud the fans get when using it. No matter what you do, the fans will, at times, sound like they are getting ready to send the machine to the sky. Still, even with the high fan usage and volume, I noticed that it did get quite warm to the touch. It’s not a machine you’ll want to sit on your lap without a cooling pad or lap desk underneath it. It also can become a tad bit uncomfortable to the touch, especially at the top end of the keyboard, when using it for extended periods. If gaming, I highly recommend a controller or using an external mouse and keyboard if the games being played are intensive.</p>



<p>Another concern is battery life. It’s too inconsistent to know just how good the life is. Sometimes, it would last over five hours. Other times, I was lucky to get over two hours on a full charge. If you want to just spend your time in a game without being plugged in, expect your time to be closer to the two hour-mark, if not less. Playing games like XDefiant or even Diablo 4 at the highest settings say the battery last just over an hour before needing to be plugged in. So while you can definitely game on the go with this machine, it’s still best to keep your power brick handy and ready just in case. </p>

<h3><strong>Verdict</strong></h3>



<p>Overall, there’s no doubt that the MSI Raider GE78 HX is a powerful computer. It does pretty much everything you’d want from a machine like this. However, when people are looking at gaming laptops, portability might be at the top of their list. The MSI Raider GE78 HX, despite it’s great performance when gaming, creating, or really anything, is a bulky machine that doesn’t really scream “on-the-go gaming”.</p>



<p>That said, if you either travel a lot where you can’t drag a desktop PC with you or you have limited real estate at home where a laptop fits perfectly, then this laptop makes sense even at it’s high price point. It really is going to come down to your specific use case. There’s also a chance you can get one at a lower price point as it’s been on the market for a little while now.</p>

"Its fundamentals are incredibly easy to understand, even if you're unfamiliar with poker, but the ways in which it works within the game's boundaries (and often breaks free from them) injects a level of depth to each hand to play that's both challenging and rewarding to continually engage with. It's a game that will melt away time as you hit play on one run after the next, with each defeat never stinging long enough to dissuade the possibility of victory on the next."</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-book-sale-june-2024-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off/1100-6524101/">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off Book Box Sets At Target - Manga, Novels, Comic Omnibuses, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide/1100-6523846/">Astro Bot Preorders Are Live - The PS5 Exclusive Comes With An Adorable Bonus</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-game-sale-features-rarely-discounted-exclusives-ahead-of-summer-game-fest/1100-6524025/">Nintendo Switch Game Sale Features Rarely Discounted Exclusives Ahead Of Summer Game Fest</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-preorders-come-with-bonus-playable-fighters/1100-6520091/">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorders Come With Bonus Playable Fighters</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-preorder-guide/1100-6524060/">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorders Are Live, Includes Doctor Robotnik's Journal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hit-anime-hells-paradise-is-coming-to-blu-ray-with-an-amazon-exclusive-limited-edition/1100-6523982/">The Hit Anime Hell's Paradise Is Coming To Blu-Ray With An Amazon-Exclusive Limited Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-season-11-launches-on-thursday-june-20/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard announced the launch date of Overwatch 2 Season 11: Super Mega Ultrawatch, two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-season-10-venture-clash-mode-alignment-swap-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of Season 10</a>. The new season will be available starting this Thursday, June 20, adding a new Mythic cosmetic type, a Push map, the return of Pink Mercy (with the proceed of her cosmetic items going fully to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation), new Hero Mastery Missions, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Runapasi Push Map:</strong> Hike your way to this hidden city in the Peruvian Andes in Overwatch 2's latest push map. This map features narrow streets and nods to the local culture, including the Inti Warrior Historical Museum and Monument. Play it in Quick Play and Competitive upon the launch of Season 11.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Hero Mastery:</strong> Sharpen your kunai and master your aim when the Hero Mastery single-player courses for both Kiriko and Soldier: 76 launch this season. Take on new challenges and earn new rewards and up to 22,500 Battle Pass XP during a limited-time event from June 20 through July 9.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Pink Mercy for a Cause:</strong> Celebrating the power of Overwatch 2's 100 million-player community, Pink Mercy returns to the store on June 25 with a new Rose Gold Mercy bundle. 100% of the proceeds from these items will benefit the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Mythic Weapon Skins:</strong> Coming with the Mid-Season Update, players will unlock cool-looking Mythic Weapon Skins. Similar to Heroic Weapon Skins, these come with exclusive sound and visual effects. Redeem Mythic Prisms to earn and upgrade Mythic Weapons to slay in style, starting with the Mythic Bound Demon Reinhardt Weapon Skin, coming July 23.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The Premium Battle Pass for Overwatch 2 Season 11 will include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Up to 80 Mythic Prisms</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">5 Legendary Skins (Genji, Reaper, and Sojourn already confirmed)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Lifeguard Lucio Epic Skin</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">500 Credits</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Souvenirs, Weapon Charms, Victory Poses, Highlight Intros and Emotes</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Everything in the Free Battle Pass, including two additional Epic skins, 600 Overwatch Coins, an additional 1,500 Credits, and more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, with a new Overwatch 2 season, there are also several balance improvements to the heroes and the maps. Cassidy has swapped her Magnetic Grenade for a new and improved Flashbang that slows foes in their tracks. The glass on the Colosseo push map has been removed, along with other changes that will allow team fights to take place all over the streets of Rome.</p>

<p>Blizzard is also making weekly challenges more accessible. If you miss a week, you can catch up on the previous week’s challenges before working on the current ones. Weekly milestone rewards are easier to achieve than before, too. Completing three weekly challenges provides 20,000 XP. As each week passes, a new milestone reward becomes available.</p>

  <p id="5WXt9A"><strong>Season 11</strong> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/overwatch-2-guide"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a> will be a comparatively smaller one for Blizzard’s free-to-play shooter. Players won’t get a new hero this season, but they will get a new map, new Hero Mastery courses, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176406/overwatch-2-pink-mercy-skin-rerelease-blizzard-charity">the return of Pink Mercy</a>.</p>
<p id="7u5NJQ">Of course, there will also be a new battle pass. The theme for season 11 is Super Mega Ultrawatch, with kaiju and tokusatsu-inspired skins for heroes like Genji, Reaper, and Sojourn. Ashe is the recipient of season 11’s Mythic skin, turning her into a Rita Repulsa-like.</p>
<p id="tamR4W">Oh, and there’s a Transformers collaboration coming to <em>Overwatch 2</em>?! Seems like season 11 will have more than meets the eye...</p>
<hr id="HwufZJ">

<p id="lRh8UJ"><em>Overwatch 2</em> season 11 starts on <strong>Thursday, June 20</strong>.

<p id="wLws7c">The first new Push map in more than 20 months, Runasapi, will give players a new location to escort the robot across in season 11. Runasapi is set in the Peruvian Andes, and serves as support hero Ilari’s hometown. Here’s how Blizzard describes Runasapi, which will be available to play in Quick Play and Competitive this season:</p>
<blockquote><p id="Q3010q">Amble through marketplaces full of fresh produce and pay a visit to the Inti Warrior Historical Museum and Monument. This exciting Push map is vibrant and challenging as you escort TS-1 through tight streets. Watch out as some fights may take place precariously close to the steep cliffs overlooking the sunny farmlands below.</p></blockquote>
<p id="c6RHq7">Another Push map, Colosseo, is getting a slight rework, with changes to structures near spawns and the removal of glass barriers in the hallway at the center of the map.</p>

<p id="w4qBOJ">I hope you like Super Sentai styling, because season 11 is rife with bug-eyed heroes and Godzilla-adjacent skins for Genji, Reaper, Sojourn, Roadhog, Zenyatta, Wrecking Ball, and others. Mauga’s vacation look is also here as one of the skins included in the season 11 premium battle pass.</p>

Kiriko and Lifeweaver’s lifeguard skins are confirmed to be sold through the in-game shop.</p>

<p id="hRcFcX">In season 11, Blizzard will introduce a new type of Mythic cosmetic: Mythic Weapon Skins. First out of the gate is the Mythic Bound Demon Reinhardt weapon skin, coming July 23, which spruces up Reinhardt’s rocket hammer with the fury of a demon. Like Mythic hero skins, the new type of weapon skin costs 50 Mythic Prisms, with additional levels of customization unlocked with 10 Mythic Prisms. Upgrades include a weapon flourish emote, elimination visual effects, and reactive effects.</p>
<h3 id="lI5rAu"><strong>Hero reworks and Mastery Courses</strong></h3>
<p id="CPOIi3">Blizzard is buffing heroes across all three roles, but Cassidy is getting the biggest change of all. His Magnetic Grenade is going bye-bye and his Flashbang is coming back. The new version of Flashbang will slow enemies, rather than outright lockstun them.</p>
<p id="csBBHu">Kiriko and Soldier: 76 will get new Hero Mastery single-player courses in season 11, and players can take part in a limited-time challenge event with them from June 20 to July 9. Doing so will earn new rewards and up to 22,500 Battle Pass XP.</p>
<h3 id="TOaRB2"><strong>Summer Games 2024 and Transformers</strong></h3>
<p id="n1Satv">Both Summer Games and a mysterious new Transformers-themed collab come to <em>Overwatch 2</em> on July 9.</p>
<p id="xOa4bh">Here’s a quick visual guide to <em>Overwatch 2</em> season 11’s upcoming content roadmap.</p>
