            <p><strong>This story discusses the ending of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.</strong><em></em></p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi has said he deliberately intended for the game's ending - the fate of Aerith - to cause debate and keep players guessing until the trilogy's forthcoming conclusion.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Hamaguchi discussed fan reaction to the game's divisive ending and how he wanted to avoid fan service with its development.</p>
<p>"There was a danger there, there was definitely a trap," he said with regards to Aerith's fate. "With the original game, I was just a fan. I played the game when I was younger, and I've got my perspective on that scene as just a single fan. I felt if I made a decision - it has to go in this direction, we have to do it this way - that would very much make it a fan-driven thing. Maybe make it more like fan service. I kind of want to avoid doing that."</p>

<p>As a result, Hamaguchi took a backseat to the original creators - Tetsuya Nomura, Yoshinori Kitase, Kazushige Nojima - and instead shifted his focus to the presentation of their vision.</p>
<p>"Mr Kitase often says this," Hamaguchi continued, "that he really wanted to create that kind of debate and speculation after the game and moving through to the third game, that people keep talking about it up until they do see the final conclusion. In that sense I think we probably have achieved exactly what he wanted to do there and I'm very satisfied with that, because people are still talking about it."</p>
<p>Hamaguchi acknowledged a mixed reaction to the game's ending, but admitted "that's kind of the way we wanted it to go" to ensure discussion continued until the third game in the trilogy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aeriths-fate-in-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-the-trouble-with-remakes">controversial ending</a> is part of a continuous guessing game for players familiar with the original, though Hamaguchi remained tight-lipped on what will be changed in the third game.</p>
<p>"The important thing is that the player will wonder whether it's going to change or not," he said. "So if it was all exactly as it was in the original storyline, you'd know exactly what was coming: there'd be no anticipation, there'd be no excitement. For people who played the game, they'd know exactly what's coming next. It wouldn't really be a fun experience. It might be nostalgic, but it wouldn't be a fun experience."</p>

</figure>
<p>Hamaguchi notes the ending of Remake with the characters breaking the barriers of fate, the inclusion of the whispers, and Zack's alternate timeline in Rebirth as key moments to keep players wondering.</p>
<p>"The real purpose of these elements is to indicate to the player, this is where the story might change," he said. "It doesn't mean it <em>will</em> change, this is where it <em>could</em> change. You might see something new, you might see something different. And that really does help people to keep engaged with the story and keep having that wonder and that anticipation about what's coming next."</p><p>He continued: "I think that kind of divided opinion is something we were always going to get just because <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, the original game, was such a popular game, it's such a well known game that if we'd have completely left it as it was, not change anything, people wouldn't like that. And if we changed it completely, there'd be another set of people who wouldn't like that at all. So we really have to try and find a balance, I think, to try and satisfy as many people as possible.</p>
<p>"I really do want to continue with that level of fans looking at us [and asking] so how's it going to change? What's the ultimate conclusion of this story going to be? Is it going to be the same? Is it going to change? And to keep that level of excitement and anticipation up for the third game in the series. I think that's the job that we've set for ourselves."</p>
<blockquote>"Is it going to be the same? Is it going to change? And to keep that level of excitement and anticipation up for the third game in the series. I think that's the job that we've set for ourselves."</blockquote>
<p>I had to ask, then, considering the dominance of Aerith's fate to the narrative of Rebirth, is she or Cloud the real protagonist of Final Fantasy 7?</p>
<p>"The way I see it for both Remake and Rebirth is very much the story told from Cloud's perspective," said Hamaguchi. "He is the character you follow, and you see events from his eyes and perspective really. The game design for Rebirth, we set very early on in development as a core concept, the idea of the bonds between Cloud and his allies. So you definitely see things from the perspective of, how does this other party member relate to Cloud? How are their bonds becoming strengthened as they journey together, as they experience things together? I can very much say, for the first two games - Rebirth and Remake - up until then, it is all from Cloud's perspective."</p>

</figure>
<p>Lastly, Hamaguchi said he was "blown away" when he saw Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth running on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> for the first time. Sony's console was released earlier this month and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-on-ps5-pro-delivers-huge-image-quality-improvements-at-60fps">Rebirth is one of a handful of games to receive a significant visual improvement</a>.</p><p>"I think certainly that was one of the problems with using the PS5 base hardware, is that to try and get 60fps output with the same level of graphic fidelity and resolution as you have in the graphics mode was something that was just really, really difficult to achieve," he said.</p>
<p>"But certainly using the PSSR technology within the Pro, that really did allow us to do both at once and achieve both of those goals of the frame rate together with the resolution. I remember when I saw it for the first time, I really was blown away by it."</p>
<p>PlayStation hardware architect Mark Cerny also had a hand in which part of the game was shown at the PS5 Pro reveal. While Hamaguchi and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> development team wanted to show the grasslands region for its open world elements, Cerny had a different opinion. "He said 'no, we really want to see the Gold Saucer'," laughed Hamaguchi. "He really pushed to show the Gold Saucer. So ultimately that's the one we showed."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth leads this year's The Game Award nominations</a>, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, with seven nominations - including for Best Game, as well as Best Game Direction, and Best Narrative.</p>
<p>While it's unknown when the third and final part of the trilogy will be released, series producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-wont-betray-fans-of-the-original-says-series-producer">Kitase stated previously it won't "betray fans of the original"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Alongside displaying the time, day, and date, <a href="https://timestoptech.com/products/d-20-black-resin?variant=45891310125292">the Timestop D-20</a> includes all the dice-rolling features you need to play tabletop roleplaying games directly from your wrist at the push of a button.</p><p>The watch allows the wearer to digitally roll a 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, 20-, or 100-sided dice, alongside “Advanced Combat” features such as rolling up to 12 dice at once, and D20s with advantage or disadvantage (a fancy way of rolling two dice and taking either the higher or lower results). It’ll also display specific icons when a D20 rolls a 1 or a 20 — known as a “critical failure” or “critical success” respectively in D&amp;D.</p><p>“We wanted a fun animation while rolling, but also an overall subdued look so you could ‘take the game with you’ and even wear the watch at the office,” Timestop says in its <a href="https://timestoptech.com/blogs/super-twisted/dungeons-development-of-the-d-20-watch">blog describing the design process</a>. “We included day and date complications with a perpetual calendar so it was still a practical timepiece.”</p><p>Pricing starts at $99 and is available in three colors: <a href="https://timestoptech.com/collections/all">black, orange, and stainless steel</a>. Shipping starts next year, with stock available for delivery in either January or February.&nbsp;</p><p>One feature you won’t find on the Timestop D-20 is an alarm, because alarms “aren’t fun,” according to its creator. Otherwise, it’s water-resistant, features a backlit LCD display, and uses a replaceable coin cell battery that can last up to three years with “typical use.” I’m not sure how many fireball spells would be considered typical, but it certainly offers a more unique way to play than traditional dice or digital dice-rolling apps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Valve have unveiled a new policy about season passes on Steam, which aims to ensure that developers release all the individual DLC involved on time and share adequate details about each DLC pack in advance. It specifies that developers can delay release of a season pass DLC just once, and by no longer than three months. In the event that a developer postpones DLC release by longer than three months, Valve may take such corrective actions as removing the season pass from sale or refunding players.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
"By offering a Season Pass, you are promising future content," reads <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/seasonpass">the Steamworks post in question</a>, which was circulated on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xpaw.me/post/3lbfpzdgjdc23">Bluesky</a> (aka, Twitter 2010 Edition) by SteamDB.info creator Pavel Djundik last night. "In the process of launching a Season Pass you will be asked to commit to a launch timing for each content release in the Season Pass," it reads. "That launch timing is a commitment to both customers and Steam.
</p>
<p>
"If you aren't ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC AND when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn't offer a Season Pass on Steam," it goes on.
</p>
<p>
"Selling a Season Pass has risks; since you are promising the release of future content, you have to commit to completing that content on time. If customers don't like the content you're releasing in the Season Pass or the timing of that content release, that will be reflected in sales and reviews."
</p>
<p>
The post includes a set of required features for any season pass on Steam. Come feast your eyes upon these hot juicy bulletpoints:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- A complete list of all DLC included in the Pass. (i.e. listing each of the four DLCs included in a Pass).</p>
<p>- A basic description of the content that's included in each DLC. For example, the first content release might be "The Glitterlands Expansion - New area to explore, two new weapons, and new enemies." It's not required for the DLC to have a final name at the launch of the Season Pass. The information about the content in the DLC doesn't need to be detailed (simply "new weapons" or "two new weapons" is acceptable, they don't have to list the exact weapons).</p>
<p>- Expected release date for each DLC. Quarter and Year (i.e. January to March 2025) or Season/Year is acceptable. Of course, a date that's more precise is also fine (i.e. June, 2025 or June 1st, 2025).
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Valve add that a season pass should include at least one released DLC when it goes on sale, with the obvious exception of season passes sold as part of a pre-order.
</p>
<p>
As for delays on any DLC releases sold as part of a season pass, Valve will allow developers "to self-reschedule the release date one time only" by "up to 3 months later than you originally selected". If a DLC pack needs a longer extension, the creators will need to contact Valve directly and haggle it out.
</p><p>
In the event of DLC cancellations, Valve mandate that customers will be offered a refund for the value of unreleased DLC. The company may take action on any DLC delays of longer than three months, even if there hasn't been a customer complaint.
</p>
<p>
"Actions include removing the Season Pass from sale on Steam, refunding all customers who purchased the Season Pass for the value of unreleased DLC, or allowing customers the option of refunding the entire Season Pass," the post goes on. "For the purposes of refunds, the value of unreleased DLC will be decided in discussion with Valve."

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/chill-guy-meme-copyrighted-creator/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98chill-guy%E2%80%99-meme-has-been-copyrighted-by-the-creator.1041453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/chill-guy-meme-copyrighted-creator/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’ve been anywhere on social media in the last few days, you might have seen a new meme called ‘Chill Guy’. It has been represented by some of the biggest brands in gaming, such as Call of Duty, and parodies of it have appeared all over TikTok and Twitter.</p>



<p>It’s a brilliant and lighthearted meme that many are enjoying worldwide, but the creator of the character used in the meme has suddenly announced a copyright action. He stressed on social media that he’ll start issuing takedowns against certain profiles using the image ‘over the next few days’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-not-very-chill">That’s Not Very Chill</h2>



<p>On Twitter, @PhillipBankss shared an image of a cartoon dog in 2023. This character mulled around on social media for a while before skyrocketing as a viral meme image just days ago. For some reason, influencers and cryptocurrency brands got their hands on the image and started using it in a series of parodies to promote their products.</p>



<p>That’s the source of the creator’s anger, and it’s why the image has been copyrighted.</p>



<p>He admitted on Twitter that not everyone will feel the brunt of his takedown notices:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>just putting it out there, chill guy has been copyrighted. like, legally. I’ll be issuing takedowns on for-profit related things over the next few days</p>



<p>not like brand accounts using him as a trend, that’s kinda something i dont really care about (i do just ask for credit. or xboxes.). mainly unauthorized merchandise and shitcoins</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the meme goes, a brand or a creator will use the image with a caption reading ‘something, something, but you’re just a chill something’. It’s tough to explain, so here’s an example from Halo:</p>



<p><em>When Master Chief trades you his plasma pistol for your rocket launcher but you’re just a chill marine:</em></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>I’m getting old and appreciate memes less and less, but this one still makes sense to me.</p>



<p>To give PhillipBankss credit, he revealed that his social feeds and DMs were being spammed by crypto shills and at times nefarious brands using his image to get in on the trend and traffic. That’s who he aims to target with this copyright action, and the run-of-the-mill users sharing it on social and content platforms won’t be impacted.</p>

<p>STALKER 2 is finally here after more than a decade of on-and-off development, and it’s turning heads worldwide. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my review</a>, I rated STALKER 2 with a 9 out of 10 score, and many other publications have echoed that sentiment. Others, not so much – STALKER 2 is proving to be an extremely divisive game within the wider community.</p>



<p>On social, streaming, and gaming platforms, the entire STALKER franchise is undergoing a boost in popularity thanks to the launch of STALKER 2, which has been met with mixed opinions.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-they-re-not-bugs-they-re-anomalies">They’re Not Bugs, They’re Anomalies</h2>



<p>One of the most common pieces of feedback being levelled against STALKER 2 is that it’s riddled with bugs and performance issues. That’s not untrue, but it’s not as bad as people are making out. As someone who put 30 hours into a pre-release version of the game, I’ll say quite transparently that users have <strong>no idea </strong>the number of issues that GSC Game World patched out ahead of launch.</p>



<p>STALKER 2 will get better with time, and when modders step in to help GSC, the timescale for those improvements will be dramatically shortened.</p>



<p>On Twitch, <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/29106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">STALKER 2 saw massive growth</a> at launch, hitting a peak viewer count of 415,708 users. By comparison, Bethesda Game Studios’ Starfield, which before it was released was one of the most anticipated games in many years, hit a peak viewer count of 552,000 little more than a year ago.</p>



<p>On Steam, every STALKER game has seen a player gain in the last 30 days. </p>



<p>For instance, STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl has racked up a 40% growth in players, while Call of Pripyat has soared by 37%.</p>



<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl managed to pull in a peak player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1643320/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">113,587 on Steam alone</a>, but it’s widely expected that the figure will be doubled or tripled on Xbox and PC (Game Pass). STALKER 2 is free on the popular subscription-based platform, and that’s where the bulk of the game’s players will likely come from.</p>



<p>Despite the mixed opinions on social media, STALKER 2 really isn’t doing so badly.</p>



<p>It has 80.5% positive reviews on Steam, and on Metacritic, it has secured a score of 74 overall. That’s below the predictions, but it’s not at all representative of what one critic wrote: <em>‘Sadly, Stalker 2 is, by far, the most unstable game we have reviewed in a long time.’</em></p>



<p>GSC Game World has already emerged on social media promising that the repair work to patch up the game as much as possible will be ongoing in earnest to smooth out the rough edges of the release version. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review.1041444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>In the earlier days of the internet, when social media wasn’t in everyone’s hands and gaming was niche and nerdy, some of the best video games were gatekept secrets and whispers on message boards. This rang particularly true for games from Japan or Europe, that often got overlooked by mainstream media. For years as a teen on the web, one game series in particular that felt like legend was STALKER. People would simply talk differently about these games, treating them like immersive experiences where you don’t just beat a level or complete a quest, you live in The Zone, and you become a Stalker. Now, with the first new entry in the series since 2009 and my first real foray into the franchise, I can tell you that all those stories were true. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> is immersive, and frightening, and hilarious, and magical, and intense, and unlike pretty much anything else out there.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKO4PL8Xzik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker">STALKER</a> series owes its inspiration to societ scifi novel Roadside Picnic and the loosely related film adaptation by Andrei Tarkovsky. In the wake of 1986 Chornobyl nuclear reactor disaster, STALKER paints the picture of an alternate history where a 2nd disaster rocked the Exclusion Zone decades later in 2006. This has warped the entire region from a barely inhabitable wasteland to a truly alien world.</p>


<p>Mutated creatures stalk through the bushes, while sudden emission storms turn the sky and rip the earth apart. And then there are the anomalies – environmental oddities like psionic whirlwinds or chutes of fire that can shred you in an instant if you aren’t careful. Stalkers are dedicated wanderers and survivors who may not share ideals or allegiances, but all take part in overcoming the odds of The Zone to track down artefacts, make a little money, and strive to see another day.</p>


<p>This is all the narrative setup that truly matters to the overarching experience. In STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the game will attempt to paint you into the box of a man named Skif, who works as a Stalker to investigate the truth behind a unique artefact he uncovered after his old family home was destroyed. His story is fine, it’s okay, but what makes this game truly special is turning it into your own story, though. Like the freedom that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/10/19/review-fallout-new-vegas/">Fallout: New Vegas</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/05/baldurs-gate-3-review-ps5-pc/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> give you in crafting your own protagonist and filling the moments in-between dialogue with your own role-played lore, this game provides that same kind ofcanvas. However, you aren’t just painting it with dialogue options or character builds – your story is told through moments of survival.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 is relentless, but combat is just one part of the tense tapestry it weaves. Gunfights can be fast and brutal. When you fight humans, they’re fragile, and so are you. A lined-up headshot can cause a bandit to crumble on the spot, but a bullet to your back can take you out just as quickly if you aren’t careful. Meanwhile, packs of dogs will upturn your plans at the worst possible time, every time. Mutated rats and invisible monsters will soak up your bullets and leave you drained of resources. Every moment of existing in The Zone is a calculated struggle, yet it never feels like an artificial challenge like so many other survival games do. You aren’t managing arbitrary hunger and thirst meters or idly gathering wood and stone – there is a constant direct connection between your survival needs and what is happening on-screen, and it is incredible.</p>

<p>As you learn what it takes to survive in The Zone, you’ll start to dig deeper into the overarching storyline of Heart of Chornobyl. While Skif’s personal journey is easy to ignore, there is a massive conflict brewing in the world between multiple factions that you quickly find yourself embroiled in – your choices on which sides to trust or not trust will leave a lasting impact on your playthrough. After one moment of siding with a group of Zone-revering Stalkers called Spark, I found myself in multiple situations where I would be attacked on-sight by their direct rivals, The Ward. On one of those occasions, though, a crew of Spark-affiliated Stalkers was nearby and helped me turn the tide on battle. Afterwards, I walked up to one of them, he offered to sell me items and boasted about “only having the good shit”, and I opened his inventory to see him selling two beers and a sausage. My man.</p>
<p>There’s an undercurrent of comedy to STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl – the improvisational nature of the world and it’s inhabitants and how they all interact can toggle between frightening immersion and gut-busting hilarity in a moment. I love that, and I think we all need that. When you take into account the real-life circumstances faced by the Ukrainian development team behind this game, it’s easy to see how the unique charm of The Zone might be something that they really need right now, too.</p>

<p>Part of the comedy of errors that tends to play out in this game also comes from a litany of literal errors and bugs – the series’ reputation for being buggy continues. Some are hilarious visual oddities, like a mutated rat flying into the sky after I knifed it. Other bugs can be boring technical frustrations, though. Most of these bugs contributed to the charm of the world as I played the review build of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. A day one patch larger than the game itself arrived after I wrapped up my time with the game, and notes fixes many of these silly or frustrating bugs.</p>
<p>Even without those fixes, though, Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is like almost nothing else out there. It’s full of charm in so many different flavors, and is a visual feast on top of that. It’s a new bold path for survival games and shooters that I never want to turn back from.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/off-the-grid-600k-tournament-ended/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Off The Grid, an all-new battle royale game splitting opinions everywhere has already held a massive tournament. Yesterday, 60 of North America’s most popular streamers dived into Off The Grid to win a portion of a $600,000 prize pool. It’s almost unheard of that a game so early in the development cycle hosts such a large tournament, but that’s crypto money for you, I guess.</p>



<p>By the time the dust had settled, a diverse roster of squads had picked up some sizeable prizes in Off The Grid’s All-Stars Invitational. The winners included retired Call of Duty pro players, Fortnite streamers, and the single biggest names in content creation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-backed-by-the-blockchain">Backed by the Blockchain</h2>



<p>Off The Grid has been splitting the community down the middle since it surfaced several weeks ago.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that Off The Grid is backed by blockchain technology and has heavy investment from cryptocurrency-focused firms, and that has been a sticking point with players everywhere. It’s a solid game, but the connection with crypto has been a hard pill for many to swallow, and that’s why the game is struggling to gain traction.</p>



<p>If it wasn’t for the developer stuffing the scene with money and prolific events like the All-Stars Invitational, Off The Grid would likely be passing under the radar.</p>



<p>During the recent tournament, 60 players entered the running in teams of three, with each game (of six) boasting a prize worth $60,000 for the top team, $20,000 for second place, and $10,000 for third-placed teams. Gunzilla, the game’s developer, has wasted no time enticing players to the platform with daily tournaments and cash prizes all over the place.</p>



<p>Here’s how it all went down, winners-wise:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Game 1</strong>: Team IceManIsaac</li>



<li><strong>Game 2: </strong>Team IceManIsaac</li>



<li><strong>Game 3: </strong>Team Holly</li>



<li><strong>Game 4: </strong>Team Huskerrs</li>



<li><strong>Game 5: </strong>Team IceManIsaac</li>



<li><strong>Game 6: </strong>Team IceManIsaac</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a trend there, I think.</p>



<p>Team IceManIsaac was represented by the man himself, Skullface, and Aydan, some of the best battle players and champions in the world. Aydan has long been a superstar streamer in the Warzone space, and Skullface has claimed wins in the World Series of Warzone, so they’re well-placed to dominate any battle royale game like Off The Grid.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s right that Gunzilla is trying to ‘buy an audience’ with Off The Grid? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It doesn't do much beyond what the original did, but advancements in technology have enhanced its anomalous strengths, breathing new life into its massive open world and the ways in which you and everything around you can interact with it."</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Several of the biggest games of 2024 are also on sale right now, if you’re looking to prepare yourself for a festive season gaming binge.

While it feels somewhat alien to use at first, leverless fight sticks are becoming very popular with professional fighting game players as these can help pull off tricky moves in games more reliably. As for colors, there are two options here, depending on your tastes.</p><p dir="ltr">Both models have Sanwa Denshi 30mm buttons, a removable Sanwa Densi Ball-top joystick on the regular model, and a foam lap pad for comfortable gaming sessions. You can also open them up for when you want to do some customization or cleaning, and since they're made from a single piece of aircraft-grade aluminum, they can easily survive a turbulent trip to Las Vegas for the next Evo tournament. If you'd prefer something nondescript, you can pick up one of these fight sticks in a crisp PS5-style white, or for something flashier, there's a bright purple finish.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Victrix Pro FS fight stick (PS5/PS4/PC)</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3VRDML3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a> -- $320 ($<del>400</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3VQXXJR?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Purple</a> -- $320 ($<del>400</del>)</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Victrix Pro FS-12 leverless fight stick (PS5/PS4/PC)</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3VP2M12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a> -- $320 ($<del>400</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3VQKGHW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Purple</a> -- $320 ($<del>400</del>)</li></ul><hr><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, you can also check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCX2DMXV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Kitsune</a>. This is a bit more affordable at $270 (was $300), and depending on your preferences, it might be superior to the Victrix Pro.

It’s shaped like a musical note, and in this case, it’s painted to look like Kirby. You play the instrument by sliding your finger into different positions on its neck, while opening Kirby’s mouth will alter the sound. The instrument is also built with a 3.5mm jack, allowing you to connect it to headphones or speakers. It’s a quirky gadget--and it might take some time to master--but just about anyone should be able to pick it up and have fun with its charming sounds.</p>                      </div><p>The Deluxe edition includes an exclusive Kirby Strap to help you find a comfortable playing position and an instruction manual to teach you the basics. The keychain edition isn’t quite as elaborate as the other two models, as you’ll just be pressing a button to the rhythm to make one of its many songs play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ranked-play-cheaters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Ops 6 Ranked Play has been added to the game in record time, and to the chagrin of competitive players worldwide, it’s already packed full of cheaters. On social media, clips have surfaced from pro players and streamers revealing them being matched against stacked hackers disrupting the game for everyone else – as always.</p>



<p>It took one day for cheaters to throw Black Ops 6 Ranked Play off the rails.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-time">Every Time</h2>



<p>Every time Activision’s studios release a ranked mode in a Call of Duty game, it’s infested with hackers.</p>



<p>For those not in the know, Ranked Play is a competitive ecosystem with more restrictions, a tighter map and mode rotation, and more rewards than regular, non-ranked multiplayer playlists. Players relish the opportunity to dive into Ranked Play as it allows them to unlock exclusive operator skins, calling cards, and more.</p>



<p>It’s also a breeding ground for cheaters, for some reason. Typically, the highest echelons of the Ranked Play leaderboard are reserved exclusively for cheaters, who year in, year out fly under the radar of Team RICOCHET’s anti-cheat mechanics.</p>



<p>It’s getting better, but it’s <strong>far </strong>from being perfect.</p>



<p>Chris ‘Parasite’ Duarte, one of Call of Duty’s first world champions, posted on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS</strong> EVERY GAME WHERE IS THE ANTI CHEAT TREYARCH</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last season’s CDL world champion, Dashy, posted a video of him slamming teams full of cheaters in Ranked Play, and Simp, one of the best Call of Duty players in the world, was sharing comments on Twitter about the trademarks of BO6 cheaters.</p>



<p>It seems like Ranked Play in Black Ops 6 is already cooked, and it’s another year back-to-back that cheaters have completely ruined the mode.</p>

Brave the arena alone or team up in matches of up to eight players.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Weapons Live, Lights Out</strong> – <em>Blindfire</em> is an online multiplayer first-person shooter. Set in a shadowy underworld, the ultra-wealthy bet on illicit bloodsports beneath a neon skyline. For contestants lured by the promise of untold riches and unimaginable glory, it’s kill or be killed.</li><li><strong>Every Kill Counts</strong> – Brave the arena alone or team up in matches of up to eight players. In Bodycount mode, score the most points over five rapid-fire rounds. Be the last person standing when the lights come on and earn your place in the winner’s showcase.</li><li><strong>Danger Lurks in the Dark</strong> – Light is a rarity in close-quarter arenas riddled with traps for intense firefights. Players must decide where and when to fire at the risk of exposing their position. Hone your senses with the room-scanning Echo mechanic to help you navigate the arena and locate your opponents.</li><li><strong>Revenge Under the Blacklights</strong> – When defeated, spectators gain access to the arena’s cutting-edge night vision cameras. Blacklight reveals the vibrant hues of hidden street art and transforms the slick designs of contestants’ outfits. The eliminated spectators can assume control of traps in the arena to influence the outcome of the match and exact revenge.</li><li><strong>Light Them Up</strong> – The pitch-black battlefields of <em>Blindfire</em> turn the first-person shooter genre on its head. Stalk the shadows as the tension builds, then run for cover as the shots start flying in a volley of muzzle flashes. Think you’ve got what it takes to eliminate the competition in <em>Blindfire</em>? Then grab your weapon and LIGHT THEM UP.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PlayStation 5 Early Access Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="BLINDFIRE - PlayStation Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNgKTcssaR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The show doesn’t directly follow the plot of the novels, but does reunite the cast of the 2010 live-action adaptation to voice their movie characters in the series. <em>Kotaku</em>’s Kenneth Shepard called it a  “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-netflix-ramona-backlash-1851043407&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-netflix-ramona-backlash-1851043407">hilarious blend of the [franchise’s] quick wit and well-measured pop culture references</a></span>.” But sadly, the series won’t be getting a second season. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859334007319822535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859334007319822535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 20</a></span>, to mark the one-year anniversary of the premiere of <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</em>, series creator O’Malley tweeted that it was “an honor to work with all of the cast &amp; staff around the world”  and called the series “a one of a kind miracle.” The creator also confirmed that Netflix had recently passed on a second season of the animated adaption. </p><p>“Anyway, we were recently informed that the show will not return,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859336990405296142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859336990405296142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said O’Malley</a></span>. “As you know, we only intended one season, and called in a lot of favors to make it happen, so making more would have been nearly impossible. Still, I know some of you have been holding out hope.” </p><p>“Sorry to all Matthew fans and Gideon fans, I know you will suffer the most,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859337323307262361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859337323307262361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added O’Malley in a follow-up</a></span> to the tweet confirming the news that there would be no second season. </p><p>While some fans were upset with the Netflix show and how much it deviated from the original graphic novels, many others were happy to get a new story featuring these characters. For now, it seems that’s the end of this chapter of the franchise, despite a post-credits scene included in the final episode of <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. </em></p><p><em>&nbsp;.</em><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While no one associated with the episode explicitly tells us what happens that makes it so bloody, the descriptions we have gotten may be enough to give us a hint. Executive producer Dave Wilson says, “Pac-Man is Joe Pesci and the swordsman is Guy Pearce in <em>Memento.” </em>Seeing how Pesci almost exclusively plays homicidal hotheads, and Guy Pearce strangles a man to death in <em>Memento</em>, the 10-minute <em>Pac-Man</em> episode may just live up to its bloody hype if that comparison holds true. </p><p>As surprised as you may feel about a violent <em>Pac-Man</em> story, the people behind it point out how the original game isn’t all that innocent. JT Petty, teleplay writer of the <em>Pac-Man</em> episode, describes the game as essentially “eating pills in a labyrinth while you’re being chased by ghosts,” in a world where the ghosts’ eyes return to the center of the game to regenerate and repeat the destructive cycle. </p><p>When you look at <em>Pac-Man</em> that way, you can see how there could be a darker side to it; a darker side we’ll have our still-attached-to-our-heads eyes glued to when the episode releases in December.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-have-made-their-own-battle-format-that-bans-ex-monsters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Don't bring an EX to a NOEX fight.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon TCG Pocket continues to be ridiculously popular, but in the early days of the game there are only a limited number of ways to engage with other players. Trading still hasn't been released yet, and battling only has one regular format that lets you start a match with a friend, or a random player. So in order to spice things up, the community is coming up with its own workarounds, including a brand new battle format that's been very well-received so far: NOEX.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"NOEX" is a battle format with one simple rule: no EX Pokemon allowed. EX Pokemon, if you're unfamiliar, are ultra-powerful monsters that are very difficult to defeat, but which award two points upon destruction as opposed to just one. Due to their sheer power, most good meta decks in Pocket are built around at least one EX card, and the end result is that you tend to run into a lot of the same decks over and over when you engage in random battles. For the last month or so, for instance, I've been playing a deck that revolves around Pikachu EX, and have been fighting a lot of Mewtwo EX, Charizard EX, and Starmie EX.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But in NOEX, all those cards are banned, which forces players to build decks around other Pokemon for some interesting combos. For this article, I engaged in a couple of NOEX battles myself. In one match I faced a Butterfree/Dugtrio stall deck that I'd never seen before that decimated my army of Nidoran, and in another I barely scraped out a win against a wacky Dragonite/Weezing combo thanks to a lucky final draw. It's a fun format if you want to shake things up a bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, NOEX exists on an honor system. There's no way to officially create your own battle formats in Pocket just yet, so players have created this by word-of-mouth. If you want to join a NOEX battle, simply select "Private Match" under battles, and use "NOEX" as the password. But you're essentially on your honor to use a deck with no EX Pokemon, as there's nothing in the system to stop you. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gvrqsl/ah_yeah_thats_the_kind_of_opener_you_want_to_see/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players are already complaining about opponents bringing EX Pokemon to a NOEX fight</a> and ruining their fun - an unfortunate hazard of a community-created format.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/screenshot-2024-11-20-143838-1732135159067.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: /u/Boomerhands420 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gvryhu/noex_format_is_insanely_fun/">Reddit</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it sounds like NOEX is otherwise going pretty well. Community members are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gvryhu/noex_format_is_insanely_fun/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">praising it on Reddit</a>, and while my personal experience is limited, the speed with which I was able to get into matches with others who were respecting the format indicates this might have legs. It also sounds like some players are suggesting other types of formats that can be done in the same way, such as only allowing a single EX card per deck, or no decks considered by the community to be "S-tier."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully, it won't be long before we start to see new features creep in that will hopefully eliminate the need for the community to invent stuff to do. We've already learned that there's a "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-more-booster-packs-before-2025">major update</a>" coming in the near future that will include trading, and new booster packs on the way will hopefully spice up the meta a bit as well. Given how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-made-120-million-in-3-weeks">wildly popular TCG Pocket is</a>, the updates can't come fast enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
