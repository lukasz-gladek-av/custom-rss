			<p>Bungie's revived franchise, Marathon, hasn't experienced the smoothest development phase, to say the least. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> in May 2023, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to 2025 partly because of Bungie's layoffs.</p>
<p>In 2024, news spread that Game Director Christopher Barrett had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fired</a> for misconduct and would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> by the former Valorant Game Director, Joe Ziegler. That's also when insiders like Tom Henderson started relaying negative vibes about the game's future from their sources.</p>
<p>Last month, Bungie suddenly <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a release date, setting Marathon to debut on September 23, 2025 while also showing off more gameplay footage. However, just last week, another scandal erupted: Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the game had used assets taken without permission from artist Antireal. They admitted their fault, said the assets would be removed, and added that they would 'make things right' with the artist, presumably through some sort of compensation.</p>
<p>It is amid this uneasy climate that the rumor of a potential Marathon delay lands very loudly. In the latest episode of his Sacred Symbols + podcast (currently paywalled <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-129769084?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_fan&amp;utm_content=web_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Patreon</a>), former IGN journalist Colin Moriarty claimed:</p>
<p><em>I was told by someone familiar with marketing plans in a key overseas market that there are now no plans to do paid marketing for Marathon at all. I don't know if those plans were affected by what has recently happened or if that was always the plan or whatever, but it is considered a fairly unusual move for a game of this high profile.</em></p>
<p>Of course, readers should take this information with a big grain of salt for the time being. We'll have to wait until we hear from Sony. One thing is for certain, though: neither Sony nor Bungie can afford another live service failure. Sony already had the fallout of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord's $200 million failed expenditure</a>, not to mention the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancellation of The Last of Us Online</a>, while Bungie suffered several rounds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoffs</a> and recently had former developers openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking out against the studio's leadership</a>. If the delay can help, it's definitely the right choice.</p>
<p>Marathon will be launched on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X with full cross-play between all platforms. The sci-fi first-person PvP extraction shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't be a full-priced title</a>, so it should be priced around $40 or $50 at the most.</p>

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>You’ll be able to use a USB mouse with the Nintendo Switch 2 in at least one game, as a Koei Tecmo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CstlgmcDgy0&amp;t=623s">developer commentary video</a> for the upcoming<em> Nobunaga’s Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition</em> revealed this week. That’s great news if your wrists, like mine, started preemptively cramping the first time you saw video of someone tipping a Joy-Con 2 controller on its edge for mouse mode.</p><p>While demonstrating the game’s use of the Joy-Con 2 as a mouse, producer Michi Ryu stops and plugs in a USB mouse. The Switch 2 displays a message that says a mouse has been connected, and he continues to play with both a mouse and his left Joy-Con 2, switching between them seamlessly, the same way you’ll be able to go back and forth between gyro and mouse control <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">in <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-supports-usb-mouse-controls-developer-reveals/"><em>VideoGamesChronicle</em> notes</a>, the original Switch had mouse and keyboard support, though only some games took advantage, like the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fturok-switch%2F" rel="sponsored">Nightdive-developed <em>Turok</em> port</a>. (If you own that game and never noticed the “Mouse” option in its input settings, go plug in a USB mouse and keyboard and try it out — you won’t want to go back.)</p><p>This time around, Nintendo is embracing mouse support more. For instance, the company published a video to its Nintendo Today app earlier this month, showing that when you put a Joy-Con 2 on its edge for mouse mode, an onscreen pointer appears for navigating the system’s menu.</p><p>So does the <em>Nobunaga’s Ambition</em> video, mean a standard mouse works interchangeably with a Joy-Con 2 controller anywhere where mouse control is supported? I sure hope so, but we don’t know that yet. And Nintendo didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s email asking if that was the case.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Almost a year on from its initial release, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a> version 2.0 has been announced, slated for release next month on June 6th. There's a lot coming in this new update, namely a new area to head to, the Waifei Peninsula, a "remote yet vibrant district of New Eridu." The story follows on from where the Sacrifice crisis was left off in previous chapters, seeing you "uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon and experience new Hollow exploration gameplay that harnesses the forces of Ether."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You'll be able to wander around a new city, Failume Heights, which is filled with things like dessert stalls, tea houses, and pawnshops. Getting around this new city, and the original map, should be a bit easier too, as the 3D navigation system will be receiving an overhaul, with an added mini-map to help you keep track of where you are. Exploring Hollows will work slightly differently too, as there are new perception techniques that let you do things like finding clues to follow the flow of Ether.

<p>
What essentially looks like a 3D platformer minigame has been added in too where you play as Eous through different levels to gather up Star Anchor Data. An entire management minigame has been added in too where you get to run your own Suibian Temple. Here you send Bangboo out to explore to find different goods to sell.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of this, you'll also be able to change your Proxies' outfit, take part in a mech-battle event, take part in a new agent story, unlock new W-Engines, and a lot more. You can take a look at the teaser trailer above for more specifics.
</p>
<p>
There will, as is typical of many gacha games, be anniversary benefits like free pulls and a free standard S-Rank agent, plus some giveaways too. Seems a bit overwhelming to be honest, but in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> like this with the kind of character designs that it has, being overwhelmed almost seems like the whole point.

You know what the main thing that's holding me back from picking up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> at launch is? The fact it doesn't have an option for duos. For the most part I'm a single-player only kind of person, and when I play something online I normally like to do so with just my partner. I imagine I'm not the only person this applies to, nor am I likely to be the only one who thought "I don't really want some rando called xX_fartmaster_Xx third wheeling my partner and me." Luckily, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> seem to be at least considering a two-player option for the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Game director Junya Ishizaki recently spoke with IGN about the things he learned under <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s director Hidetaka Miyazaki. It's a great interview, but the main thing we're concerned with here is Ishizaki's comments on not having a two-player option. When asked why the option was omitted, Ishizaki quite plainly said that "the simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that. 
</p>
<p>
"As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start."
</p>
<p>
Ishizaki went on to say that the team put a lot of effort into making something enjoyable and playable for solo players. However, because they were so focused on that, they "kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect." However! The director did also say that a duos mode "is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."
</p>
<p>
Considering it is good enough for me for now! Here's hoping the update comes before that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-an-elden-ring-film-on-the-way-from-alex-garland-and-george-r-r-martin">Elden Ring movie that's in the works</a> that I'm pretending doesn't exist.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-living-things-is-a-stop-motion-artbook-puzzle-game-based-on-a-600-year-old-alchemical-manuscript<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Have you ever immediately wishlisted a game on Steam based on aesthetics alone? I ask because that's just happened to me with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/all-living-things">All Living Things</a>, a stop-motion game inspired by The Ripley Scroll, a 15th-century alchemical manuscript. Doesn't that just seem like a guaranteed feast for the eyes? Developer MOXO self-describes it as an "animated art-book <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game", which feels perfectly apt for it. The general presentation is simple, this strange, alluring art book on a black background waiting for you to click around.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's apparently 12 puzzles to solve in total, "each reflecting a stage in the alchemical process." You have to select certain parts of the art book to set certain sequences in motion, resulting in some wonderfully tactile looking animations. The wild thing is that despite looking like real, hand-made claymation, <a href="https://x.com/stvulture/status/1907275427770400777">it's all been digitally sculpted</a>. You could have fooled me quite easily into believing otherwise if I hadn't confirmed it for myself.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Discover the secrets of alchemical processes, the hidden secrets of world and even deeper secrets hidden within us…</p><p>All Living Things has a steampage, wishlist to be notified for the upcoming early demo!<a href="https://t.co/A68GqHk0o2">https://t.co/A68GqHk0o2</a> <a href="https://t.co/D3xJDSLRI2">pic.twitter.com/D3xJDSLRI2</a></p></div>— 𝖘𝖆𝖎𝖓𝖙 𝖛𝖚𝖑𝖙𝖚𝖗𝖊 (@stvulture) <a href="https://twitter.com/stvulture/status/1925525849022857381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
I'm not entirely sure how the puzzles work, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681340/All_Living_Things/">Steam page</a> for the game is suitably vague and cryptic, hinting at how you'll be able to figure it all out but not quite laying things in front of you. There's no release date for the game just yet, not even a release window. That's ok with me, as a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681490/All_Living_Things_Demo/">demo is due out June 10th</a>, meaning it won't be long before I can try and suss out what exactly this strange artbook game wants from me.
</p>
<p>
The thing that appeals most of all to me, outside of its aesthetic sensibilities, is that it's quite plain about there only being 12 puzzles. It really sounds like a game you could just spend your evenings ticking away at, figuring them all out in small doses, with the end quite close in sight. Love a game that knows when to stop, will definitely be checking this one out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/journey-together-pokemon-card-prices-are-crashing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I wanted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-etb-amazon-in-stock">Journey Together</a> to hit big. After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-20-2025">Surging Sparks</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-restock-prismatic-evolutions-surprise-boxes-amazon">Prismatic Evolutions</a> delivered some real heat, it felt like we were on a roll. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But instead of a clean three-hit combo, this set tripped over itself on the way out the gate. Prices were inflated from the start, and now that the market has had time to breathe, this correction is aggressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s still a solid set. Great art, fun pulls, some nostalgic hits. But a lot of the single prices were built on hype that couldn’t hold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collectors thought we’d get another round of rapid value climbs. That didn’t happen. If you're buying now, you're catching cards on the way down instead of riding them on the way up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just go in knowing what’s worth grabbing and what’s still floating on leftover launch-day fumes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Illustration Rares</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Articuno had a strong start. Prices hit $55 back in late March, which made sense at the time—it's a fan-favorite Legendary with great artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, it’s taken a 36% dip and now floats around $35. Honestly, that’s still a bit high. I’ve seen near-mint listings at $18.69, and that feels more in line with where this card belongs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think it’s a solid pickup if you just want a great-looking bird without the early adopter tax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wailord was one of those early hype Illustration Rares that got pumped fast, mostly because it’s Wailord and people have a soft spot for absurdly large water types. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It hit $60 at the end of March, which didn’t last long. It’s now dropped 63.66% to a market value of around $22.49, and I’ve seen copies listed for as low as $14.55. Personally, I think this one’s due for a soft bounce back to $30, but only once the panic listings clear out and the Wailord fans circle back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite Illustration Rare is N’s Reshiram. The artwork is top-tier, and the character pairing actually adds something meaningful to the card. It started at $39.43, which honestly didn’t feel too far off given the demand at launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now it’s sitting around $17.44. Even the Journey Together stamped variant, which you'd think would carry some extra value, is undercutting the regular one at about $14. That’s a 79.51% drop, and in my opinion, a steal. If you want a chase card without paying chase prices, this is the one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Special Illustration Rare And Hyper Rares</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/pixel-9-2025-05-09t103754-924-1746783490499.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lillie’s Clefairy ex SIR was positioned as the face of the set, and for a moment it looked like it might stay there. Prices hit $400, which was wild, considering the only thing more expensive than that in Journey Together was probably regret. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now it’s sitting around $180 and in my opinion, it’s still too high. It’s a gorgeous card, no doubt about that, but I think we’ll see it hit $150 soon. Not a crash but a correction to something a little more in line with what most people are willing to pay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I thought Iono’s Bellibolt ex SIR was going to be the top card of the set. It had the rarity, it had the character, and it looked just chaotic enough to become a fan favorite. Instead, it’s hovering around $80, which is fine. Not great, not terrible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The price feels stable, and I don’t think it's going to tank like some of the other launch-day hype magnets. If you like it, grab it. If you're hoping it doubles in value, maybe take a walk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salamence ex SIR is probably the best example of what went wrong with Journey Together’s early pricing. At launch, people were paying up to $250 for it like it was the last dragon card ever printed. Now it’s going for about $106, and I think it’ll settle closer to $100. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still expensive, sure, but at least now it’s priced like a high-tier chase card and not a collector’s retirement plan. The art’s strong, and Salamence has always had staying power, so I think this one holds up better than most.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Full Arts</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Iono’s Bellibolt ex is my favorite full art, mostly because I pulled it and immediately convinced myself I was sitting on gold. At launch, it was going for around $80. It's now comfortably sitting in the $7–$8 range. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, if you paid anything above $15, I don’t know what to tell you. It’s a great-looking card, though, and I think it’ll stick around this price for a while now that the dust has settled. Just maybe don’t buy it thinking it's the next Supporter-tier Iono.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lightyear-frontier">Lightyear Frontier</a> launched into early access a little over a year ago, and it generally seems to have trudged along reasonably well since then. It's not quite ready for 1.0 just yet, but a new update was announced by developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/frame-break">Frame Break</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/amplifier-studios">Amplifier Studios</a> earlier this week that sounds like it'll be bringing in some much needed changes.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Appropriately titled the Shifting Gears Update, there's two big things it's changing. For one, the world itself is about to get a lot bigger. The devs explained that while a lot of people liked the "lush nature of the game world," it was also just a bit too small. So, the map is increasing in size for "large-scale farming", with the main progression system receiving a rework for "higher emphasis on farming." 
</p>
<p>
Hazards like tornadoes have been added in too to make getting around this bigger world a bit more challenging (but you can also just turn that off if you're just in it to relax).
</p>
<p>
Plus, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1677110/view/512957645996427407">as previously mentioned by the devs</a>, the narrative is getting reworked, namely mostly cutting out the character PIP-3R as a constant voice in your ear. Jay Castello called this one quite accurately in their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lightyear-frontier-early-access-review">early access review</a> of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sim</a> last year. 
</p>
<p>
The narrative isn't going away completely, and PIP-3R may appear again further down the line. But for now the way you'll learn about the story is through Inspection Points, which are just bits of flavour text that appear in certain areas, and Artifacts Findings, which are also just bits of flavour text from artifacts you find.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, there's a lot more features coming like a new mod chip system to upgrade your mech, automated drone watering, and a lot more. You can check out the full list of additions over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1677110/view/512958914879291494?l=english">Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Shifting Gears update isn't too far away either, as it's currently due out June 4th, just under a couple of weeks away.

            <p>We should all know by now that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Joy-Cons feature a mouse sensor, but we've also just learned that Nintendo's new system will also support USB mice, too.</p>
<p>As shared in a video by Koei Tecmo, and transcribed by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-supports-usb-mouse-controls-developer-reveals/">VGC</a>, Nobunaga’s Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition producer Michi Ryu showed off how a mouse can be used on the new system, demonstrating the feature by using both the built-in mouse and a USB one plugged into the console.</p>
<p>You can watch it for yourself in the video below:</p>
<figure>

<p>"The functionality is the same as the already released Steam version, allowing for left click, right click and wheel operations," Ryu said as he moved the Joy-Con's analogue stick up and down, as though wheeling a mouse scroll button. He also illustrated how the left Joy-Con 2 can also be used at the same time to access shortcuts.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ryu then showed the same functionality using the same left Joy-Con 2 shortcuts, but by using a USB mouse instead. Each time he changed input devices, there was a message on the screen confirming the change.</p>
<p>On its debut, the Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-gamechat-function-includes-welcome-accessibility-features">GameChat will include text-to-speech and live captions</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy">Nintendo will also be able to record video and voice chats stored on your console for a limited time</a>, if you give consent. This is to ensure a "safe and family-friendly online environment", Nintendo said, with footage only reviewed as part of its user-report system. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-gamechat-feature-requires-a-mobile-phone-number">Those wanting to utilise the Switch 2's GameChat feature</a> will need to register a phone number.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be available worldwide in just under two weeks time, on 5th June. For more, you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-specs">check out our guide to the Switch 2's specs here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pizza-bandit-combines-gears-of-war-and-overcooked-for-a-tasty-shooter-slice.1198155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pizza-bandit-combines-gears-of-war-and-overcooked-for-a-tasty-shooter-slice<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">You ever wonder who the first person to put peanut butter and chocolate together was? Part of me feels like whoever it was must be loaded; I mean, you’ve combined two already great flavors into something that Reese’s would more or less build a whole brand on. And then part of me thinks it plays out like the hypothetical guy who invented the Chicken McNugget in The Wire. A pat on the back from a big shot, and then it’s back to the basement to figure out a way to make the fries taste better. I don’t know the answer; I hope it's the former. But every now and then, you come across an idea, a combination of things, that’s so good that you wonder how nobody’s ever done it before. And every time my squad and I sprinted back to our time-traveling dropship, stopping only to deal with the Time Reapers that stood in our way, I wondered how the hell nobody had ever said “Hey, what if we combined Overcooked and Gears of War?” pre-Pizza Bandit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pizza Bandit’s setup is pretty simple. You’re Malik, a former bounty hunter with dreams of being a chef who is pulled back into the bounty game when he’s scammed out of his pizza shop and his former crew needs his help to get out of a jam. Pizza Bandit’s writing is pretty silly, but that’s part of the charm. I can’t get mad when Albert, the android that upgrades your weapons, tells me he doesn’t know how to apologize for what happened to my pizza shop because he’s just an android, or when my pilot waxes nostalgic about how he misses the fog, or when someone utters the odd nonsensical line. It’s too silly, and the whole setup is just there to, well… set up Pizza Bandit’s wackiness.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">See, you’re not just any bounty-hunting crew. You’re a time-traveling bounty hunting crew, and that means you’ll be going all over space and time to get the job done. Don’t ask me how any of this works. All I know is that pizza heals and bullets kill, and that the Time Reapers — nasty little buggers that seem to be invading every timeline — don’t want this pizza shop owner to make any dough. And that’s not gonna fly. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pizza Bandit’s writing is pretty silly, but that’s part of the charm.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes Pizza Bandit unique is that you’re not just shooting stuff. You’re also, well, kinda playing Overcooked. After squading up, my first mission saw my crew (you can play with up to three friends) heading to the Restaurant from N owhere, a hidden outpost run by another bandit crew. Our job: fulfill the pizza orders for other bounty hunting teams, and send them off in time-traveling rocket pods. That meant putting together the right type of pizza, getting it to the oven, making sure we were getting their drink orders right, and adding some extra bullets for when things got spicy, cramming it all into a pod, and doing it on time while fighting off the Time Reapers, who really, really don’t like supporting small businesses.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pizza Bandit Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where the other part of the Overcooked/Gears of War marriage comes into play. See, the Time Reapers mean business, and you’re not going to talk them out of some time reaping. That’s their whole bag. The only solution, fellow bandit, is incredible violence. I’ve played several builds of Pizza Bandit at this point, and let me tell you, your arsenal is up to the task. You start with your choice of assau lt rifle, minigun, and sniper rifle, but the fun really begins when you start unlocking your secondary weapons by completing jobs. They start simple: landmines, grenades, that sort of thing, but once you unlock the disco ball that attracts enemies and gets them dancing before it explodes? Whew, buddy. And the sentry turret? Perfection. You could slice and dice them Time Reapers with a katana, but have you ever considered using a pizza slicer as big as a man? It’ll change your life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the Time Reapers will force you to use everything in your arsenal. You got your standard guys who will just run at you, but there are also Time Reapers that’ll crawl around on all fours, Terminator-looking ones that will leap at you, giant ones with hammers, guys who throw fireballs (these can really ruin your day), the works. You gotta prioritize.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/24/ss-fc17574392f72dbb6c6579ab57335f4af8f3e918-1920x1080-1748046545180.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pizza Bandit is at its best when you’re with a good team, calling out orders. A good match should be shouts of “We need a pepperoni pie!” and “I’m on the Coke!” and “I’m down!” interspersed with lots and lots of gunfire. Simple choices, like when to call down your own, once-a-mission rocket pod full of pizza and supplies, and more complex ones, like where to put it (you can block off a stairway, for instance), spice things up, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s the thing: so far, I’ve just talked about Restaurant from Nowhere, which is only the first level. Pizza Bandit isn’t a one-trick pony. One of my favorite levels has you taking over a sushi joint and making sure you have the right stuff on the delivery turntable for your customers. Sometimes that means running downstairs and grabbing a big ol’ tuna, taking that bad boy upstairs, and chopping him up before the Time Reapers whack you and you drop him. Other times that means frying an egg, or making a cucumber roll. You gotta stay ahead of the curve, because new customers are prioritized over old ones, and the Time Reapers aren’t gonna sit there and wait for you to plate your masterpiece.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/24/ss-26bd1a7af2e8fec5f2c57033cb8a23f4a04c87d2-1920x1080-1748046559606.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, you’re not even cooking food at all. Another favorite level, Wizard’s Tomb, has you exploring a magically booby-trapped tomb in search of a sarcophagus. You’ll have to navigate the tomb’s traps, solve basic puzzles to reveal the way forward, and take out the arcane heart powering the whole enterprise before getting to the sarcophagus itself, which you’ll naturally transport with jetpacks before booking it back to your ship. It isn’t enough to get any given job done; you gotta get home, too. Just another day in the life of a pizza bandit.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pizza Bandit is always ludicrous, and its inspirations are obvious, but it’s never less than fun.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are more, of course: in one, you’ll defend a cabin with Dr. Emmert Browne (Great Scott, Jofsoft, I see what you’re doing here, and I like it!) while he invents the time travel device that makes your whole business profitable. Winning it all means keeping him warm, satiating his hunger with rabbit or venison, and stopping all those nasty Time Reapers (and Wendigos?) who are trying to stop time travel from happening. You’d think that the Time Reapers would understand time paradoxes, but I guess not. Can’t reap time if there’s no time to reap, y’all.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/24/ss-db483c1838bc283a6d4572159679b419ad7b521b-1920x1080-1748046577176.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"> Or maybe you’ll break into an enormous safe with a laser drill, like you’re roleplaying the opening scene of Michael Mann’s Thief with a drill that’s constantly exploding. That seems safe, right? But hey, apparently there’s a magical cookbook in that vault whose recipes can alter reality, and we’re being paid to get it, exploding drill or not. A Pizza Bandit always gets the job done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> And there’s always time to do your best Breaking Bad impersonation and help a couple of guys cook some “magic powder” and hide it inside some chicken. Oh, and you have to kill and cook the chickens. Only fresh, never frozen, baby. Pizza Bandit is always ludicrous, and its inspirations are obvious, but it’s never less than fun.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/24/ss-fa18e950efd8078ae934ab25415fd4f8c22c49c9-1920x1080-1748046597852.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Between missions, it’s back to Pizza Bandit (your restaurant), where you can acquire and upgrade your weapons, decorate Pizza Bandit itself, use the ingredients you find during missions to bake and share a pie for some stat boosts on your next run, or get some spiffy new duds for your bounty hunter. The milk carton backpack is a classic choice, if I do say so myself, but I’m still saving up for one of the cat ones. The things we do for fashion, am I right? Then it’s right back to it. A bandit’s work is never done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, you don’t know you want something until you get it. I didn’t know I wanted Pizza Bandit until the first time I played it at PAX two years ago. It was one of those games that generated a lot of word of mouth, but it’s one of those concepts that doesn’t seem like it’ll work until you get a controller in your hands and everything makes sense. I don’t know why we’ve never gotten something like Pizza Bandit before, but once I played it, I knew I wanted more. Pizza heals, bullets kill, and Pizza Bandit rocks. If Jofsoft can stick the landing, we’re in for a tasty slice of New York pie.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I wasn't expecting it personally, but it seems like the new hotness is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, 'ey? Sure, it's from a studio like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/level5">Level-5</a>, who've made massive games from Yo-kai Watch to Professor Layton. I just didn't expect a sequel to a 3DS game from over a decade ago to do so well. In fact, it appears Level-5 is so happy with how much money everyone's given them, it'll be giving away a free bit of DLC for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> at some point in the future.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The DLC is called "<a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250523_01/">Update the World!</a>" which is a wonderful little title, and a sentence I'd expect from some anime villain obsessed with tech who wants to install a new operating system on Earth, or something. In terms of what it'll include, there'll be "new content designed to make use of high-rarity weapons obtained from Treasure Groves and other sources." 
</p>
<p>
Maybe that'll mean more quests, or side activities, I'm not entirely sure, it's pretty vague. Though perhaps not as vague as the fact that there'll be "new recipes added" in the DLC too. Yummy, I love recipes! Level-5 also promised that they will "continue to update and improve Fantasy Life i so that players can enjoy its world more comfortably and for an even longer time."
</p>
<p>
As it stands, there's no release date for this bit of DLC, kind of seems like a "we sold lots of copies so we can announce this but we're not quite ready for it yet" type of announcement. Either way, there's already lots to be getting on with given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alternate-between-14-lives-in-level-5s-latest-open-world-fantasy-rpg-out-on-pc-this-week">you've got 14 lives to choose from</a>, an existentially terrifying point that I won't spend too much time on.

            <p>Level 5's role-playing sim Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time has hit 500,000 sales in just three days.</p>
<p>Addressing the thousands of players who had bought the game on PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen systems, the developer thanked players by releasing an all-new illustration marking the milestone.</p>

<p>As Matt summarised for us recently, The Girl Who Steals Time is a sequel to Level 5's Fantasy Life - a sort of job-focussed mash-mash of life sim and RPG - which enjoyed modest critical and commercial success when it launched for Nintendo DS back in 2012. Eurogamer's celebrated its "abundance of features" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-review">our 6/10 review</a> at the time, but noted the result was often "less than the sum of its parts".</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Switch, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version coming later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a> Season 2, entitled Where Clouds Embrace The Dawn, will launch on 6th June.</p>
<p>Calling it "a significant update and milestone moment" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-its-not-a-joke-zenless-zone-zero-really-is-coming-to-xbox">the gacha game will also release on the same day for Xbox</a> - HoYoverse teased that in Version 2, players will "embark on a brand-new and exciting journey to Waifei Peninsula, alongside Yixuan from Yunkui Summit".</p>
<p>"In this expansive update, Proxies will venture into the all-new Waifei Peninsula alongside trusted allies such as Yixuan from Yunkui Summit, revitalize the Suibian Temple nestled within the bustling Failume Heights, and take on more challenging Hollow combat in a more open and spacious environment. To commemorate the game's first anniversary, Version 2.0 will bring a wide array of celebration rewards including a free S-Rank Agent, a free S-Rank W-Engine, 1,600 Polychromes and 20 Encrypted Master Tapes," the developer added.</p>

<p>Following the resolution of the Sacrifice crisis in previous chapters, Season 2 sees Proxies further uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon and experience new Hollow exploration gameplay that harnesses the forces of Ether.</p>
<p>"The region's main city Failume Heights thrives near the Lemnian Hollow, renowned for the rare resource Porcelume. It offers distinctive tea houses, pawnshops, and dessert stalls, inviting Proxies to immerse themselves in the local atmosphere," HoYo added. "Meanwhile, Proxies will take on management of their very own Suibian Temple, upgrade the temple's facilities and earn in-game rewards by dispatching Bangboos, completing commissions, and collecting resources from the Hollows."</p>
<p>Several new allies will join the roster: Yixuan, also known as the Grandmaster, will join the combat as an S-Rank Agent, Ju Fufu, the senior disciple of Yunkui Summit, who will debut as an S-Rank Fire Stun Agent, and Pan Yinhu, Yunkui Summit's A-Rank Physical Defense Agent.</p>
<p>The S-Rank Ether Support Astra Yao and the S-Rank Physical Defense Caesar will return to the Version 2.0 banners.</p>
<p>Players can also expect Hollow Zero: Lost Void to be updated with "new commissions and the possibility to equip multiple Gears to different Agents, adding more strategic options to battles", plus a brand-new 3D map with enhanced navigation features.</p>
<p>"In Version 2.0, Proxies will be able to enter the cinema in Lumina Square to enjoy movies with different characters during the Gravitational Attraction event and obtain exclusive rewards by completing certain tasks, including an A-Rank W-Engine Reel Projector," we're told. "In the Soul of Steel: Golden Bond event, Proxies can pilot sleek mechs into the Hollows, take on a variety of challenges, and earn abundant rewards."</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">two voice actors working on Zenless Zone Zero were suddenly recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike over AI abuse</a>, and discovered the change alongside the publication of the game's patch notes. In a statement subsequently shared on social media, the studio said its contracts offer "explicit AI protections, regardless of union status" and it will continue to work on its clients' projects "in the most human way possible".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/last-defense-academy-makes-confusion-part-of-the-fun.1198089/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/673768/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> starts off by asking a simple question: what happens when you pluck a handful of colorful teenagers from their homes, plop them in a state-of-the-art school filled with every convenience, then force them to fight for their lives? Your guide as you navigate this question is an unsettling and creepy-cute mascot that knows more than it’s let on, and there’s an overarching mystery to the world that you can’t quite put your finger on. </p><p>If you, like I, answered “<em>Danganronpa</em>!” — as this premise sounds very much like the plot of the quirky and irreverent murder-mystery series from Spike Chunsoft — then congratulations! We’re both totally wrong! And after 45 in-game days with <em>LDA,</em> I still have no idea what’s going on, and I love it.</p><p>I’m going to be gentle with myself and you for thinking <em>LDA</em> is another entry in the genre of high school-themed killing games. After all, it was developed by Kazutaka Kodaka, creator and writer of the <em>Danganronpa </em>franchise, in collaboration with Kotaro Uchikoshi, known for his work on the adventure-puzzle game series <em>Zero Escape</em>. And though <em>LDA</em> oozes with the DNA from both series, it stands so completely apart mechanically and narratively that while I can get a grasp on the former, I’m lost with the latter.</p><p>The premise is simple enough. You play as Takumi Sumino, who gets whisked away to the Last Defense Academy, where he and a group of others use their newly awakened powers to defend the school from monster attacks for 100 days. Should they fail, the invaders will destroy the school and thereby… because of plot… all of humanity. Usually past a certain point, I can figure out a game’s core gameplay loop and rough narrative thrust. When the first body dropped in <em>Danganronpa</em>, I immediately understood that I’d be spending the rest of the game solving my classmates’ murders. But I haven’t been able to figure out <em>LDA</em>.</p><div><p><em>LDA</em> fills the gaping hole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a> created and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23688312/advance-wars-reboot-camp-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Advance Wars </em>remakes</a> could not fix</p></div><p>I understand the gameplay loop easily enough: it’s a tactical RPG with visual novel-like relationship-building elements. Combat takes place on a gridded battlefield with each combatant able to attack in a different configuration, similar to chess. One of Takumi’s abilities attacks enemies in a straight line. My ally, Gaku, attacks in a rectangular pattern. Each of my allies’ attacks contributes to a voltage meter that allows us to use our special abilities when full. And if one of my allies should fall, they’ll be revived before the next wave of enemies. </p><p>I like how the tactical combat isn’t like <em>Fire Emblem</em> or <em>Triangle Strategy</em>. <em>LDA </em>is unique, as you’re not trying to manage the complex rock-paper-scissors formula of what weapons are strong or weak against each other. Instead, life is the engine that drives combat. Actions you take are determined by how many action points, or AP, you have, and killing certain enemies grants you more AP. On the flip side, allies who are near death can unleash big special attacks that can clear entire battlefields at the cost of losing them for the rest of the wave.</p><p>Combat then becomes a function of playing with life totals — my enemies and mine. I’ll arrange my attacks in such a way that every time I act, I kill an enemy and gain more AP so I can just keep going, denying my enemies the chance to fight back. Then, when I’m out of AP, I can unleash a killing blow that ends the round. My allies get revived the next round, and I can start the process all over again. I’ve been left so unsatisfied by the crop of tactical RPGs lately, and <em>LDA</em> fills the gaping hole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a> created and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23688312/advance-wars-reboot-camp-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Advance Wars </em>remakes</a> could not fix.</p><p>But while I’ve got a handle on the combat, I still haven’t the faintest clue of the story it’s trying to tell. My confusion is so thorough that as I go through each new day, my experiences start sounding like wartime letters from the front lines.</p><div><blockquote><p>It’s day 33. Our self-proclaimed leader, Hiruko, is still missing. We’re starting to suspect she’ll never return. Meanwhile, the enemy keeps hurling themselves at our defenses. So far, we’ve been able to hold them off. Gaku recently developed his power, revealing himself to be a peerless ranged fighter. But our forces are nowhere near full strength, since Ima, Kako, and Shouma refuse to fight. And alas! Our foodstores have burnt up and I fear we’ll starve soon. War is grim, but I fight knowing the closer I get to the 100th day is a day I am closer to returning home… or so I hope.</p></blockquote></div><p><em>LDA</em>’s narrative is so unlike anything I’ve ever experienced that not knowing what’s happening next is part of the fun. I like getting dragged along for the ride, discovering new developments alongside the characters, who are themselves a delight. <a href="https://aftermath.site/darumi-amemiya-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-emo-cringe-punk">As other outlets have pointed out</a>, Darumi Amemiya is the physical manifestation of the irony-poisoned and terminally online dirtbag edgel(ady), and I adore her even if her characterization gets uncomfortably familiar sometimes. </p><p>I also really enjoy how the characters are over-the-top caricatures themselves — Darumi’s the creepy murder-obsessed emo girl, Takemaru’s the typical fighting-obsessed delinquent — but make decisions like normal people. I often struggle to get into “transported to another world” stories because none of the decisions made in them have ever made sense to me, a woman who can’t turn off her overly logical and reason-obsessed brain in order to just go with the flow. So it’s incredibly refreshing to see these characters push back on the circumstances they’ve been dropped in. </p><p>Instead of just accepting that they’ve been taken from everything they’ve ever known and forced to fight <em>and die</em> (even if that death is temporary), some of my allies maintain a healthy level of skepticism, question everything, and refuse to fight. I know I would! And even better, other characters in the game understand and acknowledge that as a reasonable position. There’s no rah-rah speech of “You must fight!” that convinces them to take up arms. The reluctant characters are given the space to come around on their own time and for their own reasons.</p><p>That may sound boring. After all, in an isekai-like narrative, the characters are usually forced to get on board quickly otherwise there wouldn’t be a plot. So seeing a game take its time with the reluctant characters, letting them work through their hangups in a natural and unforced way, was pleasing to my brain.</p><p>In the almost 50 days I’ve spent with <em>LDA</em>, I do have some working theories as to where the overall story will go. How it gets there, though, I have no clue, but I’m excited to see what twists the game will take along the way.</p><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is out now on Switch and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I love the moral conundrums it presents, the violent grief it depicts, and the games’ excellent writing that poignantly brings all of those complicated emotions to the surface. What I don’t like is listening to pretty much any of the creative team talk about the series, especially when it comes to weighing in on decade-long discourse around its complex storylines. Even when I agree with series director Neil Druckmann’s interpretation of something, we’d all rather he just let bad readings fester in the corners of the internet than tell us exactly what something means. Nevertheless, he continues to do so in interviews. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-fireflies-cure-joel-ellie-vaccine-could-make-1851781975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-fireflies-cure-joel-ellie-vaccine-could-make-1851781975">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="655029cf03bee10f7bc0f96d09b1ccf6" data-recommend-id="image://655029cf03bee10f7bc0f96d09b1ccf6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="655029cf03bee10f7bc0f96d09b1ccf6" data-recommend-id="image://655029cf03bee10f7bc0f96d09b1ccf6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647?_gl=1*gkben*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc2ODI3MTQkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzQ3NjgzOTExJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647?_gl=1*gkben*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc2ODI3MTQkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzQ3NjgzOTExJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw.."><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span> is a very good game that animal lovers can enjoy because there’s no way to harm a single creature in the game (except for people, of course).

            <p>NetherRealm has confirmed there will be no more additional story chapters or characters "from this point on".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X/Twitter, the studio said that despite "hearing players' requests for continued game support of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>", "there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released". It will, however, "continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes".</p>

<p>"It's disappointing because there's no thorough QoL, no online lobbies, &amp; locked away skins....you truly gave us an unfinished $140 game," <a href="https://x.com/Mikemetroid/status/1926025851734196480">replied</a> one player. "An extreme low from WB/NRS. What changed over there???"</p>
<p>As for that "next project" NetherRealm refers to? Well, no-one's entirely sure as it's not been formally confirmed as yet, but that's widely thought to be Injustice 3. Let's watch this space.</p>
<p>Some fans aren't surprised by the announcement, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-mortal-kombat-1-definitive-edition-has-fans-thinking-warner-bros-has-quietly-wrapped-up-development">NetherRealm Studios released its surprise Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition on Switch, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC earlier this month with minimal fanfare</a>, bundling together the main game, its Khaos Reigns story expansion, Shang Tsung, two Kombat Packs featuring additional fighters and Kameo characters, some in-game currency, and a selection of skins. Animality finishing moves have also been added in a free update for all players.</p>
<p>"The arrival of the definitive edition meant it was over with the previous games, so... I guess that was it," noted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1kmhhqw/this_means_its_over/">one poster on the Mortal Kombat subreddit</a> at the time, a sentiment largely shared across the playerbase.</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition costs £55/$70 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, while Switch players can pick it up for $60. There's also a £50/$60 Definitive Edition Upgrade ($50 on Switch) for Mortal Kombat 1 owners wanting to get everything in the new version without purchasing each bit of DLC separately.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Packing brand-new sculpts, the essential new Codex, and a suite of datacards designed to get you howling into battle.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Space Wolves Army Set - Special Edition Codex</b></h2>

<p>I really like the look of the Codex, and reading through it we get, as usual, a really great and extensive dive into the lore of this Chapter. From the start of the chapter on the death world of Fenris, to detailing how this Chapter battles with the ferocity of the wolves of their home planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s also an extensive section in the lore describing the heraldry of the Chapter, as well as how each of the different “packs” of warriors (like the Blood Claws and Grey Hunters, which we’ll speak to in a moment). Finally, the Codex includes all the rules you need to play, including how Sagas work for this Chapter.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a Quick Look at the individual units included in this Army Set!</p>



<p>The new Space Wolves Army Set comes with five units all ready to hit the battlefield (after some assembly, of course) and fight until the Wolftime dawns! As opposed to one of our more in-depth reviews where we break down all the stats, for this Army Set preview I really want to just take a Quick Look at what makes each unit feel different from one another and special.</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Guard Battle Leader</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-battle-leader.jpg?itok=RPNs3_Vt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-battle-leader.jpg?itok=X6xvQBgY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let’s start with the Wolf Guard Battle Leader - veterans of battle and some of the bravest warriors in the army. What makes this unit most unique is how customizable it is. You can choose from an array of melee weapons (a power weapon or a thunder hammer) and ranged options (Carbine, heavy bolt, or plasma pistol), and as a leader you can attach this unit to Blood Claws, Grey Hunters, or Wolf Guard Headtakers.</p>

<p>When you set them up as a leader, you give their unit the Sustained Hits 1 keyword and let them re-roll 1’s when you’re attacking within 6 inches. Not bad for a melee-happy Chapter like the wolves!</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Priest</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-priest.jpg?itok=TtWVfNLJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-priest.jpg?itok=V0r4gklv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Next up is the Wolf Priest, the physical and spiritual leader of the group. And while they’re outfitted with decent weaponry, their abilities truly make the Wolf Priest an extreme standout.</p>

<p>You can attach them to Blood Claws, Grey Hunters, or Wolf Guard Headtakers, and as they act as leaders you’ll get two special abilities. First, you’ve got the Litany of Hate ability, which says if the Priest is leading a unit they add 1 to wound rolls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the real prize here, and what makes the Wolf Priest stand out, is the Healing Balms ability, which says “While this model is leading a unit, in your Command phase, you can return 1 destroyed model (excluding Character models) to that unit.” That’s not a once-per-battle thing, which is huge!</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Guard Headtakers</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-headtakers.jpg?itok=UtiqqE40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-headtakers.jpg?itok=JGQ1VlUm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Wolf Guard Headtakers are tasked with breaking through enemy lines and taking down important figures in the enemy camp. To do that, they’re joined by their ferocious Hunting Wolves!</p>

<p>What makes this unit special is that, at the start of your deploy units phase, you actually split this unit up into two units - one for the marines and the other for the wolves! This unit can also can name one enemy unit as their quarry which gives the marine models in this unit Devastating Wounds and Precision keywords tied to attacking their quarry!</p>

<h3><b>Grey Hunters and Blood Claws</b></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-blood-claws.jpg?itok=NCnjymrg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-blood-claws.jpg?itok=HU7kOajz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Space Wolves Blood Claws</figcaption></figure><p>Blood Claws are the youngest members of the Chapter, hungry to prove themselves in savage battle. Contrasting that are the Grey Hunters, who are older, more mature, and patient marines. These are two different units, but they each only have one thing making them each stand out - beyond the impressive weaponry of your standard space marine.</p>

<p>For the Blood Claws, their fiery and impatient nature is brought to life via their Berserk Charge ability, which let’s them charge in the same turn it Advanced, meaning these marines can cover some serious ground.</p>

<p>For the Grey Hunters, their stalking nature is portrayed in the Cunning Hunters ability, which let’s them re-roll Wound rolls of 1 and, if they’re within range of an object marker, the ability is upgraded to allow them to re-roll all Wound rolls.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-gray-pack.jpg?itok=nzLq0QHV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-gray-pack.jpg?itok=Kldmcjxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Space Wolves Gray Pack</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the Codex, Codex Cards - which do a great job of making it super easy to keep track of your units - and the models, this feels like a very solid offering, and similar to other Space Marine Army Boxes we’ve seen since the launch of 10th. I’ve got some playtesting to do with these models, but on first look - I think you could use this box as the start of an extremely aggressive Force!</p>
