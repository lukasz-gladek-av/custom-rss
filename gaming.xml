			<p>The new and upcoming Zelda game, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has received a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHJFr5EW5bA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand-new trailer</a> that was released today. Titled "The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Traversing Hyrule," it showcases some of the environments that players can expect to explore as Zelda makes their way through Hyrule.</p>
<p>First, the trailer showcases the Gerudo Desert, home to the Voe, women who are exclusively allowed into Gerudo Town. Gerudo Desert is prone to sandstorms, which can obscure visibility for explorers as you traverse through the game. As you explore Gerudo Desert, you'll get to explore vast ruins that have plenty of unique creatures hiding around every corner. In addition, players will also get to explore an oasis hidden away within Gerudo Desert, where there will be a place to relax, as well as speak to some of the nearby NPCs.</p>
<p>Jabul Waters is the next area to be shown off. Compared to the chaos of the ancient ruins in Gerudo Desert, Jabul Waters is "home to some of the most tranquil waterways in Hyrule." In this zone, Zelda can encounter the two different types of Zora: The Sea Zora and the River Zora, both who are starkly different to each other in appearance. From the footage showcased in the trailer, it looks as if the Zora don't often see eye to eye, and Zelda will have to mediate.</p>
<p>The next area showcased is Eldin Volcano, which is home to the famous Kakariko Village, tucked away at the base of the volcano. By traversing the volcano, which is home to many risks and threats for Zelda to conquer, she will eventually make her way to Goron City, where she can meet the Gorons.</p>
<p>Zelda will also get to explore the Faron Wetlands, a lush and humid rain forest, where she'll get to learn more about the Deku Scrubs living in the Wetlands.</p>
<p>Of course, while the main quest is to<a href="https://wccftech.com/link-is-playable-in-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-too/"> save Link</a>, there will also be a variety of quests given to Zelda in each area that she explores, which will give you rewards and fun story lines to explore by completing them.</p>
<p>One of the new main features that is coming to The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the use of Travel Waypoints. This isn't too dissimilar to those that are present in Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom. Once you've unlocked the Travel Waypoint, you can warp to them from your map.</p>
<p>In addition to the Travel Waypoints, you'll also gain access to a horse, which you can use to trample small enemies as well as jump over small obstacles, which can help you traverse Hyrule. The horse can be summoned easily by crafting a Carrot Echo, which can then allow players to summon their steed from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Another new feature is the addition of Business Scrubs, where you can make Smoothies using the ingredients that you've collected on your travels. Each smoothie has a different effect, and can help Zelda on her journey through Hyrule.</p>
<p>Zelda is given a new ability in this game called Bind. When creating Echoes isn't enough to help her bypass obstacles, Tri can bind her to an object, which moves in tandem with Zelda. It can be used for a multitude of things, such as unearthing buried treasure or throwing enemies off of a cliff.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is to be released on September 26, 2024.</p>

		<p><em>It's easy to take the modern conveniences the internet provides us for granted now, and it's even easier to take the sheer existence of the internet for granted, too. Slowly, and then quickly, it was a fundamental shift that altered everything around it, to the point that it's difficult to imagine life before the internet existed. </em></p><p><em>Rob and Patrick were around before the internet was a thing for the masses, and experiencing the early interests aches, pains, and bliss was part of growing up. </em></p><p><em>Today's internet is one of convenience. The old internet required work on your part. Would it shock you to learn that maybe, as we've gotten older, we're looking back at that era with fondness, perhaps even arguing it was better back then?</em></p><p><em>Let's not spend too much time unpacking that one. Just accept it as truth.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Do you remember the first time you used the internet? For me, it’s a hazy mishmash concentrated around a growing pile of America Online discs showing up in the mail. I think we tried Compuserve once, but only because AOL was often too busy to access—yes, you would straight up get a “busy signal” when you were trying to get on the internet!!—and they were offering a free trial. I truly can’t remember if AOL was popular because it was good or good because it was popular, but regardless, AOL was the path into the life and career I have now.</p><p>It was the dial-up era, a time when you shared access to the internet with your phone line, which meant that if someone in the house picked up the phone while you were surfin’ the web, it’d disconnect. Was I supposed to be on the internet at the time my mom picked up? Debatable.&nbsp;</p><p>At one point, my family got so fed up with fighting over the internet that we purchased a second line explicitly dedicated to dial-up. By “my family,” of course, I mostly mean <em>me </em>wanting to use it.</p><p>I have fond memories of sneaking downstairs when the entire family was asleep and draping the family computer with big, thick blankets to dampen the excruciating noise the machine would make while dialing into AOL. It would be decades before I realized it was possible to turn this noise off! Doing so might have spared me from being yelled at a few times, but with the time, it’s such a funny story, and that weird noisescape is a nostalgic part of my earlier years.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gsNaR6FRuO0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Sound of dial-up Internet"></iframe></figure><p>The funny part of the early internet is how curated it was. When you logged into America Online, what you were treated to was, in essence, a magazine? There were different pages you could jump to with information, chat rooms, and discussion boards about topics like the news, games, movies, etc. And who can forget, of a/s/l, a term that will have great meaning to a specific age group who thought they were trying to talk to girls, when it was probably a child lying to you.</p><p>AOL is where I debated the death of Aeris—sorry, Aerith—for the first time. It’s where I pirated my first game, and learned the hard way that downloading 99% of a file is not the same as downloading 100% of a file. It’s where I found my first online communities and virtual friends.</p><p>It was possible to open a web browser in AOL, but I can’t remember doing it very often. And honestly, I cannot pinpoint exactly when I shifted from AOL’s siloed nature to the native internet, but it was around the time Netscape Navigator became a thing. If I had to guess, my obsession with video games eventually led me offsite, in the same way that my obsession with video games also led me to the world of IRC (Internet Relay Chat), an early chat protocol that’s directly responsible for a shocking amount of early video game criticism. mIRC for life, bitches.</p><p>What do you remember about your earliest days on the internet, Rob?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@hugo_cmt?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Hugo Clément</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Well I definitely remember AOL and in particular its huge co-marketing campaign for <em>You’ve Got Mail</em>, the Meg Ryan-Tom Hanks remake of <em>Shop Around the Corner</em> that is maybe the single most late 1990s movie ever made. The conceit of the original movie is that two co-workers who cannot stand each other are also secretly one another’s pen pals, falling increasingly in love via letters even as they grow more estranged at work. <em>You’ve Got Mail</em> liberally reinvents the premise to make Ryan the owner of a beloved children’s bookstore and Hanks is the embodiment of Borders / Barnes and Noble. I’ve got a huge soft spot for the film: I don’t think it’s Nora Ephron’s best work, but I think it’s a fascinating document and meditation on a moment in American life where everyone knows profound changes are coming but nobody knows what they will signify, and for the moment life still feels not so very different than it always has before.</p><p>The movie is really ambivalent. About everything: its leading couple and their romance, the vanishing New York that’s already started surrendering to national chains and trendy convenience, our morality… but most of all it is ambivalent about the internet. The film takes its title from the little “You’ve got mail!” voice clip that would crackle from your speakers whenever you logged into AOL and there was an unread email waiting, and throughout the movie we see the way our two Boomer protagonists have already been reconditioned by this new technology to obsess over it and the opportunities it affords to pretend to be someone else. A more authentic version of themselves? The movie isn’t so sure. (Olivia Rutigliano <a href="https://lithub.com/was-youve-got-mail-trying-to-warn-us-about-the-internet-or-telling-us-to-give-up/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>has written my favorite essay on the film</u></a>, arguing that the movie’s uncomfortable contradictions or discordances are the real point Ephron is trying to make.)</p><p>AOL, however, went buck-wild when this thing was coming out. They would send to customers tons of promotional stuff, to the point where it seemed like AOL was treating <em>You’ve Got Mail </em>like an engagement announcement between it and the whole world. The week before the movie came out I got a half-dozen messages reminding me it wasn’t too late to order a <em>You’ve Got Mail </em>bouquet for that special someone. But of course, in some of the same ways that Hanks’ character in the film now reads as a guy who is <em>also </em>about to be wiped out of business by the likes of Amazon rather than as the vanguard of capitalism, AOL was about to start declining. The silo is built around its users made too many other things difficult (I never managed to get connected to a game server via AOL), and once people got comfortable with the likes of Netscape and Outlook, a lot of the hand-holding AOL offered was going to be irrelevant. AOL was convinced this odd little romcom was a testament to how it had conquered American culture, but it turned out to mark the mass-adoption pivot-point that would devastate the entire business model.</p><p>When I was very young and didn’t remotely realize how any of this worked, I wanted to play multiplayer <em>Warcraft 2</em>. We didn’t have an internet connection but we did have a modem and I saw that option in the multiplayer menu for the game so I clicked host game and waited for my opponent to show up. And I waited. And then I went to do my chores, checking in on the game periodically to see if anyone had connected. I was perplexed: I knew the game was popular, why wasn’t anyone trying to find a game and being matched with my modem?</p><p>But once I did know how more of this worked, I will say that direct modem connection games were how I did most of my online gaming. A bunch of my friends and I all had each other’s phone numbers, so we’d give each other quick phone calls to confirm everything was set up, and then we’d connect for hours of <em>StarCraft</em>, <em>Total Annihilation</em>, and <em>Red Alert. </em>Once I got to college and enjoyed access to a 24/7 high-speed connection, I never looked back, of course. But I am not sure I ever had more fun playing multiplayer than when it was basically my and my friends (or not even friends, really: sometimes just the fact that you were both into <em>Dark Reign</em> was enough to strike up a relationship with someone you otherwise didn’t know) arranging matches after dinner, killing our families’ phone lines for hours every night.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Try to get the "You've Got Mail" notifications sound out of your head now. Good luck.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>I have a distinct memory where we’d bought a new family computer, but the old family computer still worked, and so my brother and I dragged the machines together into a part of the house, established a direct connection between them, and played a few <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> matches. Neither of us was any good, but it was so unbelievably cool to pull off that magic trick.</p><p>You must’ve been part of the Total Entertainment Network, Rob, right? </p>

While it focuses on Pedro Pascal’s Joel, who seems to be undergoing some kind of therapy after the violent events of season one’s finale, there’s a lot more to pick through in the brief flashes of other scenes that the trailer provides. Given that we know this season will be a pretty direct adaptation of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, we can contextualize a fair bit of what we see in the 24-second clip. Let’s break down this preview of Joel and Ellie’s next chapter.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="baf941341498db276b10709f57a1a82f" data-recommend-id="image://baf941341498db276b10709f57a1a82f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie watches the dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie watches the dance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="baf941341498db276b10709f57a1a82f" data-recommend-id="image://baf941341498db276b10709f57a1a82f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie watches the dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first shot is easily recognizable to <em>The Last of Us </em>fans as it’s Ellie at a dance held in the Jackson, Wyoming settlement she and Joel live in at the beginning of <em>Part II</em>. It looks like they’re re-creating the establishing shot 1:1, as we see Ellie from behind, looking on as other folks dance the night away. She’s an introverted wallflower at this point in her life, and it will take a good dance partner to get her on the dance floor. But we’ll get to her later.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0c73efd0354adb95e68a2f79531b6c8d" data-recommend-id="image://0c73efd0354adb95e68a2f79531b6c8d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie's arm is shown with a burn covered by a tattoo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie's arm is shown with a burn covered by a tattoo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c73efd0354adb95e68a2f79531b6c8d" data-recommend-id="image://0c73efd0354adb95e68a2f79531b6c8d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie's arm is shown with a burn covered by a tattoo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next, we see a close-up of Ellie’s arm where she was once bitten by someone infected with the cordyceps fungus and thus learned of her immunity. In the years since the events of the first game, she has since burned off the bite with a self-inflicted wound and covered it in a tattoo of a moth landing on a fern. Some set photos of the tattoo had fans concerned about it looking worse than professional <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Emanzii/status/1810628269101744590&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Emanzii/status/1810628269101744590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cosplayers’ versions of the ink</a></span>, but the shot we see of it here looks pretty good, I’d say.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e61884f3156198a1cb1c39ee004c3e2c" data-recommend-id="image://e61884f3156198a1cb1c39ee004c3e2c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara talks to Pedro Pascal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara talks to Pedro Pascal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e61884f3156198a1cb1c39ee004c3e2c" data-recommend-id="image://e61884f3156198a1cb1c39ee004c3e2c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara talks to Pedro Pascal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first <em>Last of Us </em>season introduced new characters who weren’t part of the games, and it seems like season two may be following suit with <em>Schitt’s Creek </em>actor Catherine O’Hara’s character. We don’t know her name at this time, but she appears to be Joel’s therapist. She is shown asking him if he “hurt” Ellie, which he denies, claiming he “saved” her during the first season’s finale when he killed members of the Firefly resistance group planning to kill her to make a vaccine. The next few seasons will most likely be unpacking that viewpoint from multiple perspectives.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8cdaaa15a0f038ecc0a3bb0d72c059c5" data-recommend-id="image://8cdaaa15a0f038ecc0a3bb0d72c059c5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie screams out as someone tries to calm her down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie screams out as someone tries to calm her down." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8cdaaa15a0f038ecc0a3bb0d72c059c5" data-recommend-id="image://8cdaaa15a0f038ecc0a3bb0d72c059c5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie screams out as someone tries to calm her down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One scene here that I’m not sure how to place is Ellie screaming in what looks like a hospital bed. Could this be a nightmare she has about the events of the first season finale? Could she be waking up in a Jackson medical facility after the inciting incident of the second season and realizing what’s transpired? It’s unclear, but actor Bella Ramsey will be dealing with a lot of Ellie’s most traumatic moments this season, so at least they’re selling the tormented young girl of it all.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a166388ce0d9c2a923a1a360bbc3f260" data-recommend-id="image://a166388ce0d9c2a923a1a360bbc3f260" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tommy shoots an infected horde." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tommy shoots an infected horde." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a166388ce0d9c2a923a1a360bbc3f260" data-recommend-id="image://a166388ce0d9c2a923a1a360bbc3f260" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tommy shoots an infected horde." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a brief clip of what looks like members of the Jackson settlement fighting off a horde of infected from attacking the town. Gabriel Luna’s Tommy is shown with a rifle firing down on them from the top of the gate. In <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, Ellie, Joel, and other townsfolk were shown doing regular patrols around the perimeter to take out infected stragglers, but there wasn’t a scene of infected attacking the town itself. A group did attack a nearby mansion where some survivors were hiding away in the opening hours, though. So perhaps this is just a retooling of those early fights.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="407e2fc6016016d264d571172380bd1e" data-recommend-id="image://407e2fc6016016d264d571172380bd1e" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seraphites run through a forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Seraphites run through a forest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="407e2fc6016016d264d571172380bd1e" data-recommend-id="image://407e2fc6016016d264d571172380bd1e" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seraphites run through a forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While it doesn’t appear to be fan favorites Lev and Yara, we do see a few members of the Seraphite cult that occupies Seattle running through a forest area. Ellie faces a few groups of these bow-sporting cultists during her time in the city, but it’s likely that we won’t see as much of them until sometime after 2025, given HBO seems to be dividing <em>Part II</em>’s story across multiple seasons. The Seraphites are a footnote on Ellie’s story, but are much more significant for other characters in the game’s ensemble cast.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="573d33c75392bddd088ded4518f5d70c" data-recommend-id="image://573d33c75392bddd088ded4518f5d70c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dina holds a lantern and Ellie fires a rifle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dina holds a lantern and Ellie fires a rifle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="573d33c75392bddd088ded4518f5d70c" data-recommend-id="image://573d33c75392bddd088ded4518f5d70c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dina holds a lantern and Ellie fires a rifle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unfortunately, we only see the briefest of flashes of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-dina-actor-isabela-merced-1851159653&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-dina-actor-isabela-merced-1851159653">Isabela Merced as Ellie’s girlfriend Dina</a></span> in this trailer. She’s seen holding a lantern and looking frightened of something off-screen. Most likely she’s trying to be quiet as a Clicker lurks around the room. But I’m sure she’ll be her usual upbeat, chatty self when there’s less danger around. This trailer seems to be looking to capture the violence and drama of the season, so even the brightest lights like Dina are dimmed here.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca16e9d15f0d139dcfeb17d0fecc5eab" data-recommend-id="image://ca16e9d15f0d139dcfeb17d0fecc5eab" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isaac pulls out a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isaac pulls out a gun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca16e9d15f0d139dcfeb17d0fecc5eab" data-recommend-id="image://ca16e9d15f0d139dcfeb17d0fecc5eab" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isaac pulls out a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like last season, there will be some members of the <em>Last of Us </em>games cast joining the live-action show. This time, Jeffrey Wright will be reprising his role as Isaac, the leader of the militaristic Washington Liberation Front. Ellie never meets Isaac in <em>Part II</em>, so if he’s showing up in season two, it does seem like the show will probably be playing around with perspective shifts to some degree. All we see of him do here is draw a gun at someone, but considering he’s a violent sadist in the game, that just sounds like a Tuesday for him.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d299edcba3a0e960f2d279151689b454" data-recommend-id="image://d299edcba3a0e960f2d279151689b454" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abby crawls underneath a fence pushed down by infected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abby crawls underneath a fence pushed down by infected." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d299edcba3a0e960f2d279151689b454" data-recommend-id="image://d299edcba3a0e960f2d279151689b454" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abby crawls underneath a fence pushed down by infected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Booksmart </em>actor Kaitlyn Dever is playing Abby, the co-protagonist of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.

It seems like they’re still trying to keep her role a secret from the casual audience, but if you’re new to the series, know you’ll be seeing a lot of her in the coming seasons. She’s bundled up for the winter weather, though.

These fuckers have been infected by the cordyceps fungus for so long that their eyes have been overtaken by the mushroom-like growth. All things considered, they recreated these creatures pretty well in the live-action show. That makeup team deserves props.<br></p><hr><p><em>The Last of Us </em>season two is set to premiere in 2025. While we didn’t see many of them in this trailer, we already know a handful of other actors who will join the cast as Abby’s friends from Seattle. Though it’s unclear how much of a role they’ll play next season given much of this trailer’s focus on Ellie’s journey while also having what looks like interstitial cuts with characters like Isaac. So there’s still a lot we don’t know.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That game’s ending moved the franchise forward about 40 seconds and seemingly set up the next main entry in the award-winning sci-fi shooter series.

The listing didn’t reveal who the actor was playing and the entire site and original post have been scrubbed from the web. But before the site was killed, <em>Kotaku </em>confirmed that the listing was real and it did indeed mention a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve game using the “White Sands” codename</a></span>.</p><p>Interstingly, White Sands is a desert located in New Mexico, the same state where <em>Half-Life</em>’s Black Mesa facility is located.

(Source 2 is Valve’s main engine, and the company has a history of leaving behind bits of code and data from other games in updates as all of its projects use the same engine and tools.) </p><p>As explained in the video, we know that Valve and the<em> Half-Life: Alyx </em>team started pre-production on a different game during the development of that VR title. </p><p>In 2021, dataminers discovered its codename was <em>HLX</em>. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valve-next-game-new-shooter-deadlock-neon-prime-moba-pc-1851493739&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valve-next-game-new-shooter-deadlock-neon-prime-moba-pc-1851493739"><em>Deadlock</em>, a different recently leaked Valve game</a></span>, was long thought by some to be <em>HLX</em> or what the project had evolved into. Others maintained that <em>Deadlock </em>(<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/T7KuuJO_lqw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/T7KuuJO_lqw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which was known internally as <em>Citadel</em></a></span>) was separate from <em>HLX</em>. It was hard to say, as data mining is tricky when you don’t know how many projects a studio is working on or the status of each game.  But now that we know what <em>Deadlock </em>is, and that it’s not a <em>Half-Life </em>game, it’s become easier to start piecing together <em>HLX </em>using datamined code. </p><h2 id="h7598"><a id=""></a>White Sands aka <em>HLX</em> might be <em>Half-Life 3</em></h2><p>“<em>HLX </em>seems to be a fully-fledged non-VR<em> Half-Life</em> game, something that seems too good to be true, and something that I wanted to be very sure of before going live with any of this information,” explained McVicker in his new video. <br></p><p>According to strings of code found in Valve’s <em>DOTA2</em>, the character in <em>HLX </em>(which is believed to be<em> Project White Sands</em>) wears an HEV Suit, goes “offworld” at some point during the game, and encounters things like “storks,” “pentatanks,” “feral man hacks,” “Xenogorillas, Xen Jellyfish, and Xen Swoopers.” (Xen is the dimension you visit at the end of the original <em>Half-Life.</em>) It’s believed that some of these enemies or creatures were planned for <em>Alyx </em>but got cut and have instead made their way into <em>HLX </em>aka White Sands.</p><p>Toward the end of the video, in a section clearly labeled “speculation,” McVicker asks himself if this leaked game is <em>Half-Life 3</em>. And after a pause, he says: Yes. </p><p> “I think this is a non-VR <em>Half-Life</em> game [in which] you play a HEV Suit-wearing character in development at Valve Software that has been in development since <em>Half-Life: Alyx.” </em></p><p>Of course, until Valve confirms any of this, we won’t know for sure. It’s always possible—and this has happened before—that the project won’t be finished and won’t ever see the light of day. We just have to wait. But if devs at Valve have been working on <em>HLX </em>aka White Sands for about three-to-four years so far, we might not have to wait too long before the next <em>Half-Life </em>game—<em>whatever </em>that ends up being—is officially revealed. </p><p><em>&nbsp; .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-console-wars-card-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A new physical card game, ‘The Console Wars, ‘ has <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xboxera/console-wars-the-card-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">just launched on Kickstarter</a> and takes some funny jabs at the entire gaming industry.</p>



<p>The new game has been launched on Kickstarter by Xboxera, who say the game is a “satirical, parody-filled spin on the gaming industry”. Its reveal trailer featured none other than actor and game developer Abubaker Salim, who narrated what The Console Wars is. You can watch the reveal trailer below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="#SecretProject reveal livestream" width="1200" height="900" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/720TrCCr4tw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<div><p>The press release reads,</p><p>“In order to win the Console Wars,&nbsp;<strong>content is king</strong>, and intellectual property ownership of the best games is&nbsp;<em>everything.</em></p></div>



<p>In order to emerge victorious, players will need to battle for ownership of&nbsp;<strong>4 full sets of IP</strong>&nbsp;across multiple genres, from action-packed first-person shooters, iconic platformers and deep, complex RPGs.</p>



<p>Throughout play, you’ll try to amass as many fans as you can – without them, you have no momentum, and arguably no platform at all – so keeping fans is&nbsp;<em>critical</em>&nbsp;to holding on to your precious gaming franchises.</p>



<p>Will you emerge victorious? Can you survive the relentless ups and downs of the video game industry? Find out if you have what it takes to truly win the Console Wars by backing us on&nbsp;Kickstarter&nbsp;today!”</p>



<p>The creator of The Console Wars, Jon Clarke, Co-founder of XboxEra said,&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Console Wars” is something the entire industry knows about, and actively dislikes. So what if we took all that toxicity; all that online hate – and turned it into something positive and fun? Something where we could all collectively point and laugh at how ridiculous the very concept of ‘console warring’ is? That’s how Console Wars The Card Game came to be.</em></p>



<p><em>Inspired by many of the card games I already play, I wanted to make something even more strategic, vicious and hilarious. As I’ve witnessed with the playtesting over the last year, I truly believe that’s what Console Wars The Card Game is!”</em></p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xboxera/console-wars-the-card-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">back The Console Wars on Kickstarter here</a>.</p>

The page hinted at a console with a “7-inch or 8-inch display,” an HDMI port, and dual fans — things the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">original Legion Go</a> lacks — before it was apparently removed.</p><p>You can still find the FAQ on The Internet Archive, where I found snapshots as far back as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240504094510/https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/legiongo/">May 4th, 2024</a>, and as recently as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240804194607/https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/legiongo/">yesterday</a>. In addition to those details, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/the-lenovo-legion-go-pc-gaming-handheld-is-getting-a-smaller-s-model-and-we-now-have-more-details"><em>Windows Central </em>suggests</a> that the console will be named the Lenovo Legion Go “S,” not “Lite,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/27/24165835/what-will-the-lenovo-legion-go-lite-look-like">as has been rumored</a> until now. </p><p>The current version of the Legion Go features an 8.8-inch screen and a single fan and outputs video over USB-C.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-cute-throwback-rpg-super-dungeon-muncher-the-dungeon-is-being-eaten-by-a-monster<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>What is it with monstrous eating mechanics in games of late? Last week it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/post-soviet-horror-trinket-kletka-is-an-endless-descent-in-an-elevator-that-wants-to-eat-you">carnivorous post-Soviet elevators</a>, now it’s retro fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> that devour themselves. In Super Dungeon Muncher, you are a teeny-tiny hero navigating a corridor-shaped map full of fireball traps and crumbling platforms, spinning coins and patrolling critters. That’s the “Super Dungeon” part. The “Muncher” part refers to the corpulent red monster guzzling the whole level in your wake.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Much like our own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-6">The Maw</a>, the Muncher is a creature that operates according to its own understanding of time and physics. You and all the creatures within each dungeon map are locked to a grid and take turns to move, as in, say, Shiren The Wanderer. The Muncher, however, exists in real time, reaching gluttonous hands out to grasp the map’s edges and drag everything into its gullet. It’s sort of like rewinding a video of a printer, except that printers have better table manners.</p>
<p>In addition to staying ahead of the Muncher's gnashing molars, you’ll need to perform such traditional RPG duties as buying new weapons and kit from swiftly-masticated shopkeepers, finding keys for locks, and destroying or circumventing obstacles such as trees or cracked blocks. Speed is of the essence, but it looks like you can also delay or even deter your ravenous nemesis by feeding it less tasty things like toilets.</p>
<p>Super Dungeon Muncher is out today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3095800/SUPER_Dungeon_Muncher/">Steam</a> and eventually <a href="https://itch.io/profile/n-nexy">Itch.io</a> and Google Play.

After dozens of hours of dealing with ugly fused weapons and broken gear, you finally get the sword of legend. But it’s still far from perfect. While it can’t break, it can lose its power and have to recharge. The Master Sword from the game’s opening prologue doesn’t have that same weakness, though, and players have spent months trying to find a way to get that version instead. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,195755,196394" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That Master Sword is called MsgNotFound and players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-master-sword-glitch-1850474567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-master-sword-glitch-1850474567">previoulsy found a way to bring it out of the confines</a></span> of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>’s prologue by breaking the game with glitches shortly after it launched.

It’s not an easy process and it requires deploying dozens of glitches, but the end result is a Master Sword that you can swing as many times as you want without it ever losing its power. </p><p>The video is by El Duende 05 and is broken into seven parts that go through each step and glitch performed in detail. The road to recovering MsgNotFound was a group effort though, with special credit to user NghtmaR3 among others whose new SLD (Save Load Dupe) exploit is the step that breaks the seal Nintendo tried to put around all of these shenanigans. The whole thing feels like one of those old History Channel documentaries of archeologists trying to recreate the building of the pyramids. </p><p>Like I said, the current method is very long, requires an intricate stacking of game-logic-defying bugs, and is easy to mess up. Doing so will either force you to start over early on in the process or potentially nuke your end-game save, since one of the key things going on here is transporting the MsgNotFound Master Sword from one file to another. One phase revolves around stacking auto saves. Another has you fall through the bottom of the world. It’s almost like players are time traveling into the past and ripping the item out of its reality and taking it back with them between separate files. It’s one of the wildest things I’ve ever seen people try to pull off in a game. </p><figure id="" data-id="e28247aace73be8599de51852a3c6f3f" data-recommend-id="image://e28247aace73be8599de51852a3c6f3f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Link falls through the world.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here’s how El Duende 05 describes the final steps in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> glitch jargon: “Transfer both a shield and weapon to prologue to unlock those inventories 2) Place a portacull shield in position near Ganon 3) Set up LSW next to the map origin 4) Cull Link while lifting an object 5) Navigate between dimensions with no abilities to arrive at Ganon in the prologue 6) Send the sword back to your future self.” Or you can reference the entire written guide <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NTa1hBai4UdGbmxf8n_M0fVK_2fMKcFzbJ_pSXGTDT8/edit&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NTa1hBai4UdGbmxf8n_M0fVK_2fMKcFzbJ_pSXGTDT8/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>.<br></p><p>This complex method works for 1.2.1, the current version of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> which Nintendo graciously hasn’t patched since last August. Some players simply never updated their game and got the MsgNotFound Master Sword using the old method. Others are waiting for a more streamlined version of the latest method to be discovered before giving it a go themselves.  El Duende 05 said they expect one will be found soon enough. Hopefully, that happens before Nintendo decides to drop a new update out of the blue. We all deserve an unbreakable Master Sword in our lives. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA has just released a new deep-dive video for FC 25’s Ultimate Team game mode, detailing features such as Rush in Ultimate Team, FC IQ, expanded Evolutions community requests, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 25 | Official Ultimate Team Deep Dive" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcGJ4fe0iNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-5v5-rush-nbsp">5v5 Rush&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>The developers first reveal the details about EA FC 25’s new game mode, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-details-new-game-mode-coming-to-ea-fc-25-rush/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rush</a>, and how it will work in Ultimate Team. Players can join this 5v5 game mode either with 3 of their friends or through matchmaking. </li>



<li>Each team will have an AI goalkeeper, and players can choose one player from their Ultimate Team club to control them for the entirety of the match.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Winning matches earns you points, which can be used to acquire Ultimate Team rewards each week. </li>



<li>Additionally, there will be Rush events throughout the season, allowing players to fetch more rewards and use various types of players.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-fc-iq-revamps-ultimate-team-tactics">FC IQ Revamps Ultimate Team Tactics</h2>



<ul>
<li>Through the improvements made towards Tactics, players have more control over how their team behaves on and off the ball in EA FC 25. Manager Items will now include Tactical Presets, so if a player wishes to apply Pep Guardiola’s tactics to their team, they can emulate that even better.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Additionally, players have more ways to apply their strategies with the addition of Player Roles, which replace Work Rates. Players can boost these roles through special items released throughout the year.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-ea-fc-25-ultimate-team-evolutions-nbsp">EA FC 25 Ultimate Team Evolutions&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>Many restrictions have been lifted from Evolutions so that players can use their favourite players more often. </li>



<li>Evolution cards have received cosmetic enhancements, too; players can now add backgrounds, borders, sounds and animations to their EA FC 25 Evolutions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>One of the community’s most requested features has arrived for EA FC 25’s Ultimate Team. There is now a storage space for the Untradeable Duplicates, which players can access through Squad Building Challenges.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Contracts have been removed for Players and Managers so they can keep playing for the club.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Rivals have also received some revamps. A new point system allows players to progress even when drawing their matches. Also, Relegations are back, as the total number of checkpoints for each division is being reduced.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Live Friendlies will no longer matchmake according to your Rivals rank. Instead, it will use the form as a factor to matchmake.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Lastly, there’s a new Ultimate Team stadium for players to customise.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/05/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-gameplay-five-minute-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has released a new video for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, showing off the world and gameplay of the first mainline series game to feature a playable Zelda. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is coming out for Nintendo Switch on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-lets-you-actually-play-as-zelda-this-september/">26th September 2024</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom – Traversing Hyrule Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DolGuwvAnfg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With a focus on exploring this latest iteration of Hyrule and how Zelda can get around with her new summoning abilities, the video takes us to the searing heat of Gerudo Desert, and the village of Gerudo tribe, and the Jabul Waters, which plays host to both the Sea Zora and River Zora, who don’t always get along. Kakariko Village is at the base of Eldin Volcano, but this has been transformed by the weird rifts that kicked this adventure into gear, and you’ll have to figure out how to reach the home of the Gorons. And finally, the Faron Wetlands are all kinds of leafy and play home to the Deku.</p>
<p>Echoes of Wisdom will throw plenty of side quests your way, such as tryiing to held an elderly man cheer up his wife with a flying plant, save someone from being trapped up a wall, gathering up Cuccos, and dealing with a… a Tornado Ghost?</p>
<p>You’ll be able to zip around the world using Waypoints as fast travel nodes on the map, but Zelda will also be able to ride a horse and hop up and over obstacles. All you need is to learn the Carrot echo and you’ll be able to summon a horse wherever you are.</p>

<p>Smoothies take the cooking of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and blend them into something a bit lighter, as you can combine gathered items to make smoothie combos. Electro Apple mixed with Floral Nectar, for example. You can also use outfits and accessories to enhance Zelda’s abilities, like Zora flippers improving her swimming.</p>
<p>Another ability was also revealed, in addition to the Echo summoning. For larger obstacles, Tri will help you with the power of Bind. This latches any object to Zelda’s movement, from a huge boulder to a half-buried chest, and even to summoned echoes, if you want to have an impromptu spiky shield. You can also reverse bond to map Zelda’s movement to other creatures and objects, switching back and forth.</p>
<p>Echoes of Wiszom borrows the visual style of the Link’s Awakening remake, which was a real highlight from a few years ago, which was already rather delightful, but will make for a real change in the series by having Zelda be the main playable character, using magical abilities and her wits, as opposed to combat in order to get ahead.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-new-fairy-tail-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-new-fairy-tail-games-take-on-deckbuilding-and-volleyball-soon.944997/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-new-fairy-tail-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kodansha Creators' Lab has announced two brand new&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>games in collaboration with series creator Hiro Mashima, and they're both landing in the next month or two.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the collaboration between the two began when Mashima "said he wanted to have a&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>game made". Presumably, he's not counting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fairy-tail">RPG created by&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>developer Gust</a>.</p>
<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>is a deckbuilding roguelite that will feature five playable characters from the manga, each of whom will have their own special abilities. It'll tell an original story and will revolve around exploring dungeons, building synergies, and taking advantage of your characters' unique strengths.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fairy-tail-dungeons-combat.jpg?itok=b2ArHRao 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fairy-tail-dungeons-combat.jpg?itok=tn0CrtG4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>is a new roguelite heading your way later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Launching on PC via Steam on August 26th,&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>is developed by ginolabo, the team behind&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/soulvars-review-biblical-demon-antivirus"><em>Soulvars</em></a>&nbsp;(which is also a deckbuilding RPG, so this appointment makes a lot of sense).</p>
<p>The second project to come from Mashima and the Kodansha Creators' Lab is&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail: Beach Volleyball Havoc</em>, a rather unique-looking pixel art proposition that marries beach volleyball with fighting game mechanics.</p>
<p>You'll be playing volleyball as (and against) teams of&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>characters, and each time you score a point, your magical abilities will become more powerful, granting you access to more spells with greater power.</p>
<p><em>Beach Volleyball Havoc&nbsp;</em>will support up to four players, and you'll be able to play either in local multiplayer or via Steam Remote Play.</p>

<p>This one's taking a little longer to cook; it'll launch on September 16th.&nbsp;<em>Beach Volleyball Havoc&nbsp;</em>is being developed by tiny cactus studio, whose work you may know from&nbsp;<em>Super Glitter Rush&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dimension Tripper Neptune: Top Nep</em>.</p>
<p>To commemorate the announcement of&nbsp;<em>Beach Volleyball Havoc</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail</em>-themed art contest is also being held, so if you fancy drawing&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>characters in beach attire, you can <a href="https://daysneo.com/award/fairytailbeachvolleyball.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check the contest and its rules out here</a> (although it's in Japanese, it looks like it's open to anyone).</p>
<p><em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305500/FAIRY_TAIL_DUNGEONS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a> on August 26th, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2116680/FAIRY_TAIL_Beach_Volleyball_Havoc/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Beach Volleyball Havoc</a>&nbsp;</em>follows not long after on September 16th.</p>

            <p>Forthcoming action-RPG Phantom Blade Zero developer S-Game says that as it believes in "making our game accessible to everyone", it has not "ruled out any platforms".</p>
<p>Confirmation came via the studio itself, which took to social media to clarify its stance after several media outlets reported an unnamed developer <a href="https://gameplayscassi.com.br/noticias/ninguem-precisa-desta-plataforma-black-myth-wukong-e-phantom-blade-zero-nao-sao-exclusivos-do-playstation-mas-as-versoes-do-xbox-nao-sao-prioridade-dizem-desenvolvedores/82482/">said</a> "nobody needs Xbox".</p>

<p>S-Game has distanced itself from the comments, saying they do not represent "S-Game's values or culture".</p>

			<p>One, if not the most popular, mini-game seen in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be revamped for the third and final part of the trilogy, according to the game's director.</p>
<p>As reported on X/Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/neo_aoshi/status/1819841781204156672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1819841781204156672%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@neo_aoshi</a>, during a panel at the Otacon anime convention with producers and voice actors from the game, director Naoki Hamaguchi talked about the Queen's Blood mini-game, revealing that he has received many requests from fans regarding a real-life version of the card game. While he couldn't confirm one would be coming, he did reveal that a revamped version of the mini-game will be included in the third and final entry in the series.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy series is no stranger to card mini-games like Triple Triad from the eighth entry in the series and Tetra Master from the ninth entry in the series, so the inclusion of Queen's Blood in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was extremely welcome, although it wasn't possible to challenge the vast majority of NPCs like it was possible in Final Fantasy VIII. Hopefully, the revamped version of the mini-game will allow players to play more games against a bigger number of opponents than Rebirth.</p>
<p>The wealth of mini-games is only one of the things that defines the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth experience. You can learn more about the second entry in the series, currently available exclusively on PlayStation 5, by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/larian-studios-%E2%80%98channel-from-hell%E2%80%99-intro-video-reveals-upcoming-content.944988/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-channel-from-hell-intro-video-reveals-upcoming-content/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1820475850942210368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios teased the intro video for its brand-new YouTube channel, “Larian: Channel From Hell.”</p>



<p>This anticipated YouTube channel now has an introductory video featuring host Aoife Wilson. It breaks down the content coming to Larian: Channel From Hell, as the studio expands its social presence.</p>



<p>Larian: Channel From Hell will include “regular streams and shows, featuring our development team, to patch explainers, unboxing videos and updates on what we’re currently up to.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing Larian: Channel From Hell!" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOVdwbRhHYM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The intro video elaborates that fans can also expect “behind the scenes footage” and documentary-style content. </p>



<p>Wilson also teases that Swen Vincke, founder and CEO of Larian Studios, will also make cameo appearances from time to time. </p>



<p>Vincke often interacts directly with fans. In March 2024, they also made it very clear that Larian is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not planning any Baldur’s Gate 3 DLC</a> or a sequel. Though fans are disappointed, many praised the open communication.</p>

            <p>God of War studio Sony Santa Monica is developing its first new IP in over 20 years.</p>
<p>As spotted by a member of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/according-to-a-developer-at-santa-monica-studio-the-studios-next-game-is-a-new-ip.943911/">ResetEra</a>, a developer at Sony Santa Monica mentioned they've been working at the studio "looking after the entire character development pipeline on their new IP".</p>

<p>In the "about" section of their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glaucolonghi/">LinkedIn profile</a>, a developer supervising character development said they were "thrilled to be back" at Santa Monica after a brief departure to work at Striking Distance and Unknown Worlds.</p>
<p>"Santa Monica Studios presented the opportunity of coming back as character supervisor, looking after the entire Character Development pipeline, on their new IP, so here I am, thrilled to be back, working again with the crew and pushing characters in video games together," the developer said.</p>
<p>As you no doubt expect, the dev stopped short of revealing what, exactly, the IP is or even what kind of characters they were developing</p>
<p>The studio's debut game was PS2 racer Kinetica in 2001, but since the first God of War in 2005 Sony Santa Monica's worked solely on that series (besides assisting development on other projects). A brand new franchise, then, is an intriguing prospect.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-launches-new-official-figurine-collection-with-aloy-varl-kratos-atreus-and-jin-sakai">Sony recently revealed a new range of figurines called "The Shapes Collection"</a> that includes characters from God of War Ragnarök, Horizon Forbidden West, and Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with toy company Spin Master, Sony says the "highly detailed figures deliver the interactive storytelling element of these titles in an all-new way, extending the gaming experience from digital to physical".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
