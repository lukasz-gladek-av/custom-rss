All of which you may or may not find interesting; it'll depend on how into <em>the</em> <em>industry </em>you are. Some of those articles may even try to poke at the console's price, how it compares to other machines on the market, whether there is good value to be had. The bravest among the internet's legion of armchair analysts might even try to predict the Switch 2's sales figures, based I'm sure on all kinds of very important video game-related metrics and historical precedent.</p><p>I'm taking the day off from all that shit. I woke up, saw the price and just checked out entirely. A video game console with those specs, costing $450 (AUD$699 here) in the Year Of Our Lord 2025, with games costing $80, is a hard pass from me. In the last two years I've lost my full-time job, my mortgage has gone up by 30% and the price of everything else around me, from groceries to insurance, has shot up by similar margins.</p><p>I can't afford short holidays or a night out at the movies with my kids, and the new video game console is asking for $450? Nah. I know none of the above factors are Nintendo's fault--this is the first major console launch to land after the post-pandemic cost-of-living crisis--nor will they likely factor into many analyst's predictions, but they're factors today, in my life, and no doubt the lives of millions of other people around a world that's growing increasingly chaotic by the day.</p><p>I was going to end this blog by saying "Who knows what the future will bring, maybe I'll just get it when it goes on sale", before realising that the Switch was released in 2017 and didn't officially get a price drop...ever.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thomas-tank-diesel-10-scary"><h3>Fuck This Anthropomorphic Diesel Engine In Particular</h3></a><p>Thomas and the Magic Railroad's Diesel 10 gave me nightmares</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Additionally, you can save 20% by using the code <strong>FOUNDER20 </strong>when you check out, which will drop the price for the ZenGrip 2 to $40 and $56 for the carrying case bundle.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.satisfye.com/products/zengrip-2-standalone" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ZenGrip 2</a> -- $40 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.satisfye.com/products/zengrip-2-bundle" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ZenGrip 2 and carrying case</a> -- $56 (<del>$70</del>)</li></ul></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100770772-15048490?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/nintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.anrdoezrs.net\/click-100770772-15048490?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https:\/\/dbrand.com\/shop\/grip\/nintendo-switch-2-cases&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100770772-15048490?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/nintendo-switch-2-cases">Dbrand Killswitch for Switch 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100770772-15048490?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/nintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.anrdoezrs.net\/click-100770772-15048490?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https:\/\/dbrand.com\/shop\/grip\/nintendo-switch-2-cases&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100770772-15048490?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/nintendo-switch-2-cases">$3 to reserve a unit | Releases Spring 2025</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Dbrand's Killswitch grip for Switch 2 works more like a case that covers the body of the Switch 2 and adds ergonomic handles to the new Joy-Cons, but you'll still be able to detach the Joy-Cons and use the kickstand.

		<p>Odin: Valhalla Rising will be getting its global launch on April 29th for PC, iOS, and Android, Kakao Games has confirmed. Pre-loads for Odin: Valhalla Rising will start on April 28th and character name reservations will open alongside the game pre-registrations which start from April 3rd. Those who do pr-register will get a limited edition Viking-themed avatar and mount as well as other rewards.</p>

<p>In Odin: Valhalla Rising, players will be able to explore various realms based upon Norse mythology including Midgaard and Jotunheim as one of four classes. Those classes are Warrior, Sorceress, Priest, and Rogue. Game modes include the 30v30 Valhalla mode, co-op battles, dungeons, and raids. Kakao Games will be adding features further down the line, including a Guild Wars mode. The story of Odin: Valhalla Rising is based upon Ragnarok, with Odin trying to avoid it. He does this by exiling Loki, who doesn’t take this well so awakens different creatures that have been laying dormant in the void of Ginnungagap.</p>

<p><span><span>Nintendo also promised but has not yet shown, a Mineru's Construct Amiibo for the future. Presumably, the Mineru's Construct Amiibo will be a little like Breath of the Wild’s Guardian Amiibo, which was oversized and a little different.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/heres-how-to-pre-order-a-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The long-anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 Direct aired today, and it was jam-packed with announcements, including hardware specs, new Mario Kart, <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/new-sakurai-directed-kirby-air-riders-announced">Kirby</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-is-a-new-nintendo-switch-2-platformer-starring">Donkey Kong</a> games, and a long list of third-party titles coming to the console. The one thing it didn't detail, however, is the pre-order process, which is a little convoluted.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="56edb9ce-2e0e-4efe-b723-cffc17c36b65" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Pre-orders at participating retailers will go live next Wednesday, April 9. At the time of publishing, retailers have yet to prepare their individual pre-order pages (<a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/video-games/nintendo/pcmcat1742407305710.c?id=pcmcat1742407305710#:~:text=Sign%20up%20for%20notifications%20about%20the%20new%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%2C%20games%20and%20more">though Best Buy has a link to sign up for updates</a>), but they will likely be updated within the next few days. That said, based on how recent console launches have gone, it will likely be a fairly frantic process with scalpers attempting to buy up stock to resell at a higher price. Once we learn specific launch times, you'll want to be right on the webpage the moment it goes live to maximize your chances.</p>

<p>To avoid that scramble, you can try to grab your console directly from Nintendo, but there's more to that process than meets the eye. If you head to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/">Nintendo's website</a>, you'll be able to sign up to indicate interest in purchasing a system once they're available. To be clear, this is not a pre-order, but a sign-up list to indicate who might want to pre-order, so there's no payment information required. You will, however, need an active Nintendo account – more on that below. Once you sign in, you can choose between a base system for $449.99 USD or a bundle including a digital version of Mario Kart World for $499.99 USD.</p>

</article><p>The timeline here is different, however. Invitations from Nintendo won't arrive until a month or so after, on Thursday, May 8. They'll also come in waves, with additional invites sent out to eligible accounts until the store is open to the general public. Invitations will also only go to account holders that meet the following "priority criteria":</p>

	<li aria-level="1">That Online Membership must have been active for a minimum of 12 months.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">You must have opted to share gameplay data and played at least 50 hours of games.</li>
</ul><p>If your account fits all three of those criteria, you'll be able to order a console to be shipped to your address – no Nintendo Store pickups are allowed. The link will be active for 72 hours, so it will be less intense than the mad dash on other sites. It also specifies that launch day delivery is not guaranteed and that purchases will be limited to one system per account, though you can also buy accessories for the system.</p>

<p>As wheelchair-bound basketball players, movement involves dragging the Joy-Cons simultaneously to push yourself forward, simulating the movement of pushing a wheelchair. Flicking the controller performs shots, and players can even roll up skateboard-style half-pipes to perform fancy trick dunks. The game’s challenge comes in intuitively using both Joy-Cons at the same time to steer the characters and take it to the hoop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check out the trailer below.</p>

The upcoming multiplayer game will be exclusive to Switch 2.</p>

<p>The reveal trailer follows From Software’s standard of using out-of-context clips, showcasing various characters such as a swordswoman wielding a ringblade and a rocket-powered flying robot. Scenes of a gothic castle complex and cathedral interiors create an oppressive atmosphere, and things take a turn for the bonkers with clips of a guy biting someone’s neck and draining them of a dark substance. A character is also seen transforming into a T-Rex-like monster. From Software describes The Duskbloods as a PvPvE experience, meaning players will face off against other human-controlled characters in addition to in-game enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niKHDEKQ7xA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>What does it all mean? The vague narration stating that “the moontears will flow for one and one alone” doesn’t illuminate much. However, a developer diary with game director Hidetaka Miyazaki will air on April 4 and should, hopefully, explain more. But until then, color us fascinated given From Software’s stellar track record.</p>

<p>The Duskbloods is coming to Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

Sakurai is the originator of both the Kirby franchise and Smash Bros., so his involvement with the new Air Riders is exciting news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Details are scarce on the new game, but footage revealed Kirby flying along on a star beside three of his other-colored Kirby friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The original Kirby Air Ride released on GameCube over 20 years ago. It was a racing game with simplified controls and high-speed course navigation, which also highlighted Kirby’s ability to suck up enemies and absorb their abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, while some games from today’s Nintendo Direct were highlighted as launch games, Kirby Air Riders features no date of launch on Switch 2.</p>

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wilds/Tears of the Kingdom, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Super Mario Party Jamboree, Pokémon Legends Z-A, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond are the first titles confirmed to play better on Switch 2.</p>

<h2>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmDD7JSfhcE" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The Switch 2 editions of the acclaimed titles feature improved resolution and framerates and now support HDR. They’ll also exclusively support a new feature called Zelda Notes, a new feature for the Nintendo Switch app. This app guides players using voice navigation to find hidden Korok and shrines. Players can also share creations with QR codes, which adds it to another player’s game.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/whats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2/">For&nbsp;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members who already own Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, the Switch 2 upgrade packs will be included with your subscription</a>.</p>

<h2>Super Mario Party Jamboree</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0jkSlm6gVA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The Switch 2 addition includes Jamboree TV, an expansion introducing new minigames such as Bowser Live, the mouse-controlled Carnival Coaster, and other games utilizing the Switch 2’s hardware features.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5peJd37J-k" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>In addition to a graphical and framerate bump, Kirby’s 2021 adventure is also getting a Switch 2 exclusive story DLC called Star-Cross World. A meteor strikes the Forgotten Land, transforming it into a crystalized version of itself for Kirby to explore and battle newly transformed enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h2>

</article><p>Those who play the yet-to-be-released Pokémon title on Switch 2 will enjoy enhanced resolutions and framerates</p>

<p>The Switch 2 versions of these titles will be sold as standalone editions (physical and digital). However, those who own the original versions can purchase an Upgrade Pack to get the new versions. Nintendo has not revealed the pricing for the Upgrade Pack or the standalone versions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alongside the games outlined above, Nintendo also shared a number of other Switch 1 games that will get free updates to make them run better on Switch 2 via backwards&nbsp;compatibility.</p>

<ul><li>Arms</li>
	<li>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</li>
	<li>Super Mario Odyssey</li>
	<li>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</li>
	<li>Clubhouse Games 51 Worldwide Classics</li>
	<li>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</li>
	<li>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</li>
	<li>Game Builder Garage</li>
	<li>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</li>
	<li>Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Pokémon Violet</li>
	<li>Big Brain Academy Brain vs Brain</li>
</ul><p>In terms of the specifics of how these games will be affected by the update, Nintendo is unclear but writes, "By connecting your Nintendo Switch 2 to the internet, you can download free updates that may improve performance or add support for features such as GameShare in select games. The contents of these free updates will differ depending on the game."</p>

Among other new features, the right Joy-Con also has a mysterious C button, and now we know what it means. The c stands for chat, meaning the Switch 2 will be the first Nintendo console to have native voice chat.</p>

<p>Pressing the button while playing the console will activate chat mode, which creates a line of boxes at the base of the screen with the people in your party. The microphone is included on the top of the main console, so you can speak freely without needing a second microphone. The feature also allegedly can erase background noise: their example had someone using a blender.</p>

<p>You can also fill these boxes, which normally have profile pictures and soundwaves, with game footage. Whether it's the same game or separate ones, players will be able to see each other's screens, though it looks like the footage will have a heavily reduced frame rate, based on what they showed.</p>



<p>You can also show yourself on screen using the Switch 2 Camera, which launches the same day as the console. It can erase your background, placing you in front of your gameplay, or just show a direct feed of your surroundings, no game included. Some games, like Mario Party Jamboree, will also make use of the camera to include players' heads and their reactions. Unlike the game footage, the frame rate of this footage does not look dramatically reduced, though I'm sure that will depend on your internet speed.</p>

<p>This voice chat feature is collectively known as GameChat. The Switch Online service is required to use it, but there will be a months-long period where that's not the case for the game's launch. That period will last from the console's launch in June to March 31, 2026.</p>

<p>For more Switch 2, check out its big launch title, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/mario-kart-world-is-coming-to-switch-2-at-launch">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

<p><span><span>Up to 24 racers compete in any given race, the most in series history. Mario Kart World still features the traditional four-race Grand Prix, but players will drive to the next course in between races.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Another new addition is Knockout Tour. Competitors must race from one side of the massive map to another, hitting checkpoints along the way. However, each checkpoint allows for only a certain number of racers to pass, such as anyone in 8th place and up. You're eliminated from the race if you arrive below that standing, giving Knockout Tour battle royale-style stakes.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The trailer also briefly shows off a new burger power-up that, when consumed, transforms the racers’ costumes to resemble biker attires. It’s unclear what this power-up does beyond the cosmetic change. The footage also showed clips of karts transforming into planes and boats to travel the air and water, respectively.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Mario Kart World is a Switch 2 exclusive and launches alongside the Switch 2 on June 5. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that it will cost&nbsp;</span></span>$79.99, $10 more than the current $70 price ceiling for triple-A games.&nbsp;<span><span>Nintendo will reveal more about the game in a dedicated Nintendo Direct on April 17. </span></span></p>

GameCube games will be available on Nintendo's new console as part of Nintendo Switch Online services.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0MvkSVs8f_w" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Nintendo revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Soulcalibur II, and F-Zero GX, will be available initially, but promises more games will be coming over time. Nintendo showed&nbsp;Super Mario Sunshine, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, Super Mario Strikers, Chibi Robo, Luigi's Mansion, and Pokémon Colosseum are all on track to be added in the future.</p>

<p>The first games will be available for Switch 2 on its June 5 release date. A GameCube controller will also be available to purchase the same day as Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642025/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-zelda-wind-waker-f-zero-gx<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Before this morning, I knew I was going to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 but I didn’t know when. After watching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct today</a>, in which a purple block traced the GameCube’s stylized “G” logo, followed by high-res footage from <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker </em>and <em>F-Zero GX </em>and an announcement that they’ll be playable at launch, I realized I’ll be doing my damndest to get it on day one. It was the cherry on top of a stellar presentation that made the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">console’s $449.99 price tag</a> way easier to swallow.</p><p>GameCube games are coming to the Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) subscription’s Classic Game Library feature, which the company is now shortening to “Nintendo Classics.” It lets you play games from the NES, SNES, and Sega Genesis. Like the Game Boy and Nintendo 64 game collections, you’ll need the NSO Expansion Pack for GameCube games. The existing catalog of playable Classic Game Library games is far from complete, but together (and combined with DLC for contemporary Switch games), they make the Expansion Pack well worth it.</p><p>The subscription gets even more enticing on the Switch 2, starting before the console even comes out — Nintendo is prioritizing long-time subscribers (with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">certain caveats</a>) when it sends out Switch 2 preorder invites. The Expansion Pack will also let you play the Switch 2 editions of <em>Zelda </em>games <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and<em> Tears of the Kingdom </em>(provided you own their respective Switch 1 versions). </p><p>But the GameCube games are what I’m most excited about. I’d love for the Wii U’s <em>Wind Waker HD</em> to get a Switch re-release, but the GameCube version is still one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played and looks great in Nintendo’s trailer for it. So does <em>F-Zero GX</em>, a game with such well-executed style and tight control that I would pit it against any futuristic racer today. The Switch 2 is also launching with <em>Soul Calibur II</em>, a game that featured adult Link as a playable character in his <a href="https://youtu.be/Q-25c8Rsobw?t=508">post-<em>Ocarina of Time</em> fighting-people-for-sport era</a>.</p><p>The company flashed a few other re-releases coming down the line, like <em>Super Mario Strikers </em>and <em>Chibi-Robo!, </em>in the latter of which you play a tiny, toothbrush-armed robot tasked with cleaning up a very messy house. It’s way more fun than it sounds, and gives me hope for what Nintendo <em>could</em> announce. There are some excellent, but more obscure gems that never really leapt beyond the GameCube, like the creepy, Lovecraft-inspired <em>Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem </em>and <em>Cubivore, </em>in which you play a small, wild cube trying to bring color back to the world by eating other boxy creatures, winning the chance to mate, die, and be reborn over and over again until you’ve become the fittest survivor of them all. </p><p>And all of these will be playable with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641482/nintendo-is-releasing-a-gamecube-controller">forthcoming wireless recreation of the GameCube controller</a>, as they should be. The GameCube wasn’t an abject failure, but it sold nowhere near as well as the Wii or the Switch. There’s no guarantee that the Switch 2 will keep up the sales pace set by its predecessor, but even if it manages half that console’s sales, it could give some games a well-deserved second look. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Nintendo Switch 2</a> offers a fairly massive upgrade when it comes to raw storage space. The 256GB onboard SSD is four times larger than the Switch OLED (64GB) and eight times the size of the original Switch and Switch Lite (32GB). That said, the Switch 2's performance upgrades will inevitably lead to bigger file sizes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">upcoming games</a>, which could compel you to expand your console's storage capacity. Just like its predecessor, the Nintendo Switch 2 has a microSD card slot. But while the Switch worked with basically every microSD card sold in stores, the Switch 2 is only compatible with a very specific type of storage: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DFQKQ9CB,B0DFQGVLYF,B0DYB7ZGR3,B0DYBW1MNC,B0DYB9TNB4&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">microSD Express cards</a>.</p><p>The Express format is a recent advancement in the semiconductor industry that hasn't been widely adopted by manufacturers yet. The Nintendo Switch 2 will certainly increase its adoption rate by both manufacturers and consumers in a hurry. During this week's Nintendo Direct, we learned that both Samsung and SanDisk will be releasing Super Mario-themed microSD Express Cards this year. If you want to get ahead of any potential Switch 2 storage woes, we've put together a brief list and explainer detailing the microSD Express options available now from SanDisk and Lexar. None of the current cards are themed around Nintendo franchises, but you'll probably save some cash by grabbing a non-branded one anyway.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-128GB-microSD-Express-SDSQXFN-128G-GN4NN/dp/B0DFQKQ9CB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SanDisk 128GB microSD Express Card</a> -- $45 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSD-Express-SDSQXFN-256G-GN4NN/dp/B0DFQGVLYF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SanDisk 256GB microSD Express Card</a> -- $60 (<del>$65</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB7ZGR3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar 256GB Play Pro microSD Express Card</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYBW1MNC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar 512GB Play Pro microSD Express Card</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar 1TB Play Pro microSD Express Card</a> -- $200</li></ul><p>For more on the new console, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">GameSpot's Nintendo Switch 2 preorder guide</a>, which includes all of the first-party hardware and games featured in the Nintendo Direct.

For comparison, the SanDisk Ultra is rated for 150MB/s read speeds, and the Extreme can hit 190MB/s.</p><p>Express cards are essentially solid-state drives that can fit on your fingertip. In fact, this card is actually faster than the average SATA SSD.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU\/dp\/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Lexar microSD Express Cards for Nintendo Switch 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU\/dp\/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Available in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB models</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you want to future-proof your Switch 2's storage space, Lexar is the only major manufacturer with microSD Express Cards exceeding 256GB.</p><p>Lexar's Express Play Pro Cards launched in March in three different capacities: 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/641149/nintendo-switch-2-vs-oled-lite-specs-comparison-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Switch 2 is here — well, almost. Nintendo took the wraps off its new console during its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">latest Direct event</a>, providing us with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">a closer look</a> at the $449.99 console ahead of its release on June 5th.</p><p>In many ways, the sequel is a generational leap from<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"> the original console / handheld hybrid</a> that rocked the gaming world over eight years ago. Nintendo is building upon the successful foundation it laid with the original Switch by offering a larger screen, more internal storage, and magnetic Joy-Con controllers that can operate like mice. It’s also introducing some new features, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">GameChat</a>, which lets players make voice calls, screen share, and video chat.</p><p>Below, we’re taking a closer look at the on-paper differences between the Switch 2 and its various predecessors — specifically, the original <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Nintendo Switch</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Nintendo Switch OLED</a>. We’ve even thrown in the handheld-only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date">Nintendo Switch Lite</a>, just for good measure.</p><div><nav><h2>In this article</h2><ul><li><a href="#pricing-and-availability">Pricing and availability</a></li><li><a href="#display-technology">Display technology</a></li><li><a href="#performance-and-battery-life">Performance and battery life</a></li><li><a href="#joy-cons-and-other-controllers">Joy-Cons and other controllers</a></li><li><a href="#storage-dock-and-more">Storage, dock, and more</a></li><li><a href="#games-and-software">Games and software</a></li><li><a href="#by-the-numbers">By the numbers</a></li></ul></nav></div><div><p id="pricing-and-availability"><h2>Pricing and availability</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 will retail for $449.99 at launch, or you can buy it bundled with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> — a Switch 2 exclusive — for $499.99 through the fall 2025 or while supplies last. The standard Switch, meanwhile, still retails for $299.99 while the newer OLED edition costs $349.99. Both models can often be found on sale, as can the cheaper Nintendo Switch Lite, but the OLED variant rarely dips below $299.99.</p><p>Fortunately, like the Switch 2, Nintendo also continues to occasionally sell discounted bundles containing the Switch OLED, a three-month subscription to Nintendo Switch Online, and select games. The latest, which launched less than a month ago for MAR10 Day, contains a digital copy of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623966/nintendo-switch-oled-mario-wonder-mar10-day-bundle"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a> for $349.99.</p><div><p id="display-technology"><h2>Display technology</h2></p></div><p>With a 7.9-inch 1080p LCD screen, the Switch 2’s display is noticeably larger than that of prior Switch models. The original Switch panel comes in at 6.2 inches while the display on the Switch OLED stretches the screen to a respectable seven inches (both support 1,280 x 720 resolution in handheld mode or 1080p when docked). The Switch Lite is the smallest of the bunch with a 5.5-inch 720p display and no docking option.</p><div><p id="performance-and-battery-life"><h2>Performance and battery life</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2’s predecessors use a custom version of Nvidia’s Tegra X1 chipset, which uses an octacore Arm CPU and a Maxwell-based Nvidia GPU that’s in league with the 900-series graphics cards that ruled the era. The power handily eclipsed smartphones of the time, but lagged well behind the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One that launched years prior. Still, that hasn’t stopped developers from producing critically acclaimed games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/17/23403042/persona-5-royal-nier-automata-nintendo-switch-review">excellent ports of several popular titles</a> within the last several years.</p><p>Nintendo has yet to divulge many technical details about the Switch 2’s new Nvidia chipset, only stating that it offers “significantly improved CPU and GPU performance” compared to the original Switch. We also know that the processor will allow for 4K gameplay at up to 60 frames per second in docked mode or 1080p at up to 120fps (with a variable refresh rate) in handheld mode. </p><p>As for battery life, you can eke out between 4.5 and nine hours on the Switch and Switch OLED. Nintendo says the Switch 2 can last between 2.5 and 6.5 hours, depending on usage, and takes approximately three hours to charge, just like previous models. </p><div><p id="joy-cons-and-other-controllers"><h2>Joy-Cons and other controllers</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 will feature longer, magnetic Joy-Con slots for a more secure connection. Instead of sliding the controllers into a side-mounted rail, you instead push them into a recessed slot. In addition, each Joy-Con 2 will feature “more durable” analog sticks and function like a mouse in certain scenarios, allowing you to control functionality in select games by simply sliding them across a flat surface.</p><p>The Joy-Cons that came with the original Switch were available in multiple colors. The Switch 2 controllers, meanwhile, come in a black colorway with red and blue accents surrounding the analog sticks. Matching colors drape the entirety of the attachment point where the shoulder buttons are located, which is visible when using a Joy-Con as a single controller. The inside of the attachment area also matches the Joy-Cons’ respective colors, and the right Joy-Con now features a “C” button for accessing various GameChat features.</p><p>If you find Joy-Cons too cramped, rest assured that Nintendo also introduced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">new Pro Controller</a> during its recent Direct event. Along with customizable rear buttons and a 3.5mm audio jack, it sports the aforementioned “C” button found on the Joy-Con 2, which launches a chat menu when pressed. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/24/14699044/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-hands-on-preview">Nintendo’s original pro-grade model</a>, it also features bigger buttons and triggers than the Joy-Cons, but will cost $79.99 (up from $69.99).</p><div><p id="storage-dock-and-more"><h2>Storage, dock, and more</h2></p></div><p>In terms of storage, the Switch 2 offers 256GB of internal space, which is eight times the storage capacity of the original Switch and four times that of the Switch OLED. You can add up to 2TB of additional storage using microSD Express cards, too, which offer faster read and write speeds than your standard microSD card.</p><p>Other notable hardware tweaks include an additional USB-C port on the top of the console and a built-in microphone with noise filtering, so you can chat with friends using Nintendo’s new Discord-like GameChat feature. GameChat also lets you screen share and make video calls via the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">new Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</a>. Nintendo has added a redesigned, U-shaped adjustable kickstand to the Switch 2 as well, which spans the width of the display.</p><p>As for the Nintendo Switch 2 dock, it comes with a built-in ethernet port just like the Switch OLED dock, whereas the original dock requires an optional adapter. The new dock also features a pair of USB-C ports, as opposed to just one, while retaining an HDMI port. </p><div><p id="games-and-software"><h2>Games and software</h2></p></div><div><p>The<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/1/13/14241960/nintendo-switch-launch-titles-prices-release-dates"> original Switch had about a dozen titles</a> available at launch, with dozens more released by the end of 2017. As of writing, Nintendo has announced a number of Switch 2 launch titles, including first-party games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and third-party titles such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two"><em>Split Fiction</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>.

That said, Nintendo says some older titles may have some in-game compatibility issues, including <em>Doom: Eternal, Rocket League, NBA 2K25,</em> and <em>Warframe.</em> You also won’t be able to make use of Nintendo’s creative VR kit (sorry, <em>Labo</em> fans).</p><div><p id="by-the-numbers"><h2>By the numbers</h2></p></div><p>The standard Switch and Switch OLED are nearly identical on paper, but the Switch 2 has many notable upgrades.
