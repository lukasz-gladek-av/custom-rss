            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We last caught wind of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> back in July, when developer Feral Interactive announced that it was bringing its latest remake to Switch at some point in 2025, with a Switch 2 edition to follow. Things have remained quiet on the Switch 2 front, but today, we've had news of the Switch 1 version, and it's arriving <em>next week</em>.</p>
<p>Yep, you read that correctly. Hitman: Absolution will land on Switch 1 on <strong>13th November</strong> for <strong>£19.99 / $29.99 / €24,99</strong>. The new trailer (above) showcases the 2012 stealth game in action on Nintendo's hybrid, and it looks, well, much as we remember it. But hey, more Hitman is never a bad thing!</p>
<p>Like Feral's recent mobile release, Absolution on Switch will be getting a 'Contracts Mode' update next year, where you'll be able to set challenges against friends and compete for high scores.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screens from Feral Interactive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MORE THAN A NUMBER<br></strong>The story of Absolution puts Agent 47’s character under the spotlight, where his loyalties and his conscience are both put to the test.<br>
<strong>TAILORED TO NINTENDO SWITCH<br></strong>Featuring gyro aiming for ultimate precision, Absolution is fully optimised for Nintendo Switch and tailored for play at home or on the go.<br>
<strong>KILLER INSTINCT<br></strong>Use Instinct Mode to identify targets, predict enemy movements, and highlight points of interest.<br>
<strong>CLEAR YOUR PATH<br></strong>Point Shooting lets you stop time, mark multiple enemies, and eliminate them in a heartbeat.<br>
<strong>MASTER THE CRAFT<br></strong>Find new ways to take out your marks, complete Challenges, and perfect your technique.<br>
<strong>PLAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN<br></strong>Choose from 5 different difficulty settings, from easy to the insanely hard Purist mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"But what about the Switch 2 version?" you may, rightfully, ask. Well, we still don't know yet. Feral stated on <a href="https://x.com/feralgames/status/1986459928525938858">Twitter</a> that it will "have more to say about the Switch 2 next year," and fans should "keep an eye out for further announcements". So, we guess we'll do exactly that!</p>
<p>As a reminder, IO Interactive brought Hitman World of Assassination to Switch 2 earlier this year, though a wealth of performance issues meant that it wasn't in the best state at launch. A subsequent patch helped things move in the right direction, but let's hope that Feral Interactive can make Absolution stronger out of the gate.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-gen-ai-square-enix-qa-bugs-2000641688</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-publisher-plans-to-offload-70-percent-of-qa-work-to-generative-ai.1345972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Square Enix is currently in the middle of a reboot. Following a bunch of flops (<a href="https://kotaku.com/foamstars-review-splatoon-ps5-is-it-good-square-enix-1851239389">remember<em> Foamstars</em></a>?) and some great games held back by timed exclusivity (<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>), the RPG publisher has been pivoting to a <a href="https://kotaku.com/square-enix-business-plan-multiplatform-1851472456">multiplatform approach and retooling its slate of upcoming releases</a>. It’s also, apparently, making a big push into leveraging generative AI. The company announced a new goal of having 70 percent of quality assurance and game debugging work handled by generative AI by 2027.</p> <p>“Through the use of automation technology, [we] aim to improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development,” reads <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">a new presentation</a> updating investors on Square Enix’s business strategy (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/"><em>VGC</em></a>). The project developed out of an AI-themed “idea contest” the company held, and will be part of a joint research initiative with Matsuo Laboratory at the University of Tokyo. Is this a real plan or just a way to impress investors with buzzwords?</p>

 <p>Square Enix isn’t the only company trying to apply generative AI tools to QA. While some companies <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">get lampooned</a> for letting AI slop infest concept art or even finished loading screens that appear in the game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-matt-booty-qa-crunch-ai-mistreatment-1849496926">others have argued</a> that the job of discovering and documenting bugs is one where LLM technology will be most useful. An AI data firm <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-30-of-game-devs-believe-ai-will-play-an-extremely-important-role-in-qa-testing">claimed earlier this year</a> that 30 percent of respondents to a developer survey believed AI would play an “extremely important role” in QA testing.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm convinced that statement from Square is to just get shareholders excited, because what is GenAi really gonna say when something like this pops up? Can it even critically understand what it's looking at to report the issue accurately? <a href="https://t.co/VJ5r67Fu27">pic.twitter.com/VJ5r67Fu27</a></p> <p>— Del (@TheCartelDel) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCartelDel/status/1986413587561390345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But will it actually be any good or save studios time and money? Veteran game artist Del Walker pointed out a recent bug in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> by which a costume completely breaks a character’s model during certain animations. “What is GenAi really gonna say when something like this pops up?” he wrote <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1986413587561390345">on X</a>. “Can it even critically understand what it’s looking at to report the issue accurately?”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-s-qa-department-seems-like-a-hellho-1847473158">Quality assurance</a> has long been at the bottom of the hierarchy when it comes to game development prestige and pay, despite bugs and glitches being the first things to go viral during a game launch, setting the tone of how big-budget games are perceived. They can also make or break its initial reception if things are particularly bad. <em>Fallout 76</em> was particularly bad when it first released and was infamous early on for important updates that found new ways to accidentally break the game.</p> <p>QA, in other words, is very important, but it can also be very labor intensive. If we know one thing about companies its that they love results and hate having to pay people to produce them. It’s easy to envision a way forward where developers on the studio floor are able to experiment with new tools and see whether they work before committing to ambitious goals that replace expertise with automation. That probably doesn’t sound as good in a PowerPoint presentation, though.</p>

<p>Sony San Diego has, as expected, officially announced MLB The Show 26. While no platforms or release date were confirmed, the studio did give players, what it calls, a “sneak peek” for what to expect from the latest installment in the franchise. </p>



<p>Specifically, Sony San Diego touched on gameplay, Franchise Mode, Road to the Show, Diamond Dynasty, and the season four of The Negro Leagues storylines.</p>



<h2 id="h-mlb-the-show-26-first-details">MLB The Show 26 First Details</h2>



<p>Regarding gameplay, <a href="https://theshow.com/news/mlb-the-show-26-first-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the studio says that</a> the goal remains “delivering the most authentic on-field baseball experience.” They say that this year will focus on “advanced logic and new data metrics” along with redefined player ratings, bat ball physics, and pitch effects. </p>



<p>For Franchise Mode, MLB The Show 26 will “continue evolving the front office experience by building deeper, more immersive, and challenging systems shaped by community feedback.” Road to the Show builds off the changes started in MLB The Show 25 with more colleges to choose from and a larger focus on a player’s mid-to-late career.</p>



<p>Within Diamond Dynasty, Sony wants to deliver “engaging content for players to live their MLB fantasy as well as new ways to play and use your squads.” </p>



<p>And, lastly, The Negro Leagues Storylines will include more moments that defined the careers of players that were “talented yet often overlooked”.</p>



<p>More specifics, Sony San Diego says, will start to come in early 2026. That will include details such as platforms, the release date, cover athletes, and more. </p>

                <p>Ubisoft's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is getting a new expansion, From the Ashes, later this year to coincide with the release of James Cameron's Avatar: Fire and Ash in theaters. Ubisoft has now shared some more information about the expansion, including its length.</p><p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/avatar/frontiers-of-pandora/news-updates/12Y5efVFVWZwiblGQCIR1C" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> From the Ashes is estimated to include "roughly" 20 hours of content. However, how long it may take you to spend completing the content will depend on your preferred playstyle. "The overall length will vary," Ubisoft said.</p><p>Players have to own Frontiers of Pandora to play From the Ashes, but the expansion's content is accessible right from the main menu. There are no completion requirements to get started.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXBW2alPp50" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JXBW2alPp50" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Since Frontiers of Pandora originally came out back in 2023, some people might want to be reminded of the story before playing From the Ashes. To that end, Ubisoft created a "short recap video" that people can watch to get up to speed.</p><p>The $25 expansion launches on December 19, which is the same day the movie Fire and Ash hits theaters. Players need a copy of the base game to play, or they can buy the $40 Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes Edition, which includes the base game and the DLC.</p><p>Ubisoft is also selling a Complete Edition of the game for $60, and it includes the main game, the From the Ashes expansion, and the Season Pass.</p><p>In From the Ashes, you play as So'lek, and the story is about grief and vengeance, Ubisoft said. A free update coming to Frontiers of Pandora on December 5 will add a third-person mode, but the From the Ashes content can be played in either first- or third-person.</p><p>Ubisoft will broadcast a deep dive for From the Ashes on November 20, so check back soon for more.</p>

<figure data-uuid="7751340a518eb"><a title="A Link to the Past" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7751340a518eb/a-link-to-the-past.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Analytics firm <a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/">Ampere Analysis</a> has posted a list of games it believes would greatly benefit from a remake or remaster (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ip-holders-are-sitting-on-a-wealth-of-content-analytics-firm-lists-18-games-ripe-for-remake-or-remaster-success/">VGC</a>). This is supposedly based on analysis of the market and consumer behaviours and attitudes – otherwise, we could just as easily pluck a bunch of games from thin air that we think need remakes!</p>
<p>What caught our eye straight away was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, both of which are, according to Ampere, prime candidates for full remakes. Now, we'd be happy to make a case for Chrono Trigger; especially if Square Enix wants to opt for the HD-2D style it's been evolving in recent years. A Link to the Past, though? Hmm, we're not sure about that.</p>
<p>The thing is with top-down Zelda games is that, in our opinion, they kind of need to <em>stay</em> top-down. And considering the game has already received a sequel in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_a_link_between_worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a>, we're not entirely convinced it really needs a remake.</p>
<p>Ampere writer Katie Holt says that while long-time fans consider it a high point in the series, “its dungeon and world design can be considered outdated, and the narrative is relatively linear by today’s standards”. In addition, searching for “The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past remake” on Reddit returns an astonishing 48,200 results, and Nintendo would supposedly be wise to approach it in a similar way to the Switch remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Ampere believes that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time_3d">Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</a> would benefit from a remake or a remaster – they're supposedly not fussed which. And yeah, we could get on board with this. With the 40th anniversary looming, we wouldn't be surprised to see Nintendo revisit what is arguably one of the most influential 3D adventure games of all time.</p>
<p>Here's the list of games from Ampere Analysis:</p>
<h3>Remake</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assassin’s Creed</li>
<li>Chrono Trigger</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</li>
<li>Fallout</li>

<li>Resident Evil 5</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fx-9590-cpu-is-pushed-to-its-limits-to-run-battlefield-6-managing-to-achieve-playable-framerates.1345924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Despite lacking TPM 2.0 support, the old AMD FX-9590 CPU is capable of running Battlefield 6, and even at playable framerates.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@FullyBuffered">Fully Buffered</a> attempted to run the latest entry in the series by EA on two old CPUs, the Intel Core i7-2600K and the aforementioned AMD FX-9590. While the game wouldn't launch on the Intel CPU due to the lack of Secure Boot support, the AMD CPU could launch and run the game, having Secure Boot support. As such, it seems like not supporting TPM 2.0 doesn't prevent a CPU from running the game, as lacking SecureBoot support does.</p>



<p>Although the AMD FX-9590 is an old CPU released over 10 years ago, it runs Battlefield 6 surprisingly well, paired with an RX 5700 8 GB GPU. In Conquest mode with a total of 64 players, the game runs at a mid-30s FPS range, occasionally reaching the 40s range at 1080p resolution, which is very impressive for an older CPU. In other game modes, and by lowering the resolution, the game even hits the mid-40s range. Unsurprisingly, all of the CPU's core are pushed to their limit to run the game, hitting 98% utilization at 4,65 GHz.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>An old CPU, such as the AMD FX-9590, running Battlefield 6 as well as it does, confirms the greater attention the development team put into optimizing the game and ensuring it could run well even on low-spec systems. Before the game launched, technical director Christian Buhl confirmed that <span>among the millions of players who joined the Battlefield 6 open beta,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/" target="_blank">a substantial number were on minimum specs or below.</a>&nbsp;Therefore, it was essential</span> for the team to optimize for these low specs to ensure all players could enjoy the game. Overcoming the technical limitations of the Xbox Series S also made <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/">Battlefield 6 a better game from a technical standpoint.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">David Carcasole's review.</a></p>

            <p>With a final lick, the weasel expires. Its head is mine. I slink back to my nest and shove this new head onto my strangely thick duck neck. Then, I take off in a flutter and scutter of beetle wings and legs. I pass an Oscar the grouch-style bloke in a basket selling animal body parts for crystals. Ahead lies a giant salamander wearing a fedora. He asks me to go and steal some eggs from an ant queen who's wearing an actual crown. I refuse. We fight. He keeps whistling for backup. My weasel head bites away, an openly terrified expression written across its whiskers.</p>
<p>That, in so many words, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2463690/Strange_Seed/">Strange Seed</a>, which came out in full yesterday and also has a demo I've gioven a go for this article. It's a cartoonish evolution murderfest from devs Chronicle Games, who cite E.V.O.: Search for Eden and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a>’s creature stage as their inspirations.</p>

<p>I'm quite young, and so haven't gotten around to playing either of those games. I've still found Strange Seed charmingly weird and weirdly charming. Well, at least when I'm managing not to think about what its central loop entails too much. You begin as a purple blob which drops off a tree, and quite jovially sets about replacing its blob body parts with those of creatures inhabiting the forest.</p><p>You murder these creatures and other blobs by licking, biting, or charging them, and they turn into a hunk of meat on a bone. You gobble this up for health, biomass which'll allow you to equip more animal parts, and animal parts themselves. Some can be talked to. For example, early on you meet a lonely duck. He'll only let you be his friend if you've got a duck's long neck. You murder another duck, take the neck from its hunk of death meat, and voilà, he's your mate. For five seconds, after which point you murder him for more duck parts.</p>
<p>To equip new parts, you claim nests, which I'm probably going to risk pissing people off by likening to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s sites of grace. They're spots of brief respite that act as respawn points throughout the world and also allow you to switch up your animal part loadout. What you equip is limited by what you've found, but also how many bits of biomass murders and exploration have earned, with some animal parts being more effective, but taking up more of your biomass limit while they're active.</p>
<p>You also find powerups while exploring which allow you to upgrade the mass of a body part. These all offer different stat boots, and the health one's linked to your neck. So, if you're minded similarly to me, odds are your head'll end up mounted on a tree trunk. Though, that might just be because I'm a bit crap at timing my licks and charges to quickly take out fairly tough beetles. I've found one boss so far - the salamander who speaks like a cockney gangster that I mentioned earlier. It's going to take a fair bit more murder-grinding before I can beat him.</p>
<p>I may well end up doing it though. Despite the constant freakish body horror, Strange Seed's got a chuckle-worthy charisma that hasn't quite worn off on me yet and is janky in the right ways rather than annoying performance ones thus far. You can check out the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3224660/Strange_Seed_Demo/">Steam</a> if it sounds up your alley.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Hello and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of interesting news and other stuff you might care about. It’s weird to me that<a href="https://kotaku.com/gremlins-3-announced-2027-speilberg-call-of-duty-sequel-chris-columbus-2000641675"> WB is making a <em>Gremlins 3</em></a>, but hey, if it features a lot of gross puppets bouncing around like cartoon maniacs, I’ll be there day one to enjoy it. Anyway, today we have news about a <em>Roblox</em> movie, <em>Overcooked</em> is becoming a reality show, and the story of an NBA player who kicked ass to spite a kid he met in a video game.</p> <h2><strong>NBA player was heckled in <em>NBA 2K26</em> and then scored 46 points as revenge</strong></h2> <p>On Wednesday night, Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell had a great game against the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring 46 points and eight assists to help the Cavs grab a victory. When asked afterward about his performance, Mitchell revealed that he played so well because he was taunted by someone, possibly a kid, while playing<em> NBA 2K26</em>. <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1986382376843551086">Here’s what he said</a>, according to CBS Sports:</p>

 <blockquote><p>You have moments where it’s like–obviously, you play this game and you’re trying to win–but this was just a cool day as a whole for me. And obviously, to have the night I had was definitely special as well. But I wouldn’t put the game I had based on the court.</p> <p>This kid pissed me off today, I was playing <em>2K.</em> I had been playing <em>2K</em> for like two hours, and I told him, too, I said ‘Just wait.’ He called me ‘Washed up,’ he called me a bunch of things. But I love it. He said he hadn’t seen a highlight from me in a minute. I just told him, ‘alright, we’ll see.’ He told me to ‘go to sleep.’ He was going in. So this game was for that kid or grown man or whoever that was. So I appreciate you. I told him I’d give him a shoutout, too. So that’s what tonight was…</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>Yup, Hollywood is making a <em>Roblox</em> movie</strong></h2> <p>Production company <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/">Story Kitchen announced</a> that it is now developing a feature film based on the hit <em>Roblox</em> game <em>Grow a Garden, </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824">one of the most popular user-created games</a> available in the free-to-play online metaverse for kids. At one point, <em>Grow a Garden</em> had over 20 million concurrent users, making it one of the most popular video games on the planet and beating everything on Steam.</p>

 <p>“<em>Grow a Garden</em> is exactly the kind of imaginative, heartfelt world we love to adapt,” said Story Kitchen co-founders Dmitri M. Johnson and Michael Lawrence Goldberg, “an uplifting story-world rooted in play, creativity, and community.” No release date for this one, and considering that Story Kitchen is already working on a slew of other video game adaptations–including <em>Split Fiction, It Takes Two, Sifu, Shinobi, </em>and <em>Toejam and Earl</em>–but has yet to complete and release most of them, I’m not holding my breath that this actually gets made. But we shall see.</p>

 <h2><strong>Netflix working on reality cooking show based on <em>Overcooked</em></strong></h2> <p>Speaking of video games getting turned into movies and TV shows, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/">Netflix has announced that it is working with A24</a> to develop a reality cooking show competition based on the hit co-op cooking game <em>Overcooked</em>. The game’s original devs are involved, and it’s reportedly going to be similar to Netflix’s other popular cooking shows, like <em>Nailed It.</em> While I enjoyed <em>Overcooked</em>, the game is nearly a decade old at this point, and it feels like perhaps Netflix waited too long to do something with it.</p> <h2><strong><em>Marvel Rivals</em> reveals new heroes via sneaky patch notes tease</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel-rivals-rogue-gambit-patch-notes/">As spotted by <em>Polygon</em></a>, on Wednesday, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> developer NetEase Games <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20251105/41548_1269153.html">posted some patch notes</a> for the popular hero shooter. And if you look closely at the top image of the post, you’ll spot what looks like Rogue and Gambit, two famous X-Men characters, hidden in the artwork. These heroes have been rumored to be coming to the game for some time now, alongside many others, so it’s not shocking that it looks like these two mutants will be making the leap to <em>Rivals</em> in the near future.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">Rockstar claims fired devs were leaking secrets</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonics-latest-outing-is-a-grim-fall-guys-knock-off-with-60-skins-2000641427">The new <em>Sonic</em> game suuuuuccccckkkks</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355"><em>Battlefield 6′</em>s drone glitch is still causing problems, but a fix is coming soon</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

              <p>Last week, developer Embark Studios published their 2025<i> Arc Raiders</i> roadmap detailing what’s coming to the PvPvE extraction shooter through the rest of November and&nbsp; December. This includes a newly revealed 1.1.0 update that went live today, with some features arriving this weekend. But while fans are chiming in with requests for new features, some also want <i>Arc Raiders</i> to keep some surprises up its sleeves.</p> <p>Here’s where things stand in the massive hit multiplayer shooter a week since launch. Also, I have an epic video of someone taking down a Bastion with a pickaxe at the end. But first the game’s latest set of patch notes:</p> <h2>Patch 1.1.0 updates and changes</h2> <p>Thursday<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/590661232047948062?l=english">’s 1.1.0 patch notes</a> detail some welcome quality-of-life changes, as well as a sneak peak of what’s dropping into the game on November 8 .</p>

 <p>Over the weekend, <i>Arc Raiders</i> will see three new map conditions arrive. For the uninitiated, map conditions change up what you can expect while out on the battlefield. For example, a “Lush Blooms” condition on a map means that you can expect more plant life and more fruits to harvest than normal.</p>

 <p>Following the latest update, Hidden Bunker, Electromagnetic Storm, and a Night Raid in Blue Gate will be added to the game. Hidden Bunker, as you can imagine, is a hidden loot spot you’ll have to unlock. Electromagnetic Storm (which was available during the Server Slam) sees deadly lightning strikes pose a risk to anyone on the map–maybe fire up some <i>Final Fantasy X</i> to prepare yourself?</p>

 <p>Right now, however, folks can expect the following tweaks to <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ gameplay:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Fixed the issue where the Integrated Shield Recharger was only recharging when equipped.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed an issue where Augment skills sometimes did not work.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed exploit using deployables pushing players through walls.</li> <li aria-level="1">Added a charge progress for Integrated Shield repair.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed an issue where Health Regen skills wouldn’t work if they were triggered while DBNO.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed the bug where the Well-Travelled achievement wouldn’t register.</li> <li aria-level="1">Barricades can no longer be placed near zipline exit points.</li> <li aria-level="1">Added the Punch Hands emote (preorder bonus) in game.</li> <li aria-level="1">Changed the schedule so new Map Conditions become available Saturday.</li> </ul> <p>The most significant of these is the inability to plant a barricade in front of a zipline exit. Barricades are really generous with where they can be placed, letting you effectively block off doors. It seemed like only a matter of before this exploit was nerfed.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ roadmap details a new map, new gear, and snow!</h2> <p><a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/">Later on in November</a>, folks can expect a new map to unlock the currently inaccessible “Stella Montis.” There’s also some new Arc enemies on the way called the “Matriarch” and “Shredder.” There will also be some new quests, and new guns with which to take them on.</p>

  <p>The December updates, however, sound even cooler. The maps will experience snow as a new environmental condition and the game’s first expedition departure window will open up.</p>

 <p>What’s an expedition? Instead of a global server wipe that nukes everyone’s gear, <i>Arc Raiders</i> has a unique seasonal mechanic that encourages you to invest a ton of gathered loot into a “Project” to build a caravan. Once you finish it, and once there’s an expedition departure window available, you can send your Raider out on a permanent expedition, allowing you to start up a new one.</p> <p>This will reset all your skill points and clear out your stash, as well as your workshop upgrades. You’ll keep all your cosmetics and your new Raider will also get an XP boost, extra materials from our pal Scrappy, easier weapon repairs, and more space in your stash.</p> <p>Most survival games have some kind of mechanic for wiping everyone’s progress, otherwise the game would just turn into a warzone of folks perpetually hoarding and stocking up on their best gear forever. We’ll see if this one can help make <i>Arc Raiders</i> palatable to casual players where other hardcore extraction shooters like <i>Escape from Tarkov</i> have failed.</p>

 <p>If you’re working on your Caravan right now, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1opk2ti/psa_for_all_raiders_dont_scrap_these_items/">OrganicAppointment43 on Reddit has kindly shared</a> a list of every piece of loot you’ll need to put it together:</p>   <h2>Fans still want some surprises kept secret</h2> <p>Since the early preview tests of the game, many fans have been asking for quality-of-life features like the ability to craft more of an item directly from a right-click submenu without diving into the various workshop submenus. One thing it seems many fans <i>don’t</i> want, however, is to know about future Arc enemies.</p>

   <p>“It would be very cool if new ARC just started appearing randomly,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1op9f2e/please_embark_keep_new_arc_units_secret/">a popular post on the game’s</a> subreddit says. Some players basically want the game to mimic <i>Helldivers 2</i>’s more organic way of evolving in which the developers don’t explicitly telegraph every change ahead of time.</p> <p>I have to echo this sentiment. So much of what makes a match of <i>Arc Raiders</i> fun is when the “unknown” happens: A Leaper arrives when you weren’t expecting it, a Tick jumps down on your face in true <i>Alien</i> facehugger fashion from a hiding spot you never anticipated, and so on. We know we’re getting two new Arc this month, but it sure would be nice if a few of the future ones remained a little hidden and were rolled out in secret.</p> <h2>Behold: Someone took down a Bastion with a friggin’ Pickaxe</h2> <p>If you’ve played any amount of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, you know your pickaxe is essential for breaking into caches and can prove a deadly melee weapon in a pinch. But as Reddit user NotaFTCAgent demonstrates, it can also deliver <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/last_night_i_had_my_lowest_low_so_far_lost_all_my/">a satisfying final blow to a friggin Bastion</a>:</p>    <p>Call him <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/comment/nmz5994/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">John of Arc</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/comment/nn1baqv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Marc Raider</a>, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/comment/nn1s9q3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">THOR with Mjolnir</a>, the dude needs a medal for that one.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p><strong>"</strong>What happens when a legendary franchise reveals one of its most anticipated experiences? ... Only to become the game everyone loves to hate?" the narrator asks at the start of the video. "When conversation shifts from gameplay to ideology? When everything you say only adds fuel to the fire? And when the voices you thought were with you actually turn against you."</p><p>The video's narrator described the ire Ubisoft experienced after it revealed Shadows in 2024. To combat the ferocity, the company "had to stop focusing on those who hated us [and] start firing up our allies." Doing that meant one thing, according to the narrator: Ubisoft had to lean on The Assassin's Creed brand.</p><p>"We started by doing the last thing anyone would have advised. We delayed the game," the narrator continued. "The extra time allowed the devs to polish, optimize, and reach the high standards fans expect from an Assassin’s Creed game. It also gave us time to rebuild the Assassin’s Creed brand pact, putting the markers of the franchise back at the center. More hood, more stealth, more leap of faith, more lore. So we could show that the spirit of Assassin’s Creed lives on in Shadows."</p><p>The video lathers on this corporate speak for the rest of its runtime, according to a transcript in that November 5 Game File report. The narrator says that, by showing the game and letting the experience speak for itself, Ubisoft won fans back, shifted the conversation, and found the confidence to "stand tall, to take risks, to speak up, even against the loudest haters." There's no explicit mention of who the "haters" were, and Guillemot doesn't define the backlash Shadows faced in his remarks after the video either. However, he did hint at the "fake fights" caused by the tension between gameplay and history.</p><p>"We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,” Guillemot said. "And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message.</p><p>"What we saw is that, by allowing our fans to see in the game--everything they were going to be able to rediscover--of what they love about Assassin’s Creed, [that] ultimately helped to combat this aggression, which is linked to the fact that video games have a very strong impact on the people who play them," Guillemot continued. "And so they’re kind of caught between 'I want to play, and what interests me is self-expression within a game' and 'there is a cultural message that comes with the video game.' So our goal is really to be able to ensure that our fans discover and defend what they expect from our games. It very quickly eliminated the fights, which were just fake fights."</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows received intense backlash for Yasuke, a Black slave who became a retainer for Oda Nobunaga, making him a samurai by association. The game was slammed for everything from being "woke propaganda" to featuring historical inaccuracies, and grew so intense that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/" data-ref-id="1100-6535320">Ubisoft reportedly canceled a Civil War-inspired Assassin's Creed game</a> as a direct result. Despite all the controversy surrounding Shadows' Black co-protagonist, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-5-million-players-2-billion-stealth-kills/1100-6533351/" data-ref-id="1100-6533351">the game still reached five million players</a> just five months after its February 14 launch.</p><p>The game, which received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">an 8/10 in GameSpot's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-expansion-launches-in-september/1100-6533445/" data-ref-id="1100-6533445">the Claws of Awaji expansion</a> that introduced tons of new content.

            <p>The Dispatch original soundtrack will be coming to music streaming services in late November / December of this year. However, a certain special song present in the latest batch of episodes won't be present.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, a PR representative confirmed that there were plans to bring the original score for Dispatch to music services after the conclusion of episode 8, though an exact date when these original songs will be streamable has yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>As of writing, you can listen to much of the original score for Dispatch on the official Adhoc Studios YouTube channel, including the most recent upload of episode 5 &amp; 6's score. However, a certain song is absent from that upload. The song itself is a spoiler<strong>, which we'll discuss below.</strong></p>

<p>That song that won't be making it to streaming services is Flambae's karaoke cover of Meredith Brooks - Bitch, which plays in full during the credits of Episode 5. When asked whether Flambae's cover will also be making it to streaming services, a representative of Adhoc told Eurogamer: "We can't upload the Flambae cover, sadly. Maybe in the future, but right now we can't."</p><p>When asked why they can't include it on soundtracks, the spokesperson said that while the track itself is licensed, they: "don't have rights to throw it on soundtracks". However, they also added that they might consider re-negotiating this in the future. Given the success of Dispatch so far, this seems like a good move.</p>
<p>Dispatch has proven exceptionally popular since its initial batch of episodes came out in October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kapow-episodic-gaming-really-is-back-on-the-map-the-dispatch-success-story-continues">with the latest two episodes causing a new peak in players on Steam</a>. The game is selling well too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">pushing past 1m copies sold in ten days</a>.</p>

<h2>Switch 2 eShop - New Releases</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe">Goodnight Universe</a></strong> <em>(Skybound Games, 11th Nov, $19.99)</em> - You are Isaac, a 6-month-old baby, developing mysterious psychic powers.

It's a pretty short one overall with few surprises, but one question regarding the Mario Kart franchise definitely piqued our interest.</p>
<p>Essentially, the query raises the possibility of another IP surpassing the sales of the Mario Kart franchise on Switch 2. As we know, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has already sold 9.57 million units on new console, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is comfortably the best-selling Switch game at an astonishing 69.56 million units.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_PuEn0ZOn5c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt_PuEn0ZOn5c" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f036rxnitv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Shigeru Miyamoto answered by stating that Nintendo has always worked with the belief that "there are no limits", citing the comparisons made between <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> and other films released around the same time. If the film has reached number one, Nintendo believes it can always strive to do more.</p>
<p>He goes on to say that the if a new IP resonates with players, then it could absolutely go on to commercial success. But then he counters this by stating that Mario Kart would continue to sell regardless, and so "it may never be surpassed".</p>
<p>Amusingly, he then recalls a conversation with <strong>Pokémon</strong> creator Satoshi Tajiri. Speaking about the creation of Pokémon in Japan, Tajiri had supposedly joked with Miyamoto, stating “if you want to surpass Nintendo’s Mario, you’ll have to sell two copies of the software to each customer". This is apparently one of the driving forces behind the decision to create <strong>Pokémon Red and Green</strong>.</p>
<p>Surpassing Mario Kart will definitely be a tricky task for any publisher, including Nintendo itself. Not even the might of games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> could knock Mario Kart 8 Deluxe off its throne.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how things pan out with the Switch 2 in the years to come.</p>

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, one of the best games in 2025, and one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-ultimate-game-of-the-year-award-major-indies-stacked/">games contending for game of the year</a> is going to be <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/news/play-kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-for-free-this-weekend-on-steam">free for players to try on Steam and Xbox Series X/S starting today</a>, November 6, 2025, until this coming Monday, November 10, 2025. This free weekend comes just ahead of the launch of its third and final DLC, Mysteria Ecclesiae, which launches on November 11, 2025.</p>



<p>Along with the free weekend, if you do decide to grab the full game, then you'll get it at a 40% off discount on both Steam and Xbox, though PlayStation fans seem to be left out of the fun, as there is no mention of a free weekend for PlayStation or a discount on PlayStation consoles.</p>

<p>When Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 released at the beginning of this year in February, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Wccftech's reviewer, Chris Wray, gave the game a 10/10, writing</a>, "<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>

			<p>A new Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will launch together with the Valley of Memory expansion to introduce gameplay changes and new features, Ubisoft confirmed.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/it-it/game/assassins-creed/news/62bserGVoUbHQPrsGCasOU/assassins-creed-mirage-new-gameplay-features-and-valley-of-memory-expansion">The new update</a> launching together with <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-free-dlc-release-date-reveal-november/">the free expansion on November 18</a> on all formats will introduce some brand new features, starting with the ability to replay all black box missions and contracts after they have been cleared once. Each replayable mission presents distinct challenges that require players to approach these missions creatively, such as avoiding the use of Eagle Vision, targeting only the main enemy, and more. Completing these missions grants the player exclusive in-game rewards usable in New Game +.</p>



<p>The upcoming free Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will also introduce a new free jump option that will allow players to jump manually, a new control scheme to smooth parkour that works better with free jump turned on, a Back and Side Ejects Mode, which allows Basim to perform ejects regardless of the presence of a safe landing spot and a few other parkous tweaks to make the experience smoother.</p>



<p>Finally, the new Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will also add a new skill called Engineer 2 that will allow him to equip all level 1 enhancements to his tools, and a new level 3 modification that will power up every tool. Rounding up the new features included in the update is the inclusion of new difficulty levels called Hardened Assassin, which will sport enemies with higher defense than Assassin difficulty, and Ultimate Assassin, the hardest difficulty in the game.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game which brought back the classic series' gameplay formula by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">Nathan Birch's review.</a></p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-long-story-short">Patrick Recommends: Long Story Short</h3><figure><figcaption><span>This scene is less familiar growing up, more familiar in the car with my own kids.

That is no more present than in one of my favorite television series this year, Netflix's <em>Long Story Short</em>, aka the tremendous new series from <em>Bojack Horseman</em> creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg.</p><p><em>Bojack Horseman</em> was a <em>bummer</em>. An insightful show, but quite often bleak enough to make it challenging to hold onto the ideas the show had about hope, redemption, forgiveness, and becoming a better person amidst the pain you have caused others. (Forgiveness isn't about another person being "okay" with you, it's living with knowing you fucked up.) <em>Long Story Short</em> channels a similar level of absurdist humor—<em>god</em>, the episode about Yoshi trying to start his own business inside his parent's house—without relying on the visual gag of lol talking animals. </p><p>(I am not trying to reduce the show to lol talking animals, but that part helped!)</p><p><em>Long Story Short</em> has little that I can personally relate to in terms of family dynamics. A mother more parts bully than loving parent. Siblings who snipe at each other. A deeply religious household. But I do know what it's like to not understand the person a parent performs in public and the person they reveal themselves to be at home. I do know what it's like to fight with a sibling, while you unconditionally love them. I do know what it means for a family to have <em>passions</em>. </p><p>My family is not the Schwoopers, but there is Schwooper-isms in the Klepeks.</p><p>P.S. Outside of <em>The Pitt</em>, this might have one of the most interesting and realistic depictions of what it was like to live out COVID-19 in terms of personal experience. </p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-john-carpenter%E2%80%99s-christine">Rob Recommends: John Carpenter’s <em>Christine</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Well, at least the burning car looks beautiful.

We’ve far from exhausted every racing movie and documentary ever made, but we’ve definitely had to expand our purview from movies about racing to movies about cars to movies that maybe just <em>have </em>cars prominently featured. Which is how I unexpectedly found my favorite John Carpenter film.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Want a powerhouse laptop without having to take out a second mortgage? Most of us just can’t justify spending $4,000 on a computer, no matter how impressive the specs might be. A premium price like that puts premium computing firmly out of reach for the average professional or student. But right now, Dell has slashed the price on <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5373/">their Inspiron 16 laptop (Ryzen 7 8-core 8840U, 32GB DDR5 RAM, 1TB SSD) from $3,999 to just… $989</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5373/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This Dell laptop <strong>features an eight-core AMD Ryzen 7 8840U processor</strong> that will make video editing and complex spreadsheets fly, not to mention everything in between. Its architecture also supports AI-enhanced tasks which means that it’s ready for the next generation of productivity applications that are becoming the norm in professional environments. <strong>Surround that chip with 32GB of DDR5 RAM</strong>, and you get a system comfortable juggling dozens of browser tabs and background apps all at the same time.</p>



<h2>Perfect for Long Sessions</h2>
<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ display stretches to 1920×1200 resolution</strong> and gives you extra vertical space compared to the standard Full HD screens. That additional screen real estate makes a noticeable difference when you’re working with documents, coding, or comparing data side by side. Dell has fitted this screen with an anti-glare coating and its ComfortView technology, filtering out harmful blue light without distorting colors.</p>
<p>The backlit keyboard will let you comfortably work in a variety of places-from the coffee shop down the block to late-night home office sessions. Dell has fitted the keys with decent travel and spacing, such that typing feels natural, not cramped. The <strong>AI Copilot key offers one-touch access to Microsoft’s AI assistant</strong> for streamlined tasks like drafting emails, summarizing documents or generating content suggestions.</p>



<p>What’s more, the fingerprint reader saves you from typing passwords throughout your day and offers more secure authentication than the old login methods. The privacy camera cover gives you physical control over your webcam to put worries about unauthorized access or accidentally showing up on video calls to rest. These are not fancy features, but they safeguard your data and privacy in very practical ways.</p>
<p>The 54Whr battery keeps this laptop <strong>running through a full workday of typical use</strong>. From virtual meetings and working on documents to web browsing and content streaming, there isn’t much you can’t do on the move without having to constantly hunt for outlets. And when you do, the system allows for fast charging in order to get you back up and running quickly.</p>
<p>For $989, this configuration becomes a very compelling value for anyone who needs reliable computing power for business. Spending $3,999 initially put this kind of performance out of the reach of most buyers, and this clearance sale changes the equation entirely.</p>

The full patch list is below.</p>

<p>In our ARC Raiders article, Stefan pondered whether the game could be for everyone, and said, <em>“ARC Raiders has the potential to quickly become the biggest and best example of the extraction shooter out there. The distinct tone and feel of the world that Embark Studio has created, the feel of the action, the layered progression and systems to try and make failure not feel so final, all builds to what could be this genre’s new gold standard.”</em></p>

			<p>Square Enix is the latest video game publisher to push for AI usage in video game development, aiming to let it handle a critical part of development almost completely by 2027.</p>



<p>As part of the company's latest earnings report, the Japanese publisher shared a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">Progress Report on its Medium-Term Business Plan</a>, detailing some of the initiatives underway to boost long-term growth, which include promoting AI utilization in Japan. This is being achieved through the initiation of joint research with the Matsu Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, aimed at improving the efficiency of game development processes using AI technology.</p>



<p>The current goal of this joint research project is to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027. This will <em>"improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development"</em>, Square Enix detailed in the report. As of now, the research team is composed of more than 10 people, including researchers from the Matsu-Iwasawa Laboratory and engineers from Square Enix.</p>



<p>While Square Enix has only started researching AI usage in QA, other publishers are already using it for their titles, putting testers' jobs at risk. Last month, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">EA has already been using AI in QA for a while</a>, as a former employee at Respawn confirmed that over 100 people were laid off last Spring because the company started using AI to review and summarize feedback from play testers, which was work previously handled by human employees.</p>



<p>Square Enix's plans to utilize AI to enhance game development efficiency appear to align with a prevailing sentiment among the most successful Japanese video game developers, such as Masahiro Sakurai and Hideo Kojima. Both developers are not averse to using AI to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">make large-scale game development sustainable</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">let it handle tedious tasks to allow them to focus on the creative process.</a></p>

			<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A has been out for three weeks at the time of this writing, and has had a stunning commercial start with <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/">5.8 million copies sold in its first week</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-massive-retail-launch-in-the-us/">strong sales in both the UK and the US</a>. Continuing the momentum, today, The Pokémon Company announced that the game's first paid DLC, Mega Dimension, will arrive on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 devices this coming December 10, 2025.</p>



<p>The announcement came with two new trailers, one that's more of a cinematic showcase of the new DLC, and another that goes into more detail about Mega Dimension and lays out what to expect in the paid expansion.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension | Visit a Strange New Dimension!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DHozr0ZBcE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As shown in the cinematic trailer above, Mega Dimension marks a historic change for the Pokémon series, which is that the level cap for Pokémon, which has been at level 100 for the entire history of the series, has been removed, and you'll now have to face Pokémon far, far stronger than level 100.</p>



<p>The DLC begins with the introduction of a new character, Ansha and her partner Pokémon, Hoopa. They pull you into a new dimension and a new version of Lumiose City that has new versions of Pokémon running around the city, but you're not just there to capture new Pokémon. You're also there to uncover a mystery behind distortions that are appearing across Lumiose City, with the help of Ansha and Hoopa.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/">Wccftech's review of Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, our reviewer Nathan Birch gave it an 8.5/10, and<em> </em>wrote, "<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully-constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s tough being a </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>fan when Square Enix drops an announcement trailer for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720"><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV</span></i></a><i><span>,</span></i><span> then mostly disappears for three years. These days, those waiting to hear more about Goofy and company’s next foray into the Disney/</span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>crossover universe will lap up even the smallest of crumbs in hopes that it means a full-course meal could be waiting for them at the end of development. This week’s crumb is an Instagram story from Haley Joel Osment, the voice behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-best-games-ranked-2-3-birth-by-sleep-1851494518"><i><span>Kingdom Hearts</span></i><span>’</span></a><span> key-wielding hero Sora, that implies he’s recording…something!</span></p> <p><span>On November 5, Osment posted a photo to his Instagram story of a big red sign that says “RECORDING” with the caption “Back to work” in what looks like a recording studio. Now, this could be for anything. Osment has done plenty of voice work over his decades-long acting career, and it’s not limited to playing Sora in the </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>series, which he’s done since the series’ debut in the PS2 era. Take a cursory look at his acting credits, and you’ll see he’s done a lot of voiceovers for tons of animated Marvel, DC, and </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>projects over the past few years. So it’s entirely possible he’s just doing another routine gig.</span></p>

 <p><span>But we also don’t know that this </span><i><span>isn’t</span></i><span> him gearing up for another monologue about how Sora’s friends are his power, right? </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV </span></i><span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809"><span>still in an uncertain point of development</span></a><span>, but if Square Enix is considering a re-reveal of sorts, it’s entirely possible Osment is doing a session or two for a trailer. But let’s not jump to conclusions. Nobody would ever get themselves in a tizzy over a simple, nondescript Instagram story, right?&nbsp;</span></p>
