			<p>Even though Rockstar Games only released a single Grand Theft Auto VI to date, there's a lot of information floating around regarding the next entry in the series, and most of it can now be checked out in a very convenient way thanks to the hard work of a dedicated fan.</p>
<p>The GTA VI Document version 1.5 was released online earlier this week, providing an in-depth look at the game, the very first trailer released last year, all the leaks that have occurred so far, and more. You can check out the latest version of the document by going <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1usHpd-r-dllDIlMj6rBWxCCLwy4SgRyM/view">here.</a></p>
<p>It has been some time since we have heard anything about Grand Theft Auto VI from Rockstar Games, but the lack of information definitely hasn't impacted the excitement surrounding the game, which is only getting bigger as we get closer to the late 2025 release window <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/">confirmed</a> by Take-Two a few months back. It's not just players who are excited about the game's release but also the video game industry, as GTA VI is expected to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, whose performance on the market can have a huge impact on the entire industry.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is now in development for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Peter Molyneux, a veteran game developer responsible for games such as Fable, Dungeon Keeper, and Theme Park, spoke out about what he thinks people can expect from the games industry over the next few years and what developments will be made to keep it alive. The main answer was AI. When<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-will-games-be-in-25-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> asked by Eurogamer</a> where he thinks the world of video games will be in two years time, he mentioned that AI will most likely be heavily used at this point.</p>
<p>"AI is going to be a real game changer. There will come a time where AI will be used to create huge parts of a game - AI-generated characters, animations, dialogue, VO, there is so much that AI will be able to tackle." While this is a genuine possibility, it spells danger for those who are in the games industry at present, as it would leave their jobs dangling in the balance. What will happen to those responsible for animating characters when AI takes over? His statement continues with, "You will be able to, for example, create a game from one single prompt such as 'make a battle royale set on a pirate ship,' and your AI will go and do that for you."</p>
<p>With how controversial Peter Molyneux has been in the past, these responses don't surprise many people. In addition to adding AI into the game industry mix, he also went on to explain his thoughts on how Hollywood will perceive video games and says that Hollywood is "going to continue to be fascinated with games and keep on coming for more game stories and narrative." We've seen the Fallout TV show, The Last of US TV show, the Super Mario Movie, and recently announced the Minecraft movie.</p>
<p>While Peter Molyneux commented on AI during this interview with Eurogamer, he wasn't the only veteran games developer to comment, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/shinji-mikami-says-no-need-for-dino-crisis-to-exist-when-monster-hunter-is-so-successful/">Shinji Mikami,</a> founder of Tango Gameworks, also explained how AI will make a difference in the game industry. Looking into the far future, Mikami mentioned "there's not a whole lot that can be changed as far as backgrounds, but animations and stuff like that could all be, in 25 years, completely AI-generated. And so the importance of the creation of backgrounds and actual animations, I feel that there's going to be a much bigger gap than there is now. That's one of the things that is a bit daunting."</p>
<p>AI has accelerated from janky-looking art prompts on Dall-E to fully-fledged videos and imagery that borders reality. For the most part, it is still easy to clock out what is AI and what isn't, but who knows how fast AI will continue to evolve?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber and Focus'&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is out now, and if you've already picked it up and played all the way through to the credits sequence, you may notice a rather lovely and unexpected tribute nestled there.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fa0og5/john_totalbiscuit_bain_homage_in_the_w40k_space/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Redditor Tiucaner</a>, the credits feature an "In Memoriam" section, which pays tribute to John "TotalBiscuit" Bain. The section also seemingly features several other staffers who died during the game's production, including casting and voice director Roman Palmov and technical writer Andrey Kozyrev, among others.</p>
<p>Just in case you need a reminder, TotalBiscuit, also known as The Cynical Brit, was a very well-known figure within the gaming industry. He's perhaps best known for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cynicalbrit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his YouTube channel</a>, where he drew attention to lesser-known indie games, and the Co-Optional Podcast, on which he served as one of the hosts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit-tribute-tyranid.jpg?itok=nwofBWvU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit-tribute-tyranid.jpg?itok=ZShGyXnd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>features a touching TotalBiscuit tribute in its credits.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, in 2014, Bain was diagnosed with cancer, undergoing treatment that would ultimately prove unsuccessful. In 2015, Bain's cancer was sadly deemed inoperable, and he was given around two to three years to live.</p>
<p>That prediction sadly proved to be correct; Bain passed away in 2018. He had, at that point, already retired from content creation on YouTube, although he was still hosting the Co-Optional podcast alongside his wife Genna.</p>
<p><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s mention of Bain in the credits reminds us that he's no longer with us, of course, but it also gives us a chance to honor and celebrate his legacy, which includes a 2011 video shining a spotlight on the original&nbsp;<em>Space Marine</em>. You can check that out here.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is, as you might expect, the followup to 2011's third-person hack-and-shooter hybrid <i>Space Marine</i>.</p>
<p>It returns to the story of Captain Demetrian Titus, although he's a captain no longer; stripped of his rank after being accused of heresy, Titus must prove his worth to the Empire by putting a stop to a Tyranid invasion on an Imperial planet.</p>
<p>Saber and Focus have promised that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>will feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions">no microtransactions</a>; although the game will have a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-roadmap">post-launch roadmap</a> that adds new features, all gameplay additions, including new modes and features, will be free for all players.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003330" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2/9n9pczwhvp2l" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

They’re <em>born</em> loving guns. Their blood has bullets running through it. So naturally, the Imperium has a wide range of weapons for players to use in <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>. But which to use? Which is best? What if you’re using <em>the wrong gun</em>?! Calm down, it’s OK, this guide will detail the best guns you should use to slay your enemies in Space Marine 2.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51b2fdf858489d76cce52eee135e8cd2" data-recommend-id="image://51b2fdf858489d76cce52eee135e8cd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1098" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Plasma Incinerator" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Plasma Incinerator" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51b2fdf858489d76cce52eee135e8cd2" data-recommend-id="image://51b2fdf858489d76cce52eee135e8cd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1098" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Plasma Incinerator" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h10953"><a id=""></a><strong>Plasma Incinerator</strong></h3><p>The Plasma Incinerator is arguably one of the best guns to use in the game. Even though its firepower isn’t the highest, you can charge it up to do a significant amount of damage. Its overall stats balance it out to be an ideal rifle, and since it doesn’t have a magazine, you don’t have to reload it.</p><figure id="" data-id="cc79ab50798cd7dc7f57b7ed64ce8ddd" data-recommend-id="image://cc79ab50798cd7dc7f57b7ed64ce8ddd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Rifle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Rifle" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc79ab50798cd7dc7f57b7ed64ce8ddd" data-recommend-id="image://cc79ab50798cd7dc7f57b7ed64ce8ddd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Rifle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h10954"><a id=""></a><strong>Heavy Bolt Rifle</strong></h3><p>The Heavy Bolt Rifle is a light machine gun. Its firepower is surprisingly low for its heft, but it makes up for it in speed and range, which is ideal when you find yourself fighting large hordes (which happens a lot). Out of all the weapons you can carry, this one has the largest magazine size too.</p><figure id="" data-id="c118e2d2841de68a8e8acd919c79d0d9" data-recommend-id="image://c118e2d2841de68a8e8acd919c79d0d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Melta Rifle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Melta Rifle" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c118e2d2841de68a8e8acd919c79d0d9" data-recommend-id="image://c118e2d2841de68a8e8acd919c79d0d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Melta Rifle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h10955"><a id=""></a><strong>Melta Rifle</strong></h3><p>The Melta Rifle is one of the strongest weapons to use in the game. It has the highest firepower, and can kill anything within two rounds. This weapon is essentially a shotgun flamethrower that’ll melt anything you shoot at. But the catch is the Melta Rifle has horrible range and reload speed, so you’ll need to be mindful of that.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c8f909cc1b6cf1b5215b17a065887a3b" data-recommend-id="image://c8f909cc1b6cf1b5215b17a065887a3b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1098" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Plasma Pistol" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Plasma Pistol" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8f909cc1b6cf1b5215b17a065887a3b" data-recommend-id="image://c8f909cc1b6cf1b5215b17a065887a3b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1098" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Plasma Pistol" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h10956"><a id=""></a><strong>Plasma Pistol</strong></h3><p>The Plasma Pistol is a miniature version of the Plasma Incinerator. It has the second-highest firepower out of all the pistols, and can be charged up to inflict a lot of damage at once. This pistol perfectly pairs up with the Melta Rifle, if you’re looking for a one-two combo.</p><figure id="" data-id="85aa366e4f5d589b6806d69f26655ce4" data-recommend-id="image://85aa366e4f5d589b6806d69f26655ce4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1162" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Pistol" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Pistol" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="85aa366e4f5d589b6806d69f26655ce4" data-recommend-id="image://85aa366e4f5d589b6806d69f26655ce4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1162" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Pistol" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h10957"><a id=""></a><strong>Heavy Bolt Pistol</strong></h3><p>The Heavy Bolt Pistol is a great weapon. It has the highest firepower of all the secondary weapons, and an incredibly high reload rate. If you find yourself surrounded, this is a perfect fallback weapon to use. Just be aware that it only has eight bullets per clip.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fc2214a8f1d87bce4eb9bbf22f6f79bf" data-recommend-id="image://fc2214a8f1d87bce4eb9bbf22f6f79bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1090" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Power Sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Power Sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc2214a8f1d87bce4eb9bbf22f6f79bf" data-recommend-id="image://fc2214a8f1d87bce4eb9bbf22f6f79bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1090" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Power Sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h10958"><a id=""></a><strong>Power Sword</strong></h3><p>The Power Sword is perhaps one of the most enjoyable weapons in the game. It can be used for light or heavy attacks, and it is great for any situation you find yourself in, and it looks like…a sword! Out of all the melee weapons in the game, it’s the most well-rounded one. Except for the sides. They’re very sharp.</p><figure id="" data-id="b77f79dc534972c05c632524a032679a" data-recommend-id="image://b77f79dc534972c05c632524a032679a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1095" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thunder Hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thunder Hammer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b77f79dc534972c05c632524a032679a" data-recommend-id="image://b77f79dc534972c05c632524a032679a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1095" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thunder Hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h10959"><a id=""></a><strong>Thunder Hammer</strong></h3><p>Nothing screams <em>40K</em> like a giant hammer swinging at your enemies. The Thunder Hammer is extremely satisfying to use, and packs a serious punch. It’s great for clearing out hordes, but the downside is how long it takes to swing. When using this, be prepared to take a hit or two.</p><hr><p>These are some of our favorite weapons to use while playing <em>Warhammer 40:000 Space Marine 2</em>.

Concord was announced as one of the 15 franchises involved in the project, and a source <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source" rel="nofollow ">told IGN</a> that the game will remain a part of Secret Level.</p><p dir="ltr">Secret Level will also feature new stories in franchises that haven't seen a fresh entry in some time, such as Mega Man and Unreal Tournament. A brief moment in the trailer led us to think that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/were-thinking-its-keanu-reeves-in-secret-level-upcoming-armored-core-episode/1100-6526013/">Keanu Reeves might star</a> in the Armored Core episode, but that hasn't been confirmed yet. The John Wick star was recently revealed as the voice of Shadow in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-adds-keanu-reeves-as-voice-of-shadow/1100-6522667/">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The future of Concord remains unclear, with one of the developers of the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-dev-thanks-fans-for-their-support-but-admits-none-of-us-know-whats-next/1100-6526291/">outright stating</a> that "none of us know what's next." Prior to the game's shutdown on September 6, reports suggested that players were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-players-are-repeatedly-killing-their-characters-to-get-a-platinum-trophy/1100-6526260/">killing themselves in the game on purpose</a> to try to gain the platinum trophy before the curtain fell.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lous-lagoon-preview-new-cozy-obsession</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lou%E2%80%99s-lagoon-preview-%E2%80%93-a-new-cozy-obsession.974010/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lous-lagoon-preview-new-cozy-obsession<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes low stakes vibing with a sense of progression is all you want out of a game. To chill yet effect change all the same. <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> is the next up and coming game to let you do just that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> is obviously its own game, but it’s also got quite the interesting mixture. Part <em>Animal Crossing</em>, part <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, part flying game, and add in a dash of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> -- yes, really – and you’ve got <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your uncle has disappeared and you’ve turned up to figure out what happened to him and to rebuild his delivery business at the same time. Set in an archipelago of islands full of mystery, you’ll be building up and connecting people from all around.</p>
<p>The throughline of the game is the mystery of what happened to your uncle, but the meat of the game will be rebuilding, repairing, and improving the various islands and the inhabitants you meet along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Collecting resources is very <em>No Man’s Sky</em>-like in that you’re “vacuuming” things up with your Swirler 2000, like wood debris and metal parts, to then use to craft things later. Also, what else are islands but a planet analogue with the sea and air between standing in for space? Alright, reaching a bit here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those resources can then be used to repair or build structures, repair stairs to reach new places on an island ,and pretty much anything and everything in-between. You can even craft your own decorations and furniture. There's cooking and a science station, too.</p>
<p>The most unique thing you can repair and upgrade, however, is your plane that's unlocked after you repair it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using the plane isn’t simply a quick travel system, as you will be actively flying it around the archipelago of Lou’s Lagoon. The brief time I had with it showed a simple control set that will be difficult to master if you’re wanting to challenge yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Timed challenges can be found throughout the sky that see you flying through rings. You’ll need some serious practice to complete some of them, let alone set a good time.</p>
<p>With all of those tools in hand, that’s more or less the basis of the game. You go around collecting resources, doing quests for people you meet along the way, find and upgrading more things along the way so you can explore even more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m always a sucker for a game where I can collect some sort of resource or do a quest to then upgrade some sort of town or building. That tangible result of my effort that has a permanent physical affect on the game world is never not satisfying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> is full of things like that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a game of exploration, growth, and connection set in a beautiful backdrop. There's a mystery to uncover and plenty of secrets within many of the islands to find as well. You can go where you want, when you want, at your own pace -- comfort gaming you can curl up with any day.</p>
<p>I think this game will speak to anyone looking for their next cozy game fix. <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> smartly mashes together a few systems with its unique island hopping world to make for a compelling game.&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Lou’s Lagoon<em> was previewed at PAX West 2024.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/street-fighter-6-sales-top-4-million-around-the-world.974007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another major milestone around the world, around fifteen months after the game was initially released.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1831814865297489924" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>has sold more than four million units globally, which presumably counts across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The studio says that updates and new stuff for&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>will continue, as "more content" and "more events" are on the way for the game. Given that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-3-million">crossed the three million threshold back in January</a>, that means it's shifted another million units in the last eight or nine months, which isn't too bad.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million-blanka.jpg?itok=VZAO-jhP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million-blanka.jpg?itok=chYcewUM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>has broken another big sales barrier.</figcaption></figure><p>By way of comparison, Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-sales-2-million">sold two million copies</a> within its first month or so on sale, while&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>had sold around 2.47 million copies by the time of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sells-247-million-copies-drives-capcoms-overwhelming-financial-results">Capcom's September 2023 financial results</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it's difficult to compare fighting franchise sales directly; fighting games are a fairly niche genre in the grand scheme of things, and each franchise within the genre arguably has its own audience as well, although there will naturally be some crossover.</p>
<p>Still, four million sales for the latest entry in a pretty major series well over a year after its initial release suggests that there's still a market for&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, which Capcom will no doubt be happy about. Those might not be&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million"><em>Resident Evil Village</em>-level sales</a>, but hey - there's still time!</p>

<p><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>may already be well over a year old, but the game's not resting on its laurels. It's still getting regular DLC injections;&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury&nbsp;</em>legend Terry Bogard is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1364780/view/4616839976807963593" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the game's latest addition</a>, and other DLC fighters include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-akuma-release-date">Akuma</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-street-fighter-6-dlc-character-ed-gets-release-date-and-gameplay-reveal">Ed</a>, and new character <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-reveals-release-date-gameplay-trailer-for-disturbing-new-character-aki">A.K.I.</a>, to name but a few.</p>

But it was more than just an elaborate tech demo, and established the <em>Astro</em> franchise, previously a VR-exclusive, as a budding Sony first-party A-lister. Leading up to the release of the third game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span>, Team Asobi even added a countdown timer to the mission room in <em>Astro’s Playroom </em>for the September 6 launch. </p><p>That’s where players were able to wait ahead of actually being able to play <em>Astro Bot</em> and watch all of the little guys count down like it was New Year’s Eve 1999. It was a neat little easter egg that’s in keeping with the franchise’s dedication to celebrating PlayStation’s past and taking time to add little touches that make the whole thing feel extra special. </p><p><em>Astro Bot</em> is out now on PlayStation 5 and I’m not alone in thinking it’s a strong frontrunner for GOTY and also one of the best 3D platformers ever. It’s full of whimsical little touches and dazzling set pieces, with levels that revolve around clever mechanics and make full use of the DualSense controller, from the haptic triggers to the speaker. It all gives playing the game the same tactile satisfaction of playing with toys in real life. </p><p>But the seeds of many of those ideas, including blowing onto the touch pad to to create wind gusts in the game, were there in <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, a short game not enough people played despite it being free with each of the over 60 million PS5s that have been sold so far. It only takes three hours to beat and will give you a nice taste of what to expect in <em>Astro Bot</em>. Plus, it will give you a point of reference to see how far the franchise has come in just four years, and a new appreciation for all of the novel ways the new game iterates on what Team Asobi experimented with before. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sheer level of joy the game produces makes it impossible to compare it to anything other than Mario's very best adventure. Astro is no longer a vector through which to reference PlayStation icons; he is a PlayStation icon." -- <em>Jordan Middler</em> [<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/astro-bot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>VG247 -- 5/5</h2><p>"Astro Bot only cares about fun, and I genuinely can't think of a single moment it made me wish something had been handled differently, tweaked to be easier, or expanded upon. It's just perfect." -- <em>Tom Orry</em> [<a href="https://www.vg247.com/astro-bot-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Eurogamer -- 5/5</h2><p>"Astro Bot is a really, really good 3D platformer. As is often the case with the blockbuster genres of yesteryear, it's always nice when someone busts another one of these out, particularly when they put in so much effort to make it satisfying, curious, lavish and pleasantly odd." -- <em>Christian Donlan</em> [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Inverse -- 10/10</h2><p>"More than anything, my time with Astro Bot is dominated by one word: surprise. There were moments that had my jaw on the floor, moments I cackled with glee, and even one or two where may have shed a tear. Astro Bot is everything that I love about video games — the potential they have to cause wonder and excitement, self-reflection, and, most importantly, fun." -- <em>Hayes Madsen</em> [<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/astro-bot-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>GamesRadar -- 5/5</h2><p>"Astro Bot doesn't just deliver on the promise and potential displayed in PS5 pack-in demo Astro's Playroom, but soars above and beyond to serve up a near-perfect platformer to rival--and possibly surpass--the best of Super Mario's Mushroom Kingdom romps." -- <em>Matt Cabral</em> [<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/astro-bot-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>IGN -- 9/10</h2><p>"Astro Bot made me smile from beginning to end. A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities, it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive. And while you don't need a long history with Sony systems to enjoy it, it is especially a delight for those with a piece of PlayStation in their heart as a treasure trove full of playable nostalgia awaits. Taking the PS5 marketing mantra that “play has no limits” more seriously than you'd expect, Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it." --<em> Simon Cardy</em> [<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Polygon -- No score</h2><p>"Sony has been reaching for something like Astro Bot since PlayStation launched 30 years ago in the age of Mario and Sonic. It has cycled through mascots like Crash, Jak, and Sackboy in its quest for a breezy family game that could hold its own with Nintendo’s best as well as mesh with Sony's cooler, tech-centric brand. Sony ended up settling for edgier cinematic action heroes instead, but deep in the consoles' soul, it felt like something was missing. Astro Bot--a dazzling, joyful game--is a celebration of all the failed attempts and quizzical detours Sony made on that quest. And it might also be the game to fill that hole at last." -- <em>Oli Welsh</em> [<a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/447564/astro-bot-review" rel="nofollow ">Full review</a>]</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/omut-preview-i-died-30-times-in-10-minutes.973962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/omut-preview-i-died-30-times-in-10-minutes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had no idea what to expect when I went to check out <em>OMUT </em>at PAX West. When I walked away, its weird, dark world had charmed me, and I was more than happy to keep on dying until I ran out of time with my best run being one hit away from victory..&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>OMUT </em>is mechanically simple, lean and mean with the one goal of killing you as much as possible. It’s difficult, punishing, frustrating, tantalizing, alluring, cathartic, and glory-inducing all in one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll get into the combat and how it plays in the moment, but the best aspect of <em>OMUT </em>is that it’s a punishing game where you are going to die a whole lot that also respects your time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting a boss fight after a failure is instantaneous at the click of a button, which makes it easy to just try again, again, again, and again.</p>
<h2>OMUT Is A Boss Rush Demanding Perfection</h2>
<p><em>OMUT</em>’s nothing but bosses, 20 or so all told, so the name of the game is just figuring out their patterns and quirks. If you mow down the bosses perfectly, you could finish the game in probably 30 or so minutes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can tell you that I played for about 30 minutes and did not kill either of the two bosses I tried in my preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failure is immediate and fatal in <em>OMUT</em>, meaning that only perfection will see you succeed. If all goes well, you can probably clear out a boss in that one perfect attempt in about a minute or so.</p>
<p>If you can do that with any regularity for the first time, I’ll crown you the god gamer now myself. OMUT is hard as nails with little margin for error. There's a lot of dying, trial and error, and close calls until you get that one perfect run.</p>

Making a deal with this guy gives the kid his powers to come back to life and fight again.</figcaption></figure><p>From what I played, and I understand there may be upgrades and changes later in the game, I was equipped simply with a shotgun with three shells. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The shells replenish automatically quickly but there is a slight delay, so you’ll often find yourself in moments where you don’t have a shot ready when you need it. That means shots need to be strategic and thoughtful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Movement in <em>OMUT </em>is like a 2D sidescroller action game, where you can just shoot and dash. The dash does give you some invulnerability, which you’ll need to time correctly to avoid death. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Shooting and dodging is really all you need to do to win but that’s like saying all you need to do to hit a bullseye is just pull back on the bowstring.</p>
<h2>OMUT's Boss Fights Are Simple But Exacting</h2>
<p>The first boss I fought was a floating demonic ball that was constantly trying to fall to the ground. In later stages of the fight, it would start shooting things out I would have to avoid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I hit it with a blast of the shotgun, I’d send it back up into the air. If it hit me or the ground at any point, it was game over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Juggling this guy with my measly three shotgun shells was a tall task. The projectiles the boss would send could knock my shells out of the air (or I could block them with a shot), which added another wrinkle to the sporadic movements the boss would make already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add onto that the increase in speed, and the fight had significant ramp ups to account for each step of the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told it was either 12 or 16 shots to beat the boss and that at one point I was just one hit away from victory. I knew it at the time too and that didn’t make it any easier to step away when I had to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one thing I’ll hold onto is that when I ran into the PR person later that day, he said I was the closest to beating the boss of anyone that demoed the game that day. I knew I'd see him at an event later in the day and hoped <em>OMUT </em>would be there so I could get some more shots in at the boss, but it was never to be. I am happy to live in my own reality believing I got further than anyone else.</p>

<p>The second boss I saw was somehow more frustrating. A large fat naked? man just running at you left and right. Sometimes he changed up the speed, jumped at you, shoots out a projectile, or leaps forward.</p>
<p>This is the fight where you learn where the i-frames are in the dash. The boss has plenty of good animations and clues as to what’s coming next, you just have to be ready to react, so death never felt cheap.</p>
<p>I didn’t have as much time on this one, as I got so close on that first boss I was determined to beat it, but I was no less challenged or engaged with the mechanics.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>OMUT Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>OMUT </em>is cleverly designed in a very meticulous way. The fewer mechanics and systems to engage with, the more glaring a potential problem will be, which thankfully <em>OMUT </em>had none in my brief time with the game.</p>
<p>With 18 or so bosses still left for me to see at some point in the future, I can’t wait to try all of their wackiness out. There’s no way I’m not seeing at least 1,000 deaths along the way.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-season-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>Season 4 is finally upon us, and it's bringing all kinds of goodies to the gloomy multiplayer dungeon-crawler, including a reworked map, a new boss, and plenty more.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2016590/view/4593196713079675998" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post announcing the new season's arrival</a>, developer and publisher Ironmace first notes that all characters have been reset for the start of this season, which is a fairly standard practice for Early Access games.</p>
<p>As for new features, the first one you're getting is a reworked version of the Ruins map, which also serves as a gateway to two more layers: the Crypt and the Inferno. As you've probably guessed, this season therefore also marks the return of three-layer dungeons.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-and-darker-season-4-ruins-map.jpg?itok=I3ZSSQq2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-and-darker-season-4-ruins-map.jpg?itok=_iUNZXS6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>Season 4 has tons of new stuff for you to discover.</figcaption></figure><p>Other major highlights for this season include a new Spectral Knight boss for you and your friends to take on, as well as a new Dungeon Express system that lets you safely extract loot between dungeon layers.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to encounter new unique monsters, new models for several weapons and items, and more, so even if you think you know&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>inside out, you might want to head back in for this update.</p>
<p>The experience should now be easier on newer players, too; a new Tome of Knowledge has been added "to help with basic game information", and all classes have had their Starting Gear improved as well.</p>

<p>If you're interested in everything that's been added to&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>as part of its fourth season, then you can check out the update's <a href="https://www.darkanddarker.com/news/74" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>is a multiplayer PvPvE dungeon-crawler in which your goal is to gather treasure, defeat monsters, and stay one step ahead of other groups of players, who'll be looking to take your treasure from you.</p>
<p>The game is one of several of its kind that have popped up in recent years. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-release-date"><em>Dungeonborne</em></a>&nbsp;and, of course,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>, although the developers of that one have seemingly been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-pve-eod-free">doing their best to alienate their community</a> of late.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016590/Dark_and_Darker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only widescreen. No ultrawide for the moment, sadly. As and when they add support for ultrawide monitors, perhaps they should call it "ultramarinewide". Ha ha! Ha. Anyway, here's what's coming in the first round of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> patches.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Saber Interactive's well-regarded battle-bludgeoner isn't fully on sale yet - the public release date is Monday 9th September, but certain Warhammerers have gotten early access by means of the blasphemous Chaotic rite of Preordering, may the God-Emperor shrive their souls. The Steam reactions so far seem broadly positive, but there are a few sore spots, including the absence of ultrawide support, which Saber have said they're <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/68-august-community-update">working to add</a>.</p>
<p>There are also reports of crashing, for which publishers Focus have <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/forums/27-bugs/threads/43800-quick-note-on-the-most-common-issues#post-207833">outlined some possible workarounds</a>. If you're experiencing crashes in general, consider deactivating any overlay software you're using such as Riva Tuner, Afterburner or NVIDIA's equivalent. If you're finding that the game crashes during the first cinematic, the publishers recommend updating to the latest version of Windows, verifying that the game is running on the correct GPU, and updating your GPU driver. And if you're running into an infinite loading bug when playing in multiplayer Operations, try restarting the game - it could be a networking issue, or it could be to do with getting kicked from your squad. </p>
<p>Personally, I think infinite loading bugs are appropriate to a game with infinitely loading bugs (Tyranid swarms). Ha ha! Ha. Anyway, here's what to do if your controller is refusing to work with the game: switch off Steam Input (Right click on game &gt; Properties &gt; Controller &gt; Disable Steam Input) and try plugging in your controller via USB.</p>
<p>If none of these bodges jump-start your Adeptus Astartes, you'll have to wait for some game updates, unfortunately. "We aim to fix all these issues in our first patches," Focus promise.</p>
<p>Crashes and the omission of ultrawide aren't the only bones Spice Margerine aficionadoes have to pick with Spruce Maureen 2. As passed on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2s-epic-games-client-on-steam-is-for-crossplay-confirms-publisher">Eurogamer</a>, there's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1f9ule0/space_marine_2_is_sitting_at_55_on_steam_due_to/">a stink on Reddit</a> about the "stealth installation of Epic Online Services" when you accept the game's EULA. </p>
<p>The installation of Epic's client is, in fact, mentioned in the EULA, and "was implemented to support optional cross-play between Steam and Epic players and to synchronize friend lists between the two stores", as Focus explain. "However, please be aware linking your Steam and Epic accounts is not required to enjoy the game. These features are entirely optional and will not affect your gameplay experience in any way."</p>
<p>Ugh, I need a final ghastly Warhammer pun to finish off this post. Something to do with Steam Tanks, maybe? The game tanking on Steam? Please go read Brendy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 review</a> while I consult the scriptorium and try to figure out the Warhammer 40K equivalent for a "review bomb".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Wouldn't such a surge of interest be a boon for the two developers?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">No. At least, not for the bulk of Godot's development. Verschelde and Linietsky (who also co-founded W4 Games, a separate corporation developing licensable porting and multiplayer tools for Godot users) had been leading community-driven development on the engine since 2014, and all the while they said they saw a backlash to Unity coming from a mile away. "Even before this happened, there'd been multiple warning shots from Unity," Verschelde recalled in a conversation at Gamescom 2024. And despite the boon that could come from an influx of users, the Godot team prayed Unity wouldn't make that explosion happen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the two tell it, Godot wasn't ready for primetime until just months before the Runtime Fee debacle—and as it exploded, they faced their first test on what would happen when a userbase used to Unity's tech and values would react in the face of Godot's open-source style. It's a case study in how any team can rapidly scale in the face of surprise growth—and how teams who espouse open-source values can incorporate input from new members.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/from-unity-to-godot-in-a-weekend" target="_self">From Unity to Godot in a Weekend</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Godot wasn't ready for primetime">Godot wasn't ready for primetime</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Linietsky, a longtime technology consultant, told Game Developer that Unity's push to hit the stock market with an IPO was a ticking time bomb. Not necessarily because of the focus on stockholders, but the mission of acquiring technology companies to make Unity a larger tool. "They invested in so much technology that I, as a technology person, know is expensive to maintain," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rumors of Unity's IPO push </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-is-looking-to-go-public-in-2020">began in 2019,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Godot had only hit version 3.0 in 2018. Even though the engine saw "steady growth" over the next few years, Linietsky and Verschelde didn't think that version of the tool was a worthy alternative to Unity.

But Godot's open-source nature means features can't just be solicited like they are from a licensed engine. They have to be voted on and implemented by the community. "We were just hoping Unity would keep doing a good job and keep users happy so people can willingly embrace Godot for what it is, and not try to change it to what it isn't," Verschelde said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair said it was a major relief that the calamity came after version 4.0 of Godot was released in March of 2023. That version, they felt, was most ready for a sudden rush of new developers. That meant when the calamity came, the founders were more prepared to face the challenges of introducing developers to the open source model.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Godot has been forced to grapple with the needs of Unity users">Godot has been forced to grapple with the needs of Unity users</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the moment came, Linietsky and Verschelde said there were some user demands that risked running up on the engine's capabilities—but they were relieved to find "Unity refugees" were willing to compromise. Godot's community-first structure did a lot of the heavy lifting, with other Godot developers who'd worked with Unity ready on day one to explain how the new arrivals could replicate desired features with their new tools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, they found that Unity refugees were surprisingly patient with Godot's shortcomings.

An option to move the file system window to the bottom of the screen, just as it's located in Unity, was a relatively easy lift.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What wasn't an easy lift? Unity's beloved feature that lets developers edit their game while in "Play" mode. The pair said it's one of the "top 5 most-requested features," but it's not one that can be added in a straightforward manner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Godot generates a playable version of the game being worked on, it runs separately to keep both functions more stable. Recreating the "edit while in Play mode" isn't likely to happen any time soon, but Verschelde said there's a proposal in the community for a smaller feature: the ability to click on objects in the game and see them in the inspector. "That can be done," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't expect a C Sharp to C++ compiler any time soon though. Godot uses a more "modern" version of C Sharp maintained by Microsoft that has "other capabilities of optimizing performance."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Developers can always fork their own versions of the engine">Developers can always fork their own versions of the engine</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Godot's limitations are fascinating in part because, as the pair stressed multiple times in our conversation, they're something technically savvy developers can solve themselves.

		<p>It’s been a hell of a gaming week, with some actual bangers arriving to brighten up a dreary start to September. I’ve been reviewing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a>, and loved its rendition of Warhammer 40,000’s universe, and now I’m jumping into Age of Mythology: Retold, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-plucky-squire">The Plucky Squire</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. There is some juggling going on!</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has also played Astro Bot, and he played it before the rest of us! He awarded it a massive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">10/10 in our review</a>, and told us, “It’s bloody delightful!” He’s also played little bits of Magic and Monster Hunter Now.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> played the demo of Stories from Sol The Gun Dog and started Final Fantasy XVI where he replayed the intro as he forgot what happened in that (isn’t restarting an RPG literally the worst thing in gaming?) He’s also been playing NBA 2K25 and Beyond Galaxyland for review.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been scoundrel-ing in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, hunting in Hunt Showdown 1896, tried out Quidditch Champions, and has been performing indie songs, beating up weirdos, and having emotional moments about his past in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dustborn">Dustborn</a>. That’s not all though, as he tells us, “I also started Cult of the Lamb, which I didn’t know anything about other than make a cult. Now I know it’s Binding of Isaac with a cult theme I’m not sure if I’ll return.”</p>


<p>Giving up on the “fairly pants”&nbsp;Wukong Black Myth, <strong>Ade</strong> has been playing Wild Bastards and Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions for review instead. He’s returned to being a pirate again too: “I’m also on with Skull and Bones Season 3, which is brilliant! Teaming up with about seven other players to take down a giant flying storm dragon was awesome!”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> started the week off strong by finishing the “entertaining” Dungeons of Hinterberg before moving on to Creatures of Ava in the ‘what’s interesting on Game Pass’ style. He’s continued to bung a lot into one week though, continuing, “Alongside that I have just started what will be a very long-running playthrough of the Age of Mythology: Retold which is super nostalgic as I rinsed the original back in the day. I also finished Atlas Fallen: Forgettable Subtitle which was a surprisingly decent open world Ubi-type game but less bloated than the usual Far Cry/Ass Creed. Nice sand traversal and pretty deep combat too. Finally I have just installed the Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition PC mod for a pre-Remake playthrough after finishing my review time with an embargoed upcoming horror game that blew me away.”</p>
<p>While he had hoped to continue his career as a Freegunner, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Sony’s decision to axe Concord</a> left <strong>Jim</strong> with no desire to jump back in (until the game’s expected future relaunch). It’s been a tough week all round for Jim, as he says, “I’ve also entered a bit of a slump while playing Fallout: New Vegas and its Lonesome Road DLC which has turned out to be a bruising gauntlet of super tough enemy encounters I clearly wasn’t ready for. Thankfully the end is in sight – when I return to the Mojave Wasteland, I’ll almost be ready to wrap up the main questline.”</p>

<p><strong>Nick P</strong> played and finished <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/the-casting-of-frank-stone-review/">The Casting of Frank Stone</a> for review, as well as continuing his play through of Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth and Parasite Eve. He almost certainly snuck in some Fortnite and Dead by Daylight too.</p>
<p>And finally, we come to&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong>, who’s shared his impressions from going <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-link-who/">hands on with Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and had a great time with the fresh spin on a Zelda adventure (now with playable Zelda!). Beside that, he dabbled a tiny bit with COD Black Ops 6’s beta, with plans to play some more this weekend, and will make a start on Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown today, after a week of server issues has stalled our review on the starting line.</p>
<p>How about you? Have you been scoundrel-ing? Or do you fancy being a tiny PlayStation robot?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-the-car-review-%E2%80%93-where-we%E2%80%99re-going-we-don%E2%80%99t-need-roads.973914/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/what-car-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of my least favorite things about living in America is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-gran-turismo-revolutionized-car-culture">the obsessive car culture</a>. We’re so reliant on them, and they don’t even have legs or rockets! <em>What the Car?</em>, a comedy game from Triband, bravely asks us to reconsider what cars can really do for us.</p>
<p>If you’re a mobile gamer, you’ve already seen this on your iPhone thanks to Apple Arcade. However, on September 9, <em>What the Car?</em> hits Steam, opening the door for so many others to experience this charming game.</p>
<p>At its core, it’s like most other games starring a car: You have to get from point A to B as fast as possible. But like anything worth enjoying, <em>What the Car?</em> is more about the journey than the destination.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-frogger.jpg?itok=mQ_0E3Uq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-frogger.jpg?itok=UTRKszXR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ribbit.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>What the Car?</em> Reinvents the Wheel</h2>
<p>Made by a Copenhagen-based team of developers who primarily don’t drive, <em>What the Car?</em> is a comedy game first and foremost. You might recognize one of their other games, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/what-golf"><em>What the Bat?</em></a></p>
<p>Community Manager Sarah Sanders, who I spoke with at PAX West, said one of their primary measures of success is “laughs per minute.” And I can confirm, I found myself chuckling a lot at this silly little game.</p>
<p><em>What the Car?</em>’s humor lands more often than not thanks to the boundless creativity on display here. You play as the titular Car, who’s primarily on two human legs instead of four wheels—and it only gets weirder from there.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’re a car riding a bike with a jetpack on its back. Other times, you’re an ac-car-dion, slinking along the level, or a carp swimming through water. Occasionally, you're chopping veggies like Cooking Mazda. There’s even one mini-game where you’re a car who would literally rather be fishing.</p>

<p>I’m barely scratching the surface of just how ludicrous these premises get. Each level is named either after the car type or features a punny reference on something else.</p>
<p>Choice names include “Bike Me Up Inside,” “Drop It Like It’s Hot Wheels,” and my personal favorite, “Car on Skateboard but Giraffe.” That last one’s not a pun; it’s just wonderfully silly, with and without context.</p>
<p>Controlling each of these monstrosities is pretty simple, and it’s maybe the biggest giveaway of the game’s mobile roots. You move left or right and have one action button. The action button can be pressed or held, depending on the level and the car’s modifications.</p>
<p>The only thing funnier than the puns is moving Car itself, especially when it's a weird mess of spare parts and gears. Turns out, controlling a car with keyboards for wheels isn't easy, but the absurdity of it all makes it so enjoyable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-pirate-ship.jpg?itok=3FkE5ME7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-pirate-ship.jpg?itok=RSn_q7n5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is the tale of Captain Jack Car-row.</figcaption></figure><p>For the most part, maybe only one or two levels confused me on how they worked, but that confusion lasted for maybe five seconds. Once you play around with it, it’s all pretty intuitive.</p>
<p>Each level, you're ranked by a bronze, silver, or gold crown based on how long it took you to finish. As an added challenge, there's a collectible card hidden in each level, asking you to detour and find some shortcuts.</p>
<p>Thankfully, shortcuts can be easy to find on lots of these levels. The physics in <em>What the Car? </em>are whimsically wonky, giving you lots of leeway to make certain jumps or finagle your way around corners.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-hot-wheels.jpg?itok=k49rJPkc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-hot-wheels.jpg?itok=sT3r0ega 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What's this? A normal-looking racing game?</figcaption></figure><h2>Pumping the Brakes</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I found the wonky physics to also be a small point of contention. There are optional harder levels denoted by a skull, and personally, the floaty feeling sometimes contributed to more annoyance than ingenious shortcutting.</p>
<p>Sometimes Car's legs would get stuck on some debris, and other times, one little bump would send it flying higher than expected. Similar bumps would just result in a smaller hop or something, but it wasn't always predictable.</p>
<p>Momentum also works a little weirdly in <em>What the Car?</em>, where sometimes hopping with a jetpack would carry forward the momentum. Yet other times, it would just kill all the built-up speed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-soccer-cannon.jpg?itok=t5iID_KV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-soccer-cannon.jpg?itok=zK8DKseT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, that's a car sliding along on its top with the power of a soccer ball cannon.</figcaption></figure><p>Levels are grouped into what Triband calls Episodes, and at the time of writing, <em>What the Car? </em>has nine themed Episodes. You can navigate to each of these Episodes through an overworld that Car can run through and explore.</p>
<p>There are lines that denote main-path levels and optional levels, and there's even more to find off the beaten path, like secret quests and skull levels.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, I think the overworld introduces more tedium than fun. Exploring is alright, but it wears out its welcome partway through, and the extra bit of time it takes to navigate through levels doesn't really add to the charm.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm biased by the demo I played at PAX West, where it was just a quick hit of level after level, just a black screen in between. That rapid fire of inventive humor felt better paced than what the overworld provided.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-overworld.jpg?itok=4jAvNj40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-overworld.jpg?itok=YjHbyV1s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The bears are cute, though.</figcaption></figure><h2>Live Servicing Your Car</h2>
<p>Another sign of <em>What the Car?</em>'s mobile gaming roots, there's already a history of Triband supporting the game with updates after launch. The team continues to add new Episodes, and they release surveys asking players what they should do next.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are daily missions as well as special weekly levels to enjoy. If that's still not enough content, there's a whole library of user-generated levels that you can explore—and there's already a lot, thanks to the Apple Arcade head start.</p>

<p>If you want to get into the level-making game though, I'd recommend a large dose of patience to go with it. The level editor uses the same control scheme as the overworld navigation. In fact, all the menus use this system; you walk up to what you want to do and interact with it.</p>
<p>I found this made for less precision and control over the creation tools, which makes the well-built stages all the more impressive. However, it also meant I wouldn't jump into it for myself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-mad-max.jpg?itok=YujjT6Zv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-mad-max.jpg?itok=v4NZqWYj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm torn between making a Darude - Sandstorm joke or a Mad Max reference.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>What the Car?</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Long story short, there's a lot of content to explore in <em>What the Car?</em>, if it's your kind of game. The mainline levels plus some side content took me five hours, but if you obsess over getting the gold crown and card on everything, you can get a lot of miles out of this.</p>
<p>However, I think this game benefits more from taking it easy on the scenic route. At first, I got caught up in trying to get gold everything, but that detracted from enjoying the absurdity of the game.</p>
<p>As long as you're expecting a silly game that deconstructs the meaning of a car, you'll be in for a good time with a high laughs per minute score. But your mileage may vary if you take it more seriously.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>What the Car? </strong>was reviewed on PC via Steam with a copy provided by the developer over the course of around 5 hours of gameplay. All screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
If we’re measuring the success of What the Car? by laughs per minute, it’s a pretty sweet ride. The overworld eventually wears out its welcome, and some of the harder levels feel a little too frustrating for a comedy game. However, as an overall lighthearted experience, this game kicks it into high gear. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-pathea-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>My Time at Portia&nbsp;</em>developer Pathea Games has revealed&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, the third game in the cozy series of life sims.</p>
<p>Right now, we don't know a whole lot about&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>; a full reveal is coming later this month when <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Kickstarter campaign</a>&nbsp;for the new game goes live. We don't have an official date for that yet.</p>
<p>What we do have, though, is a piece of concept art, which you can see above. It depicts what are presumably several of the characters from&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, as well as the game's logo, which is consistent with the previous two games in the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-time-at-sandrock-gameplay-my-time-at-evershine.jpg?itok=mlXHZ73M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-time-at-sandrock-gameplay-my-time-at-evershine.jpg?itok=mbtdFlN2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The followup to&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/666140/view/4602203912329491293" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a> teasing&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, Pathea says it opted for a Kickstarter campaign once again with&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>because "indie game development comes with its challenges".</p>
<p>The studio says that&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock</em>'s budget was nearly $12 million, which "stretched [the] studio's resources". Since Pathea wants to "reach and exceed"&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, crowdfunding will help the devs to "make more decisions earlier in the development cycle".</p>
<p>Pathea says that&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>will feature "major upgrades in graphics, animation, and gameplay", and that it will offer "more consistent product quality across all platforms".</p>
<p>The announcement concludes with Pathea saying that crowdfunding has helped it to gather together a community of passionate fans, and that it hopes those fans will "continue to support [it]" throughout&nbsp;<em>Evershine</em>'s development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-time-at-portia-pathea-games.jpg?itok=DnRf04J2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-time-at-portia-pathea-games.jpg?itok=h1bkhoHj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also recognize Pathea Games' name from&nbsp;<em>My Time at Portia</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If it feels like there hasn't been much time between the release of&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>and the announcement of&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, well, that's because there hasn't.</p>
<p><em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-sandrock-early-access-release-date-revealed">hit Early Access back in May 2022</a>, and it was released in full in November last year (having been delayed from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-sandrock-finally-builds-full-release-date-will-leave-early-access-in">original September release date</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when you factor in development time, it's likely we won't see&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>for a good few years yet, so there's still plenty of time to play and enjoy&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock</em>.</p>
