            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/trump-tariffs-board-games-ttrpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Board gaming, which during the 2010s was an ascendant medium and an industry finally finding its feet after decades of being seen as child's play, <a href="https://kotaku.com/board-games-are-having-a-bad-time-1842653367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was rocked in 2020 by the pandemic, whose disruptions to manufacturing and shipping costs</a> sent a lot of companies to the wall. Five years later, those challenges seem quaint compared to what's coming in the wake of<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/03/donald-trump-tariffs-world-trade-republicans-join-democrats-block-canada-tariffs-us-politics-latest-news-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the Trump administration's tariff announcements</a>.</p><p>Like most other businesses around the world, many board game companies have been using Chinese manufacturing for years now. In most countries it's the only way to get components made for commercial purposes, since local manufacturing capabilities--or at least those capable of operating at the scale necessary to keep costs down--simply don't exist.</p><p>The imposition of a 54% tariff on goods imported from China will have a cataclysmic effect on the entire industry.<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oldhammerpodcast.bsky.social/post/3llwhylnfh22u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> A statement put out by publisher Steve Jackson Games earlier today</a> puts those numbers into context:</p><blockquote><p>On April 5th, a 54% tariff goes into effect on a wide range of goods imported from China. For those of us who create boardgames, this is not just a policy change. It's a seismic shift.</p><p>At Steve Jackson Games, we are actively assessing what this means for our products, our pricing, and our future plans. We do know that we can't absorb this kind of cost increase without raising prices. We've done our best over the past few years to shield players and retailers from the full brunt of rising freight costs and other increases, but this new tax changes the equation entirely.</p><p>Here are the numbers: A product we might have manufactured in China for $3.00 last year could now cost $4.62 before we even ship it across the ocean. Add freight, warehousing, fulfillment, and distribution margins, and that once-$25 game quickly becomes a $40 product. That's not a luxury upcharge, it's survival math.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Extrapolate that math--$40 games going to $60, $60 games becoming $90 games--and you can see how quickly this gets away from both publishers and retailers. That’s something the industry representative group in the US, The Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA), is all too aware of, saying in a statement today that "The latest imposition of a 54% tariff on products from China by the administration is dire news for the tabletop industry and the broader US economy. As an industry highly dependent on producing goods overseas and importing them into the US, this policy will have devastating consequences."</p><p>Those consequences won't just hit publishers and retailers;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/552558/tabletop-panic-tariffs-on-china-layoffs-bankruptcy-gama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Polygon's Charlie Hall broke down</a> how an entire ecosystem of board game businesses could now face extinction, from distributors to studios who have Kickstarted a game recently but are yet to manufacture their game to TTRPG companies who are already cancelling production runs.</p><p>Even companies outside the US are in trouble; like so many other industries, from cars to electronics, the United States is one of (if not <em>the</em>) single biggest market for board games. Even studios and publishers based in Europe could be looking at huge drops in sales, whether because of tariffs placed on their own exports, or just because Americans are about to have a lot less expendable income to spend on things like board games.</p><p>I know board games aren't going to be grabbing the headlines in the same way cars and electronics will be amidst all this political chaos, but seeing how deeply these proposed tariffs will impact even your hobbies shows how destructive they're going to be, not just to the wider American economy, but your downtime as well.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts"><h3>Psycho Patrol R Is A Hilarious Dream Of A Brutal Future</h3></a><p>The follow-up to Cruelty Squad is a brilliant, euro-septic vision of a the future and one of the best immersive sims I've played in ages.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-price-release"><h3>Nah, Man</h3></a><p>It's not Nintendo's fault, but 2025 sure is a time</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thomas-tank-diesel-10-scary"><h3>Fuck This Anthropomorphic Diesel Engine In Particular</h3></a><p>Thomas and the Magic Railroad's Diesel 10 gave me nightmares</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’ve done our best over the past few years to shield players and retailers from the full brunt of rising freight costs and other increases, but this new tax changes the equation entirely.”</p><p>In the post, Placko spells out an example of how the tariff could affect costs. “A product we might have manufactured in China for $3.00 last year could now cost $4.62 before we even ship it across the ocean,” she says. “Add freight, warehousing, fulfillment, and distribution margins, and that once-$25 game quickly becomes a $40 product. That’s not a luxury upcharge; it’s survival math.”</p><p>Placko adds that the company doesn’t manufacture in the US because the infrastructure “doesn’t meaningfully exist here yet.” She acknowledges that tariffs can be “an effective tool” when they are “part of a long-term strategy to bolster domestic manufacturing.” But she says that “there is no national plan in place to support manufacturing for the types of products we make.”</p><p>If you’re frustrated with the tariffs, Placko suggests writing to your elected officials. “Ask them how these new policies help American creators and small businesses,” she says. “Because right now, it feels like they don’t.”</p><p>The Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA) has also issued a grim warning. “The latest imposition of a 54% tariff on products from China by the administration is dire news for the tabletop industry and the broader US economy,” GAMA said, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/552558/tabletop-panic-tariffs-on-china-layoffs-bankruptcy-gama">according to <em>Polygon</em></a>. Card-grading company PSA has released a statement about the new tariffs, too, saying that the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643117/psa-pausing-submissions-outside-us-tariffs">has paused</a> direct card grading submissions from outside the US.</p><p>In March, Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-ceo-on-trump-tariffs-higher-toy-prices-are-looming-184955178.html">told <em>Yahoo Finance</em> that</a> “when you’re talking about tariffs in the neighborhood of 20 percent plus, that’s a cost that we can’t fully accommodate. It will have to be passed on.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-valhalla-origins-odyssey<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em><a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16792/assassins-creed-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has reviewed well</a>, folks are into it,<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-elon-musk-twitter-ratio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it's trending on social media</a>; all of that is great, because I'm loving it as well. But looking over a lot of people's reviews and general feedback, I can't help but wonder where some of you have been for the last ten years.</p><p>For all the cool stuff <em>Shadows </em>does around the edges of the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>formula, the core experience–the way the game feels and plays and what it has you doing moment to moment–feels largely unchanged from <em>Origins</em>, a game released all the (relative) way back in 2017.</p><p>This is not a criticism. That makes sense! Of course they feel the same; a lot of the same tech is underpinning both games, which is why Bayek and Naoe move with largely the same momentum and stick to walls and doorframes the same frustrating ways. These aren’t the only familiar things, though; even <em>Shadows</em>' missions, quests and, most important, sandbox playthings are much the same.</p><p>For all of Ubisoft's efforts at making elaborate, scripted story missions for the game's two playable characters, the centrepiece of <em>Shadows</em>--and the last few <em>Assassin's Creed</em> games, but <em>Shadows </em>does it slightly better--is its open world, sandbox mayhem. It’s those personally-curated, freestyle moments when the game shows you a city block, farm or entire castle full of bad guys, a number of different ways you can approach them and says "have fun".</p><p>These are the moments that the game, and indeed much of the series, was built for. When every button press and inventory item is geared towards player expression, whether they’re opting for stealth or combat. Every sandbox encounter, from its scale to its architecture, is designed with the multiple paths towards the same goal: You can sneak your way through and steal some loot; you can sneak your way through killing everybody; you can try to sneak post everybody, fail and have to fight who's left; or you can just kick the front door open, say "surprise motherfuckers" and kill everyone.</p><p><em>Assassin's Creed</em> has always had some iteration of these playgrounds (<em>Black Flag's</em> fortress battles were great), but they started getting <em>really </em>good in <em>Origins</em>, which was the first true open-world <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, meaning it was the first to really flood the map with staged encounters and let you have at them however you wanted. And while the quality of these sandboxes has ebbed and flowed slightly over the years as settings and characters have necessitated slight changes, for me they've remained the highlight of each successive game.</p><p>The flexibility you're given, the freedom of expression, the possible strategies lying before you, the satisfaction of a self-imposed job well done, I love it all. Ubisoft know exactly what it is that's best about this series–not long horseback rides or eavesdropping, but the act of sneaking up to a guy, shanking him in the ribs then dragging his body into the bushes. Wash, rinse, repeat.</p><figure></figure><p>In <em>Shadows </em>these moments--its towering castles especially--remain the highlights. Especially since our creative impulses have been spun off into two distinct characters, each with their own strengths and approaches: Naoe for more traditional stealth and Yasuke for when I just want to kick a man to death.</p><p>I get the impression they're the highlights for a lot of other people out there, too. This is anecdotal, but three out of five co-founders here at Aftermath didn't unlock Yasuke until around 15-20 hours into the game, because we were all too busy climbing viewpoints and rinsing castles and just generally doing cool assassin stuff. (The other two co-founders...haven't played the game.)</p><p>I'm happy for everyone finding out that these skirmishes are the best part of the game but, as someone who put over 100 hours into each of the last three main games, I just wanted to say here that <em>Shadows</em>' highlights aren't substantially different to those found in <em>Origins</em>, <em>Odyssey </em>or <em>Valhalla</em>. <em>Assassin's Creed</em> has been this good for a long time, and I don't think enough people either remember that, or were aware of it in the first place.</p><p>There's a feeling on the wind, especially now that everyone is having so much fun with <em>Shadows </em>and that<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/ubisoft-had-an-absolutely-dire-2024-and-desperately-needs-a-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ubisoft has been in such trouble lately</a>, that the last few <em>Assassin's Creed</em> games have been <em>bad</em>. But that's not true. The last three (four if you count the glorified spin-off <em>Mirage</em>) have been <em>fantastic</em>, full of memorable characters and breathtaking locations and extremely cool missions.

            <p>
The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), which represents all major gaming companies in the US, has responded to US president Donald Trump's sweeping trade tariffs, saying the measures will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the games industry.
</p>
<p>
Trump imposed wide-reaching trade tariffs earlier this week, with some of the highest levies targeting countries which also happen to be critical centres of video games hardware manufacturing. Vietnam, for instance - where much of Nintendo's hardware production now takes place - was hit with 46 percent tariffs, while China's reach as high as 54 percent.
</p>
<p>
Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/esa-trump-tariffs">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, ESA senior vice president Aubrey Quinn said the increased costs associated with these tariffs "are going to have a real and detrimental impact on the video game industry". Quinn also noted the way parts are sourced and devices are shipped means, "Any one product that a consumer would buy is likely to be subject to many of the tariffs announced, all compounded on top of one another."

<p>
The situation could also worsen, Quinn suggested, as countries affected by the tariffs begin to take retaliatory measures. "I think what we heard yesterday is not the end of the story," she added, "not for the United States, not for other countries."
</p>
<p>
Tariffs have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">already been a major talking point following Switch 2's reveal</a>, with analyst Daniel Ahmad noting, "Nintendo shifted its manufacturing to Vietnam to avoid tariffs and with today's reciprocal tariff announcements they're likely going to end up paying tariffs anyway." Ahmad also suggested the console's higher US cost compared to Japan "is likely a calculated move on Nintendo's part, driven by tariff impacts, the weak Japanese yen, and local market conditions."
</p>
<p>
There've also been fears <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, which is priced at $450 in the US, could see its cost eventually rise to as much as $600 if impacted by the Trump administration's tariffs. However, Ahmad argued it's "unlikely that Nintendo will raise the price of the console at this point, but it's also unlikely to see a price drop in the next five years."
</p>
<p>
Back to Quinn, though. When asked if video game manufacturers should consider producing more goods in the US to lessen the effect of tariffs, she concluded, "I think every company, every industry... needs to think about what's best for consumers, best for business, and best for employees. Supply chains are complicated and, certainly, supply chains don't change overnight. Everything that is considered or decided can't be a quick turnaround and can't be a knee-jerk reaction to any particular announcement."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> has exceeded most everybody’s wildest expectations, moving <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-sales-surpass-150-million-units-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 150 million units</a> on the way to (most likely) breaking console sales records set by Sony’s PlayStation 2. Following up on that sort of success is no simple or easy feat, and Nintendo has taken what some have deemed the “safe” route by simply delivering a more powerful, feature-enhanced <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Of course, sometimes the appeal of new hardware isn’t obvious at first glance. You need to actually go hands-on to get that exciting new console feel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recently had the opportunity to do just that, going hands-on with the Nintendo Switch 2 for several hours at a press event in Paris, tackling upcoming games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. While I’ll have deeper thoughts to share about individual Switch 2 games in the near future, we’re going to focus on the hardware itself in this article. Has Nintendo delivered a new level of Switch splendor or should you keep your expectations docked? Scroll on for my early hands-on impressions…</span></p>

<h2><b>Form Factor</b></h2>
<p><span>Those who have had a Nintendo Switch rattling around in their backpack for the past eight years will find themselves on familiar ground with the Switch 2 in terms of basic form and function, although almost everything about the new system feels a bit more polished and cohesively designed. While slightly larger than its predecessor, the Switch 2 still feels manageable to hold, and despite packing a lot more processing power, the system remains surprisingly thin and light (perhaps even lighter than the original Switch). The matte plastic the system is made of feels nice to the touch, and, hopefully, won’t be a magnet for palm sweat.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Various small tweaks to the Switch 2 make it feel like a more modern, deluxe device, including a sturdy new flexible kickstand and dual USB-C ports, which could open the way for a broader range of accessories, like the newly-announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-camera-function/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</a>. I didn’t spend a lot of time examining the new Switch 2 dock closely as they were almost all hidden behind glass, but Nintendo has said it has a fan to actively cool the system now, boosting performance gains when playing docked.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch23.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The Switch 2 offers up a larger (approximately 8-inch) 1080p screen, with a slimmer bezel. The screen looked quite sharp, lacking the jagginess often seen when playing the OG Switch in handheld mode, although it is noticeable that the screen is a touch less bright and vibrant than the Switch OLED’s screen. For now, greater sharpness in exchange for a bit less brightness is a trade-off you’re going to have to make (as somebody who only plays Switch in handheld mode on occasion, I don’t mind, but your mileage may vary).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Overall, the Switch 2 is a handsome little devil that you may want to spend a few minutes just admiring in your hands before you jump into a game, although I’d be lying if I said the design upgrades are truly transformative. This is the Switch you know, just polished up a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch24.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><b>The Joy-Con Grows Up</b></h2>
<p><span>Arguably the lion’s share of the Switch 2’s design upgrades have gone towards improving the detachable Joy-Con controllers. The OG Switch’s Joy-Cons always felt like a good idea that hadn’t been fully realized – too small, too finicky, too flimsy and prone to stick drift and other failures. While the Switch 2’s new Joy-Cons have been extended less than an inch compared to the original models, they do feel more substantial in the hand. The sticks feel less flimsy, and a Nintendo rep present at the preview hinted they’ve been re-engineered to head off drift (something the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NY Times got hints about too</a>). Whether the new Switch 2 Joy-Cons will be more resilient in the long term remains to be seen, but they felt sturdier to me.</span></p>
<p><span>The Switch 2 Joy-Cons also come with some new functionality, including an IR sensor that allows the player to use a Joy-Con like a mouse. I had a chance to test the mouse functionality with several games, including Metroid Prime 4 and the updated Switch 2 version of Mario Party Jamboree and the controls were perfectly responsive and holding the Joy-Con on its edge felt surprisingly comfortable. That said, Nintendo may still have to hone their approach to mouse controls, as some games, particularly Metroid Prime 4, still require you to press the face buttons on the Joy-Con you’re using as a mouse, which doesn’t feel intuitive. The new Joy-Cons’ HD Rumble also feels as though it’s been subtly updated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oh, and yes, as somebody who likes messing around with anything magnetic, the way the new Joy-Cons satisfyingly snap onto the side of the Switch is an immense improvement over the old janky rail system. Once connected to the main Switch 2 unit, the Joy-Cons felt fully secure, but again, we’ll have to wait and see regarding long-term durability.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch28.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><b>Nintendo Power</b></h2>
<p><span>Nintendo’s developers are a talented lot, but they’ve been working with more or less the same toolbox for well over a decade, given the Switch was only marginally more powerful than the Wii U. While Nintendo remains largely mum about the Switch 2’s under-the-hood improvements, it’s clear the toolbox has finally received an upgrade. That said, it’s also clear it will likely take Nintendo devs a while to adapt to the new power at their fingertips. Much like the earliest crop of Wii U titles, which marked Nintendo’s first foray into HD gaming, Switch 2’s first games look better than most of what we’ve seen from the company before, but it also feels like they’re leaving a lot of potential on the table.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the first-party content shown by Nintendo at the hands-on event can be roughly sorted into three piles – new big AAA-style experiences (Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Metroid Prime 4), enhanced “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition” versions of older Switch games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> + Star-Crossed World, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-party-jamboree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Party Jamboree</a> + Jamboree TV), and quirky stuff designed to show off the system’s new control features (Drag x Drive, Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, and, uh, Super Party Jamboree again).</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch27.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The most successful group were the big headline games. Mario Kart World very much feels like a direct follow-up to Mario Kart 8, and that’s not a bad thing. While Mario Kart World doesn’t necessarily stand out that much visually next to MK8, Nintendo is undoubtedly putting the Switch 2’s power to some use with the game’s higher 24 racer playercount and interconnected open world. Donkey Kong Bananza offers up a bold reboot of the Kongiverse and looks to provide all the varied challenges, collectibles, and hidden extras you’d expect from a major Nintendo release. The slice of Metroid Prime 4 I got to play left me with some questions, but there was no denying its technical prowess, running an impressive 120fps in Performance mode, with none of the rough un-aliased edges we've become used to seeing from some Nintendo games.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch29.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades didn’t land with quite as much impact. While playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom with 4K visuals and a smooth framerate was certainly nice, it wasn’t the transformative experience I expected it to be. Perhaps my favorite upgraded Switch experience was Kirby and the Forgotten Land, which looks better than ever (it was already one of the prettiest Switch titles) and adds the new Star-Crossed Worlds content, which promises to be just as fun as the original game.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Quirky Stuff bag was a bit more mixed. The additions to Mario Party Jamboree were all quite entertaining, but I’m not sure how much they’ll extend the life of the game. Drag x Drive was, frankly, a bit of a drag. Perhaps the best of the quirky crew was actually Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, which features some fun diversions and ought to come at a nice price.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch210.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Each individual game’s pros and cons aside (again, I'll have more to say about that in the future), it really does have to be stated how refreshing the technical polish of all of them were. Almost every game I played, from Mario Kart World, to Donkey Kong Bananza, to Metroid Prime 4 ran at an unblemished 60fps (or more). The OG Switch has been showing its age for some time now, so just the clarity, smoothness, and general technical prowess of most of the games I played felt revelatory in its own small way. I’m particularly excited to see what Nintendo might do with the hardware a few years down the line.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch211.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><b>Current Thoughts on Nintendo Switch 2</b></h2>
<p><span>It’s been a long time since Nintendo last chose to simply iterate on a successful formula with a new console. Since the 90s with the Super Nintendo, arguably. They’ve been so dedicated to throwing the baby out with the bathwater for so many successive generations, that the Switch 2 ends up feeling rather refreshing in a way. That said, they’re also asking quite a bit for this “Super” upgrade – $450 for the console itself, with games perhaps as much as $80. That may complicate the “Should I buy this right away?” math for some people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re one of the sizable number of folks who have affection for their trusty Switches, it seems quite likely you’ll enjoy the Switch 2. The system looks better, feels better, the Joy-Cons are sturdier and more versatile, and playing Nintendo games with some decent hardware grunt behind them is a nice change of pace. Whether the Switch 2 reaches the commercial heights of the OG Switch will largely depend on its library of games, but titles like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza show Nintendo can still deliver fun, and sometimes unexpected, experiences with their long-running franchises. While I need more time with the Switch 2 to render a final verdict, it feels like the pieces are there for another hybrid hit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep an eye out for my hands-on impressions of Switch 2 games, including Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and more over the coming days. The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5 with pre-orders going live on April 9.</span></p>

I know we're all about PC games, but none of you will mind if I reminisce about how good PS2 games were, would you? Good, because they were! And <strong>Havenhold</strong>, the debut game from the Beijing based <strong>Wolfpack Games</strong>, looks like it could quite easily be one, even if it has some modern sensibilities in places. You play as a Taichu warrior monk, fighting against other players as you all vye for the top of a special mountain, with the catch being that the game's world completely resets every 14 days.

<p>
Gameplay wise, it looks to be a pretty solid action game complete with dodging, parrying, elemental abilities. Nothing that necessarily stands out on its own, but it looks pretty tight here as a complete package, and I'm a fan of how your visage transforms depending on the element that you're using. As you try to make your way to the top of the game's main mountain, Kunlun, you'll find dungeons, ruins, temples, that sorta thing, where you can learn new abilities and find blueprints to make gear and weapons.

<p>
For me, the main appeal is in the game's cycle system. I love time-based pressure games like The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unsighted">Unsighted</a>, so to see a game like Havenhold explore that across two weeks feels like a cool concept. 
</p>
<p>
The whole game is PvP generally, but you might be sometimes forced to fight tougher enemies with others, so the whole thing is kind of like one really long Fortnite match you can dip in and out of. I like it! Don't worry though, you keep items and powers over into new cycles, so you don't lose out completely.
</p>
<p>
There's a closed beta test taking place later this month on April 17th too, which you can sign-up to try out through the game's Steam page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2015760/Havenhold/">here</a>. It's also planned to launch into early access sometime this year, though no word on when that'll be just yet.

			<p>Gamers aren't the only ones who are doing everything they can to get their hands on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> as soon as possible. According to a report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/game-devs-scramble-to-join-nintendo">The Game Business</a>, game developers are "desperate" to get their hands on a Nintendo Switch 2 development kit.</p>
<p>Obviously, you can count out all the publishers and developers who were able to announce that&nbsp;<span>their&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game is coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a> on launch or sometime later this year during Wednesday's Nintendo Direct presentation</span>&nbsp;from having this issue. Nintendo has, perhaps expectedly, prioritized the biggest studios and publishers when it comes to who gets a dev kit first.</p>
<p>Those left out of the loop expressed their frustrations to The Game Business, with one studio co-founder expressing why it's so important that studios get their hands on development kits for new consoles as soon as possible.</p>
<p><em>"New console audiences are often willing to try new things at the start, so we were desperate to get our hands on dev kits early. Nintendo has finally responded to us, but we still don’t think we’ll get anything for a few months</em>," the studio co-founder said.</p>
<p>That same studio also claimed they could have had a game ready to go with the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 this coming June had they heard from Nintendo earlier. The Game Business also reports that most of the studios they spoke to had not received a development kit or any word from Nintendo as to when they would see one coming their way.</p>
<p>The Game Business did add, though, that those teams who have not heard yet are hopeful things will change now that the console's release date and launch lineup have been revealed.</p>
<p>Nintendo might have covered the biggest bases with its first wave of Switch 2 development kits, but alongside the first-party titles Nintendo brings to its platforms, the popularity of indie games on the Nintendo Switch is a key cultural aspect of its player base. And those smaller, independent developers are all the ones who've likely been left out of the loop on development kits.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see if any studios speak out in the coming months about how their game could have arrived on Nintendo Switch 2 sooner if only Nintendo had been more willing to share its wealth of development kits.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-reveals-new-details-for-season-2-hellfire-gala-introduces-emma-frost/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase Games has just revealed new details about the upcoming Season 2: Hellfire Gala update that will go live next week on April 11, 2025. The new season adds X-Men Emma Frost to the lineup, and Ultron, who spoils the gala Frost is hosting in the Mutant nation of Krakoa.</p>
<p><span>This is also the setting of the new maps that'll be added with Season 2, which, according to a press release, will feature "<em>dreamy botanical landscapes and beautiful fireworks</em>."</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Season 2: Hellfire Gala Official Trailer | Krakoa Welcomes You April 11! | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/thyG51IdChc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Weekly missions will also be added with Season 2 on top of the already included daily missions, just to give players a little more to do during the three-month-long season.</p>
<p>Speaking of season length, NetEase also revealed that beginning with Season 3, a season in Marvel Rivals will only be two months long, with a new playable character introduced each month.</p>
<p>For Season 2, the first half will introduce Emma Frost as a new Vanguard character, with Ultron, and details about his character type, still to come in the second half of the season. Season 2 will also feature the first time NetEase adjusts or removes certain team-up abilities, which means the game is about to undergo some of its first major changes.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals launched at the end of 2024, and has so far accomplished what many big publishers have tried and failed to do, which is carving out a slice of the live service pie for itself. NetEase boasts that the game has grown to beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/">40 million players</a> since its launch, and it doesn't show any signs of slowing down. Marvel Rivals definitely has an advantage over games like Sony's failed <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-ceo-shares-learnings-from-concord-failure-reckons-psn-requirement-will-keep-pc-games-safe/">Concord</a>, which was also attempting to establish a new set of characters and a new world for players to enjoy, but as we saw in <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-shutting-down-soon-2023-content-canceled/">Marvel's Avengers,</a> a big IP backing up your game doesn't mean it'll be a smash-hit.</p>

<p>NetEase even admits in its developer vision presentation that the studio understands the pressure it is under to sustain the success Marvel Rivals has enjoyed so far. These changes coming in Season 2, which are still to be laid bare in the full patch notes still to come, could prove to be the beginning of a turning point for the game, with the next check coming with the arrival of shorter seasons in Season 3. This was a move made specifically to try to keep players engaged and not let the game stay too stale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/nintendo-virtual-game-cards-explained<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In what may be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last Nintendo Switch 1-dedicated Nintendo Direct</a>, the gaming company revealed Virtual Game Cards, a solution to moving digital purchases between Switch consoles and even lending them to family members who are part of your Nintendo Switch Online family account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But how exactly does loading, ejecting, and sharing games work on Nintendo Switch and upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 systems?&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Loading &amp; Ejecting Nintendo Switch Virtual Cards&nbsp;</h2>

<p>For many of us who own multiple Nintendo Switch consoles and buy games digitally, the process of ensuring those games are actually playable is pretty daunting, since an internet connection can be required to load the game. Many players have solved this problem by designating a Switch Lite or OLED as their primary Switch and the console they use at home as a secondary Switch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Virtual Game Cards are supposed to make this process simpler by allowing you to view your Virtual Game Cards on a designated menu and simply load or eject them between two consoles. The idea is to be able to play your digital purchase on either console without the need for an internet check, but being online is still necessary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fine print on the Nintendo Virtual Game Card page reads: "An internet connection is required the first time you start a game that you have loaded to your system. An internet connection is also required each time a loaded title is ejected."</p>

<p>So even though only a local area connection is required to change the games between systems, you'll need to be connected to the internet to actually launch the game. The two Switch consoles must be linked to the same Nintendo Account, and any user on that account has access to that game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Virtual Game Cards management system in the Direct also indicated a simple drag-and-drop method of loading and ejecting cards between two systems. It will be interesting to see if the real thing is as seamless as they make it to be, but it makes sense with the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 release that they want users to more easily share digital games between Switch 1 and Switch 2 consoles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's currently unclear if you'd be able to load a digital game onto a family member's primary Switch console if your account is on there as a secondary user, but you can at least lend games to other NSO members on your family plan.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Lending a Nintendo Switch Digital Game to a Family Member</h2>

<p>Up until now, letting family members play digital games you own has been a cumbersome process that usually involves setting your Nintendo Account as the primary user for the console they'll be using.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this system, users can lend a Nintendo Virtual Game Card to people on the same Nintendo Switch Online family account. However, only one game can be lent per person at a time, and you can't lend the same game to multiple people at the same time. I suppose this is primarily to prevent one person buying&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/splatoon-3" rel="nofollow">Splatoon 3</a></em> and making it possible to squad up with three other people with just one copy of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's also an expiration: the Virtual Game Card will be loaded onto the second user's Switch for 14 days before it's automatically returned. Nintendo didn't clarify if the lender will be able to also play the game during this lending period, but seeing as Virtual Game Cards are supposed to be the digital variation of a physical game cart, it's likely not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With that in mind, if lending Virtual Game Cards is supposed to be as convenient as lending a physical cart, it's extremely weird to have the 14-day limit. It would make sense for the person lending to have the ability to pull the card back at any time, but the idea of lending a game like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild" rel="nofollow">Breath of the Wild</a></em> or <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom" rel="nofollow">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em> for only 14 days is absurd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's implied the lender should be able to lend the same game out again immediately after the 14 days expire, but this wasn't explicitly stated. For these reasons, those wanting to freely lend their games out with no restrictions may want to stick to physical media for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What Are the Nintendo Virtual Game Card Limitations?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>As covered above, the main Nintendo Virtual Game card limitations include:</p>

<ul><li>Only being able to load and eject Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 games between two consoles.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Only lend out one game at a time per person through the NSO family plan.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Games can only be lent out for 14 days at a time before automatically being returned to the owner.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>It does not appear like the owner will have the ability to play the game they lend out during this period.</li>
</ul><p>The Virtual Game Card is a solution to a problem that Nintendo created by not allowing digital games to be easily played and shared between different users. A platform like Steam has a much better game-sharing system, and I don't see a reason why Nintendo wouldn't adopt something like this to make their games be more easily enjoyed by more people, apart from the fact that they're Nintendo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Are Virtual Game Cards going to be an easy and convenient way to swap digital purchases between consoles or just a cumbersome step that could potentially feed into an algorithmic marketing machine to better gauge gaming interests from a young age? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>Those concerns aside though, we did get a cool reveal in the fine print of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/?srsltid=AfmBOoqItjD-H0JptkV-v6kE_8IJi01rkN1RUf-4Z3As7MmIE3FgGSh3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Virtual Game Card webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Did Nintendo Just Confirm Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Games?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Yes. Yes they did, and in a disclaimer no less.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the Nintendo Virtual Game Card webpage, they have the following disclaimer:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Compatible systems must be linked to a Nintendo Account to use virtual game cards. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system."</p>

<p>There has been discussion for months now about if the Nintendo Switch 2 would ship Switch 2-editions of Switch 1 games, most notably <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metroid-prime-4" rel="nofollow">Metroid Prime 4</a></em> and <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-legends-arceus" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Legends</a> ZA</em>. This disclaimer looks to confirm that Switch 1 titles have the potential to also get a Nintendo Switch 2 version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This falls in line with what we've seen from other companies – Sony and Microsoft continued releasing cross-gen games for a few years into the current console cycle. Though Nintendo has a history of making their consoles backwards-compatible (which we know Switch 2 will be), it usually reserves cross-gen games for special launch titles (<em>Twilight Princess, Breath of the Wild</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Virtual Game Cards in Spring 2025&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Available as an update in late April 2025, Nintendo Account users can start experimenting with Virtual Game Cards. As for the digital titles we already own, will those transfer and become a Virtual Game Card? I don't think we'll know for sure until the update actually drops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nintendo Virtual Game Cards were a cool reveal, but I think in practice they're going to be much more cumbersome than they're worth.</p>

<p>Maybe this will be a fun feature for families with lots of kids who want to load and eject Virtual Game Cards frequently, but for a company that still sells a significant number of physical games, it feels like a half-step solution that won't be worth the trouble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That being said, I'm looking forward to checking this out for myself in April when it launches and see if it's measurably better than the current system for digital purchases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/642866/nintendo-switch-2-steam-deck-lcd-oled-comparison-specs-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The biggest threat to the Steam Deck in 2025 won’t be the arrival of other Windows-based handheld gaming PCs. Instead, it’ll likely be the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which arrives on June 5 for $449.99 — smack dab between the cost of the $399 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Deck LCD</a> and the $549 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>. </p><p>Ironically, the Steam Deck is also the Switch 2’s biggest threat. While Nintendo’s new console may have Valve’s beat on screen resolution, refresh rate, and a custom Nvidia processor capable of DLSS and ray tracing, Steam trumps it in value, particularly with game prices.</p><p>I get it, I get it. They’re totally different devices. So even though comparing Nintendo and Valve’s hardware and software philosophies is an apples versus oranges exercise, the two devices — and companies — are more aligned than you might think. And that’s especially true when consumers, whether because of tariffs or other economic reasons, need to choose between one or the other.</p><p>You’ve come to the right place, as we’ll break down all of the specs worth caring about to show how they stack up.</p><div><p id="pricing-and-availability"><h2>Pricing and availability</h2></p></div><p>As mentioned, the Switch 2 and the Steam Deck have somewhat similar prices. The Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $449.99 to start, though there will be a $499.99 bundle available for a limited time that includes <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Preorders go live on Wednesday, April 9th for the console, its accessories, and launch titles.</p><p>Valve’s Steam Deck doesn’t come with various game bundles, although there are two models to choose from: the $399 Steam Deck LCD (also known simply as Steam Deck) and the Steam Deck OLED, which starts at $549. Several specs, as well as storage amounts, differentiate the two. The Verge’s Sean Hollister has a review of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> that neatly sums up their differences. In the US, the Steam Deck is only available through Steam, Valve’s online game storefront. Internationally, it’s available through various stores.</p><div><p id="display-technology"><h2>Display technology</h2></p></div><p>This is where things get really interesting. The Switch 2 took many by surprise by featuring a 7.9-inch 1080p LCD touchscreen with a 120Hz refresh rate. Not only that, it supports VRR and HDR10. Compared to the launch Switch and Switch Lite, both of which had 720p LCDs of varying sizes (6.2 inches in the Switch, 5.5 inches in the Switch Lite), it’s a big difference in terms of added size, features, more clarity, and smoothness in how games appear onscreen. The same could be said for the Switch 2’s screen improvements over the Steam Deck LCD, which has a 7-inch 60Hz LCD touchscreen (with chunky bezels) without VRR or HDR support.</p><p>The Switch OLED’s 7-inch 720p OLED screen may be better than the Switch 2’s screen in terms of contrast and viewing angles, but the Switch 2’s is faster and better in every other metric.</p><p>The Switch 2 meets its match in the Steam Deck OLED. Many hoped that Nintendo would come out of the gates with an OLED display, but that still makes Valve’s $549 handheld special. The Steam Deck OLED has a smaller 800p touchscreen than the Switch 2 at 7.4 inches (but without the chunky bezels of the Deck LCD), but adds 90Hz refresh rate and HDR into the mix. </p><p>It’s a gorgeous screen, with stellar viewing angles and brilliant color reproduction, making 800p games somehow look higher resolution. Some may prefer the higher refresh rate and VRR in the Switch 2, which will allow the screen to quickly adapt to a fluctuating frame rate without tearing. The VRR difference is something you have to experience yourself, and it’s great to have in the Switch 2 as not many handhelds support it, save for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> and select others.</p><div><p id="performance-and-battery-life"><h2>Performance and battery life</h2></p></div><p>There is sure to be more to come in terms of comparing performance between the Switch 2 and the Steam Deck. Hands-on time with the Switch 2 has been limited to a few games coming at launch, so you should expect more on how games available for both compare in terms of visuals and frame rate.</p><p>We can make some comparisons based on specs. Both the Steam Deck models use a custom AMD APU (bundling the Zen 2 CPU and RDNA 2 GPU) that plays a swath of PC games relatively smoothly at good-to-great visual quality with surprisingly good battery life. Not every game can take full advantage of the Steam Deck OLED’s 90Hz refresh rate, but that’s not a claim Valve makes. Some AMD’s FSR graphical upscaling technology is available in select games to reduce the render resolution of the image and upscale it using AI. In many cases, it makes supported games run better on Steam Deck, but with a major hit to visual quality.</p><p>On the other hand, I think Nintendo’s Switch 2 is more of a spec powerhouse than anyone expected. It uses a custom Nvidia processor, though almost no details about its power have been unveiled at the time of publishing. Nintendo is publicly targeting up to 120 frames per second in some games in handheld mode, with a 60 frames per second cap at 4K when docked, indicating that there’s quite a bit of potential in the Switch 2. Nintendo Switch 2 hardware engineers claim the console utilizes DLSS and ray tracing — key features offered by Nvidia graphics cards. It’s unclear how these features will be used in titles across the board, and if there are any downsides to its implementation.</p><p>Switching over to battery life, the Steam Deck has the Switch 2 beat, though for both handhelds it’s important to note that battery longevity varies wildly depending on the games you play. <em>Balatro</em>, for instance, is less taxing on hardware than <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. The Switch 2 has an expected battery life between 2 and 6.5 hours. Valve’s Steam Deck LCD (which has a 40Wh battery) can last between 2 and 8 hours, while the Steam Deck OLED, thanks to its more efficient display and jump from 40Wh to 50Wh, lasts between 3 and 12 hours.</p><div><p id="storage-dock-and-more"><h2>Storage, dock, and more</h2></p></div><p>By default, the Switch 2 contains 256GB of speedy UFS storage that presumably cannot be upgraded by the end user. However, it can be expanded upon with microSD cards — but not just any will do. It’s one of the first devices to support microSD Express, which are classified as PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSDs, but are just as tiny as other microSD cards. The console supports up to 2TB capacities, though we’ve only seen up to 1TB models hit shelves so far (more will certainly show up in time for the Switch 2’s June 5th launch).</p><p>The Steam Deck offers more versatility. For one, all models come with M.2 2230-sized SSDs that can be upgraded by opening the system. Doing so doesn’t void the warranty, but you’ll want to be careful. Once inside, you can replace the SSD with something bigger. It’s unclear currently whether the Steam Deck’s built-in SSD is faster or on a par with the Switch 2’s internal storage.</p><p>If you want to supplement the SSD with more user-friendly expandable storage, each Deck also supports UHS-1 microSD cards. Those are slower than the Switch 2’s microSD Express cards, but they do the trick.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Owen Grove / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Both handhelds can be used as hybrids, either in handheld mode or docked to a TV. Speaking of their handheld use case first, the Switch 2 includes a versatile kickstand, while the Steam Deck doesn’t. </p><p>Placing either on a dock grants you more ports to connect to the console. The Switch 2 dock, which comes with each console, includes an HDMI port, USB-C for power, plus an Ethernet port for wired internet. The Steam Deck docking station is a separate $79 accessory that includes more ports, such as HDMI, DisplayPort, three USB-A ports, Ethernet, and a USB-C port for power.</p><p>The Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch 2 have USB-C ports that send video out to your display. However, only the Switch 2 features a second USB-C port, located on its top, which can be used to plug in peripherals, such as a camera for GameChat, or numerous other accessories to be released in the future. This Switch 2’s secondary USB-C port doesn’t support video out. In the case of the Switch 2, its dock unlocks more power capabilities, whereas the Steam Deck’s dock <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeckdock%23%3A~%3Atext%3DWill%2520using%2520Docking%2520Station%2520increase%2520the%2520performance%2520of%2520Steam%2520Deck%253F" rel="sponsored">doesn’t increase its power</a>. </p><div><p id="games-and-software"><h2>Games and software</h2></p></div><p>The Steam Deck puts your Steam library at your fingertips. You’ll be able to play most of them on the Steam Deck, but how each game performs — including whether you can launch it at all, due to anti-cheat or other incompatibility reasons — varies depending on the game. Valve attempts to make it easy to know whether a game will work well on Steam Deck. If it’s “<a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified">Verified</a>,” that means you’ll probably have a good experience. If it’s “Playable,” there might be some controller-based difficulties that might negatively impact and otherwise good experience. “Unsupported” games are simply that — they either won’t work if you boot them, or Valve hasn’t tested them and doesn’t know what kind of time you’re in for. One defining feature of Steam is that the store hosts many sales, and Steam games can be legally acquired through third-party sites at big discounts. Games are often significantly more affordable by comparison to the Switch and other gaming consoles.</p><p>The Switch 2 supports almost all original Switch games, though <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftransfer-guide%2Fcompatible-games%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopHuS4GsXqD2aRPJwfKf5_kU7odM1BiStkhrlQBjoFQSVOAqSzR" rel="sponsored">there are some titles that have issues</a>. It supports them through a method “somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility,” according to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4%2F" rel="sponsored">Switch 2 developer Takuhiro Dohta</a>. This sounds somewhat similar to Valve’s Proton, a compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run on the Steam Deck’s fork of Linux.</p><p>Continuing on the Switch 2, there are “Switch 2 Edition” upgrades to select Switch titles that add flourishes allowed by the more powerful hardware, ranging from faster frames per second and higher resolution (<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>), as well as other Switch 2-only features, like GameChat functionality (<em>Super Mario Party: Jamboree - Switch 2 Edition</em>), or mouse controls (Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Switch 2 Edition). Then, there will be Switch 2-exclusive games, like Mario Kart World, that can only be played on new hardware.</p><p>Games aside, let’s speak about the underlying software. The Switch 2, much like its predecessor, is focused almost exclusively on gaming. We don’t yet know whether video streaming services will be available. However, on the Steam Deck, you have the option to switch from gaming to “desktop mode,” essentially turning it into a Linux desktop. From there, you can install apps of your choosing, run a browser, connect Google accounts to it to type documents — anything that comes to mind.</p><div><p id="by-the-numbers"><h2>By the numbers</h2></p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Specification</h3></th><th><h3>Nintendo Switch 2</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck LCD</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Custom Nvidia chipset (details TBD)</td><td>Custom AMD APU</td><td>Custom AMD APU</td></tr><tr><td>Screen type</td><td>7.9-inch LCD</td><td>7.4-inch OLED</td><td>7-inch LCD</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution (handheld)</td><td>1,920 x 1080, up to 120Hz, VRR, HDR</td><td>1,280 x 800, up to 90Hz, HDR</td><td>1,280 x 800, up to 60Hz</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution (docked)</td><td>3,840 x 2,160 at 60Hz, or 1440p/1080p at up to 120Hz</td><td>7680 x 4320 at 60Hz, or 3840 x 2160 at 120Hz</td><td>7680 x 4320 at 60Hz, or 3840 x 2160 at 120Hz</td></tr><tr><td>HDR10 support?</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Internal storage</td><td>256GB</td><td>512GB</td><td>256GB</td></tr><tr><td>Expandable storage</td><td>microSD Express (up to 2TB)</td><td>microSD (up to 2TB)</td><td>microSD (up to 2TB)</td></tr><tr><td>Sensors</td><td>Accelerometer / gyroscope, mouse / brightness (in console)</td><td>Accelerometer / gyroscope / ambient light sensor</td><td>Accelerometer / gyroscope / ambient light sensor</td></tr><tr><td>Ports (handheld)</td><td>2x USB-C / 3.5mm</td><td>USB-C / 3.5mm</td><td>USB-C / 3.5mm</td></tr><tr><td>Ports (dock)</td><td>2x USB-C / HDMI / ethernet</td><td>3x USB 2.0 / 2x USB-A / USB-C (power adapter) / HDMI / DisplayPort / Ethernet (dock not included)</td><td>3x USB 2.0 / 2x USB-A / USB-C (power adapter) / HDMI / DisplayPort / Ethernet (dock not included)</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless connectivity</td><td>Wi-Fi 6 / Bluetooth / NFC</td><td>Wi-Fi 6E / Bluetooth 5.3</td><td>Dual-band Wi-Fi / Bluetooth 5</td></tr><tr><td>Wired connectivity</td><td>Ethernet (docked mode)</td><td>Ethernet via optional dock</td><td>Ethernet via optional dock</td></tr><tr><td>Built-in mic?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Speakers</td><td>Stereo speakers</td><td>Stereo speakers</td><td>Stereo speakers</td></tr><tr><td>Battery capacity</td><td>5,220mAh lithium-ion</td><td>50Wh battery</td><td>40Wh battery</td></tr><tr><td>Battery life (est.)</td><td>2 to 6.5 hours</td><td>3 to 12 hours</td><td>2 to 8 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Charging time</td><td>About 3 hours 30 minutes</td><td>Not advertised</td><td>Not advertised</td></tr><tr><td>Game card slot</td><td>Switch 2 and Switch cartridges</td><td>N/A, uses microSD card (plus internal SSD)</td><td>N/A, uses microSD card (plus internal SSD)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight (grams)</td><td>399.16g (or 535.24g with Joy-Con 2 controllers attached)</td><td>640 grams</td><td>669 grams</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>4.5 x 10.7 x .55 inches</td><td>4.6 x 11.7 x 1.92 inches</td><td>4.6 x 11.7 x 1.92 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Starting price</td><td>$449.99</td><td>$549.99</td><td>$399.99</td></tr><tr><td>Available</td><td>June 5th, 2025</td><td>Now</td><td>Now</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Much like many of you, I suspect, I too would love a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored-2">Dishonored</a> 3, but I'm not entirely confident it will ever happen. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">Arkane Austin was obviously shut down last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkanes-deathloop-team-are-making-a-marvel-blade-game">Arkane Lyon are making a Blade game</a>, which leaves little room for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> sequel. But is there any possibility of one happening all the same? Well, still no, probably, but Arkane Studios founder and Dishonored co-creator Raphaël Colantonio did recently say that he could at the very least see himself working on a follow-up.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
While on an episode of the Quad Damage Podcast (thanks for the heads-up, co-host Robert Yapp), Colantonio was asked if he'd have any interested in bringing back working on Humanhead Studio’s version of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2">Prey 2</a>. The developer expressed disinterest in working on someone else's games (don't forget Arkane's Prey just uses the name), but he did say this about a potential Dishonored 3: "I'd love to - I mean, we're talking totally hypothetically at this point - I could see myself working on Dishonored 3 right now because it's been so long that, you know, why not?"

<p>
Like all glimmers of hope, there was a caveat, as he noted "after Dishonored 1, the last thing I wanted to do for the next four years of my life was Dishonored 2. In general I like to create new stuff." 
</p>
<p>
None of this exactly screams Dishonored 3, but Colantonio did also say that both he, fellow Dishonored creator Harvey Smith, and current Arkane head and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a> director Dinga Bakaba all have their own documents about their own ideas for a sequel. "I don't think it would make sense to talk about it," Colantonio continued. "Which of those three versions will ever see the day, now we're talking about science fiction at this point. So many of the people [that worked on the series] are scattered around, and Harvey is not at Arkane any more. I'm not at Arkane, and Dinga is working on Blade."
</p>
<p>
So, there you have it. All the people formerly in charge of and currently in charge of Arkane all have ways they could take Dishonored 3, except none of them really have the ability to do it at this point in time. It's a shame Arkane likely won't be working on an original game any time soon, even if Blade looks cool, but I'll still keep my fingers crossed that something fresh - or even a Dishonored sequel - makes its way out eventually.

Included in the 15-minute upload were details about how Season 2 will introduce its new Vanguard, Emma Frost, at launch April 11, as well as Ultron, whose class will be revealed closer to his mid-season launch. Both promise to keep Marvel Rivals fans on their toes with new abilities, but the real changes to how playable heroes will impact matches truly begin in Season 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Marvel Rivals Season 3, which is currently without a release date, NetEase will shift season lengths from being three months long to just two months. It means major content updates will progress rapidly without changing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-promises-a-new-hero-every-month-and-a-half">the team’s initial promise to drop at least one new hero every half-season</a>. So, while you’ll have to wait a month and a half to play as Ultron after Emma Frost launches next week, that wait will be cut down significantly after the hero after that drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since the launch of Season 1, we’ve been deeply contemplating how Marvel Rivals can continuously deliver fun and engaging experience for you all,” Marvel Rivals creative director Guangyun Chen explained in the Dev Vision video. “During this time, several discussions on social media have certainly added some pressure on us to keep the game as exciting as it has been since December. To a certain extent, we agree.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With our goal of keeping the audience’s excitement alive just like our opening months, the real adventure with Marvel Rivals is just beginning.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Chen went on to explain that NetEase wants Marvel Rivals “to fulfill everyone’s fantasies about Marvel Super Heroes,” and that means exploring new modes and flooding the scene with a dense roster of varied characters. Following what he called “extensive internal discussions and thorough evaluations,” NetEase will adjust its systems to account for the increased flow of content. More information on how this will affect players will be revealed before the launch of Season 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With our goal of keeping the audience’s excitement alive just like our opening months, the real adventure with Marvel Rivals is just beginning,” Chen added.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-2-ushers-in-the-age-of-ultron-with-hellfire-gala-theme-and-emma-frost"><u>pulled back the curtain on Marvel Rivals Season 2</u></a> just hours ago, revealing that it will soon swap out its vampire takeover theme in favor of a new storyline that focuses on the Hellfire Gala. That means new fancy outfits, maps, and characters are on the way, with more information primed to be revealed in the coming weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals was a smash hit when it launched in December, securing 10 million players in three days. NetEase’s free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. On Steam the launch was particularly huge, with 480,990 concurrent players. January's Season 1 then drew an incredible 644,269 concurrent players, making Marvel Rivals the 15th most-played game ever on Valve's platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But those concurrents have been on a downward slide ever since, which may have sparked the drastic roadmap change from NetEase. Still, Marvel Rivals remains hugely popular, and is one of Steam's most-played games. The launch of Season 2 will no-doubt prove a shot in the arm, and again with Season 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Marvel Rivals, be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-update-20250327-patch-notes-reveal-new-galactas-quest-easter-egg-and-hero-fixes-coming-this-week"><u>the patch notes for update version 20250327</u></a> as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/there-was-once-an-idea-for-a-marvel-gaming-universe-that-would-tie-all-the-video-games-together-like-the-mcu-but-it-didnt-get-funded"><u>why Disney decided to scrap an idea for a Marvel Gaming Universe</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-all-changes-and-updates-coming-next-season/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals Season 2 is set to launch on April 11th, bringing a plethora of new changes to the wildly popular multiplayer title. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-promises-a-new-hero-each-month-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seasons will be shortened down from three months to two months starting with Season 3</a>, but there will still be plenty of new content to explore over the next few months.</p>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown of the changes coming to Marvel Rivals in Season 2, including the new heroes, new features, and gameplay changes.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-heroes-emma-frost-and-ultron">New Heroes: Emma Frost and Ultron</h2>



<p>When Season 2 launches, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-confirms-emma-frost-and-ultron/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emma Frost will join the roster of heroes</a> in the Vanguard role. Emma Frost will be able to “adeptly utilize her telepathic and diamond abilities” while “standing at the fore front to shield her allies and obliterate her foes.”</p>



<p>Ultron will join a month and a half after the launch of Season 2, during the Season 2.5 update. Details about Ultron have not been released yet, but he will most likely join the roster as either a Vanguard or Duelist.</p>



<h2 id="h-costume-colors-and-costume-sharing">Costume Colors and Costume Sharing</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>New color options for some of the “more popular costumes” are being added in Season 2. Psylocke’s Vengeance costume and Luna Snow’s Mirae 2099 costume are just two examples of costumes that will have new color options. </p>



<p>A new feature that allows players to gift costumes and bundles to their friends is also going live with Season 2. When at the checkout screen for a costume bundle, players can select the “Gift” option instead of buying it for themselves. It appears that players will be limited to sending only five gifts a day.</p>



<h2 id="h-team-up-ability-and-hero-balance-changes">Team-Up Ability and Hero Balance Changes</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>For the first time since the game’s release, Team-Up Abilities are being either altered or removed. Since Marvel Rivals launched, Team-Up Abilities have only been added to compliment new hero arrivals. Here are the changes coming to Team-Up Abilities in Season 2:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>New</strong>: Emma Frost can team up with Psylocke and/or Magneto to form Mental Projection. Emma creates illusory clones of Psylocke and Magneto.</li>



<li><strong>New:</strong> Doctor Strange can share his arcane magic with Scarlet Witch to form Arcane Order, which transforms her right-click into a rapid-fire, long-range projectile that doesn’t consume energy.</li>



<li><strong>New: </strong>Captain America and Winter Soldier (finally) can team up with Stars Aligned. Winter Soldier can pounce forward and deal a shockwave pulse. He and Captain can pounce together to cause more damage and debuff nearby enemies.</li>



<li>Metallic Chaos (Scarlet Witch and Magneto) has been removed.</li>



<li>Voltaic Union (Storm, Captain America, and Thor) has been removed.</li>



<li>Psylocke has been removed from Dimensional Shortcut (Black Panther and Magik).</li>



<li>Winter Soldier has been removed from Ammo Overload (The Punisher and Rocket Raccoon).</li>



<li>Namor has been removed from Chilling Charisma (Luna Snow and Jeff).</li>



<li>Doctor Strange has been replaced with Namor in Gamma Charge (Iron Man and Hulk).</li>
</ul>



<p>Without giving specific details yet, the Marvel Rivals team also provided some information on who’s getting buffed or nerf in the next balance update. Here are the changes players can expect to hero balance in Season 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Peni Parker, Scarlet Witch, Mister Fantastic, Black Widow, Rocket Raccoon, Jeff the Land Shark, Captain America, Winter Soldier, Moon Knight will receive buffs, either via increases to their power or through Team-Up Abilities.</li>



<li>Doctor Strange will get a nerf to his offensive power, but a buff to his survivability (health).</li>



<li>Loki and Adam Warlock are getting nerfs to their area-of-effect healing abilities.</li>
</ul>



<p>A deeper dive in the balance changes coming to Season 2 will be coming soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-changes-to-missions-competitive">Changes to Missions, Competitive</h2>



<p>Starting in Season 2, Marvel Rivals will implement weekly missions alongside the existing daily missions and challenges. Players won’t be able to earn more Chrono Tokens, instead those will be rebalanced across all three mission types. </p>



<p>On the Competitive side, some players might be disappointed to learn that ranked players will drop nine divisions at the start of Season 2. For example, a player that ends Season 1.5 at Diamond 1 will start Season 2 at Silver 1. The new map, Hellfire Gala: Krakoa, will enter the competitive pool, while Yggsgard: Royal Palace and Tokyo 2099: Shin-Shibuya will be “retired” from competitive play. </p>



<p>The minimum level requirement for competitive play is being increased from level 10 to level 15. The hero pick and ban system will also be implemented starting at Gold 3. Only duo queueing will be allowed when a team includes players that are Eternity or One Above All. And finally, the rank rating players receive will now be more weighed by individual performance.</p>



<p>The full Dev Vision video can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thyG51IdChc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, and full patch notes will release closer to the April 11th launch date for Season 2 of Marvel Rivals.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">Switch 2 reveal</a>, neither Nintendo nor Nvidia has gone into any detail at all about the exact chip inside the upcoming handheld—technically, we are still not sure what Arm CPU architecture or what GPU architecture it uses, how much RAM we can expect it to have, how fast that memory will be, or exactly how many graphics cores we're looking at.</p>
<p>But interviews with Nintendo executives and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nintendo-switch-2-leveled-up-with-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-and-4k-gaming/">a blog post from Nvidia</a> did at least confirm several of the new chip's capabilities. The "custom Nvidia processor" has a GPU "with dedicated [Ray-Tracing] Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements," writes Nvidia Software Engineering VP Muni Anda.</p>
<p>This means that, as rumored, the Switch 2 will support Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) upscaling technology, which helps to upscale a lower-resolution image into a higher-resolution image with less of a performance impact than native rendering and less loss of quality than traditional upscaling methods. For the Switch games that can render at 4K or at 120 FPS 1080p, DLSS will likely be responsible for making it possible.</p>
<p>The other major Nvidia technology supported by the new Switch is G-Sync, which prevents screen tearing when games are running at variable frame rates. Nvidia notes that G-Sync is only supported in handheld mode and not in docked mode, which could be a limitation of the Switch dock's HDMI port.</p>
