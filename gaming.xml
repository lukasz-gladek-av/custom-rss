              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-retro-trailer-judgement-day-snes-1851766852"><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em></a> is an upcoming video game adaptation of the original ’90s action movie sequel that is designed to look, sound, and play like classic 2D games from that era. <em>No Fate</em> looks really awesome. But sadly, due to ongoing tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump, this cool-looking <em>Terminator</em> game has been delayed (again) from October to November.</p> <p>On September 28, <em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> publisher Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau announced that the upcoming side-scrolling action game was being delayed a second time until November 26. <a href="https://www.reef-entertainment.com/post/terminator-2d-no-fate-release-date-moved-to-november-26-2025">In a statement posted to the publisher’s official website</a>, the company blamed the delay on “ongoing global trade and tariff changes” that caused shipping issues with components needed to produce the Day One and Collector’s Editions versions of the game. And because the studio and publisher want to ship the game to all platforms and users at the same time, <em>No Fate’s</em> release date was pushed back. This delay affects digital and physical copies worldwide.</p>  <p>“We truly appreciate your patience and understanding, and we’re sorry for this further delay,” said Reef Entertainment. “The team is working hard to make sure your wait is worth it, and we can’t wait to share <em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> with you all this November.”</p> <p>This isn’t the first delay for<em> Terminator 2D: No Fate.</em> In July, the 2D action platformer based on James Cameron’s iconic action flick starring Arnold Schwarzenegger was delayed from its initial release date of<a href="https://www.reef-entertainment.com/post/terminator-2d-no-fate-release-date-moved-to-october-31-2025"> September 5 to October 31, just in time for Halloween</a>. But that’s not happening anymore, and you can directly blame Trump, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-tariff-price-trump-nintendo-1851775491">who continues to screw around with tariffs haphazardl</a>y, causing global chaos for those trying to buy, ship, or import products or resources to the United States.</p>

<p>There's the beta of the n-game AI-powered assistant, Gaming Copilot, expanding to Game Bar on Windows PC and hitting the Xbox mobile app next month. You've got a revamped Xbox PC app, which simplifies finding your apps, games, and history into a couple of easier-to-navigate menus. And then PC gamers get three specific updates: a visually cleaner Social widgets experience, a Network Quality Indicator tool designed to help you understand and troubleshoot your connection, and a feature to make game saves sync easier across devices.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox's major new update this month is Offer Wallet, a "unified wallet solution" that simplifies how you access and claim Xbox offers. This is in addition to a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591" data-mce-href="/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> dynamic background, as the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/">multiplayer beta starts on October 2</a>.</p><p>Gaming Copilot is a rather controversial addition to the Xbox ecosystem. Revealed earlier this year and designed to provide help, recommendations, and other in-game support, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-copilot-to-help-xbox-players-beat-games-in-real-time/1100-6530113/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-copilot-to-help-xbox-players-beat-games-in-real-time/1100-6530113/">Gaming Copilot is a Steam-like overlay</a> that puts the essentially AI assistant right in your face. There’s also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-launches-beta-for-ai-chatbot-that-reads-your-xbox-profile/1100-6531875/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-launches-beta-for-ai-chatbot-that-reads-your-xbox-profile/1100-6531875/">a linked AI chatbot</a> that can read your Xbox profile, which lets you get answers to questions around enemy encounters, gamer score inquiries, rare Achievements, and more.</p><p>In other Microsoft news, the company announced on September 19 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">Xbox consoles will get another price increase in the US</a> on October 3. The cheapest Xbox Series model, the 512GB Xbox Series S, will cost $400.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Finnish developer Mainframe Industries and publisher New Tales announced that Pax Dei, the studio's social sandbox MMORPG, will launch version 1.0 on October 16. The game has been on Steam Early Access since June 18, 2024, which is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/pax-dei-early-access-qa-mainframe-talks-improvements-from-the-wilderness-alpha-monetization-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last time we spoke to the development team</a> (we previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mainframe-ex-ccp-remedy-ceo-the-industry-is-headed-towards-cloud-native-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed Thor Gunnarsson in 2020</a>, when the game still hadn't been fully unveiled).</p>



<p>Over this year and a half of early access development, the game received several updates, but the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1995520/Pax_Dei/">Steam user reviews</a> remain at a meager 54% score (Mixed), while recent reviews are even worse with a 38% score. Anyway, Founders will have access to the game starting on October 14, and they also get a free copy of the game to gift to a friend. Everyone will begin on new shards (servers) with new characters upon release, so any progress made during early access will be reset.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Pax Dei is available for $29.99 on the official website, Steam, and Epic Games Store, and can be played via GeForce NOW. Starting on October 16, it will be included with the PC Game Pass subscription. The base game comes with two character slots and one month of Premium Membership, which offers +50% Grace on Daily login and Gold Offerings, +50% XP boost, and the exclusive ability to build your own home in the game. Outside of that bundled month, the Premium Membership costs $6.99 a month if you want at least one plot.</p>



<p>Mainframe Industries is already planning other post-launch updates. Verse 5, due this Winter, will introduce Feudal Shrines, which are control points that Clans will fight over. Then, Verse 6 will implement Feudal Alliances, allowing clans to join forces in war and peace. In 2026, the developer plans to further expand other systems, beginning with Grace and the game's economy. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-removes-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-removes-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite-after-the-show%E2%80%99s-recent-twist.1311793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Beyond his appearance in <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/mortal-kombat-1-guide-peacemaker-fatalities-strategy/">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, Peacemaker has made another videogame appearance by joining the ever-expanding world of Fortnite earlier this month. It was a collaboration with the Peacemaker TV series, currently airing, that's written and directed by DC co-boss James Gunn. However, one of the dance emotes that came with the bundle of Peacemaker-based items has been removed following the release of the series's most recent episode, which unveiled a darker truth to what was sold as an emote dance to kids.</p>



<p><em><strong>Spoiler alert for Peacemaker season two episode six</strong></em></p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-pulls-controversial-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite-following-big-twist-in-the-tv-shows-latest-episode">Eurogamer</a>, the 'Peaceful Hips' emote was <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447">removed from the game while Epic investigated</a> "<em>into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote</em>." Refunds were issued to players who purchased the emote preemptively, assuming that the emote would not be added back into the game. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're disabling the Peaceful Hips Emote in Fortnite as we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote. Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks.</p>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The dance, which you can see in the video below, can seem innocent enough out of context. But the context is what counts, and in context, it's clear why the emote was quickly removed.</p>



<p>That context is that in episode six of Peacemaker's second season, the title character discovers he's in an alternate Nazi-run universe, with the dance, specifically how he moves his arms, imitating a swastika. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Peacemaker’s dance emote from Fortnite has been disabled.</p><p>“As we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote.

<p>It seems that James Gunn held back the true meaning of the dance from Epic, and once the truth was revealed during the episode, Epic moved quickly to remove the emote from the game. Gunn even promoted the arrival of Peacemaker in Fortnite in a post on <a href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1967015798939283554">X (formerly Twitter)</a> that, in hindsight, carried more weight than we could've known at the time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Who knows why the dance's meaning wasn't shared before its release in Fortnite. Busy as he is, surely Gunn would have seen updates from Epic as they were creating and animating the dance that would be in the game and available to millions of players, many of them children. It's unclear who at Warner Bros. was aware of this and if anyone at Epic knew what the dance would symbolize. </p>



<p>Gunn must have been aware, to some degree, that Epic would do something about the emote once episode six aired. It could be that this was all meant to be just a publicity stunt, though it'll be curious to see what further implications this stunt has on any future collaborations between Epic and Warner Bros, and if Epic adjusts how it approaches future collaborations with other partners.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New details have been revealed on a new D&amp;D Beyond digital supplement. The Fey-themed <em>Lorwyn: First Light</em>, will bring new player options and adventures to Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024. In addition, it officially brings yet another Magic: The Gathering setting into the fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The Lorwyn: First Light Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2069-add-a-delightful-twist-to-forgotten-realms" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast revealed what players can expect from the <em>Lorwyn: First Light</em> digital supplement. It will contain new Fey-inspired player options and monsters alongside a new Fey Domain of Delight: Lorwyn Shadowmoor.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-first-light-shadowmoor-wilt-leaf-liege-artwork.jpg?itok=Pdpk03_D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorwyn-first-light-shadowmoor-wilt-leaf-liege-artwork.jpg?itok=7Z9LsDkc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those familiar with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>, that name may not be that new. Shadowmoor was introduced to the ubiquitous card game in 2008. It introduced creatures of fables and fairytales living together in a domain of perpetual midsummer. Now, much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-and-magic-gathering-worlds-collide-in-mythic-odysseys-of-theros" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Theros</a>, Ravnica, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/strixhaven-arrives-in-dungeons-and-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Strixhaven</a> before it, this land is now represented in the world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Lorwyn: First Light</em> supplement will contain the following:</p>

<ul><li>2 Backgrounds</li>
	<li>2 Feats</li>
	<li>2 Magic Items</li>
	<li>8 Monsters</li>
	<li>2 New Player Species and Advice on Playing 8 Player Species in the Lorwyn Shadowmoor setting</li>
	<li>2 Adventure Examples and a Map for Both</li>
</ul><p>The official post states that Lorwyn: First Light will be available as part of the Forgotten Realms Ultimate Bundle. This bundle includes physical and digital versions of the upcoming Forgotten Realms supplements alongside two other digital supplements: <em>Astarion's Book of Hungers</em> player supplement and the prewritten adventure <em>Netheril's Fall</em>.</p>

<p>While the bundle contains a lot of material for the latest edition of D&amp;D, it does sit at a considerable MSRP of $159.99. However, in the original announcement for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-details-emerge-on-new-dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-supplements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Forgotten Realms bundle</a>, Wizards of the Coast did confirm the digital supplements would be available as standalone purchases at an MSRP of $14.99. A less daunting price point if you just want the fey-themed material for your table.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-fire-max-11-tablet-hits-lowest-price-yet-ahead-of-prime-big-deal-days-hundreds-cheaper-than-an-ipad-2000627185</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-fire-max-11-tablet-hits-lowest-price-yet-ahead-of-prime-big-deal-days-hundreds-cheaper-than-an-ipad.1311784/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’d be telling you that this limited-time deal on the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet is hot, or that it’s fire, or that it’s a scorcher, but honestly, would you still respect us in the morning? So we’ll dispense with the terrible puns and cut straight to the deal, because it’s one of the better ones we’ve seen in a while on this great, affordable tablet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4376/">It’s 32% off for a limited time, turning a very good $280 price into a great one at just $190.</a></p>
<p>To put things in perspective, the Amazon Fire Max 11 is an 11-inch tablet with an octa-core processor, 14-hour battery life, expandable storage of up to 1TB via microSD card, and 2.4 million pixel resolution. As an Amazon product it blends seamlessly with the rest of the Amazon ecosystem, including Prime Video, Kindle, Audible, and Luna, along with your smart home devices via either Alexa or the Device Dashboard. And here’s the kicker — at this sale price it’s over $700 less than the 11-inch M4 iPad Pro, and $375 less than the 11-inch M3 iPad Air.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4376/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Features, Not Price</h2>
<p>There are probably metrics and benchmark tests that put those pricier iPads ahead of the Fire Max 11, but not nearly enough to quantify the price difference. The octa-core processor at the heard of the Fire Max 11 is certainly no slouch when it comes to streaming, multitasking, and gaming on Luna. The 128GB of storage is small, but so easily and inexpensively expandable thanks to the microSD card slot that the Apple tablets lack.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 speeds, a robust 14-hour battery life, 8MP camera, and options to expand into a more laptop-like experience with the sold-separately Fire Max 11 Keyboard Case — which also happens to be&nbsp;<em>way</em> more affordable than Apple’s Magic Keyboard — all make the Fire Max 11 highly competitive even before you do a price comparison. Once you check out those numbers, this isn’t even a fair contest.</p>



<h2>Beautifully Basic</h2>
<p>When you look at the Fire Max 11 — and this is the latest, most updated iteration of the Fire Max — in the context of being a fully integrated part of the massive Amazon ecosystem, it’s a brilliant tablet, especially for just $190. It’s not going to compete with a laptop as a productivity machine, although this deal does come with a free 3-month Microsoft 365 trial, but as an e-reader, streaming device, smart-home control panel, and light gaming device, it’s an exceptional tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-octa-core-processor-lockscreen/dp/B0B2SFTGQ6?tag=kotaku01-20">This model of the Amazon Fire Max currently on sale for just $190</a> has the max 128GB storage and also comes with lockscreen ads deactivated. The $90 savings on this deal are great, and even greater when you tack them onto the hundreds you save by avoiding the super-bougie competitor tablets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You would think that The Pokémon Company and GameStop would know that turning something that could easily have been distributed digitally into a physical item, only obtainable in stores, would attract the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>Mandibuzz-like vultures who circle the franchise</span></a><span> looking for a way to scalp its merch to make a quick buck. That’s exactly what’s happened with a partnership to give out free codes for rare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>Shiny Pokémon</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i></a><span>, as scalpers have found a way to ruin something else for everyone.</span></p> <p><span>Here’s what was supposed to happen: from September 26 to October 15, fans who visit GameStops or EB Games locations would be able to get a code to receive either a Shiny Koraidon or Miraidon, the legendary Pokémon that grace </span><i><span>Scarlet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>‘s covers. These alternate-colored variants have never been available before, so if you’re the kind of collector who wants every Shiny, this is a pretty big deal. No purchase was required to get one of these codes; all you had to do was show up at participating locations. However, many fans are reporting that their local stores are running out of codes weeks before the promotion ends next month, and some locations say they won’t be getting more. Some customers report that stores still have codes but have been </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonScarletViolet/comments/1nqg2ay/local_gamestop_shiny_koraidon_and_miraidon/"><span>giving them out only as a promotional item</span></a><span> alongside other purchases, despite the official word on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s website </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/get-shiny-koraidon-or-shiny-miraidon-at-gamestop-and-eb-games"><span>saying no purchase is necessary</span></a><span>.</span></p>   <p><span>Sometimes these events are digital, meaning that you could download an event Pokémon in a store or through the game itself and go on your merry way. But when they involve a physical card with a code on it, supplies actually </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> limited, and when something is limited, a scalper is waiting just around the corner to swoop in. This also happened the same day as a new </span><i><span>Trading Card Game</span></i><span> set drop, so these people smelled blood in the water, and not only got the codes, but have started listing them for sale on places like </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=shiny+koraidon+and+miraidon&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1311"><span>eBay</span></a><span>. Some of the prices are fairly cheap at less than $10, while other sellers are getting bold and asking for much more. Even if the price is cheap, these codes are supposed to be free, so even a dollar is a profit for scalpers.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>As some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFl1XUEqcls">commentators have pointed out</a>, <em>Pokémon </em></span><span>loves brand synergy, which is why every facet of its business releases new products around the same time. The games come out, new TCG sets come out alongside it, and more plushes of new critters show up on the Pokémon Center website, so it makes sense that it would offer these rare Pokémon on the same day people are showing up to game shops to buy the new TCG sets. That said, adding scarcity to a digital good just emboldens some of the worst people to keep taking advantage of other fans. Hopefully, these stores get more codes between now and when the promotion ends in October, because only sending enough for one weekend sounds like poor planning on everyone’s part.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-battlefield-6-trailer-is-a-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty.1311775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new live-action trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-have-a-button-that-blows-up-everything-in-a-map-and-its-fun-to-press-it-2000626898">Electronic Arts’ upcoming<em> Battlefield 6</em> </a>features a group of celebrities, including Zac Efron, getting swiftly blown up by a missile in what seems to be a dig at <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s many commercials featuring actors, musicians, and other famous people. It’s the latest example of the two military shooter franchises reacting to one another in a way we’ve not seen in years.</p> <p>On September 28, EA released the “<em>Battlefield 6</em>: Official Launch Live-Action Trailer.” And like many live-action<em> Call of Duty</em> ads from the last decade, the <em>BF6</em> commercial starts off with a group of celebs cosplaying as soldiers and getting ready to fight. But just 24 seconds into the new trailer, a missile flies into frame and blows up all four stars in a large, fiery explosion. A group of soldiers then walks through the area, with one asking, “Who was that?” and the other bluntly replying that it “doesn’t matter” before telling everyone to move out.</p>  <p>While the new ad doesn’t directly mention <em>Call of Duty</em>, it’s obvious what EA is doing here. For many, many years, <em>Call of Duty</em> games have used celebrities like Will Arnett, Jonah Hill, Michael B. Jordan, Cara Delevingne, and many others in various live-action trailers. <a href="https://youtu.be/yXzMOUCYGBs">As recently as 2021,<em> Call of Duty</em> featured numerous celebs in a <em>Warzone</em> ad</a> that was heavily criticized by fans for going too far and feeling too silly. This new <em>BF6</em> trailer feels like a direct nod to those <a href="https://youtu.be/IhPyNuqewZU">celeb-heavy launch ads</a> and a commitment from EA that it won’t follow in <em>CoD’s</em> footsteps, a move that fans in the comments of the trailer seem to greatly appreciate.</p>

 <p>Over the years<a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">, longtime <em>CoD</em> players have lamented</a> the franchise’s shift away from grounded combat and realism as bizarre crossover skins and over-the-top future tech have become more prevalent in recent entries. This has all come to a head in 2025 as <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a>, which had a massively popular open beta earlier this year, has gone the opposite direction and doubled down on being a gritty, grounded, and realistic military shooter. Activision has responded by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-changes-black-ops-7-pre-order-operator-skins/">making changes to skins</a>, rolling back plans to let all <em>Black Ops 6</em> skins move forward into <em>Black Ops 7,</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-blops7-skins-goofy-crossover-turned-down-deals-bf6-grounded-2000628200">even letting devs talk publicly about the series turning down some collaboration cosmetic deals</a>.</p>

 <p>It’s very, very unlikely that <em>Battlefield 6</em> will outsell <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> this year. But it seems like EA’s FPS might take a bigger bite out of the rival shooter series than it has in previous years, and Activision is definitely paying attention. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">The news that EA is being bought up by Saudi Arabia’s PIF</a> as well as other investors, including Jared Kushner’s investment firm, has certainly added <a href="https://kotaku.com/electronic-arts-acquisition-saudi-arabia-jared-kushner-2000629849">an awkwardness to <em>BF6</em>‘s rollout</a>, though.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> will launch on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. EA won’t talk about a Switch 2 port. <em>Black Ops 7</em> launches on consoles and PC in November. <a href="https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023">It also isn’t going to be available on Switch 2.</a></p>

<p>Epic Games has disabled a <em>Fortnite</em> emote based on the HBO show <em>Peacemaker</em> after the latest episode cast the dancing animation in a potentially different light.</p>
<p><em>The remainder of this post contains spoilers for Season 2 of Peacemaker.</em></p>
<p>The "Peaceful Hips" emote, which was first introduced to the game on September 15, mirrors the dance motions that John Cena's character Christopher Smith makes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS11-GIemXY">during the opening credits sequence</a> for the show's second season. In the dance and the emote (which can be applied to any character in-game), the dancer briefly flails their arms at opposing right angles before shaking their hips seductively.</p>
<p>Some are seeing the dance in a different light after the sixth episode of the show's second season, "Ignorance is Chris," which revealed that the alternate universe featured throughout the season has been controlled by swastika-brandishing Nazis. With that knowledge front of mind, the arm movements in the dance emote could be seen as a winking reference to the arms of a swastika.</p>
<p>"[In] season 2 there's a lot more of the story of the season in the intro, [in] the first season there wasn't as much of a reference to the story," choreographer Charissa Barton <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdtN4MTYXQM">said in a video interview</a> posted by Warner Bros. last month.</p>

<h2>The arm motions mean <em>what</em>?</h2>
<p>Fans have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PeacemakerShow/comments/1npn95v/90_probability_its_a_nazi_dimension_but_heres/">picking up on hints</a> of the show's eventual Nazi-related reveal (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PeacemakerShow/comments/1nm9772/hidden_nazi_hints_in_the_opening_dance_sequence/">including from that opening dance</a>) as the second season has aired over recent weeks. But the confirmation of the link in Sunday's episode had Epic quickly re-evaluating the emote by Sunday night.</p>

<p>Originally scheduled for the end of October, the company confirmed that the delay is due to "trade and tariff changes" affecting the Day One and Collector's Editions. Not content to force physical enthusiasts to wait longer, all editions of the game have subsequently been pushed back.</p>
<p>Here's the full announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We wanted to share an important update on the release of <em>Terminator 2D: NO FATE</em>. The game will now launch on November 26, 2025.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"This adjustment is due to ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector’s Editions. Because we are committed to launching all editions together, this new date applies to both physical and digital releases worldwide.</p>
<p>"We truly appreciate your patience and understanding, and we’re sorry for this further delay. The team is working hard to make sure your wait is worth it, and we can’t wait to share</p>
<p>"<em>Terminator 2D: NO FATE</em> with you all this November."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming game will be an adaptation of the classic 1991 action movie <strong>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</strong> from director James Cameron. It takes inspiration from old-school Sega Mega Drive action games and will feature several playable characters and iconic scenes from the movie.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost of Yōtei developer Sucker Punch Productions is getting ready to launch the game later this week on PlayStation 5. As part of the marketing promotion, they joined a media roundtable where the series' setting was discussed, among other things. <a href="https://www.ungeek.ph/2025/09/sucker-punch-studio-head-on-the-ghost-of-yotei-series-identity-we-cant-imagine-a-ghost-game-in-feudal-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As reported by Filipino website Ungeek</a>, Sucker Punch studio head and founder Brian Fleming revealed that the setting will never really change to somewhere outside Japan:</p>



<p><em>We believe the core of Ghost is someone wielding a katana, that’s part of the essence. We can’t imagine a Ghost game set in, say, feudal Europe. That doesn’t make sense. There are plenty of games set there, but that’s not what a Ghost game is.</em> <em>For us, the natural beauty of Japan is part of the essence of a Ghost game. I gave this answer on stage at Tokyo Game Show, and I think the fans in Japan, really appreciated that. That’s the way we see it. It will always have that core, open-world katana adventure of some kind. Now, we may change time periods, we may explore different settings, but I think there are some boundaries we probably won’t cross.</em></p>



<p>If the core of the games is a character wielding a katana, then it also follows that the series is essentially bound to the samurai era, which started in the late 12th century and ended in the late 1870s, when the Meiji government basically abolished the samurai. Ghost of Tsushima already explored the late 13th century (it's set in 1274, the same year of the real-life Mongol invasion), while Ghost of Yōtei jumped quite far ahead, taking place in 1603. Of course, the Seattle-based developer could absolutely set a new game elsewhere in Japan even before 1603, as the series has been set up more as an anthology than a storyline that continues from installment to installment. Furthermore, both games have been set far away from central Japan, so that's another option that a future entry will undoubtedly explore.</p>



<p>Still, given those constraints, it's hard to imagine the franchise ever reaching as many entries as, say, Final Fantasy, or even just The Elder Scrolls. It's all the more reason to savor the games we get, though, and Ghost of Yōtei is certainly well worth playing if you're a fan of open world action/adventure games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can find my review here</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em></p>

            <p>Your cuddly dinosaur aunties at Capcom have warned that they can't "guarantee" various Monster Hunter games will run on Windows 10 PCs after uncle Microsoft end support for the operating system on October 14th this year.
</p>
<p>When that fateful day comes to pass, Capcom "will no longer guarantee that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will run on Windows 10 systems." Which isn't to say that these games will immediately become unplayable, but "future system updates or game title updates may make the game incompatible on Windows 10 systems".
</p><!--more-->
<p>The developers add that if you have trouble with those Monster Hunter games on Windows 10 PCs after October 14th, "support can only be provided based on information from before support for Windows 10 was discontinued", as they'll be discontinuing services for investigating problems when playing on Windows 10.
</p>
<p>If this is the first you've heard of Windows 10 being sunsetted/given the old heave-ho/left crying by the roadside, Microsoft have said that Windows 10 apps and drivers will continue to boot and run normally after the cessation of official support, but you won't get any more free security updates, bug fixes and big feature updates. 
</p>
<p>It's not quite as cut-and-dried as that in practice. Microsoft 365 apps running on personal and commercial Windows 10 PCs <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/24/stay-secure-with-windows-11-copilot-pcs-and-windows-365-before-support-ends-for-windows-10/">will get security updates until October 10th 2028</a>, and feature updates until August 2026.
</p>
<p>Microsoft are also offering a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates">paid extended security update subscription</a> for people who want to maintain Windows 10 beyond the cut-off date, with availability dependent on region and which version of the OS you're running. In good news for people resident in the European Economic Area, Microsoft have <a href="https://www.euroconsumers.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Euroconsumers_vs_Microsoft_092025.pdf">bowed to pressure from consumer protection organisation Euroconsumers</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/operating-systems/turns-out-microsoft-will-offer-windows-10-security-updates-for-free-until-2026-but-not-in-the-us-or-uk/">Particle Collider Gamer</a>) by making ESU updates free in the EEA until October 2026.</p><p>Windows10mageddon threatens to leave a lot of PC users in the lurch, though there's a certain amount of Y2K-style hysteria about the fallout. According to <a href="https://www.controlup.com/windows-11-readiness/">one study</a>, around half of Windows PCs still don't run Windows 11. If your machine doesn't have the specs for Windows 11, it seems like you'll need to buy a fresh one. I expect there will be plenty more bulletins from game publishers encouraging players to update their systems.</p>
<p><em>This article has been updated to mention Microsoft's recent decision to make ESU updates free to people in the EEA until October 2026.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest YouTube video stunt by one <a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-lawsuit-beast-games-amazon-hidden-cameras-1851775284">James “MrBeast” Donaldson</a> has already wracked up over 46 million views in just one day and it’s not hard to imagine why. Titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo7i8VTpfNM&amp;t=28s">Would You Risk Dying For $500,000?</a>” it shows a series of challenges in which people brave flame-engulfed obstacles in exchange for money. It’s kind of like David Blaine if, instead of doing absurd and wild stuff himself, he paid other people to do it while also explaining how it was all incredibly fake and just for grim lulz.</p> <p>The infernal trap that’s been drawing the most attention is one in which a stuntman is tied to a chair inside a “burning house” and has to escape and save as much money as he can from inside the house in order to earn the highest cash prize possible. Donaldson bounces back and forth between urgent warnings about how real the flames are and mugging the camera with jokes about MrBeast product placement. The entertainment concept is more grotesquely mundane than anything Phillip K. Dick could have imagined and also, clearly, highly entertaining to millions of people.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This blew up, if you’re curious obviously we had ventilation for the smoke and a kill switch to cut off the fires. We had professionals test this extensively and the guy in the video as stated is a professional stunt man. I take safety more serious than you could ever imagine.</p> <p>— MrBeast (@MrBeast) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1972507399413260366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Donaldson defended his uniquely gifted intuition for creating the debased content people crave by promising the whole stunt was tested with professionals multiple times, responding to viral posts about the stunt with additional context. The last thing Donaldson needs after lawsuits last year over <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-internal-investigation-findings-sexual-misconduct-1235150941/">alleged safety violations on his Amazon Prime</a> show is people thinking he doesn’t take the premise of potentially roasting another human being alive for less than the median home price after taxes seriously.</p>

 <p>“We had professionals test this extensively and the guy in the video as stated is a professional stunt man,” he wrote on X over the weekend. “I take safety more serious than you could ever imagine.” He expanded on the setup in a comment on the YouTube video as well.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:on5oeywiqx32fh2zau473wz6/app.bsky.feed.post/3lzy22r723k2w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiglqdgk2xfrl3d2mts5fqecakrqwbllpidp6sbsybsdamtbhqirve"> <p lang="en">Content creators tend to think any spectacle is defensible if they can say health and safety concerns have been attended to behind the scenes, but that’s not really it imho. Mr. Beast’s whole thing is that his subjects’ desperation for cash allows him—a wealthier person—to indulge his sadism.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:on5oeywiqx32fh2zau473wz6?ref_src=embed">southpaw (@nycsouthpaw.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:on5oeywiqx32fh2zau473wz6/post/3lzy22r723k2w?ref_src=embed">2025-09-29T12:45:09.235Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>“In case there’s any concern about the safety of the stuntman contestant, I just wanted to mention that we take safety extremely seriously,” he added. “Every challenge was tested by multiple stuntmen, we have a full rescue team on standby with firefighters, EMTs and divers equipped with an ambulance and fire truck. We also had a pyro team controlling the fires and multiple fire suppression methods on every challenge to ensure we could essentially turn off the fire if there was ever an issue. But our stunt coordinator did an amazing job as always, and none of these systems were ever needed. Just wanted to be transparent with you all since I saw some concern!”</p> <p>This is the Catch-22 at the heart of this entire genre of extremely watchable algorithm-bait. Either the entire thing is so real and authentic that it’s an absolutely monstrous thing for everyone involved to be associated with and signals the utter depravity of modern capitalism, or the stunt is all so fake and performative that none of it matters and you’ve been conned out of 25 minutes of your week just so some guy can hock candy bars.</p> <p>Either way, it kinda sucks!</p>

<section><p>In a world filled with remakes, remasters, ports, and mods, the quest for a truly definitive version of a game is a lost cause--and yet, that's precisely what makes the medium so interesting.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Summer 2049. A ghoulish-looking man is huddled against a shelf in a derelict building. He's grasping a long, rusted pipe. An eerie voice asks him to accept a bargain: power in exchange for his soul.</p><p dir="ltr">"Take it," the voice says, "and save your daughter … "</p><p dir="ltr">You see the man talk to said daughter later, as she coughs repeatedly, and you can see the pain of a parent watching their child suffer. When he promises her that the monsters around them won't hurt her, you see a father trying his best to reassure his frightened daughter in the midst of genuine danger. When he growls at the enemies to stay away from her, there is an intensity in his voice--a perilous quality. As he begs for someone to help them while he holds her, you sense a specifically parental kind of fear and heartbreak.</p><p dir="ltr">Summer 2053. A small, baby-faced boy is huddled against a shelf in a derelict building. He's grasping a long, rusted pipe. An eerie voice asks him to accept a bargain: power in exchange for … something unsaid, in order to protect … someone unsaid. When the boy stands up to fight the monsters that tower over him, you don't feel the same dangerous edge as the father. You feel the vulnerability of a young person in over his head. When he tells the monsters to stay away from his sister, it's in a low, almost pleading voice. As he screams for help, there is desperation, but also the fear of someone far too young to deal with this situation.</p><p dir="ltr">The first of these scenes is from the 2010 English-language release of Nier, while the second is from the 2021 English release. The writer-director of Nier, Yoko Taro, made two versions of the game back in 2010: one where the protagonist is a boy trying to save his sister, and one where the protagonist is a father trying to save his daughter. The latter (which was called Nier Gestalt in Japan) was reportedly only made because the American marketing team of Square Enix thought the Western audience <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yoko-taro-didnt-mean-to-make-nier-sad-on-purpose/1100-6490892/">wouldn't respond as well</a> to the young boy as the main character. When Nier was finally re-released in a new form in 2021 (the cheekily named <em>Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139…</em>), Taro decided to go with the boy protagonist for the English language region this time. Now, the modern English version only gives us the younger protagonist.</p><p dir="ltr">When players discuss the game today, there doesn't tend to be a lot of consideration for this difference in versions. Yes, the main character is different, but the majority of the game is the same. It doesn't really matter that much, they claim.</p><p dir="ltr">Doesn't it?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576940-3822412-vlcsnap-2021-04-22-03h48m06s250.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576940" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576940-3822412-vlcsnap-2021-04-22-03h48m06s250.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576940"></a><figcaption>Festivities in the desert village of Facade in Nier Replicant.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576940-3822412-vlcsnap-2021-04-22-03h48m06s250.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">How can these two gaming experiences be the same? The emotional quality and perspective is markedly different and evokes different reactions. The critic Dia Lacina is one of those who perceptively <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nier-replicant-ver01/" rel="nofollow ">discussed this issue for Vice</a>, and, struck by that piece, I decided to watch the openings of both versions of the game and compare them. They certainly feel distinctly different to me.</p><p dir="ltr">There are plenty of other classic games being remade or remastered in recent years. Shadow of the Colossus, Silent Hill 2, Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid 3, Suikoden I and II, and Final Fantasy Tactics, just to point to a handful. I sometimes wonder if there is enough appreciation amongst players for just how different the new experiences can be to the originals, though, especially considering that the fame and historical significance of the games usually comes from those originals.</p><p dir="ltr">Film fans will contemplate the differences between Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings theatrical and extended editions, or the intriguing variations in Wong Kar-wai's cuts of The Grandmaster (the critic David Ehrlich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214255/http://www.film.com/movies/wong-kar-wai-the-grandmaster-ruined-by-american-cut" rel="nofollow ">went as far as to argue</a> that if you've only seen the American version of that film, you haven't really seen it). Readers will debate over the best translations of Dostoevsky or Hugo. Gamers, on the other hand, seem more likely to overlook changes in areas such as narrative and art direction, even in games that focus on storytelling.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's look at Final Fantasy VII. It's one of the most famous video games in history, so I wouldn't be surprised if a fair amount of players have experienced it. But what did they experience, exactly?</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe you played FFVII when it came out in 1997, in the original Japanese, on the original PlayStation. Maybe you played it when it came to America and Europe for the same console, and thus experienced the localized version, which also included new gameplay features. Perhaps you played the 1998 Eidos PC version, which revealed mouths on characters. Did you use mods, or the new features like the Character Booster in modern versions of the game? Perhaps you even played FFVII via the abridged Ever Crisis on your phone.</p><p dir="ltr">The fascinating thing is just how different these versions of a classic can be. The initial version of FFVII in Japan, for example, reportedly lacks a special flashback scene that triggers when you go to the Nibelheim Mansion basement near the end of the game; this scene is one of the most memorable in the story and gives the player a very special and touching glimpse of Zack Fair, an important character in the narrative who will become even more important to the series later.</p><p dir="ltr">What about the English localization? As the translator and critic Tim Rogers detailed in his video series, there are some particularly interesting changes in English, such as <a href="https://kotaku.com/video/zack-wasnt-actually-aeriss-boyfriend-in-the-japanese-ve-1798639613" rel="nofollow ">dialogue that arguably alters the emotional status of Aerith and Zack's relationship</a>. Or should I say Aeris, the name that so many of us recall from playing the original Western release, but has now become close to obsolete? Meanwhile, the PC version of the game featured mouths on character models, which altered the feel of certain scenes; Aerith dying while Sephiroth stands over her has less impact to me when Sephiroth is bizarrely opening his mouth wide as if performing at an opera house. Maybe you just skipped FFVII and played the remake, because that's Final Fantasy VII too, right?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576941-3657122-02_sephiroth.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576941" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576941-3657122-02_sephiroth.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576941"></a><figcaption>Sephiroth surrounded by flames in Final Fantasy 7 Remake.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576941-3657122-02_sephiroth.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you've played the FFVII remake games, you've experienced a different story to the original. This is a topic of much debate in the fandom--whether the remake is the same story as the original or not--and there is no simple answer. While it does indeed cover the main events, it does so while adding new things, taking other things away, and changing the execution of the older scenes. Suddenly the antagonist Sephiroth is appearing in the part of the story where he was never present in the original. Though Yoshinori Kitase wanted him to be like Spielberg's Jaws in the original--mysterious--that isn’t as emphasised in FFVII Remake.</p><p dir="ltr">You can even briefly play as Sephiroth in Rebirth, while in the original he was kept critically distant from you: an untouchable, terrifyingly powerful figure. To control him would be unthinkable. Zack, someone barely present in the original, is far more prominent now, and we see him even temporarily join forces with Cloud to fight Sephiroth in Rebirth. Even without the story changes, the difference in visuals, music, direction, gameplay, and the addition of voice acting would all make for a very different experience.</p><p dir="ltr">It's remarkable how quickly players will sweep these kinds of changes under the rug, though. It's still basically the same story, they often shrug. Others will go as far as to treat a remake as a replacement for the original, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/16/21221953/final-fantasy-7-remake-original-playstation-worth-playing/" rel="nofollow ">as Carolyn Petit pointed out for Polygon</a>, that just doesn't make sense.</p><p dir="ltr">Differing translations also alter the feel of a work; it's something often discussed in literature and cinema but not quite as much when it comes to video games, outside of a few specialist websites or social media accounts. In one of the most important (albeit optional) scenes in Final Fantasy VI, to cite one example, Celes throws herself off a cliff. In the original English version on the Super Nintendo (where it was released as Final Fantasy III), she does this after hearing stories about how other people had taken "a leap of faith" to restore their spirits. In the newer, more faithful English translations, however, it's framed as pointedly dark. Both versions inevitably feel different, even if--as the translator <a href="https://legendsoflocalization.com/comparisons/final-fantasy-vi/part-12/" rel="nofollow ">Clyde Mandelin noted</a> in his comparison--some players back in 1996 still saw the old version as grim.</p><p dir="ltr">The visual direction of scenes alone can change how a work comes across. The <a href="https://youtu.be/P8I5EIBLQ08" rel="nofollow ">differences between the original Silent Hill 2 and the Silent Hill 2 remake</a> are immediately striking, and something <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-hours-of-bloobers-silent-hill-2-its-unclear-who-is-remaking-who" rel="nofollow ">others</a> have written about. As many have observed, the fog in the original is overpowering to the point where you can't make character faces out as clearly, lending a distinct sense of unease to the scenes. Atmospheric differences also arise with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/30/16946392/shadow-of-the-colossus-review-remake-ps4-playstation-sony/" rel="nofollow ">Shadow of the Colossus remake</a>. The mansion setting in the original Resident Evil on PlayStation compared to the one in the GameCube remake looks dramatically different; the former has the kind of plainness you might encounter in an old, empty hotel, while the latter is much darker and Gothic, like somewhere Dracula might live. The original looks scarier to me, because it feels closer to home, like a place I might have been in before.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576944-2783625-hl2-hl2-2015-01-1401-56-2612.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576944" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576944-2783625-hl2-hl2-2015-01-1401-56-2612.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576944"></a><figcaption>A look at the mansion in Resident Evil HD Remastered.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576944-2783625-hl2-hl2-2015-01-1401-56-2612.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">These are all official changes, but gaming becomes even more complicated when you recall how intertwined the medium is with modding. Modding is so prevalent, and so part of the core of PC gaming specifically, that many players will download and use them to "improve" a game in numerous ways without much care for how this critically alters their experience in regard to visuals, audio, and interactivity. People will employ mods as casually as they grab some ketchup to improve the taste of their food. The mods will make the game look "sharper," "fix" the translation to make it more accurate, or add in cut content. They will, you are told, greatly enhance your experience with the game. But which game are you playing, then?</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps there is no definitive version of a game. Perhaps there are just so many factors to consider for the medium, as even the tool you use to play something--be it keyboard and mouse or a console controller--can dramatically alter your experience. What about the way playing a text-based game, like Disco Elysium, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysiums-switch-port-feels-like-the-perfect-form-for-this-most-novelistic-of-games" rel="nofollow ">can feel more like reading a book when you play it on a handheld system</a>?</p><p dir="ltr">I don't believe in prescribing a "right" way to play a game--but I do believe in approaching your gaming experiences with awareness and thought. It can be more taxing than the casual approach many of us take, but it's also exciting, because it makes us think about one of the powerful qualities of this medium: fluidity. Choose prudently while you stand before waves of different versions of a game. Your favorite version may not be the one the general public recommends, or even the one the creator prefers. It'll be the one that fits you best, for whatever reason.</p><p dir="ltr">Remakes, remasters, mods, and so on are all fine in concept, even wonderful, especially as it can be so hard to play older classics these days. It's worth celebrating all the versions of classics that we have, but it's also important to think about each version as an independent work. It's not so much about focusing on which version is better or worse. It's more about reflecting on the fascinating differences in the classic works of the video game medium.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not a terribly handy guy, something that’s more than once been a real problem on my bike trips. (I once got stranded in rural Virginia and had to be rescued by an old man in a truck because I… couldn’t fix a flat tire.) Despite this, I’m really into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3283240/THE_LIFT_Supernatural_Handyman_Simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Lift</em></a>, a sort of fix-it <em>Prey</em> that has a playtest until the 30th on Steam.</p><p>You play as the handyperson of a research facility, a job that in the grand tradition of video games swiftly goes wrong when disaster strikes and everyone disappears. The facility, post-disaster, is in a state of disrepair, and to progress, you have to fix doors, engines, lights, and assorted furniture.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Lift - Official Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IX8QBjHMfyk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Some of these tasks are obvious–this chair is wobbly, so you need a screwdriver and a screw–while others are little spatial and logic puzzles of wires, power sources, and converters to open doors or power up machines. Everything is wonderfully tactile: a replaced lightbulb sputters to life, a listing bench straightens up, machinery whirrs and rumbles once you’ve got the right pieces in place. There are tons of<a href="https://aftermath.site/pacific-drive-star-trucker-buttons-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> buttons to press</a> and levers to flick, and you have to physically pull drawers and doors to move them. If you can’t find the right repair bits lying around, you can craft them from recycled materials and blueprints in a machine that gave me fond flashbacks to my crafting setup in protagonist Morgan’s office in <a href="https://kotaku.com/prey-the-kotaku-review-1795167006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Prey</em></a>, though more than once I eschewed the chore of recycling detritus and simply swapped pieces from one bit to another. As the core mechanic of the playtest, all of this fixing is incredibly satisfying to do, even when your repairs are more aesthetic than world-saving.</p><p>Atop all this is a narrative full of strange characters, guiding you through the station and into how to repair the titular lift to progress. After what is basically the game’s tutorial, the playtest shuttles you to a slice deeper into the game, where there are a ton of quests to pursue that sometimes felt a little overwhelming narratively–fix X to fix Y to do Z in ways that sometimes felt a little padded–but also mostly happened organically as I wandered around seeing what I could tinker with. The atmosphere is unsettling, but so far there haven’t been any monsters or jump scares, which I hope maintains through the full game. I’m not the best spatial reasoner, and I’d hate to do it under duress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Fantastic Signals</figcaption></figure><p>The game is still a work-in-progress– I don’t love the inventory system, which can be clunky to scroll through, though when you hover over an interactable object the game will often choose the right tool for the job for you, which makes things a little simpler. And to progress you sometimes need to repair enough things in an area to raise it to a certain level; there’s a narrative justification for this, and I love the contrast between fixing important machines and just changing an overhead bulb because it’s nice to have, but it sometimes felt a little bit like busywork. </p><p>But overall I was totally charmed with the time I spent in <em>The Lift</em> and curious to see how its puzzles and story grow in the full game. I got into the playtest simply by clicking the “request access” button on Steam; I’m sorry to be telling you about it when it ends so soon, which I didn’t realize until writing this blog, but if you miss it, <em>The Lift</em> is slated to come out in 2026.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/palestinian-voice-in-games-coalition-helps-game-developers"><h3>New Coalition Seeks To Help Palestinian Game Developers ‘Speak Loudly’ Through Games</h3></a><p>Palestinian Voices in Games aims to ‘push against the dehumanisation of Palestinians’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-dc-ice"><h3>Playing Is This Seat Taken?

With the ability to carry around massive storefronts like Steam on the go, and enough horsepower to run graphical powerhouses like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, it’s no wonder Microsoft wanted to get in on the action with a more Xbox-themed offering. The only problem is that the hardware manufacturer and game publisher is asking folks to spend $600 on the basic model, and a full four-digit $1,000 for the top-tier model featuring a more powerful processor. And yet, some eBayers think folks will spend even more than that even though it hasn’t sold out elsewhere. Wild.</p>

It features a new AMD Z2E AI Chip. Is it a generational leap? Certainly not enough to prompt Valve to base a Steam Deck successor on it.</p>

That improvement, however, comes at a cost, namely about $500 more than what you’d pay for a Steam Deck, and $100 more than Asus’ excellent ROG Ally X, which is not the Xbox-branded one. (No, you’re not dumb, this naming convention is.)</p>

 <p>So, that really just leaves the controller-based Xbox user interface, which reduces the overall processing power Windows takes up and is more gamepad-friendly, and the unique controller grips. And even then, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-x-windows-handheld-app-leak-2000626934">folks have found a way to get the new Xbox game launcher working</a> on regular, non-Xbox-branded Ally portable PCs, and, to be honest, while I haven’t held a ROG Xbox Ally, it’s gonna be hard to compete with the Steam Deck’s excellent ergonomics.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-x-windows-handheld-app-leak-2000626934">The Biggest Reason To Buy The Xbox Ally Handheld Just Leaked</a></p> <p>At $1,000 for the top-tier Xbox handheld, it’s hard to see a compelling reason to upgrade if you already have a Steam Deck, and certainly not if you have a more powerful handheld than that. Who, then, is gonna get suckered into spending twice that for an eBay pre-order? Hopefully not you!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. Welcome to a new week. Will it be better than last week? I really hope so! Anyway, today’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of interesting news and stuff you might care about, features a new and less shiny PS5, <em>Silent Hill f</em> sales data,<em> Borderlands 4</em> DLC news, a content creator retiring, and a cool Daft Punk video.</p> <h2><strong>New PS5 Model Ditches All That Shiny Black Plastic</strong></h2> <p>A new model of the PlayStation 5 has leaked online ahead of an official announcement from Sony, and while it’s not a massive update to the current iteration of the console, it does include one tweak that seems to be making a lot of people happy: The new PS5 doesn’t include shiny black plastic.<a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1972613838953476238"> As reported by Zuby_Tech</a>, new photos and information about the refreshed PS5 show that it features matte black plastic, saving you from having to cover your PS5 in nasty fingerprints every time you dare to move or touch it.</p> <p>Other changes found in this new, updated PS5 console include different-colored USB ports, a smaller SSD, and a new heatsink. The console is also overall a bit lighter now, likely thanks to more stamped metal parts inside. No word on when to expect this new console to hit shelves, but I’d bet it won’t be long, as we are getting close to the holiday season.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em> Outselling <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake</strong></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">『SILENT HILL f』</p> <p>全世界累計出荷本数※が100万本を突破しました。<br>プレイいただいた皆さまありがとうございます。</p> <p>■ゲームはこちら: <a href="https://t.co/msZNoMHzVg">https://t.co/msZNoMHzVg</a></p> <p>※2025年9月26日時点 当社調べ<br>※パッケージ版出荷数とダウンロード版販売数の合計<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SILENTHILL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SILENTHILL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B5%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%83%92%E3%83%AB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#サイレントヒル</a> <a href="https://t.co/P6jl93zhGW">pic.twitter.com/P6jl93zhGW</a></p> <p>— SILENT HILL (@silenthill_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/silenthill_jp/status/1972577585558433936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>People really like <em>Silent Hill f</em>, Konami’s first original mainline entry in the long-running horror series in over a decade. So I’m not shocked to see it selling so well. According to Konami, <em>Silent Hill f</em> sold a million copies in around 24 hours. <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/topics/20250929/">In a press release announcing the news</a>, the publisher also confirmed that <em>Silent Hill f</em> was selling faster than last year’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. This is good news for <em>Silent Hill</em> fans who have spent the past decade putting up with a lot of bad news, garbage, and disappointment. Hopefully, this new era of <em>Silent Hill</em> isn’t short-lived.</p>

 <h2><strong>GOG Adds More Classic Games To Its Preservation Program&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Classic PC gaming store Good Old Games, aka <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WX">GOG, announced recently</a> that over half a dozen more titles were being added to its ongoing preservation program. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">Launched in 2024</a>, the GOG Preservation Program is the store’s long-term plan to keep certain classic PC games playable, updated, and accessible. It’s a great idea and one which, if GOG sticks to it, could be extremely helpful for games that no longer have official publisher or developer support.</p>

 <p>Here’s the latest list of games added to the program, many of which are currently on sale to celebrate the news:</p> <p><em>– Gothic 1</em><br> <em>– Gothic 2</em><br> <em>– Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness</em><br> <em>– Mortal Kombat Trilogy</em><br> <em>– Freespace 2</em><br> <em>– XIII Century Gold Edition</em><br> <em>– Stranglehold</em></p>

 <h2><strong>Gearbox Reveals <em>Borderlands</em> <em>4</em>‘s First DLC Character&nbsp;</strong></h2>  <p>Over the weekend during Tokyo Game Show, Gearbox and 2K Games revealed the first playable DLC character coming to<em> Borderlands 4:</em> C4SH, a gambling robot cowboy built around luck and chance. <a href="https://x.com/borderlandshub/status/1972264469280559301">Fan account Borderlands 4 Bulletin shared more information</a> about the new Vault Hunter on social media directly from the Gearbox TGS panel. The studio says that C4SH will have 3 action skills just like the other playable characters and that the character’s skills are “distinctly unpredictable, as they all involve an element of chance.”</p>

 <p>C4SH will be available in Q1 2026 for all players on all platforms who own the Super Deluxe Edition of <em>Borderlands 4,</em> buy the Vault Hunter Pack DLC, or who purchase the game’s first Story Pack when it’s available.</p> <p><strong><em>Skyrim</em> Grandma Shirley Curry Retiring (Again)&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/almost-90-years-old-skyrim-grandma-shirley-curry-says-shes-retiring-from-the-adventuring-life-im-tired-im-not-having-fun-anymore/">As reported by<em> PC Gamer</em>,</a> Shirley Curry, better known online as the famous <em>Skyrim</em> Grandma, is retiring from content creation. The nearly 90-year-old gamer, who will appear in <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> when that finally launches, <a href="https://youtu.be/89L4oV-ZKqM">confirmed the news in a new VLOG uploaded to her YouTube channel.</a> She explained that she’s just “bored” with playing <em>Skyrim</em> again and isn’t having a great experience on YouTube anymore, as many of the comments she got were just, according to her, younger kids shouting about how much they loved their video game grandma. She says she wanted more feedback and interesting conversations.</p> <p>“That’s why I’m just going to stop uploading anything to do with <em>Skyrim</em>,” said Curry. “I’m tired, I’m not having fun anymore, probably because of all the little kids on there. I think that’s about all I have to say.”</p> <p>Curry will keep making VLOGS and blogging, but her days with <em>Skyrim</em> are over. Probably. It was just a year ago that Curry actually announced similar plans to retire from <em>Elder Scrolls</em> content, but then came back and even made a video of herself playing the <em>Oblivion Remaster</em>. But based on how she sounds in this new VLOG, I get the feeling she really is done with <em>Skyrim</em>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is turning into a giant <em>Fortnite</em>-like mess</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-free-to-play-game-tech-debt-ceo-discord-ps5-pc-fps-performance-2000629256"><em>Helldivers 2</em> was, at one point, planned to be a free-to-play game</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-america-3ds-satoru-shibata-2000629269">Nintendo of America’s New CEO Seems Fun</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

The studio has previously announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-borderlands-4-will-keep-you-looting-and-shooting-after-launch/1100-6534397/" data-ref-id="1100-6534397">the game's first DLC</a> is coming next year.

He--or it--will debut as part of the first story pack DLC, which includes a new tale called Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned. C4ash is one of two new vault hunters teased by Gearbox, but the identity of the second one has yet to be revealed.</p><p>Claptrap voice actor Jim Foronda reacted to the announcement by sharing his own "head canon' about the relationship between his character and C4sh.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/JimForonda/status/1972147470076670348" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">SUDDEN AND *VERY UNOFFICIAL* HEADCANON:<br>Claptrap mistakenly believes he pioneered pronouncing the 4 in one's own model number as the letter A… and now he thinks C4SH is his biggest fan on Kairos. <a href="https://t.co/Oi19N6NJsn" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/Oi19N6NJsn</a></p>  — Jim Foronda (@JimForonda) <a href="https://twitter.com/JimForonda/status/1972147470076670348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>C4sh and the rest of the first story pack DLC will be released in Q1 2026.

                <p>Fortnite continues to lean into artificial intelligence, as developer Epic Games has <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972665777556955476" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> an AI-powered chatbot to help with Player Support inquiries.</p><p>The goal is for the Fortnite AI chatbot to help players find answers faster for their support questions. The chatbot is first rolling out in a test that will make it available only to 1% of players on Fortnite's English-language support site. Wider availability for the chatbot will come later, Epic said.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-launches-beta-for-ai-chatbot-that-reads-your-xbox-profile/1100-6531875/" data-ref-id="1100-6531875">Microsoft rolled out its own AI chatbot to help Xbox users with a variety of things.</a></p><p>Before this, Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">used AI to replicate the late James Earl Jones' voice to bring a Darth Vader to Fortnite</a> as a character people could converse with.

The use of AI technologies in game development has proven controversial as well, as people fear things like job losses and plagiarism issues.</p><p>In other Fortnite news, with Halloween right around the corner, a leak has suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kpop-demon-hunters-are-you-next-rumored-guests-for-fortnites-halloween-party/1100-6535058/" data-ref-id="1100-6535058">characters from the popular Netflix movie KPop Demon Hunters</a> will come to Fortnite for the Fortnitemares 2025 event.

            <p>Earth Must Die was one of the stand-out premieres in yesterday's PC Gaming Show. The cartoon-styled space romp shone with crisp and vibrant visuals, and boasted a cast list that read like a who's-who of British comedy.</p>
<p>Starring in it are Joel Fry (Game of Thrones, Dr Who, Our Flag Means Death), Ben Starr (Expedition 33, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>), Martha Howe-Douglas (co-creator of Ghosts), Alex Horne (Taskmaster), Mike Wozniak (Man Down, Taskmaster, Three Bean Salad podcast), Don Warrington (Rising Damp!), Matthew Holness (Garth Marenghi's Darkplace), Tamsin Greig (Black Books, Green Wing!), and Stevie Martin, Julie Nolke, Sophie Duker, Emma Fryer, Alasdair Beckett-King, Rosie Holt, Jon Blyth, Sam O'Leary, Tom Lawrinson, Sally Beaumont, David Montieth and Inel Tomlinson.</p>
<p>Yes, that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/authors/jon-blyth">Jon Blyth who once contributed to Eurogamer</a>, which I'm sure is the accolade he shares and not his recent BAFTA-nominated performance in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thank-goodness-youre-here-review">Thank Goodness You're Here!</a></p>

<p>An eye-catching trailer and an eye-catching cast list, but details about the actual game were relatively scarce. What actually is Earth Must Die, then, and when is it coming out? Having talked to the game's creator Dan Marshall today, I know some of the answers.</p><p>Earth Must Die, like many of Size Five's games (that's Marshall's studio name), is a point-and-click adventure. And like many of Size Five's games, it comes with a twist. "The idea is it's a point-and-click adventure game but the lead character refuses to touch anything," Marshall tells me. "He's above it; because he's from land-owning gentry, he won't press buttons. So the game is a... conversation-'em-up. That's not a real word is it?</p>

<p>"But it's not like Monkey Island where you can constantly replay conversations until you get the right stuff. Conversations play through, and you choose how much of a dick you're going to be [I'll come back to this point], and puzzle solving is more about manipulating other people into doing what you want to achieve rather than you actually doing it. So it's more about ordering other people around to do things, rather than picking stuff up and having your own inventory."</p>
<p>Indeed, Earth Must Die <em>doesn't </em>have an inventory, so you can't touch anything or pick anything up, or keep anything with you. I don't think I've ever heard of an adventure/point-and-click game having done that before.</p>
<p>To come back to the "choose how much of a dick you're going to be" point earlier: Earth Must Die is also a game about a baddie. A proper baddie. Not a baddie who secretly wants to be good.</p>

<p>Says Marshall: "What they do in games quite often, or in Despicable Me or Star Wars or whatever, is they go 'this time you're going to play as one of the people in the Empire', and they chicken out about a third of the way through and you defect to the Rebel side. And actually [the character is] a goodie because playing a baddie all the way through is slightly irksome.</p><p>"We've worked out ways of balancing [Valak's] story so that he's just a dick - he's a fascist dictator bellend. I won't mince my words! But he's not the hero of the story. But you do get to play him and choose his dialogue options and all the rest of it, while the world crumbles around him."</p>
<p>Valak is the lead, then, a Ming the Merciless-like character in charge of a vast alien empire who one day discovers Earth and an empire better organised than his. "So it's basically: you're this Ming the Merciless character with your 1950s wobbly sets, and then the Empire from Star Wars turns up and invades and takes over and rolls you into their much better empire. So that leaves you in the slightly awkward position of becoming the de facto Rebel leader for your [rebellion]," Marshall says.</p>

<p>I think it sounds great, and if Size Five's last game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lair-of-the-clockwork-god-review-platform-meets-adventure-with-hilarious-consequences">Lair of the Clockwork God</a> is anything to go by, there's every chance it will be (I wish I'd been bold enough to give that game five stars; don't tell Chris Tapsell I said that). But when is Earth Must Die coming out?</p><p>One of the upsides of holding back a reveal until the vocal parts have been recorded is the game's nearly done. As in, there's an outside chance Earth Must Die could even release this year, publisher No More Robots told me today. It's a very tentative aim, so bear that in mind, but it could happen. And if it doesn't, a 2026 release presumably won't be far behind.</p>
<p>Incidentally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swindle-dev-dan-marshall-reveals-new-spacefaring-game-in-the-eurogamer-podcast">I was delighted to host Dan Marshall and writing and design partner Ben Ward (the Ben of 'Ben and Dan') on the interview podcast I ran</a> a few years ago, and I don't think any guests made me laugh harder.</p>

<p>In a new announcement, Evil Empire revealed that it'll be stepping behind the development wheel of Brotato while the game's initial devs, Blobfish Games, head off to focus on new projects.</p>
<p>This 'live ops' work is very similar to what we saw Evil Empire do with Dead Cells — heck, the studio was founded by former Motion Twin devs for this very reason — so we're excited to see what the team will cook up for the runnin', gunnin' potato roguelike.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067outhgy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>Evil Empire has said that it has no post-launch Brotato plans to reveal at the moment, though it has teased that an update will be coming our way in October featuring a new mob called 'The Gobbler'.</p>
<p>The studio shared the full Bortato statement on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/evilempirestudio.bsky.social/post/3lzy6ihdh4k2a">BlueSky</a>, which you can check out below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big news: today we're feeling chipper as we're picking up Brotato!<br>
Blobfish Games has been carrying it for years, and they've done an incredible job. Now they want to make new games (which we're very excited to play), and so they're trusting us to keep Brotato alive while they do their thing. That's both an honor and a little terrifying.<br>
In case you hadn't realised already, we live and breathe roguelikes, and we've got over 6 years of 'live ops' experience that we can put to good use here. We also just genuinely love this game — there's a few of us whose 'hours played' stats are way too high... So, this means that we'll be doing what we know works best — working with the players as closely as possible to mash their ideas with ours, while we release regular content updates.<br>
We'll start sharing some broad ideas with you soon and we might just wedge in some betas in the coming months too, What you can expect is more chaos, more experiments, and maybe a few disasters along the way. That's how good games grow. And this one deserves to keep growing. Sprouting?<br>
Thank you again to Blobfish Games for your trust, we can't wait to get stuck in!<br>
PS: The first update is on its way, but you may want to update the game already for a little something something</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from all the Brotato bonus content, Evil Empire will be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> to Switch and Switch 2 at some point this year. This one has racked up some pretty positive reviews throughout its early access period, so it'll be interesting to see whether it lives up to the hype.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-lord-of-the-rings-third-person-action-game-in-development-rumor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-lord-of-the-rings-third-person-action-game-is-in-development-%E2%80%93-rumor.1311643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/">Insider-Gaming</a> claims that a new Lord of the Rings game is in development, and that a deal regarding the game's funding, which Insider-Gaming alleges will partially come from the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), and potentially even the new game, could be revealed next week.</p>



<p>Insider-Gaming's report doesn't include details about the new game, save for a claim that this new title is "<em>a third-person action game that is designed, in a way, to 'compete with Hogwarts Legacy.'"</em></p>



<p>Beyond the ADIO's involvement, Embracer Group, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-rights-embracer-low-price/">purchased the rights to the major fantasy franchise and the right to develop new videogames for it in 2022</a>, are also, as expected, involved. The other studio mentioned in the report is a studio called <a href="https://www.getrevenge.ch/">Revenge</a>.</p>



<p>The last time we got a third-person action game set within the world of The Lord of the Rings was the Middle-Earth series from <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Warner Bros. and the now shuttered Monolith Productions</a>. It's the series that fans remember for introducing the infamous Nemesis System, though, thanks to WB having a copyright hold on the mechanic, we can bet it probably won't be included in whatever this new title is.</p>



<p>Regardless, it's exciting to know that there is at least talks of a new action game coming from the world of The Lord of the Rings. The classic PlayStation 2-era titles from EA based on Peter Jackson's films, still hold up in the eyes of many players who were around at the time, and even though we only got two of them, the Middle-Earth games from Monolith Productions are memorable for more than just a single groundbreaking game mechanic.</p>



<p>It would also be nice to see a solid Lord of the Rings game appear on the scene again, since the last two games based on the franchise, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollums-failure-causes-daedalic-to-shut-down-studio-shift-to-publishing-only/">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-the-shire/">Tales of the Shire</a>, didn't exactly hit their mark. </p>
