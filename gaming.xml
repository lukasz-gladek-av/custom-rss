            <p>Team Folon – the volunteer squad of developers who have released the ambitious <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> mod, Fallout London – is set to launch itself as a new indie studio.</p>
<p>Talking to the BBC (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-london/developer-new-indie-studio">PCGN</a>), Folon's project lead, Dean Carter, admitted that "as much as I love the fact that this is a free project - that we can offer this thing for free for all the community - free doesn't pay our bills".</p>
<p>"What has been great for us is that a lot of people who have really enjoyed [Fallout London] have donated to us, and we're channelling that into Team Folon, which is what we're going to be moving into," Carter said.</p>

<p>"We should hopefully launch our own indie games company which will allow us to come up with our own ideas, create our own games, and work [...] without having to speak to anyone above us, such as Bethesda, or anything like that.</p>
<p>"It'll be completely our own thing and we can create a game that we want, that we think the community will enjoy. Fallout London has been a great springboard for that."</p>
<p>As for what's next for Fallout London?</p>
<p>"Fallout London will continue until we have all the content which we had to cut for the release. We have another ending, which we call the wild card ending - that will come out in one of the future patches. That's not going to happen soon; we can see ourselves working until the end of the year.</p>
<p>"We don't have ulterior motives. We wanted to do something that was fun [during lockdown], we've made something that's fun, and people have found it fun, so for us we've achieved that goal so we're very happy about it, and the reception."</p>
<p>Asked if Bethesda had reached out to Team Folon following all the positive coverage of Fallout London, Carter simply said: "Um, no. No, we haven't."</p>
<p>"There hasn't been any communication, which is strange, because we've now had communication with other people in the industry, and what I guess would be seen as their competitors. <em>They've</em> reached out to us, and we've spoken to them, but Bethesda themselves have not spoken to us at all, no."</p>
<p>He did, however, add that as this was a fan-made mod created entirely on Bethesda's own IP, Team Folon in no way believes it is "entitled" to an audience with Bethesda.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-hotfix-still-on-the-way-along-with-huge-update">A hotfix for Fallout: London to address crashing issues is still on the way</a>, with developer Team Folon planning a "huge" patch soon after.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-fan-made-mod-out-today">game-size fan-made mod for Fallout 4 set in the English capital</a> released at the end of July, but players have experienced a high number of crashes and issues, including Eurogamer's Ian Higton when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-ian-explore-the-new-fan-made-fallout-london-mod-in-todays-live-stream">streamed his playthrough</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-developers-promise-incoming-fix-for-biggest-issues">Team Folon has since promised a fix was on the way</a> and, in a new statement on its Discord, has reiterated its plans for the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick said the company is not tempted to put its game on subscription services like Xbox Game Pass on day one because "our decisions are rational".</p>
<p>Talking to our sister site <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Zelnick said that whilst he accepted "offering a frontline title with a premium price in a subscription service, day and date, will push consumers to that subscription service for at least a period of time", "it won't affect [Take-Two's] decisions [not to offer AAA games on subscription services on day one]".</p>

<p>With "15 immersive core" games on Take-Two's books for 2026 and 2027 - one of which is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, of course - as well as one indie, five mobile games, and three remasters, Zelnick says it's his company's "job to outperform the industry, and the one way to do that is to generate big hits, and I think we have all the necessary elements to deliver that."</p>
<p>"There are modest tailwinds which are positive," he concludes. "It is our job to outperform the industry, and the only way to do that is to generate big hits, and I think we have all the necessary elements to deliver that."</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that Zelnick asked if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-asks-you-to-give-the-borderlands-movie-a-chance-as-a-lot-of-people-worked-really-hard-on-it">fans could please give the new Borderlands movie "a chance"</a> because "a lot of people worked really hard on it".</p>
<p>Zelnick was asked about the film's less-than-stellar early reviews during its Q1 earnings call, and whilst he called the "look and the feel" of the movie "terrific", Zelnick told investors that its performance "wouldn't have a financial impact" on Take-Two or, indeed, the Borderlands franchise itself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Master Sword from the game’s opening prologue doesn’t have that same weakness, though, and players have spent months trying to find a way to get that version instead.  - Ethan Gach <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-totk-master-sword-unbreakable-glitch-prologue-1851613232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-totk-master-sword-unbreakable-glitch-prologue-1851613232">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cce55fcd87374460c1431ab3e6264042" data-recommend-id="image://cce55fcd87374460c1431ab3e6264042" data-format="png" data-width="919" data-height="517" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A demonic warrior flashes her cool cosmetics.

		<p>We’re into the final weekend of the Olympics, and there’s always going to be that bittersweet ending to the two week spectacle of sports. All the years of build up and preparation for the athletes, so much joy for the medallists, no doubt mixed with a tinge of missed opportunity for those walking away with a silver, but that can be a massive drive to push on to the next world championship, the next four years to reach the 2028 Olympics in LA.</p>

		<p>QuakeCon 2024 has seen the announcement and launch of a brand new remaster of Doom and Doom II. A newly combined release of the two classic, genre-defining first person shooters, Doom + Doom II also includes a brand new episode called Legacy of Rust, created in collaboration by individuals from id Software, Nightdive Studios and MachineGames.</p>
<p>Doom + Doom II is out now across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, Xbox One, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, PS4, Nintendo Switch and PC – and obviously available via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>. It’s a free upgrade across all these platforms for owners of Doom or Doom II, who can still access previously owned versions of these games – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/26/doom-doom-ii-doom-3-ps4-switch-xbox-one-eternal-battlemode/">the last remasters arrived in 2019</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM + DOOM II | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-4-xswoPRpo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Doom + Doom II has been remastered by Nightdive Studios using their powerful cross-platform KEX Engine. This has been the backbone for the studios proliferation of classic game remasters, and has been used for remasters of Doom 64, Quake and Quake II in the last few years.</p>
<p>This enhanced version of these games comes with a newly optimised renderer which pushes resolutions up to 4K and 120fps, depending on the platform and console. There’s also new accessibility options. Deathmatch and co-op play for up to 16 players are available cross-platform – they suggest using room codes to join up – with new rules for level wipes and restarts. Oh, and there’s 4-player split-screen support.</p>

<p>In a similar vein to previous KEX Engine releases, this remaster aims to be an all-encompassing collection, and so it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>DOOM</li>
<li>DOOM II</li>
<li>Master Levels for DOOM II</li>
<li>TNT: Evilution</li>
<li>The Plutonia Experiment</li>
<li>No Rest for the Living</li>
<li>Sigil</li>
<li>Legacy of Rust (a new episode created in collaboration by individuals from id Software, Nightdive Studios and MachineGames)</li>
<li>A new Deathmatch map pack featuring 25 new maps</li>
</ul>
<p>The Deathmatch map pack includes community creations from from Luis “DX-Chain” Armacanqui, Luca Ciriaco, Ralph “Ralphis” Vickers, Matthew “RottKing” Cibulas, Colton “Arrowhead” Murchison, Andrew “Saar” Bouvé &amp; Joshua “tokyopunchout” Boyle. This new pack compliments the existing 18, bringing the total Deathmatch levels to 43.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s great to see this remaster made, considering some of the fussy awkwardness that surrounded the 2019 remasters – things like the 35fps frame limit, which was patched out months later, and the controversial Bethesda.net requirement, which was also removed, and doesn’t affect this new launch.</p>
<p>This is not the only Doom-y announcement to come out of QuakeCon 2024, and on the complete other end of the series’ timescale, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/09/doom-eternal-gets-official-pc-mod-support/">Doom Eternal now has official mod tools</a> via a PC mod beta. That should tide series fans over until the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-with-a-gory-trailer-and-its-coming-to-ps5/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-campaign-leaked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-black-ops-6-campaign-cutscenes-leak-online.949935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-campaign-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The entirety of Black Ops 6’s campaign has been leaked online over two months before the games official release.</p>



<p>The campaign has been uploaded to X (formerly Twitter) by user @Kivikou. According to our sources and rumours circulating the internet, the campaign cutscenes were extracted from the BETA build of Black Ops 6, which began to leak earlier this week. You can watch the cutscenes below with the catch that it does not have audio.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to our estimates, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-hundreds-of-people-playing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of people have already gained access to Black Ops 6</a> via jailbroken PlayStation 4 consoles. Some users have resorted to uploading the content online, with Activision beginning to DMCA the content and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-c-and-d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issue cease-and-desists to the most prolific offenders</a>.</p>



<p>The campaign leak marks another huge blow to the developers behind Black Ops 6. So far, the entire BETA build, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-all-achievements-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s achievements</a>, and now the entirety of the campaign’s cutscenes.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 zombies are seemingly the only game mode that has yet to be compromised, but with data miners continuing to extract and find data, it could only be a matter of time before that game mode is also leaked.</p>



<p>Speaking with several Black Ops 6 developers, they are understandably upset and frustrated over the large amount of leaks, which is an unprecedented amount for Call of Duty. One developer told me about the situation, “It really sucks to see our big reveal ruined like this, we were all excited to show it off in a big and special way.” Black Ops 6 multiplayer is set to be officially&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-watch-codnext/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed at the end of August in a CODNext event</a>, which will be prior to the Black Ops 6 BETA.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is set to launch on October 25 on the PlaysTation4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-boarding-actions-compendium-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>First released as part of the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-400000-kill-team-gallowfall-review">Kill Team Gallowdark</a></em> season, and then followed up in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-arks-of-omen-abaddon-review">Arks of Omen</a> series of books for <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, Boarding Actions takes the open battlefields of the 41st millennium and trades them for the close confines of inter-spaceship fighting. Initially, the rules for this version of the <em>40K</em> game were spread over the 5 Arks of Omen books, which released before the Leviathan box which kicked off 10th Edition, the current edition of the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> rules. The Boarding Actions rules have now been updated, and released in a collated version of their own book. In this article, we'll take a look at the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K</em> Boarding Actions Compendium, see what it contains, and how Boarding Actions plays.</p>


<p>The <em>Warhammer 40K</em> Boarding Actions Compendium is a collection of all the Boarding Actions rules from the Arks of Omen books, updated for use with <em>Warhammer 40K 10th Edition</em>. The book contains:</p>
<ul><li>All the rules for Boarding Actions and the rules adaptions from the core <em>40K</em> rules needed to use the system</li>
<li>A huge amount of missions including balanced competitive missions, narrative missions, a linked campaign to play through, multiplayer missions, and the unique dark depths missions, where players select their own board half and link it with their opponent's selection</li>
<li>55 Detachment rules for mustering your <em>40K</em> force as Boarding Actions uses unique rules with limited unit selections (not everything fits in a space hulk). Most armies have at least 2 detachments options, some 3 and daemons have 5! My preference is the Adeptus Astartes Pilum Strike Team, where I can make the best use of my Raven Guard Phobos Marines</li>

<p>To use the Warhammer 40K Boarding Actions Compendium, you will need:</p>
<ul><li><em>Warhammer 40K </em>Rulebook</li>
<li><em>Warhammer 40K</em> Boarding Actions Compendium (for the Boarding Actions rules, missions, and detachment rules for your force)</li>
<li>The Codex for your chosen faction and the miniatures for them</li>
<li>A set of the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> Boarding Actions Scenery (or 2 sets from the Kill Team Gallowdark Season)
<ul><li>If you want to use the Breaching Operations Missions, you will also need a set of the Killzone Upgrade Soulshackle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Measuring tool, dice, and tokens</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/40k-boarding-actions-2.jpg?itok=ngLMQ2ST 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/40k-boarding-actions-2.jpg?itok=MyoXgPxT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boarding Actions feature tight often point-blank combat.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Are The Boarding Actions Missions?</h2>
<p>Boarding Actions completely change the way that <em>40K</em> is played. You're limited to 500 points and the restrictions that your selected detachment gives you. For example, the Adeptus Sororitas Penitents and Pilgrims detachment can only take a Priest, Arco-Flagellants, and Repentia Squads.</p>
<p>There are also several new and slightly modified actions:</p>
<ul><li>Set overwatch, allowing a unit to fire after an enemy unit moves&nbsp;or when a hatch is opened</li>
<li>Set to defend, which adds one to a unit's hit rolls when in melee</li>
<li>Secure site, used to capture objectives</li>
<li>Operate hatchway, to open the door units in the scenery walls (nearby enemy models can resist opening and closing hatches, which results in a roll-off adding the strength of the two opposing fighters as they fight over the door)</li>
</ul><p>Boarding actions are fast-paced, tight, action-filled battles, that add a new challenge to creating and piloting your chosen army. I like that you get stuck in with the enemy, and the walls of the scenery gets rid of that sometimes oppressive turn 1 shooting phase that can decimate your army in open terrain.</p>

<p>Boarding Actions themselves are a lot of fun and mainly being a&nbsp;<em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;player, it's a great progression into a different side of <em>40K</em>. I played a lot of the previous edition of <em>40K</em> with Boarding Actions, and having all the rules and missions, along with the updated detachments in a single book is a great step.&nbsp;The points and troop choice limits change up force selection and brings the focus into short punchy firepower and melee.</p>
<p>It's great to see each faction (except the Imperial and Chaos Knights as they don't fit) get a few different detachment options, this adds some variety in the way they play, as the 500-point and limited units does restrict the optimum or meta force within the detachment. The forces are all thematic, which makes for some great Boarding Actions games (Infestation Swarm vs Terminator Assault anyone?).</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Warhammer 40K Boarding Actions Compendium?</h2>
<p>To use the<em> 40K</em> Boarding Actions Compendium, you need to invest in the Boarding Actions Scenery Set, and the missions themselves take a lot more time than you may be used to for 500-point games to link all the walls together and get them set up according to the mission. The effort is worth it, but if you're looking for quick games, or don't want to invest in the scenery set, then Boarding Actions might not be for you.&nbsp;</p>
