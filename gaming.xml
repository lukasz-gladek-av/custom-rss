Spidey’s eyes will glow, as the light ring on your Echo can shine through its translucent cover. The light adjusts automatically--so the darker the room, the brighter his eyes.</p><p>The stand doesn’t bring any additional functionality to your Echo, but it’s a fun way to display it in your home. It also won’t hinder your ability to operate the smart speaker, as all its buttons and ports are still easily accessible. As mentioned, this is the first discount we’ve seen for the stand, and it's prominently featured on Amazon's home page, so we wouldn't be surprised if it sells out.</p></div>                      </div><h2><a href="https://amzn.to/4evC4Q1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime Day Smart Speaker &amp; Display Deals</a></h2><p>Unless otherwise stated, all of the deals below are for the newest editions of Amazon's various Echo smart home devices.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Spider-Man-Amazon-Generations-Separately/dp/B0D5NQJM3S?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Spider-Man Echo Dot Stand</a> -- $30 (<del>$40</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-vibrant-helpful-routines-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Dot Smart Speaker</a> -- $32 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Bundle-release-Glacier-Limited/dp/B0DKPFN5PW?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Dot + Iron Man Stand</a> -- $62 (<del>$90</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-featuring-Mandalorian-Grogu-TM-inspired/dp/B08NVVRCTM?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Baby Yoda Echo Dot Stand</a> -- $15 (<del>$28</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-release-Designed-parental-controls/dp/B09B9CD1YB?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Dot Kids Smart Speaker</a> -- $32 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Made-Amazon-Battery-generation/dp/B09RV53551?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Dot Battery Base</a> -- $33 (<del>$40</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Alexa-fits-anywhere/dp/B09ZXJDSL5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Pop Smart Speaker</a> -- $22 (<del>$40</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Designed-parental-controls-Princess/dp/B0CB9PF1N6?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Pop Kids Smart Speaker</a> -- $22 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Spot-2024-release-Smart-alarm-clock-with-vibrant-sound-Alexa-Black/dp/B0BFC7WQ6R?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Spot Smart Alarm Clock</a> -- $45 (<del>$80</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-5/dp/B09B2SBHQK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Show 5 Smart Display</a> -- $60 (<del>$90</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-5-3rd-Gen-2023-release-Kids/dp/B09B2SB77Q?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Show 5 Kids Smart Display</a> -- $60 (<del>$100</del>)<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-8/dp/B0BLS3QJTX?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Show 8 Smart Display</a> -- $110 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Amazon-Battery-Generation-Release/dp/B0BZ3X7Z7M?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Show 8 Battery Base</a> -- $35 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds-Wireless-Charging-Case/dp/B085WTWYS4?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Buds Wireless Earbuds with ANC</a> -- $45 (<del>$140</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Frames-3rd-Gen-Smart-audio-glasses-with-Alexa--Modern-Rectangle-frames-in-charcoal-gray--with-blue-light-filtering-lenses/dp/B09SVHP9X8?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Frames Smart Glasses</a> -- $130 (<del>$300</del>)</li></ul><hr><p>Amazon previously released an <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Spider-Man-Amazon-Generations-Separately/dp/B0CZY2X5ND?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Iron Man Echo Dot Stand</a></strong> last holiday.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>and Sonic the Hedgehog secret lair were <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-magic-gathering-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair-is-gonna-go-fast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Official Magic: The Gathering Sonic The Hedgehog Secret Lair is Gonna Go Fast">announced last week</a>, and they look like a blast. At the heart of this announcement is the Secret Lair X Sonic: Friends and Foes drop which features 7 new and unique cards depicting core characters of the&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>&nbsp;franchise.</p>

<p>Clearly designed with Commander in mind as casual first cards with legality in only Eternal formats like Vintage, Legacy, and Commander, in this article I'll look at each of the legendary creatures in that drop and suggest 5 cards that work well with each. With six new creatures to take a look at, let's dash off to this look at the new creatures from the Sonic the Hedgehog secret lair.</p>

<h2>Knuckles the Echidna</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/knuckles-the-echidna.jpg?itok=dstUZQhh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/knuckles-the-echidna.jpg?itok=W_OG3OYm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Knuckles is an interesting design for <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>as he’s got a head of steam as a voltron type commander with a flurry of keywords, and comes with his own back up alternate win condition. 30 Artifacts is a lot, no doubt about it, but his ability to make several treasure a turn make it viable to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you can also give Knuckles some handy gear to make him even deadlier to take advantage of his double strike, trample, and haste to rush down opponents. The combination of both directions make Knuckles a powerful warrior, even if he is restricted to mono-red.</p>

<p>Obviously if you’re looking to run Knuckles as your commander, you should look at some of the other cards in the Sonic Secret Lair drop as cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2081/super-state" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Super State">Super State </a>and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2095/the-reaver-cleaver" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Knuckles's Gloves">Knuckles’s Gloves</a> are clear fits.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Knuckles the Echidna</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otc/251/academy-manufactor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Academy Manufactor">Academy Manufactor</a>: Triple the artifact output as you grab Sonic’s chili dogs.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afr/167/xorn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Xorn">Xorn</a>: Double the treasure output for double the fun.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/127/full-throttle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Full Throttle">Full Throttle</a>: Any extra combat type card can fit,&nbsp;but Full Throttle’s 2 extra combat phases give you the opportunity to wipe the table out in one turn.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden</a>: With Excalibur from the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/assassins-creed-magic-gathering-set-has-me-hooked" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" The Assassin’s Creed Magic: The Gathering Set Has Me Hooked"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em>'s MTG set</a>, one attack from Knuckles is enough to kill anyone.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/34/goldlust-triad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Goldlust Triad">Goldlust Triad</a>: A little spice, as with myriad it will get you more Knuckles triggers, and it makes more treasure too.</li>
</ul><h2>Amy Rose</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amy-rose.jpg?itok=wAeamRo2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amy-rose.jpg?itok=VL6SzTyH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sonic’s psychotic stalker/girlfriend, Amy Rose is yet another boros (red/white) equipment centric Commander, prompting comparisons to any number of those previous (like all the Cloud's from <em>Final Fantasy</em>). Still, Amy has some unique capabilities here on display, and some important abilities for this type of deck.</p>

<p>Haste will help her get into the action quickly, while her attack trigger lets you avoid paying exorbitant equip costs that some cards have. Unlike many equipment commanders, she also wants to have a friend along the ride.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amy clearly wants her <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2098/hammer-of-nazahn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Piko Piko Hammer">Piko Piko Hammer </a>from the Turbo Gear secret lair, and is more than willing to enter <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2081/super-state" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Super State ">Super State </a>as well. She’s also more than willing to borrow <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2095/the-reaver-cleaver" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Knuckles's Gloves">Knuckles’s Gloves</a> to apply some beatdown, but let’s take a look at five other cards the pink menace could use.</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Amy Rose</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/338/colossus-hammer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Colossus Hammer">Colossus Hammer</a>: Probably really a better fit for Piko Piko Hammer than Hammer of Nazahan, but really a must run here for Amy.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/137/firion-wild-rose-warrior" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Firion, Wild Rose Warrior">Firion Wild Rose Warrior</a>: Double up your new equipment and take advantage of Amy even more with this <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 1"><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>MTG legendary creature</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/215/merry-esquire-of-rohan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Merry, Esquire of Rohan">Merry, Esquire of Rohan</a>: Merry is a perfect friend for Amy, as Merry draws cards, and joins in the hasty attacks, all the way from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/deep-cuts-in-lord-of-rings-tales-of-middle-earth-mtg-set" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" The Best Lore Deep Cuts in Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth MTG">Middle-Earth</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/105/inventory-management" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Inventory Management">Inventory Management</a>: There’s a lot of equipment to run with Amy, and Inventory Management provides a unique way for decks using it to get pieces where they need to be, with this&nbsp;technology from&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/197/bladehold-war-whip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bladehold War-Whip">Blade War-Whip</a>: Providing a friend for Amy, Blade War-Whip also provides the important double strike, and its high equip cost matters less with Amy dodging it.</li>
</ul><h2>Dr. Eggman</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dr-eggman.jpg?itok=jFgX0LZG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dr-eggman.jpg?itok=1e_exU4I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Robotnik is an intriguing card that has a lot of potential, but also one that is challenging to take advantage of. Your opponents always have the option to discard, thus you should expect them to make that choice most of the time, as the idea of whatever construct, robot, or vehicle coming down for free will scare your opponent.</p>

<p>Thus, players must be like Eggman and pollute the situation to make it painful and harmful for everyone. Choke them with pollution, inundate them with smog, and make their lives miserable to power your creations and unleash them on an unsuspecting public.</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Dr. Eggman</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/khm/112/tergrid-god-of-fright-tergrids-lantern" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tergrid, God of Fright">Tergrid, God of Fright</a>: If you’re going to be a villain, you might as well go all out. With Tergrid down, your opponents will be strongly considering letting Eggman send out his artifacts. Do note he is a game changer, and thus makes the deck at least bracket 3.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/86/yshtola-rhul" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Y’shtola Rhul">Y’shtola Rhul</a>: The double endphase is what you want here to get two Dr. Eggman triggers each round, from another of our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 2">top 50&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>legendary creatures</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/who/165/the-valeyard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Valeyard">The Valeyard</a>: You know what’s better than 2 villainous choices a round? 4 Villainous Choices a round, as Doctor Who’s The Valeyard will double Eggman’s triggers.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/132/scrawling-crawler" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Scrawling Crawler">Scrawling Crawler</a>: To make sure opponents feel the pain of denying Eggman his robots, we must give them more cards to make them discard and fuel our evil.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/233/cityscape-leveler" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cityscape Leveler">Cityscape Leveler</a>: Cityscape Leveler is one of the biggest construct, robot, or vehicle options, and provides plenty of&nbsp;destruction capability.</li>
</ul><h2>Miles “Tails” Prower</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/miles-tails-prower.jpg?itok=B4QihPBt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/miles-tails-prower.jpg?itok=qa9EUo3d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The kid genius of the Sonic universe, Tails is a longtime icon of the Sonic franchise, and he's got his shop tools out to lead a vehicle deck. Known for making different machines, piloting, and being Sonic’s sidekick, Tails can take take the lead here.</p>

<p>Vehicle decks have challenges with the fact that you need both creatures, and the vehicles, as well as needing to defend yourself. While the traditional UW (blue/white) vehicle deck is led by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/4/shorikai-genesis-engine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shorikai, Genesis Engine">Shorikai</a> and is a slower, more methodical deck. Miles wants to lead a more aggressive take that is taking to the sky under his piloting, much like his work on <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2100/weatherlight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tornado, Sonic’s Biplane ">Tornado, Sonic’s Biplane </a>which you definitely will want here as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Miles "Tails" Prower</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/neo/231/prodigys-prototype" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Prodigy’s Prototype">Prodigy’s Prototype</a>: Making trained pilots, Prodigy’s Prototype also benefits from Tails granting flying to it, as well as a low crew cost.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bot/1/prowl-stoic-strategist-prowl-pursuit-vehicle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Prowl, Stoic Strategist">Prowl, Stoic Strategist</a>: From the BOT special sheet, this Transformers crossover is disruption, vehicular talent, and able to eventually be a decent beater with evasion from Tails.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mor/25/stonybrook-schoolmaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stonybrook Schoolmaster">Stonybrook Schoolmaster</a>: From Lorwyn, Merfolk there gave a benefit when they become tapped - which is what you need to do to crew vehicles, and the tokens it makes are perfectly disposable blockers or bodies to crew vehicles.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/6/drumbellower" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Drumbellow">Drumbellow</a>: Untapping all your creatures each turn ensures that your attacking vehicles don’t leave you defenseless.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/37/unidentified-hovership" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Unidentified Hovership">Unidentified Hovership</a>: Abduct opposing creatures, and ensure they won’t return with the Unidentified Hovership, and grab a card if Tails is out.</li>
</ul><h2>Shadow the Hedgehog</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-the-hedgehog.jpg?itok=A9r9p82L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-the-hedgehog.jpg?itok=YCyB8H1A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Shadow is one of the less focused commander options in the Sonic Secret Lair drop, as Sonic’s nemesis is rewarding a variety of behavior. He wants hasty or flash creatures, who are dying, and artifacts that produce mana, ideally for spells that take the most advantage of split second.</p>

<p>The best use for him is likely as a draw engine in an aggressive aristocrats style of deck. That means hasty creatures attacking, sacrificing and getting payoffs from it all while causing chaos with attacks.</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Shadow the Hedgehog</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/136/kiki-jiki-mirror-breaker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker">Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker</a>: Making quickly disposed of versions of various creatures you control, Kiki-Jiki is a great friend to Shadow.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/139/sneak-attack" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sneak Attack">Sneak Attack</a>: Put any monster you want onto the field quickly and attacking with haste, and cash out with the card from Shadow.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/57/sabin-master-monk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sabin, Master Monk">Sabin, Master Monk</a>: A recurring consistent threat, as blitz is a great mechanic with Shadow, and Sabin can blitz from the graveyard.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otc/159/captivating-crew" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Captivating Crew">Captivating Crew</a>: <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/10e/242/threaten" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Threaten ">Threaten </a>effects are a great way to add haste to creatures, and with other sacrifice outlets can be removal and card draw with Shadow.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/775/zulaport-cutthroat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zulaport Cutthroat">Zulaport Cutthroat</a>: While I try to avoid too many staples, to avoid the Cutthroat would be ignoring the fact that there are a lot of black payoffs for creatures dying.</li>
</ul>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog.jpg?itok=BSeB5Tyz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog.jpg?itok=U3lKuBUX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Last and not least, is the blue speedster himself. While he’s missing chilidogs (seriously where is that food token), Sonic here is in Jeskai (blue/white/red) colors and rewards having creatures with haste or flash by growing them.</p>

<p>Sonic wants you going fast, and grows himself and the entire team of speedsters he’s inspired by attacking. He also is instructing them to grab all the rings that they can, as when the speeders hit someone treasure comes in.</p>

<p>Sonic works particularly well with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2082/knuckles-the-echidna" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Knuckles">Knuckles</a>, and alright with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2085/miles-tails-prower" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tails">Tails </a>and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2083/amy-rose" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Amy Rose">Amy</a>, as well as loving his <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2099/lightning-greaves" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Power Sneakers">power sneakers</a> to make anyone trigger his abilities as they gain haste.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/40k/19/vexilus-praetor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vexilus Praetor">Vexilus Praetor</a>: Sonic might be opposed to the Imperium order opposed type, but this flash(y) Warhammer 40k card works incredibly well with him.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/224/errant-and-giada" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Errant and Giada">Errant and Giada</a>: If you’re wanting to focus more on Flash creatures, this pair from New Capenna can join Sonic on his anarchic quest, adding spray painting and angel wings to team Sonic.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/j25/49/gornog-the-red-reaper" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gornog, the Red Reaper">Gornog, the Red Reaper</a>: Sonic is a Warrior, so you can take advantage of Warrior typal cards like Gornog, who also is a perfect fit for Sonic’s trashtalking, calling your opponent’s creatures cowards.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afr/18/guardian-of-faith" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Guardian of Faith">Guardian of Faith</a>: Sonic sometimes needs protection for him and the crew, and the Guardian of Faith will provide just that and a flash body afterwards.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/246/gingerbrute" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gingerbrute">Gingerbrute</a>: This little guy is easy to miss but as a cheap haste creature who is virtually unblockable for 1 mana, he’s a great fit for Sonic.</li>
</ul><hr><p>The Sonic Secret Lair drops look great, and these cards look like they’ll be a lot of fun. You’ll be able to attempt to order them on July 14, at Noon Eastern, or buy one of a limited supply of non-foil versions at local stores that are part of the Wizards Play Network for the mechanically unique cards in the ‘main’ secret lair with the new cards.</p>

Saying goodbye to talented colleagues and friends is painful. These individuals have contributed meaningfully to our studios, our games, and our culture. I want to thank them for the contributions they have made that shaped our journey as a team and as a company.</blockquote><blockquote>Today is a day to support one another. Please know we are working closely with impacted employees to ensure they are treated with respect and have our full support during these difficult times. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your manager or HR support team.</blockquote><blockquote>I also want to share today that Matt Firor has decided to step down from his role as the head of ZeniMax Online Studios, effective July 14. I want to offer heartfelt thanks to Matt for his incredible leadership of ZOS over the last 18 years. As a driving force behind the success of The Elder Scrolls Online, Matt has grown the game into one of the most enduring and beloved MMOs in the industry.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m pleased to announce that Joseph (“Jo”) Burba will be taking over for Matt Firor as the new Studio Director for ZOS. With over 20 years in the industry, his extensive experience in live service multiplayer titles, and a strong background in various roles across ZOS the past thirteen years, Jo is well-prepared to lead the team into its next chapter.</blockquote><blockquote>Matt, Jo, and I will work together to finalize our transition plan – more to come soon. In the meantime, please join me in wishing Matt all the best and congratulating Jo on his new role.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you to all of you for your dedication to Bethesda/ZeniMax, our community, and to each other. </blockquote><blockquote>Jill</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The reference to Matt’s note here is the prior memo Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, sent to Microsoft gaming staff today confirming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">the cancelation of Rare's Everwild</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">the Perfect Dark reboot</a>, as well as the closure of Xbox studio The Initiative.

As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.</blockquote><blockquote>Our overall portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</blockquote><blockquote>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams.</blockquote><blockquote>To everyone across our studios: thank you.

Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</blockquote><blockquote>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</blockquote><blockquote>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental — it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</blockquote><blockquote>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</blockquote><blockquote>Phil</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has made a huge number of cuts to its gaming business since acquiring Activision Blizzard for $69 billion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">It laid off 1,900 staff in January 2024</a>, then made further cuts just a few months later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">when it closed Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>.

On the other end of the scale, TCG Player has <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnm1k?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</a> at a massive 48% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXZv?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's current price</a>, which is very close to MSRP.

Mega's will be returning later this year with the start of the Mega Evolutions era and the end of Scarlet and Violet, so snapping up these top Mega cards before prices go even higher is a wise move. We know how it'll play out, no one will be able to grab the new sets at launch, then the nostalgia will kick in and these cards will skyrocket.

It plays 4K Blu-rays in native 4K UHD (2160p) resolution and supports HDR10, which improves picture brightness.</p><p>It comes with an HDMI cable, but we'd recommend grabbing a second 4K cable if you don't have a spare. That's because the player has two HDMI out ports. The main one is for video and audio, and is the only one you must use, but the second output is dedicated to audio. Separating audio from video output produces a richer, clearer sound, so dual ports are common on dedicated 4K Blu-ray players. It's one of the benefits of using a media player for Blu-rays instead of a game console like the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can grab an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-1-Pack/dp/B014I8SSD0?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Basics 4K HDMI cable for $6</a> right now.</p><p>The UBP-X700U also has a Coaxial SPDIF, which can be connected to speakers, soundbars, and TVs. In- terms of audio support, the UBP-X700U is equipped with high-end audio enhancements, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.</p><p>One of the coolest features of dedicated Blu-ray players like the X700U is picture upscaling. The X700U can read 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and DVDs. When enabled, the built-in tech will enhance the resolution of standard Blu-rays and DVDs.</p><p>While we haven't tested the 2025 edition of the X700U, the upscaling feature on previous iterations was quite impressive. Standard 1080p Blu-rays can look pretty darn close to 4K resolution, and 480p resolution DVDs are substantially better. Honestly, without upscaling tech, DVDs generally look terrible on modern 4K and HD panels. That said, upscaled output varies, and sometimes there are jagged edges or noticeable oddities that won't be appealing to viewers looking for an authentic experience.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">For a higher-end 4K player with built-in streaming and voice assistant capabilities, check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ultra-Assist-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ultra-Assist-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Panasonic DP-UB820-K</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest in today's whirlwind of Microsoft and Xbox-related news is a rumor that <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-feels-great-about-xboxs-2025-slate-of-games-with-more-unannounced-titles-to-come/">Phil Spencer</a>, the current chief executive officer of Microsoft's Gaming division will retire following the launch of Xbox's next-gen console. Sarah Bond, who is currently the head of Xbox at Microsoft, is rumored to take his place.</p>



<div><p>This claim comes from <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1940460596995961190">TheGhostOfHope on X</a>, an account that has previously been accurate regarding Call of Duty news. It's also been slightly corroborated by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retiring-xbox-next-gen/">Insider-Gaming</a>, who claims that Spencer's retirement in the near future is something they have also heard multiple times this year. That said, Phil Spencer is currently 57 years old. He's worked at Microsoft in one form or another since 1988 and joined the Xbox team in 2001. He's been at the head of Xbox since 2014, and in 2022, he was made the chief executive officer of Microsoft Gaming. </p><p>He's climbed the ladder as far as he could, and is near retirement age. That he has one foot out the door isn't the greatest bit of speculation, but it's also not a surprise that this claim would come on the day when there are many changes being announced internally at Microsoft and in its gaming division, even beyond what we've already heard about.</p></div>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>EXCLUSIVE: Phil Spencer will be retiring from his role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming after the launch of the next generation Xbox.</p><p>Phil Spencer is working closely with Sarah Bond and her team to ensure a smooth transition for her take over as CEO of Microsoft Gaming once he… <a href="https://t.co/LDqB4BW8ER">pic.twitter.com/LDqB4BW8ER</a></p></div>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1940460596995961190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Spencer took charge of Xbox after the man he replaced, Dom Mattrick, left a mess of a console launch for him to clean up with the abysmal start to the Xbox One generation. He brought the platform back into the spotlight for positive reasons with his championing of Xbox Game Pass, a service that carried the moniker of 'the best deal in gaming' for years.</p>



<p>More recently, his legacy has been the massive acquisitions he's helped secure, of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-acquired-bethesda-and-all-its-ips-from-elder-scrolls-to-doom/">ZeniMax and Bethesda</a>, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-has-been-acquired-by-microsoft-for-70-billion/">Activision Blizzard King</a>, though what people will remember of those acquisitions are the mass layoffs that followed them, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">today's massive cuts</a>. </p>



<p>Ultimately, Spencer's retirement is more of a question of when, not if. We've been hearing rumors about <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/">Xbox's next-gen hardware</a> for some time now, and we know that there's an <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">Xbox-branded ROG Ally handheld</a> coming at the end of this year. It could be the case that Spencer's retirement will come after the ROG Xbox Ally is out. It could also be that he'll step down after the next proper Xbox console is out. Either way, it seems clear that his time at Microsoft is winding down.</p>

        <p>Together with "several unannounced projects"</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Microsoft have cancelled their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot and closed its development studio The Initiative in the course of this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">scything sacrifices to their actually rather healthy bottom line</a>. In a statement, head of Xbox Matt Booty also confirmed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">the cancellation of Rare's Everwild</a>, alongside "several unannounced projects". </p> <!--more-->
<p>Booty says this "reflects a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape." For context, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast">announced net income of $25.8 billion</a> for their most recent financial quarter, with the Xbox division also posting year-over-year revenue growth.</p>
<p>In an email to staff announcing the wider layoffs, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer echoed Booty in styling them a question of "[making] choices now for continued success in future years", and having "the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities." A reported 9,100 people have been kicked to the curb across Microsoft's operations, but as far as I know, no senior leadership salaries are being "disciplined".</p>
<p>While depressing, the cancellation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> perhaps isn't surprising, given how long it had been in development, and Rare's reported difficulties settling on a direction for the game. The Perfect Dark reboot was also a troubled project. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-making-a-new-perfect-dark">Announced in 2020</a>, it was still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-in-early-development-and-years-from-release-report-claims">"in the earliest stages"</a> of development in 2023, according to one report. But then came a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/perfect-dark-reboot-resurfaces-with-stealth-parkour-and-spy-gadgetry">June 2024 trailer</a> that brought a smile even to Graham Smith's careworn visage. I thought it seemed promising, too, albeit not much like the campy original for N64.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all those affected, and to all those who don't yet know whether they're affected. In other layoff news, Microsoft have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-mmorpg-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-as-part-of-microsofts-layoffs">taken the axe to a new MMO from Elder Scrolls Online developers ZeniMax Online Studios</a>. There are probably more cancellations to be announced.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">The Initiative was formed in 2018 and based in Santa Monica. Billed as a "AAAA" studio, it was led by former Crystal Dynamics studio head Darrel Gallagher and made up of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-studio-the-initiative-adds-alumni-from-re/1100-6469070/" data-ref-id="1100-6469070">developers from Respawn, BioWare, Naughty Dog, and more</a>.

The trailer showed Perfect Dark to be a first-person shooter with immersive sim elements, as series protagonist Joanna Dark used gadgets, stealth, and melee takedowns to complete her objectives, all the while hinting at a greater conspiracy for players to uncover. Despite the gameplay showcase, Perfect Dark did not ever receive a release window.</p><p dir="ltr">A report from shortly before the debut of Perfect Dark's gameplay trailer stated the reboot of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-is-allegedly-in-bad-shape/1100-6523261/" data-ref-id="1100-6523261">spy FPS was in bad shape</a> and that the project hadn't "really come together" despite Crystal Dynamics being brought in to help development.</p><p dir="ltr">Perfect Dark and The Initiative are just a few of the games and studios to be affected by this new wave of layoffs at Microsoft. While at the time of writing The Initiative is the only studio closure announced, other studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online</a>, Blizzard, Forza developer Turn 10 and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/" data-ref-id="1100-6532918">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 developer Raven Software have also seen layoffs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty in an internal email shared by Windows Central confirmed Perfect Dark, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a>, and several other unannounced projects, one of which is reported to be ZeniMax Online's next MMORPG, have all been canceled as part of the layoffs.</p><p>"We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio," Booty writes in the email. "As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment."</p><p>It's just the latest round of layoffs for Microsoft in recent years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Microsoft has laid off thousands of workers across its various divisions in the latest cost-cutting measures taken by the corporation, whose 2024 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar24/index.html">revenue exceeded $245 billion</a>, a 16-percent increase over its 2023 revenue. Though the cuts have impacted several of the company's various divisions, Xbox appears to be hit particularly hard. This represents the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/24/major-xbox-layoffs-reportedly-inbound-for-the-fourth-time-in-18-months">fourth time in 18 months</a> that Microsoft Gaming has laid off workers.</p><p>"We continue to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace," an Xbox spokesperson said in an official comment provided to <em>Game Informer</em>. Alongside the official statement, Xbox PR confirmed that less than 4 percent of Microsoft's global workforce was impacted. However, according to <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/">Microsoft's official reporting</a>, the company employs 228,000 people worldwide, which means 4 percent of the global workforce accounts for more than 9,100 people. Xbox PR also confirmed to <em>Game Informer </em>that the gaming division is impacted, "but not the majority," and stopped short of providing any additional details. When I requested a percentage of Xbox-specific impact, PR could not provide additional context.</p><p>However, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-thousands-xbox-gamning-1236446010/"><em>Variety </em></a>and several other outlets obtained a memo to Xbox employees from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. Notably, Spencer says, "Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger," and "Simply put, we would not be where we are without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted." You can see that in its entirety below.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.&nbsp;</p><p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams. &nbsp;</p><p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey. &nbsp;</p><p>Phil&nbsp;</p></div><p>Subsequently, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs"><em>The Verge</em></a> acquired a memo sent by Xbox president of game content and studios, Matt Booty. In his memo, Booty confirms Xbox is closing down The Initiative, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2018/2018/06/10/new-microsoft-internal-studio-announced-undead-labs-ninja-theory-playground">an all-new first-party studio founded by Xbox in 2018</a> in Santa Monica, California. In 2020, The Initiative revealed it was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2020/2020/12/10/the-initiatives-perfect-dark-announced">working on a new entry in the Perfect Dark franchise</a>, which is now canceled as a result of this closure. Booty also confirms the Twycross, England-based Rare, which Xbox acquired in 2002 and has worked on titles like Sea of Thieves and Viva Piñata, has been impacted by this round of layoffs, and its new IP, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/11/14/rare-works-its-whimsical-magic-in-the-new-world-of-everwild">Everwild</a>, which was announced in 2019, has also been canceled. You can read his full memo below.</p><div><p>Following Phil’s note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units.</p><p>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.</p><p>Our overall portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</p><p>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams.</p><p>To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are.

            <p>The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann is stepping away from his creative involvement in HBO's TV adaptation, calling this a "difficult decision".</p>
<p>In a statement shared on <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781">social media</a>, Druckmann said now season two of The Last of Us had wrapped, he would be moving his "complete focus" back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>. This includes writing and directing the studio's all new game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">as well as Naughty Dog's future projects</a>.</p>

<p>"Co-creating the show has been a career highlight," Druckmann said. "It's been an honour to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons."</p>
<p>Druckmann added he was "deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting" the first The Last of Us game, as well as the ongoing work adapting The Last of Us Part 2 for TV.</p>
<p>The statement noted now was the right time for the Naughty Dog head to step back from the show, before meaningful work on season three begins.</p>

<p>The Last of Us season two aired earlier this year, picking up five years after the events of the season one finale, with Ellie and Joel - played by Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal - now living in Jackson. New cast members this season included Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">Catherine O'Hara as a new character for the show, Gail</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its season two premiere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">The Last of Us was renewed for a third season</a>. At this time, showrunner Craig Mazin said: "We approached season two with the goal of creating something we could be proud of. The end results have exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew."</p>
<p>The showrunner additionally confirmed The Last of Us TV team is working on a four season plan, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">there's "no way" the show's narrative can be wrapped up in only three seasons</a>.</p>

<p>As for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, earlier this year the star of Naughty Dog's next game said she'd received preparation for the role - and specifically the online reaction to it - from Druckmann himself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="PowerA 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/413a1c80020e8/powera-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Like the Switch 1 before it, the Switch 2 will no doubt play host to dozens of third-party controllers over the course of its (hopefully) long lifespan. First out of the gate is PowerA with its Advantage Wired Controller, which I received in a rather jovial <a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/205546/1256186/15385?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fcontrollers%2Fwired%2Fadvantage-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-mario-time-nsgp0527-01%2F" rel="sponsored noopener">Mario Time</a> theme. You can also get a <a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/205546/1256186/15385?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fcontrollers%2Fwired%2Fadvantage-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-mushroom-kingdom-nsgp0526-01%2F" rel="sponsored noopener">Mushroom Kingdom</a> themed variant along with a <a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/205546/1256186/15385?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fcontrollers%2Fwired%2Fadvantage-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-black-nsgp0523-01%2F" rel="sponsored noopener">standard black design</a> – y’know, if you’re boring (joking!).</p>
<p>Boasting a similar layout to Nintendo's official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro Controller</a>, the Advantage pad features offset analogue sticks, two mappable ‘AGL’ and ‘AGR’ buttons on the backside, and a handy headphone jack on the bottom. Really, the only major change in terms of layout is the placement of the start, select, home, GameChat, and capture buttons, which are all housed beneath the d-pad and right analogue stick.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7knoxgl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>To be honest, this alone was enough to throw me off my game; I’d often go to reach toward the centre of the pad to hit the home button, miss, and instead give the image of Mario a good ol’ fondle (Sorry, Mario) before realising the home button is actually down toward the bottom.</p>
<p>Having all of these buttons gathered together in one place <em>is</em> convenient in a way, and it does allow the artwork to really shine if you go for one of the themed variants, but it definitely plays havoc with about thirty years’ worth of muscle memory in which controllers at least housed the start and select buttons in the centre. Why fix what isn’t broken, y’know?</p>

<p>As for those mappable buttons on the back, these don’t function like the ‘GL’ and ‘GR’ buttons on the Pro Controller. Well, they <em>do</em>, but you can’t assign inputs to them quite as easily. With Nintendo’s own offering, you can simply hold down the home button and assign inputs via the quick settings menu, but that isn’t available for PowerA’s controller.</p>
<p>Instead, you need to hold down the additional ‘PRGM’ button on the back until the LED light on the bottom turns dark blue. Then, you hit the button you want to remap and then assign it to either ‘AGL’ or ‘AGR’. It’s pretty manageable in practice and won’t take long to figure out after your first couple of goes, but it would’ve been nice if it supported quick remaps via the settings menu like the Pro Controller.</p>

<p>In terms of build quality, this is very much a budget controller, so it’s <em>incredibly</em> light at just 143g. For comparison, the Pro Controller is 235g, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-controller-the-return-of-the-king">GameCube controller</a> is 210g, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-ultimate-2c-bluetooth-controller-probably-the-best-budget-switch-pad">8bitdo’s Ultimate 2C Controller</a> is also 235g. Combined with the mandatory wired setup, the lightweight design makes lengthy gaming sessions an absolute breeze – no need to worry about discomfort or loss of battery life at all.</p>
<p>On the flip side, it’s… well, <em>too</em> <em>light</em>; to the point where it comes off as being pretty cheap. It feels like there’s barely anything inside the device, and you can tell by just tapping on the exterior with your finger: it sounds very hollow. This is exacerbated by the buttons, all of which give off very loud ‘clicks’ when pressed.</p>
<p>The worst of these are those aforementioned back buttons, which when pressed, sound like they’re reverberating throughout the interior of the controller.</p>

<p>Looking at the analogue sticks in a bit more detail, I don’t have a great deal to complain about here. They’re perfectly smooth and functional, with decent travel and good grip. Again, they sound pretty loud when hitting the casing on the outside, which you’ll definitely notice if you’ve been using the Switch 2's official Pro Controller, but otherwise, they’re good.</p>
<p>I can’t say the same for the d-pad, though. It’s slightly thicker and more rounded than Nintendo’s own offering, and it feels weirdly spongy when pressed. Needless to say, this makes more precise inputs a bit tricker on some retro games, and I wouldn’t even consider using it on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, this isn’t a controller I’d recommend if you’re after a daily driver for the Switch 2. Your best options at the moment are Nintendo’s own Joy-Con 2 or Pro Controller. That said, if you’re after something cheap and cheerful for the player two in your life, this is a perfectly adequate option for you. Yes, it may feel a bit too light for some, the lack of rumble and motion control support is frustrating, and the wired setup sure isn't for everybody, but it’ll come in handy in a pinch if you’re looking for some local multiplayer fun.</p>

<p>We previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-qa-devs-reveal-tons-of-info-on-this-exciting-wuxia-sandbox-rpg/">interviewed</a> Everstone Studio in September 2022, learning that there would be separate single player and multiplayer modes in Where Winds Meet. Indeed, now the developers have confirmed that there are some MMO-style features, such as: </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Build or join a Guild to unlock a wide range of group activities—from intense guild wars to challenging multiplayer dungeons and epic raids. </em></li>



<li><em>Prove your might in competitive duels, or step into a shared, ever-evolving world with thousands of fellow adventurers.</em></li>
</ul>

Spanfeller also couldn't resist taking a shot at the union, praising unions for "add[ing] value to editorial employees’ positions" while also writing that "the core methods that unions work with (or rather against) companies working hard to change with the times is counterproductive to both their membership as well as the companies as a whole.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully Kotaku employees do not care what Jim Spanfeller has to say, because he is no longer their boss!

The cuts to Turn 10 are reportedly very significant, with "nearly 50%" of staff affected, Schreier said.</p><p>Raven Software is the main co-developer on Activision's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> alongside Treyarch. Raven also works on Call of Duty: Warzone. Turn 10 Studios, meanwhile, is known for its work on the Forza Motorsport series, the latest entry of which came out in 2023 for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>In addition to cutting staff, Microsoft has canceled Rare's Everwild and an unannounced MMORPG from ZeniMax Online Studios. The <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Perfect Dark game has been canceled, too</a>, with its developer, The Initiative, closing up shop.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer claimed in a memo to staff that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">the cuts were necessary to propel Xbox forward to a healthy future.</a> "Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger," Spencer said in the wake of the cuts.</p><p>"We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities," he added. "We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come."</p><p>Xbox boss Matt Booty confirmed the cancellations of Perfect Dark and Everwild in a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memo to staff seen by Windows Central</a>, while also saying "several unannounced games" are being axed as well. Booty also confirmed The Initiative is closing up shop, and that all of these initiatives took place to "adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape."</p><p>Despite all of Microsoft's latest layoffs and game cancellations, Booty said Microsoft still has 40+ games in "active development" and a "strong slate" heading into 2026.</p><p>Xbox has been shedding staff on a semi-regular basis for the past few years. After Microsoft closed its deal to buy Activision Blizzard, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">laid off around 1,900 people</a>.

<p>"You want to see something cool?"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Fans of the cult 2015 movie <strong>Turbo Kid</strong>, rejoice! The upcoming Metroidvania sequel to the post-apocalyptic action movie is coming to Switch on 5th August 2025.</p>
<p>We first heard about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/turbo_kid">Turbo Kid</a> in February 2024, before it launched on Steam in April of that year. Now, the wait is over for Switch owners as you'll be able to pedal through the wasteland next month.</p>
<p>Developed by Outerminds, Turbo Kid takes place in a futuristic version of the '80s, where neon lights aren't necessarily a good thing. The world has crumbled; water is hard to come by and the wasteland is ruled by tyranny. So, what do you do? Grab your BMX and get biking.</p>
<p>Accompanied by gorgeous pixel art and a fantastic electronica soundtrack from Le Matos, even if you've never seen or heard of the movie, it's one to keep an eye on. Here's a rundown on what to expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pedal. Slash. Explode. Repeat. -</strong> Rediscover the Metroidvania you should have grown up with. Blaze your trail through a mutant-infested wasteland, upgrade your arsenal of absurdly deadly weapons, and leave a trail of pixelated guts in your wake—all from the seat of your trusty BMX.</p>
<p><strong>BMX Combat -</strong> Who needs a horse when you have a bike with attitude? Call your BMX anytime to boost through maps, unlock shortcuts, smash enemies, or just pull sick tricks. It’s the first true Metroidvania where two wheels matter (no need to fact-check that).</p>
<p><strong>Slash, Shoot, Splat -</strong> Machetes? Of course. Turbo Glove™? Absolutely. From electric blasts to saw blades, your toolkit is overflowing with over-the-top destruction. Rip through enemies with style and turn every screen into a spray of beautifully deranged pixel gore.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom to Explore, Freedom to Wreck -</strong> Set just after the events of the film, forge your path through a twisted world filled with bizarre characters and unexpected choices. Who you help—or hurt—will shape your journey across multiple playthroughs.</p>
<p><strong>All Killer, No Filler -</strong> Love lore? It’s here. Hate it? Skip it. We built Turbo Kid with pure gameplay in mind: no unskippable cutscenes, no walls of text—just fast, fluid action and flexible storytelling that works whether you’re exploring or speedrunning.</p>
</blockquote>
