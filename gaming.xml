            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>IO Interactive is in our good books big time off the back of all the premium-grade assassinating they've let us do across the globe as Agent 47. Now the team has taken up the mantle (the obvious next step for those paying attention) of James Bond himself, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>.</p>
<p>And ahead of the game's <strong>27th March 2026</strong> release date, IO has dropped the very first in a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL2hzHtdW38">dev diary deep dives</a> aimed at exploring this latest Bond adventure alongside interested players. What an absolute high this dev team has been on with the majestic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>, and it looks like it'll continue here.</p>
<p>We've already seen <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/007-first-light-is-more-than-just-spies-and-style-launches-march-2026-on-switch-2">bits and pieces of the game</a>, and we know it's a reimagining of the Bond origin story, featuring a young 007. But this first episode, which you can watch in full above, concentrates on gameplay, as the series as a whole looks to cover the design philosophy and creative processes.</p>

<p>It's interesting stuff, so make sure to check it out for all the new gameplay footage, and discussions about the game's blend of mechanics, which it seems will - in part at least - run with some <strong>Hitman</strong> aspects, developing on stuff such as questioning and observing, and blending into your surroundings. Oh boy, we can't wait.</p>
<p>One example mentioned in the video is "enforcers", meaning NPCs who see through you because they "know" everyone who works in a particular building or area. So this then introduces a new puzzle style to work with.</p>
<p>We also get some tantalising chat about how the devs want to balance thing to give players freedom to approach any situation the way they want as Bond, whilst also making it so the execution of any given plan you hatch can go wildly wrong and need re-tuning on the fly. All the good stuff we hoped we'd hear them speak about when approaching James Bond in their signature style, basically.</p>
<p>Andreas Krogh, the gameplay director on 007: First Light also mentions new techniques they've come up with by "marrying" Bond's style with their take on stealth. So you have some new deescalation options, such as bluffing. Here we see that Bond can smooth talk his way out of a scenario where the only option for 47 would be to pan somebody in the head or run away.</p>

<p>Thomas Pulluelo, the game's level designer, also pops up to show how the rather nice looking environs on display are designed so that players can see opportunities more easily and naturally. So hopefully fewer shiny pipes and yellow footholds, and more feeling like you did it all yourself. Nice.</p>
<p>There's are some fantastic sequences (so do make sure to check out the full vid) that show off the amazingly brutal action and combat we can expect in March of next year. This young Bond does some vicious CQC, he charges down foes and gets stuck in like a proper trained killer. Expect plenty of quick switching between fist fights, shooting with fancy guns, stealth action and lots of crashing of expensive cars and then reloading the game.</p>
<p>Now, speaking of cars, where did we put the keys to our motor? It's been leaking oil slicks and randomly firing machine gun bullets out of its hood again. Honestly, Q's been right off their game recently.</p>
<p>If you're looking forward to 007: First Light, make sure you check out <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/why-007-first-light-is-the-most-exciting-game-of-2026">Push Square's preview</a> from back in September; they might be more excited than us!</p>

<p><em>Looking forward to 007: First Light? Think IO's style suits 007 down to the ground like we do? Let us know!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pathea Games, the studio behind the <em>My Time </em>series of cozy life sims, has announced <em>The God Slayer</em>, a steampunk action RPG set in a bustling Eastern-inspired metropolis.</p><p>The game was originally revealed as part of PlayStation's China Hero Project initiative back in 2023, but now, Pathea has released two brand new trailers that show off <em>The God Slayer</em>'s unique setting and action-heavy gameplay.</p><p><em>The God Slayer </em>looks like it's taking a pretty different direction to Pathea's usual fare; it'll cast you as Cheng, who is an Elemancer, a warrior "infused with elemental powers and a heart of vengeance". You'll set out on a quest to avenge your loved ones and oppose the tyrannical Celestials.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>The God Slayer </em>probably isn't what you're used to from Pathea Games.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Per the game's brand new Steam page, <em>The God Slayer </em>features a rather nifty elemental system in which the elements will interact with each other in realistic ways; fire, for instance, will burn wood, while steam will rise from boiling water and earth can block your path.</p><p>As an Elemancer, you'll be able to use the elements to your advantage in combat; the gameplay trailer (thanks, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhiXXsDsWTg" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">IGN</a>) shows the player using ice to freeze human enemies after an alleyway has been flooded with water, as well as using rock magic to hurl stones at encroaching demonic enemies.</p><p>Of course, we're likely a while away from <em>The God Slayer</em>'s release; it doesn't have an official release date yet, so what we're seeing in these trailers could be fairly heavily choreographed to show the game at its best.</p><p>Still, if you want to get a sense for <em>The God Slayer</em>'s setting and vibe, you can check out the debut CG trailer right here.</p>
<p>As well as <em>The God Slayer</em>, Pathea is also hard at work on upcoming cozy life sim <em>My Time at Evershine</em>, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-skipping-early-access" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ba8c6a72-2d0f-4000-bc5a-2dc8cdc24ff3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">skipping Early Access</a> after its Kickstarter managed to raise over $2.5 million dollars late last year.</p><p>You can wishlist Pathea Games' <em>The God Slayer </em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536510/The_God_Slayer/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">right here</a> to keep up with its progress.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech Failed to Clear Racing Wheel at Black Friday, Now Liquidating Stock at Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-failed-to-clear-racing-wheel-at-black-friday-now-liquidating-stock-at-record-low-2000650485</link>
            <guid>1372783</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cyber Monday ended three days ago, and Black Friday seems like a long time ago but Amazon still has this bundle at its lowest price ever: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6208/">Logitech G923 racing wheel with pedals and the separate shifter usually costs $459, but right now it’s only $333</a>.</p>
<p>This is a g<strong>reat gift for people who love racing games</strong> or who are tired of playing Gran Turismo and Forza with a regular controller that doesn’t feel like real driving. The <em>TrueForce</em> force feedback system connects directly to game audio engines to make vibrations and resistance that match what’s happening on screen and it fixes the problem of not being able to feel what you’re seeing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6208/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How TrueForce Makes Sim Racing More Fun</h2>
<p>The<strong> G923’s force feedback technology processes game sound up to 4000 times per second</strong> to make the wheel vibrate: You can feel the texture of different road surfaces, the rumble of engine vibrations, and the effect of hitting curbs or going off-track through steering resistance that changes all the time. This is different from older force feedback systems that only reacted to directional forces like crashes or understeer as they missed the small things that make driving feel like you’re in control of the car. The dual-motor system has enough torque to make it feel like you’re steering a heavy load when you’re going fast around a corner, but it still lets you turn smoothly when you’re going slowly.</p>



<p>The <strong>wheel can turn 900 degrees</strong> which is the same amount that real car steering does which means that you are turning the wheel the same amount that you would in a real car, not making big movements. The rim is wrapped in real leather for grip and durability that lasts through long marathon races and the hand-stitching gives it a high-end look that cheap rubber or synthetic materials can’t match. Steel paddle shifters behind the wheel make a satisfying click when you change gears. They are also in a place where your fingers naturally rest while racing. The steel shaft that runs through the center of the wheel hides the force feedback motors which makes a strong connection that sends feedback exactly without any dead zones or flex.</p>
<p>The <strong>pedal set has a progressive brake spring</strong> that makes it harder to push down on the brake pedal, just like real hydraulic brakes that need more pressure to stop faster. This progressive resistance makes it easier to control how hard you brake, which is very important when you want to brake as late as possible without locking the wheels. The throttle and clutch pedals have lighter springs to make them easier to use, and all three pedals have rubber faces with texture that keep your feet from slipping when you drive aggressively.</p>



<p>The <strong>separate shifter makes the experience go from good to great</strong> by giving you a real H-pattern with six speeds and reverse: You can put the shifter exactly where it feels right for you in relation to your wheel and seat because it mounts separately with a desk clamp or screws. The metal shaft and gear mechanism make mechanical clicks and resistance that feel good to use. The whole thing is strong enough to handle rough shifting during competitive racing.</p>
<p>You can <strong>use this with PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Mac</strong> so you don’t have to stick with one platform if you upgrade your hardware or switch between systems. The wheel connects to your computer or console through USB and gets its power from them and you don’t need any extra power supplies or complicated setup beyond putting it on your desk.</p>
<p>This $126 off the bundle is a big savings compared to buying the wheel and shifter separately, where you’d usually pay full price for each part. For less than the cost of the wheel alone at regular price, you get professional-grade sim racing hardware that real racers use in competitive leagues.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung 2025 B-Series Soundbar Is Now Cheaper Than Budget Earbuds as It Still Holds Its Black Friday Low Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-b-series-soundbar-2025-black-friday-low-cheaper-than-budget-earbuds-2000650185</link>
            <guid>1372777</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your TV’s internal speakers don’t offer an immersive sound experience and you’re done rewinding content just to hear what was said, it’s high time you invest in a solid soundbar. The best options out there push audio that surrounds you, plus offer multiple listening modes for different needs, and now is a great time to nab one without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6200/">The latest Samsung B-Series soundbar, which comes with a built-in subwoofer, is currently down to just $100 at Amazon, after a nice 29% discount.</a> You’re saving a nice $40 on it, and it’s also the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while. Pick yours up fast, because such discounts don’t last forever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6200/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Room-Filling Sound</h2>
<p>This compact soundbar sits nicely on the console of your TV and is minimal enough to blend into any entertainment setup. Those who prefer a cleaner setup can mount it on the wall just as well. It connects to your display (or other devices) using Bluetooth, so there are no cables or complicated steps to worry about. Once connected, it pushes bold, room-filling sound that surrounds you. It won’t feel like the audio is just being blasted from the speaker, but instead, coming from all corners and every direction. The included subwoofer takes care of the bass, bringing action-packed scenes and even your favorite tunes to life. Watching a classic action movie? You’ll feel like the fights are happening right there in your living room. Planning a horror show night? Be ready for footsteps creeping up from behind, and don’t blame us if the entire thing feels a lot more spookier!</p>
<p>Dialogues get a boost, too. It does a good job of picking up on everything that’s being said, from screams in the Real Housewives to subtle whispers in the Stranger Things. You won’t have to rewind a scene repeatedly anymore. Moreover, sound doesn’t distort at higher levels, which is great for when you’re using the soundbar to vibe to your favorite songs. There’s also a Do Not Disturb mode built right in, which automatically reduces the volume. This is one ideal for those late-night streaming sessions where you don’t want to wake the entire house up.</p>



<p>Setting things up is straightforward, and managing everything is even simpler. The soundbar can be used with your Samsung TV remote, letting you adjust power, volume, and sound effects easily. To get started, put the soundbar in the pairing mode using the input button on it. Then, turn your TV on and head to Settings &gt; Sound &gt; Sound Output &gt; Bluetooth Speaker List. Look for your soundbar in the list, and press Pair and Connect. It should be ready to use within a few minutes! All in all, if you’ve been wanting to grab a solid Bluetooth soundbar to enjoy better sound during your favorite movies and series but couldn’t pick one up during Black Friday, now is a good time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6200/">This option would normally run you around $140, but you can grab it for just $100 today</a>. You’ll also enjoy free delivery with your purchase. Just note that it’s selling out fast, so the discount, as well as the stock, won’t be around for long. Snap it up quick, because once the deal is gone, it might not come back anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Treyarch Pushing SBMM In Black Ops 7 Due To “Increased Engagement”]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/treyarch-pushing-sbmm-in-black-ops-7-due-to-increased-engagement/</link>
            <guid>1372774</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought the Skill-Based Matchmaking conversation was going anywhere, you might want to boil the kettle. Not only is Treyarch adamant about having SBMM, but Black Ops 7’s playlist options will now feature SBMM modes more prominently.</p>



<p>The letters ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sbmm-cod-creator-debunk-conspiracies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM</a>‘ will forever be synonymous with FPS games. Skill-based matchmaking plays a huge role in modern-day matchmaking, and there was a lot of interest around Black Ops 7 after Treyarch revealed that it would feature a greater emphasis on ‘Open Matchmaking.’</p>



<p>Slowly but surely, the developer might be backtracking.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-season-1-moving-standard-matchmaking-to-featured">Black Ops 7 Season 1 Moving Standard Matchmaking To Featured</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Was it always going to happen? Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since launch, the Standard Matchmaking playlist option—which emphasizes SBMM—has been a regular playlist option. This will change with Black Ops 7 Season 1.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-patch-notes-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 patch notes</a> have revealed some interesting notes on SBMM:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve continued to see increased engagement with Standard Moshpit, so we’ll be featuring it in the Featured tab for players who prefer an experience with more similarly skilled opponents. With the main tab changing to Featured, the other tab will now become Party Games, which will include Prop Hunt, Sharpshooter, One in the Chamber, and Gunfight at the launch of Season 01, as well as the debut of Sticks &amp; Stones and Gun Game in Week 2.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In layman’s terms, players are apparently playing modes that prioritize SBMM for matchmaking. This is more player engagement here; therefore, Treyarch is now rewarding this by adding Standard Moshpit to the featured playlist—making it a center-stage attraction.</p>



<p>There have been suggestions that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-findings-show-sbmm-might-not-be-as-open-as-advertised/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM might not be as open as advertised</a> in Black Ops 7. This ‘Featured’ move doesn’t necessarily support this theory, but it shows that SBMM is becoming prevalent in Call of Duty once again.</p>



<p>Is this Treyarch u-turning on the idea of moving Black Ops 7 more toward open matchmaking? If you have thoughts on this or SBMM in general, head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> for more gaming conversations.</p>

            <guid>1372771</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Death Ball monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Gems, Crystals, Cosmic Orbs and much more.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of intense anime-style battles and the popular gym class game dodgeball, then you need to check out Death Ball immediately. Death Ball is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sols-rng-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> dodgeball game where players use an energy ball instead of a traditional ball. This is done not by throwing the ball as would usually be the case, but by using various abilities and movement skills. Players must try to parry the ball in order to hit an opponent instead of trying to catch it, as each hit and change of direction increases the speed and power of the ball.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Players initially queue into a massive arena with multiple other players, where the main objective is to be the last player standing after all of the competitors have been eliminated. The game also tends to get harder and harder as it progresses into the latest stages, making things like timing, reactions and general positioning that much more important. With a variety of Champions to choose from, each with varied abilities, Death Ball can offer hours of entertainment. Stronger weapons and Champions can be unlocked using the in-game currencies, and one way to get more of them is by using the following Death Ball codes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-death-ball-codes">How To Get More Death Ball Codes</h2>



<p>Death Ball codes are usually released either through the game’s official Discord server or through the Roblox game page. However, tracking both of these regularly can be a hassle, and moreover, they never notify the players when any of the previously released codes expire. That’s why we recommend that all players keep this page bookmarked, as we update the article as soon as any new codes drop, while expired codes are also promptly removed from the active codes list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

But that's not part of Ubisoft's plans, according to the Prince of Persia account <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1996323369080250412" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The official social media channel poured cold water on a fan account speculating that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time will show up at The Game Awards on December 11. "Sorry to disappoint but can confirm Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time won't be at [The Game Awards] this year," the Prince of Persia account states.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1996323369080250412" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Sorry to disappoint, but can confirm Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time won't be at TGA this year 💖</p>  — Prince of Persia™ (@princeofpersia) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeofpersia/status/1996323369080250412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In June, Ubisoft noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-once-again-promises-that-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-on-the-way/1100-6532466/">the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake is set to launch by March 31</a>--the end of the company's current fiscal year. That was the second time <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-launch-by-march-2026-ubisoft-says/1100-6531547/">Ubisoft stuck to that release timeline</a>, too. However, it's been a bumpy road for the game since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-revealed-dur/1100-6482030/">being announced in 2020</a>. For instance, in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-changes-developers/1100-6503046/" data-ref-id="1100-6503046">the Prince of Persia remake switched developers to Ubisoft Montreal</a>, the original team behind the Sands of Time series. Before that, Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai were working on the title.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time released in 2003 on PC, PS2, GameCube, and Xbox. From a marketing perspective, Ubisoft might want to focus on The Rogue Prince of Persia, as <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1996263159556878586" rel="nofollow ">it's coming to Switch and Switch 2</a> on December 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, there are other questions swirling around The Game Awards. The biggest one relates to a statue that showed up in a desert, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">people guessing the teaser relates to Diablo 4 or a new God of War</a>. However, there's been pushback that neither is correct.</p>

Seriously. Many creators overlook how crucial solid audio is. Whether you’re shooting laid-back vlogs from your couch or doing those man-on-the-street style interviews, viewers will pick up on your sound quality. They might not consciously notice it, but something about your video will just feel a bit lackluster. In most cases, it’s the audio. Fix that immediately with a high-quality lavalier mic that’s currently discounted. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/">At the moment, the DJI Mic Mini two-person vlog bundle is 50% off, cutting the price from $119 to just $59. Personally, saving $60 sounds pretty great to me.</a></p>
<p data-start="918" data-end="1144">These wireless mics are low-profile yet don’t compromise on performance. They’re ultralight, weighing only 10 grams. They stay discreet and look clean on camera, plus they’re simple to get working and comfortable to wear.</p>
<p data-start="1146" data-end="1306">Each microphone can deliver crisp audio to the receiver at a maximum transmission distance of up to 400 meters. That’s a quarter mile range.</p>

<h2 data-start="1146" data-end="1306">Powerful Noise Cancelling</h2>
<p data-start="1308" data-end="1749">The DJI Mic Minis are excellent for recording in energetic outdoor settings like crowded conventions or busy streets. This is thanks to their pro-level noise cancellation. You can choose between two intensity modes. Basic works well for quiet indoor spaces, while the strong mode is ideal for loud outdoor areas. They can also automatically limit audio levels when sound gets too loud. This prevents clipping and can be a huge help once you begin editing.</p>
<p data-start="1308" data-end="1749">Switching up these settings is simple enough. Just tap the power button to enable or disable noise cancellation. In order to swap between the two modes of Strong or Basic can be done using the DJI Mimo app (supported on iPhone and Android).</p>
<p data-start="1751" data-end="1905">The DJI Mic Minis integrate seamlessly with your wider DJI OsmoAudio setup. You can pair them with an Osmo Action 5 Pro without even needing the receiver.</p>


<p data-start="1907" data-end="2139">Each transmitter and receiver has a long-lasting battery so you can film all day if needed. The DJI Mic Minis provide up to 10 hours of operation on a single charge, making them great for livestreams or long interviews. If your content only has one speaker, then you effectively have 20 hours of operation since you can always swap to the other. Heck, you can get even more than that since realistically you can start charging your first after it dies while using the second.</p>
<p data-start="1907" data-end="2139">As an additional add-on, you can pick up the DJI Mic Mini charging case. This can house both transmitters and the receiver, providing you with up to 48 hours of operation.</p>
<p data-start="2141" data-end="2261" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/">Right now, you can grab this bundle with two DJI Mic Mini microphones and the DJI receiver for only $59, saving you $60.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/anbernic-rg34xxsp-retro-handheld-review-the-gba-sp-returns/</link>
            <guid>1372729</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Sometimes modern devices are designed to inspire the most intense nostalgia possible. While many of the big-hitters have launched mini renditions of their older consoles to fill that gap, in the handheld space it’s generally been left to companies like Miyoo, ModRetro and Analogue to fill that gap. One of the clear big hitters here is Anbernic, and with their snappily named <a href="https://www.litnxt.com/products/litnxt-anbernic-rg34xxsp-3-4-inch-retro-handheld-game-console">RG34XXSP</a> they’ve released one of the best Game Boy Advance SP-like devices since… well, the original.</p>
<p>To all intents and purposes, the RG34XXSP looks and feels like a Game Boy Advance SP. It tickles all of those primary coloured gaming memories, instantly taking you back to the incredible hours spent with games like Advance Wars and Fire Emblem. However, as a modern emulation device, the Anbernic RG34XXSP is capable of much, much more.</p>



<p>Our review unit came in glorious yellow, and really, all it needs is a Pikachu face emblazoned on the top, and it’d be perfect. The main body of the case is made of sturdy plastic, while the folding metal hinge ensures that the top screen panel feels sturdy and locked in place. Compared to Miyoo’s recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/04/miyoo-flip-v2-review-a-dose-of-handheld-nintendo-nostalgia/">Flip</a>, the RG34XXSP feels much more rugged and sturdy, and where I was loathe to take that anywhere without popping it in its hard case, the RG35XXSP has bounced around in my bag for weeks without any noticeable side effects.</p>
<p>Opening it up reveals the 3.4-inch IPS screen in a 3:2 ratio which perfectly matches the original GBA screen. It’s clear and bright, with a good colour balance that feels authentic to the original games it’s displaying. With a 720×480 resolution, it’s a huge jump from the original Game Boy Advance’s 240×160, which makes it all the better for emulating more powerful consoles than simply the one it’s physically imitating, although the screen ratio means that consoles aiming for the 4:3 standard will have pillarboxed frames either side of the display.</p>

<p>There’s more controls here than you would have found on a GBA or SP. There’s a great-feeling D-pad, which instantly stands out as your key point of interaction with the handheld, while each of the four face buttons gives a strong, meaningful click with every press.</p>
<p>There are also two inset analogue sticks here, which are ideal if you want to emulate anything past the 16-bit era. They feel pretty good considering their short travel distance, but they would definitely have benefited from some grip or textured surface, just to help during more action-packed moments.</p>
<p>Around the outside edge, you’ll find four shoulder/trigger buttons, as well as a USB-C/OTG port and a mini-HDMI out for playing on a big screen. Additional controls come in the form of a volume rocker, reset switch and power button, with the front of the device rounded out by a 3.5mm headphone socket. Anbernic have packed everything you could want in here, and they’ve done it to a higher spec than their immediate rivals in the £50 price range.</p>

<p>There’s magnets installed in the top screen panel, so not only is the RG34XXSP capable of closing extremely firmly, it also initiates a sleep mode, letting you simply close your game when you want to take a break, before flipping it open to continue later on. This is a great quality of life feature, and one which made a huge difference during our testing, as it lets you jump in and out of games at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>The small form factor also helped with that, and the RG34XXSP has become my go-to device to travel with over the last month, taking up virtually no space in my bag or hand luggage, and it even fits into your actual pocket. Imagine that! It feels genuinely great to take it out on the train and be able to leap back into one of your favourite games of yesteryear. The original Game Boy Advance SP remains one of my favourite consoles of all time, and the RG34XXSP hits all the right notes in bringing a similarly flavoured device to 2025.</p>
<p>To be clear, you should only be emulating games that you already own, and emulation devices like this are just a means to collect and categorise your libraries. With that out of the way, it’s great to see the RG34XXSP capable of emulating devices up to and including the Sony PSP and Sega Dreamcast. Some titles for both of those platforms will push it pretty hard – I found things slowing down occasionally in Marvel Vs Capcom 2 when there were a lot of characters on screen – but overall, the RG34XXSP dispenses itself well thanks to its quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 chipset and 2GB of LPDDR4 RAM.</p>

<p>Really, I can imagine a lot of people using it to return to their Game Boy Advance libraries, and it’s ideal for that, particularly with two micro-SD slots for taking every game you own with you. I obviously went straight back to playing Fire Emblem, followed swiftly by Advance Wars, and the included Retroarch software worked perfectly for emulating both titles. Retroarch is also the avenue to various screen filters that might get the games looking more like you remembered them, instead of the crisp upscaled look that we’re now more accustomed to.</p>
<p>The Anbernic launcher that sits over the top of it all is basic, but functional, and if you’re not interested in tinkering with it, it’ll do everything you could want in terms of curating your emulation experience. Where the Anbernic RG34XXSP is weaker is in its speaker setup. The mono speaker at the centre of the front panel can certainly pump out plenty of volume, but it’s pretty harsh and can become distorted at higher volumes. It also seems to emphasise any emulation issues, and at times the overall audio was pretty poor compared to the rest of the package. It’s fine for quiet, everyday use, but I’d recommend using a wired pair of headphones to get the best out of the audio.</p>
<p>The RG34XXSP’s main competitor is undoubtedly the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/04/miyoo-flip-v2-review-a-dose-of-handheld-nintendo-nostalgia/">Miyoo Flip</a>, and while I think I’d give the edge to Miyoo’s stock OS – LITNXT’s own version – the build quality of the RG34XXSP is a clear step above Miyoo’s. However, if you’re looking to play titles beyond the Game Boy Advance’s extensive library, the Flip’s 3.5inch screen is bigger, and boasts a more traditional 4:3 ratio.</p>
<p><em>Thank you to <a href="https://www.litnxt.com/?gad_source=1">LITNXT</a> for providing our review unit for the Anbernic RG34XXSP.</em></p>

            <p>Revived <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y survivabuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> got a fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-early-access-release-date-set-in-stone-for-january-2026-but-its-devs-admit-the-first-impression-will-be-rough">early access release date of January 13th</a> the other week. However, the team behind it how now confirmed you shouldn't expect to see it hit Steam at that point, with the game's executive director not seeing the need to knock on Valve's pipe-laden door yet and keen to avoid an early access spent drowning in negative reviews.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This comes from the first <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq">post adressing frequently asked questions</a> that Hytale's current devs have put out since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">securing the rights to it from Riot</a>. Right off the bat, executive director Patrick 'Lyall' Derbic addressed whether the game'll be hitting the Steam platform.</p>
<p>"No, not initially," he wrote. "We want to spend our time in early access working with the community and improving the game, rather than overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren't as well-informed yet about what we are doing. Steam is a great marketing tool, but one that we might never need. This doesn't mean we will never be on Steam - just that we do not see the necessity of it yet."</p>
<p>On one hand, working with a more concentrated group of players you can grill for in-depth thoughts on the game early doors sounds like a good plan, especially since the team have been very clear what folks will be getting on day one will be quite rough around the edges and have lots of room to grow. On the other, there's perhaps an argument that initially ducking criticism from folks outside of those likely already keen on the proposition of Hytale could potentially lead to blind spots in terms of helping it appeal to a wider audience down the line.</p><p>In any case, I'm not a game developer and certainly appreciate the tough task any game nowadays faces in carving out a reputation for itself that can attract eyeballs and avoid being buried amid the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-next-fests-have-grown-into-humongous-battle-royales-and-june-2025s-was-no-different">massive avalanche of games</a> constantly competing for players' hours.</p>
<p>The rest of the FAQ post saw Derbic acknowledge things like the fact the team are working on getting region-specific pricing up and running for "a limited number of countries to start with", with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-gets-a-cheap-price-point-all-because-its-devs-dont-think-the-game-is-good-yet">$20 being the base price worldwide for now</a>. Extra cosmetics will be added, but there'll be no pay-to-win offerings as far as monetisation goes. Finally, pets, animal taming, and fishing are all in the works, but won't be there in January.</p>
<p>The full thing's also worth giving a read if you're unsure about the different permutations of the three different editions of Hytale being sold out of the gate. Derbic and co have also shared the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-hardware-requirements">hardware specs</a> you'll need to meet to comfortably get the sandbox up and running on your machine.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-jbl-go-4-tiny-bluetooth-speaker-leftover-cyber-monday-stock-goes-to-record-low-2000650147</link>
            <guid>1372723</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon kept some Cyber Monday deals running on select items including this JBL Go 4 that punches way above its weight class in the sound department. The speaker <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6199/">is currently down to $39 from its regular $49 price, which is an all-time low</a> that makes it an easy pick for personal use or as a <strong>holiday gift at a reasonable budget</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6199/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How JBL Made a Small Package Sound Big</h2>
<p>The sound engineering that went into this small speaker is all about<strong> getting bass response that usually needs much bigger drivers and enclosures</strong>. JBL tuned the parts inside to make what they call <em>“punchy bass”</em> which means that you can feel the low-end frequencies instead of just hearing the tinny mids and highs. A single driver and passive radiators in the speaker boost the bass without needing extra power or space. This means you get fuller sound from something that weighs less than half a pound. The JBL Go 4 is great for times when you want to hear real music instead of the thin, high-pitched sound that most ultra-portable speakers make.</p>



<p>With moderate volumes,<strong> the battery lasts up to seven hours of continuous playback</strong>&nbsp;which is enough for most day trips or outdoor activities without having to find an outlet. The <em>Playtime Boost</em> feature adds two more hours by changing the audio processing to use less power. However, you will lose some volume and bass depth in exchange for longer battery life. This is helpful when you’re at the beach or camping and remember you forgot to charge it the night before and it gives you enough power to keep the music going until sunset.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP67 certification</strong> means that the speaker can stay submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes and is also completely dustproof. After a day at the beach, you can rinse it off under the tap, use it in the shower, or leave it by the pool without worrying about splashes ruining the electronics. The tough outside is made of recycled plastic and has a fabric grille that protects the driver while letting sound through clearly. This environmentally friendly construction doesn’t make the speakers less durable; the materials can handle drops and bumps that would break less sturdy speakers.</p>



<p>With the $10 off, this speaker is now cheap enough that you might buy it on a whim instead of thinking about it first. For less than the price of good wired headphones, you get IP67 protection, surprisingly strong bass, and a battery that lasts all day. JBL built their name on providing high-quality sound at reasonable prices. This is the lowest price ever for a portable speaker that doesn’t sound like a toy and it’s easy to grab one and try it out for yourself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Access to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has been banned in Russia, as the country's authorities have deemed it a host of "LGBT propaganda."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Russia's communications watchdog Roskomnadzor announced the move last night, news agency <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a> has reported, blocking the giant gaming platform to Russian citizens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement explaining its decision, Roskomnadzor said it had removed the ability to access Roblox as it was "rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By many measures the biggest game in the world, with more than 151.1 million daily active users, Roblox hosts countless player-made game experiences — including breakout hits such as Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot that enjoy player counts bigger than anything on Steam. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear exactly which games on the Roblox platform have prompted Russia's ire, though the country has taken an increasingly strict approach to any content featuring LGBT themes in recent years. In 2013, Russia implemented the Law for the Purpose of Protecting Children from Information Advocating a Denial of Traditional Family Values, which was designed to mark LGBT content as contradictory to traditional Russian values.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone," a spokesperson for the game said in a statement issued to Reuters. "[Roblox has] a deep commitment to safety and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Russia isn't the first country to block access to Roblox, though countries such as Iraq and Turkey which have also banned the game have done so citing concerns over child safety fears. Amid ballooning player numbers, and a user base primarily made up of users under 18, Roblox has spent the past year belatedly adding various features designed to improve its user safety, following a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-bans-players-who-gang-raped-a-seven-year-olds-avatar" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">string of reports</a> that have <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/05/girl-6-invited-sex-room-playing-childrens-video-game-roblox-7605376/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlighted cases</a> where <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users were contacted</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-reported-over-13000-incidents-to-the-national-center-for-missing-and-exploited-children-in-2023" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">groomed by adults</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Roblox announced plans to require facial age checks for all chat communication, with an aim to limit communication between minors and adults.

			<p>The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and other global economic powers are having a significant impact on the production costs of various devices, including gaming consoles such as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, which are primarily assembled in China. With the very concrete risk that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/two-of-the-biggest-dram-suppliers-are-skeptical-about-increasing-production/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the current massive price increases for components like RAM</strong></a> may cause console prices to increase further, Microsoft is taking a significant step to mitigate these risks by expanding production in Vietnam.</p>



<p>The evidence for this crucial production shift comes directly from regulatory documents. As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/foxconn-subsidiary-plans-expand-production-vietnam-document-shows-2025-12-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Reuters</strong></a>, Foxconn subsidiary Fushan Technology is seeking permission to expand production in Vietnam to produce up to<strong> 4.8 million Xbox gaming devices annuall</strong>y. This likely includes not only consoles, but also accessories like controllers and headsets, which all carry the same price increase risk as consoles.</p>



<p>Microsoft isn't the only one, reportedly. In a related document, it's revealed that China's Luxshare-ICT is planning to produce up to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">4.5 million game consoles per year</strong> at a factory in Vietnam, starting from 2026. The brands of the devices haven't been confirmed, so it could be any of the three big manufacturers, as all are facing the same global trade challenges that have led to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">an unprecedented price increase of gaming systems, years after their debut.</a></strong></p>



<p>Amidst price increases for all components due to trade tensions that show no signs of easing and the increasing demand for AI data centers, mitigating the risk of price increases for gaming devices in any possible way is the most sensible thing to do for all manufacturers, not just Microsoft for its Xbox devices. </p>



<p>With the<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/"> <strong>next console generation looming ahead</strong></a>, expanding production outside of China may also prevent gaming systems from reaching exorbitant prices, which would take away one of the advantages gaming consoles have over gaming PCs, including those targeting the same audience, such as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-machine-console-price-not-much-higher/">the upcoming Steam Machine</a>:</strong> affordability.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has released the Fallout 76: Burning Springs update across all platforms. The patch updates the game to version 1.7.22.12, with download sizes of roughly 28.8 GB on Steam, 39.3 GB on Microsoft Store, 41.9 GB on Xbox, and 40.8 GB on PlayStation.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As previously covered</a>, it's a major free expansion for the online survival action game Fallout 76 that opens a new Ohio‑set region west of Point Pleasant, introduces the Ghoul from the award-winning Amazon Prime Video TV show as a recurring character, and adds a full bounty‑hunting system plus new public events and creatures.</p>



<p>According to the developers, Fallout 76: Burning Springs is one of the largest map expansions released since the game's launch in 2018, probably the biggest since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wastelanders-country-roads-take-me-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2020's Wastelanders</a>. It is accessed by crossing the Point Pleasant bridge into a rust‑scarred, war‑torn area of rural Ohio, which was never previously featured in any Fallout game. The region includes new wildlife and fishing content, including creatures like the Radhog that can be adopted as a C.A.M.P. pet, plus new fish species and at least one “local legend” catch.</p>



<p>The update adds a new questline that begins when level 30+ players tune into the Ohio Distress Signal; this story centers on Highway Town, its Last Resort saloon hub, and the ruthless Rust King, setting up a multi‑update narrative arc that will keep players engaged for some time. The patch also adds two new public events (Gearin’ Up and Sinkhole Solutions); both are located in the Burning Springs region and are built around the new enemy groups and environmental hazards there.</p>



<p>The patch applies a broad pass to weapon balance, legendary mods (including some new ones), and certain enemy behaviors. C.A.M.P. budgets have also been loosened, as several decorative and functional items receive lower budget costs.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 76: Burning Springs Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ_SER3SwSQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Arguably, the highlight of Fallout 76: Burning Springs is the new Bounty Hunting feature, which lets players pick up basic Grunt Hunt and harder Head Hunt contracts in the Last Resort. Grunt Hunts target 1‑star Legendary enemies that can scale up to 2‑ and 3‑star as the player successfully completes more hunts, making them a structured Legendary farming path. Head Hunts, on the other hand, put the player on the trail of named targets tracked through the Challenges tab, with unique cosmetic and item rewards tied to specific bounties. Bounty Hunting is essentially a major new progression pillar, designed to be revisited for long‑term gear chasing.</p>



<p>The hook is that the quest giver is none other than The Ghoul, the popular character played by actor Walton Goggins in the TV series, who did all the voice work for the digital version as well. In the game, The Ghoul is overwhelmed by these bounty contracts and asks the player to step in and help clear them as they appear. Fallout 76: Burning Springs is neatly timed to release just ahead of the highly anticipated second season of the Prime Video show (<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due on December 17</a>), where Lucy and The Ghoul pursue Lucy's father into New Vegas.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-76-update-launches-milepost-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milepost Zero</a> is closing down in the Skyline Valley region. The rewards that were previously available when protecting Milepost Zero caravans are now spread across the Wasteland. The developers reckon that Bounty Hunting delivers the same promise of on-demand content with legendary enemies and great rewards more succinctly and satisfyingly. They also teased 'exciting plans' for the Skyline Valley region.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 76 - Season 23: Blood x Rust" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/70-xouZLce0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Fallout 76: Burning Springs lands right alongside the launch of Season 23, Blood x Rust, featuring a new scoreboard themed around raiders, scrapyards, and Deathclaws. The board is packed with Raider themed C.A.M.P. items, workbenches, and décor, such as raiderized workstations, metal braziers, junk‑metal fences, and scrap‑themed prefabs, aimed at giving camps a freshly pillaged look. Multiple cosmetics and utility items reference the new Burning Springs content, including bounty‑hunter icons, Rust‑themed player titles, and props tied to the Ohio region's Dino Golf attraction.</p>

            <p>The ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">chaos in RAM production</a>, with mass shortages jacking up street prices to are-you-joking levels, now has a major manufacturer casualty. <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business">Micron have announced</a> the end of Crucial, their consumer brand for PC memory and SSDs – and likely a familiar name to gaming PC builders who’ve been hooking up their storage drives and slotting in their RAM sticks for decades.</p>
<p>"Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments," wrote Micron’s Executive VP and Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana.</p>
<p>In other words, there’s a whole bunch of AI data centres cropping up, and Crucial are rudely hogging memory hardware that could be put to more profitable use than merely supplying grassroots interests in computing and games. Important uses! Like generating a thumbnail image of Mr Beast pretending to swim away from a shark, or unilaterally rewriting article headlines in Google Discover so they’re full of incoherent lies. God, you PC people are so selfish.</p>
<p>Crucial RAM and SSD shipments will continue until 2026, though expect the former, especially, to remain at silly-high prices while that data centre demand keeps shortages short and costs in the clouds. Probably worse so than before, now that there’ll be one less company trying to keep stock flowing.</p><p>After February, they’re gone for good, which is a huge shame. Crucial had been making quality, relatively affordable components and storage right up until Micron’s act of filicide, with the likes of the T500 and X9 Pro currently holding pride of place in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">best SSDs</a> list. I’ve even had a few more recent models – the T710 NVMe drive and the external X10 – in my cupboard, waiting for me to find the time to test them. The PC I’m writing this on, and have played games for years with, has a Crucial P5 as its main SSD, and I somehow remember choosing a 2x4GB Crucial Ballistix RAM set for my first DIY build after reading an agreeable review of it in PC Gamer’s then-tiny hardware section.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have a pile of to-be-benchmarked components in your house, that’s a lot of hobbyist history to just... end. And for what?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale will not be available on Steam when it launches in January, Hypixel Studios confirmed, with the developers keen to avoid negative reviews during the early access stage.</p>



<p>After being axed by Riot Games, Hytale was saved by the initial founders of the game and will be released into early access on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 13</a>, with an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-price-revealed-ahead-of-early-access-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">affordable price of $19.99 for the base version</a>, and, while Steam won’t be available at launch and may never be required, there are plans for a console release.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-skipping-steam-but-coming-to-console-in-future">Hytale Skipping Steam But Coming to Console in Future</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Wait. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Answering a series of frequently asked questions on the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hytale website</a>, executive director Patrick ‘Lyall’ Derbic confirmed Hytale won’t be supported on Steam at launch, with the intention to avoid “overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren’t as well-informed yet about what we are doing.”</p>



<p>The intention is to spend time “working with the community and improving the game,” and, while “Steam is a great marketing tool,” it’s one that may not ever be required. However, the door hasn’t been closed on a Steam launch entirely.</p>



<p>There are plans for launches on console and other platforms in the future, though the early access period will be on PC only. Launching on console “requires a lot of work on backend systems,” and the initial desire is to “focus on making a good game first.”</p>



<p>A mobile version will also not be available during early access, and it remains to be seen whether it’s on the cards at all, as Hypixel Studios are “still evaluating what it would take to make this a feasible reality.”</p>

<p>Fortnite players are set to be treated to another new game mode, according to leakers, with a mode for five-player squads in the works.</p>



<p>Battle Royale in Fortnite currently supports 1-4 players, but larger groups have been restricted. However, that could be set to change with five-player squads on the horizon.</p>







<h2 id="h-leakers-say-fortnite-will-add-five-player-squads">Leakers Say Fortnite Will Add Five-Player Squads</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More players, more fun. Credit Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Fecooo_/status/1996365066212696385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter post from Fecoo_</a>, five-player squads are “likely coming” to Battle Royale soon, with a sub link code to the data of the playlist of the mode showing details of ‘Quints’, which also confirms that five players can be in a team.</p>



<p>The string has come in the same area where the Battle Royale modes of Solo, Duos, Trios, and Squads are shown, suggesting there is strong legitimacy to the claims.</p>



<p>Five-player squads would be the first variation to the standard Battle Royale since the introduction of Trios in January 2019, which initially came as a limited-time mode before being later added as a permanent option.</p>



<p>Since then, Battle Royale has branched into entirely separate modes with the likes of Blitz, Reload, Fortnite OG, and Delulu, but the lobby sizes have largely remained the same.</p>



<p>The leaks do not specify when to expect the addition of five-player squads to Fortnite, nor is it indicated whether the addition will arrive permanently or as a limited-time mode.</p>



<p>It does serve as further evidence of Epic Games’ plans to continually expand Fortnite to cater to a wider range of players, with the game now containing separate ecosystems with their own passionate playerbase.</p>

<p>Fortnite has confirmed an iconic character has survived the shocking attack that occurred in the trailer for Chapter 7 Season 1, with the Battle Bus poised to return and the driver being safe from harm.</p>



<p>One of the biggest shake-ups in recent history in Fortnite occurred at the start of Chapter 7, with players landing on the Battle Royale Island after surfing a wave after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-the-battle-bus-fortnite-chapter-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shocking destruction of the Battle Bus</a>. However, the iconic vehicle isn’t gone for good.</p>







<h2 id="h-battle-bus-returning-to-fortnite">Battle Bus Returning to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Survival. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1996338694383714586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Twitter</a> was shared confirming the safety of the driver, alongside a message that read “The Bus Driver, who was obliterated by an energy beam last week, just texted me this.”</p>



<p>The exchange of messages included one from the driver himself, saying “i lived *****,” and a dramatic return to Fortnite is expected to take place later today.</p>



<p>Players have been hard at work completing quests to repair the Battle Bus, including finding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-custom-battle-bus-pieces-chapter-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom Battle Bus pieces</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-bus-wheels-pump-n-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Bus wheels</a>, and the work has seemingly paid off, with Dummy successful in their repairs.</p>



<p>The return of the Battle Bus coincides with the return of additional modes to Fortnite, following a brief absence, with Reload, Blitz, and Ranked now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-roadmap-blitz-reload-og-delulu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available from December 4</a>.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG remains unavailable for the time being until the launch of a new OG Season on November 11, while Delulu is back for Chapter 7 the following day.</p>



<p>At this stage, it’s not clear whether the surfing mechanic will be removed entirely or retained with a varied approach to landing in matches.</p>

            <p>Arrowhead trusts the newly-announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film director, and has shut down any comments suggesting the director should at least try the game before taking on the adaptation.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">Fast &amp; Furious' Justin Lin would be taking the director reins for Sony's upcoming Helldivers adaptation</a>, which will be based on Arrowhead's game. On this announcement, it was revealed that Lin is not a gamer himself, and actually used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film.</p>

<p>However, while this move was clearly enough to win over those within the film business, it caused a bit of scepticism with some over on the game's Discord server. In fact, one user tagged Arrowhead's studio head Shams Jorjani asking if they could direct the adaptation instead.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Jorjani did not take the user up on the offer, and instead showed his support for Lin's work. "Let Justin Lin work his magic," <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1445530210098352138">Jorjani replied</a>.</p>
<p>In a further exchange, another member of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> Discord asked the Arrowhead exec to ensure Lin "plays the game at least once" or checks out some gameplay footage. Again, Jorjani affirmed that Lin is the right person for the job.</p>
<p>"I trust Justin," the Helldivers 2 CEO said, adding: "He did a great job on the Star Trek movie."</p>

<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after it was announced, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p><p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

<figure data-uuid="bad24b5f3ad58"><a title="Metroid Merch Japan" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bad24b5f3ad58/metroid-merch-japan.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Metroid has rarely been able to play with the Nintendo big boys as far as sales are concerned, so it's no surprise that Samus merch drops have been a fair bit rarer than those seen for Zelda and Mario. But, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> finally here, Nintendo is changing that... in Japan, at least.</p>
<p>Yes, a new wave of Metroid merch is now available <em>exclusively</em> at the Nintendo Stores in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Fukuoka and the Okinawa pop-up. Just to really rub salt in the wound, it's also available on the <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/feature/feature_met001?">My Nintendo Store</a>, <em>exclusively</em> in Japan. *<em>sigh</em>* Back to looking longingly at plane tickets, it is.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cehjxlsy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p><em>Update: Well, it looks like Nintendo has answered our wishes! Although it appeared that the merch outlined below was exclusive to Japan, many of the items have just cropped up on the <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fmerchandise%2Fview-all-merchandise%2Fshop-by-franchise-merchandise%2Fmetroid-merchandise" rel="sponsored noopener">UK My Nintendo Store</a>, too.</em> <em>Time to beef up those Christmas stockings!</em></p>
<p>Simply put, the new range is awesome. There's a super cute Baby Metroid keychain, a Morph Ball zip-up pouch, a 'gadget case' for all your wires and charging banks, and even glasses so you can 'cheers' Prime 4 in style.</p>

<p>The real winners, mind you, are the Metroid ice cube tray (not available on the EU store) — because why have cube-shaped ice, when it <em>could</em> look like a tiny alien? — and the Arm Cannon pillow, which, yes, <em>you can actually wear</em>.</p>

<p>The full collection ranges in price from 2,420 yen / £12.99 for the keychain, up to 6,600 yen / £37.99 for the Arm Cannon pillow.</p>
<p>And if the above has got you in the mood for even more merch, the squishy Metroid amiibo is now back in stock on the <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fmetroid-amiibo-metroid-collection-000000000002006766" rel="sponsored noopener">UK My Nintendo Store</a> for <strong>£12.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Those unable to get their hands on any of the above can still take joy in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which arrives on Switch and Switch 2 <em>today</em>, instead. We called Samus' latest adventure "one of the very best Metroid games of all time" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>, and today, the wait is finally over!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has announced that Diablo IV: Season of Divine Intervention is going live on December 11, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-ptr-tests-big-core-changes-itemization-monster-combat-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after several weeks of testing on the Public Test Realm</a>.</p>



<p>The game's eleventh season introduces 'evolved monsters', as they were described by the studio, increasing the challenge players will face when playing the latest installment in the studio's acclaimed hack-and-slash action RPG series. Monster AI and affixes have been overhauled: enemies react more dynamically, elites and champions hit harder and come with over twenty new affixes, champion packs are formalized, and packs clump less. These changes apply across all Diablo IV content, including Nightmare Dungeons.</p>



<p>Blizzard also releases the long-awaited itemization overhaul with Diablo IV: Season of Intervention:</p>



<ul>
<li>Non‑unique items now drop with four base affixes instead of three, and Sanctification (channeling Angelic power into gear) becomes a final, irreversible upgrade that can add a bonus legendary power, Greater Affix, special Sanctification affixes, and 5–25 extra Quality while locking the item from further modification; Sanctification, which occasionally can even make items indestructible, is earned via Heavenly Anvils and Heavenly Sigils at higher tiers.</li>



<li>Tempering now lets players pick a specific affix from a recipe instead of rolling randomly; items get only one tempered affix, but charges are infinite, and Ancestral items can occasionally upgrade the tempered affix into a Greater Affix. </li>



<li>Masterworking uses a new Quality (0–25) stat that increases base damage/armor/resists and all affix values by 1% per Quality level; Masterworking adds 2–5 Quality per upgrade, with costs scaling by current Quality, and a final Capstone Bonus roll at max Quality that boosts one random affix (Greater included) by 50%.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>As previously announced, Blizzard has also overhauled the defense stats to equalize effective Health across classes better and builds. Diablo IV: Season of Intervention introduces rating‑based Armor and Resistances (with diminishing returns and Armor now reducing all damage types), a new Physical Damage Resistance, and a unified Toughness stat that summarizes effective HP against each damage type and can be compared on item tooltips. Many skills and Paragon nodes that granted generic damage reduction now give multiplicative bonuses to Armor, or all Resistances; Fortify is redesigned from DR into an extra Life reservoir that slowly heals the player character at the cost of Fortify.</p>



<p>Potions have been redesigned as well. They're now reduced to a base stack of 4, but now provide an instant 35% max‑life heal, and passively regenerate one charge every 30 seconds. Life on Hit, Life Regeneration, Life on Kill, and Healing % are buffed and more available, potion tier upgrades are removed, and Welcome Back Booster handling is adjusted for future seasons.</p>



<p>There are significant tweaks to the Season Journey, too. Season Rank is replacing Renown on the Seasonal Realm; players advance through the ranks by completing objectives and a Capstone Dungeon at each tier, earning Skill points, Paragon points, Smoldering Ashes, cosmetics, Heavenly Sigils, and other rewards. The Eternal Realm, on the other hand, keeps traditional Renown with some adjustments. </p>



<p>Five Capstone Dungeons (Vault of the Crucible, Hellish Descent, Enclave of Darkness, Den of the Apostate, Breach of Sin) have now been built into an all-new system aimed at challenging progress through the many difficulty tiers, from Hard through Torment III, as the character grows in power. Despite Capstone Dungeons stating a suggested level at which to attempt them, their difficulty does not actually scale with the character's current level.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GRZOQEKCPXRQ1764270043784-scaled.webp"></a></figure>



<p>Story-wise, Diablo IV: Season of Intervention features the angel Hadriel aiding Sanctuary's heroes. In Seasonal Realms, players follow his light in towns to start the seasonal questline. The Lesser Evils each invade a specific endgame mode: Duriel takes over Helltide, Belial corrupts The Pit, Andariel infests the Kurast Undercity, and Azmodan becomes both a permanent world boss and a summonable challenge in Hawezar with variant powers from the others; their minions gain themed affixes and visual readability updates.</p>



<p>Killing each Lesser Evil unlocks two Divine Gifts tied to that boss. Gifts have a Reward track plus Corrupted and Purified socket options that change difficulty and benefits for activities like Helltide, The Pit, Undercity, and World Bosses (for example, more socketables from Pangs of Duriel but harsher maggot threats, or extra Tower/Pit upgrades in exchange for lethal Belial eye beams). Divine Gifts level up as players farm their associated content, and Purified slots for each Lesser Evil unlock at specific Season Rank milestones (Duriel IV, Andariel VI, Azmodan VIII, Belial X).</p>



<p>Looking ahead, in Patch 2.5.2 (tentatively slated for early 2026), the multi‑stage timed dungeon The Tower and its Leaderboards return in Beta: Tower difficulty tiers will unlock independently, some problematic bosses will be removed, and class and party‑specific leaderboards will track clears by tier, time, date, platform, and mode (Normal/Hardcore) with filters for friends and clans.</p>



<p>Diablo IV will get its second expansion, following 2024's Vessel of Hatred, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at some point in 2026</a>. The original plan was <a href="https://wccftech.com/annual-diablo-4-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to release annual expansions</a>, but it ultimately proved unfeasible for Blizzard. </p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Access to Roblox has been blocked in Russia, with federal censorship and media oversight agency Roskomnadzor accusing the platform of distributing content "justifying terrorism" and spreading "LGBT propaganda". According to Russian media reports, the state body said Roblox has become rife with content that can "negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Roskomnadzor also cited reports of sexual harassment of children and the sharing of intimate images in their accusations against Roblox. As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/12/04/russias-media-regulator-blocks-roblox-for-justifying-terrorism-and-spreading-lgbt-content">Euronews</a>, Roblox Corporation have issued a response to the ban via a spokesperson. </p>
<p>"We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone," this statement reads. "We have a deep commitment to safety and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform."</p>
<p>Roblox has faced plenty of criticism over how it protects young players in the last few years, with the US state of Louisiana <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox-calling-platform-perfect-place-rcna225144"> bringing a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation over child safety concerns</a> in August, and Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill accusing the game of being a "overrun with harmful content and child predators".</p>
<p>The company behind the blocky game that's actually many games have responded to this by pushing to limit interactions between minors and adults, introducing measures like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-to-roll-out-facial-age-estimation-technology-for-everyone-after-us-prosecutor-dubbed-it-the-perfect-place-for-pedophiles">mandatory selfie-based "facial age estimation technology"</a>.</p>
<p>"We’re taking this step as part of our long-term vision as a platform for all ages," Kaufman added. "We expect that our approach to communication safety will become best practice for other online platforms, whether lawmakers pass laws requiring age verification for all platforms in the future or not." Though, checks of this nature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord">haven't always proven to be totally bulletproof</a> when deployed in response to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act">the UK's Online Safety Act</a>.</p><p>As far as their accusation of spreading "LGBT propaganda" is concerned, Roskomnadzor have a long history of going after games which they deem to violate the Russian government's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-signs-law-expanding-russias-rules-against-lgbt-propaganda-2022-12-05/">ultra-conservative views</a>, which have seen draconian laws <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/30/russia-supreme-court-outlaws-lgbt-movement">carve away the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people</a> in the country. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-block-steam-game-with-queer-art-in-russia-after-state-censor-attacks-it-for-promoting-non-traditional-sexualities">last month</a>, Valve blocked Flick Solitaire from the Russian version of steam, after Roskomnadzor accused the card game of "promoting non-traditional sexualities".</p>

<p>Fortnite has revealed a surprise Nickelodeon collab with Danny Phantom is arriving in the Item Shop tomorrow, with the secret somehow being kept from the flood of leakers on social media.</p>



<p>Epic Games’ boasts a proud history of featuring a wealth of impressive collabs in Fortnite, shown by the recent The Simpsons mini-season, but keeping collabs under wraps and coming as a surprise is difficult. This time, though, they’ve managed to do so.</p>







<h2 id="h-danny-phantom-coming-to-fortnite">Danny Phantom Coming to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Surprise! Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1996323949882523779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">teaser post</a> showcasing what to expect to appear in the Item Shop on Fortnite this week, it was subtly revealed that a Danny Phantom bundle will land on December 5.</p>



<p>The bundle will feature skins for Danny Phantom and Samantha Manson, though further items like Back Bling, Emotes, or Gliders have not been showcased, nor has the price been revealed.</p>



<p>Keeping such a huge collab under wraps is a big win for Fortnite, and the fact that Danny Phantom falls under the Nickelodeon banner could open the door to further huge collabs in the future.</p>



<p>It’s already been widely reported that SpongeBob SquarePants is coming to Fortnite later this Chapter, which, along with Danny Phantom, suggests other collabs could be on the cards.</p>



<p>The potential for collabs has increased following the release of Sidekicks, which allows for smaller characters to feature in collabs, whereas previously, there were size restrictions that prevented small-sized characters from starring prominently.</p>



<p>So far, the only Sidekick collabs have come from The Simpsons, with Scratchy and Homer’s Pig, but there are plenty of options for the future.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the fantastic musical action game, is losing Denuvo anti-tamper support early next year, according to a post on the game's official Steam page.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626840?l=english">The post</a>, succinct in scope, announced suddenly that the software would be removed in a mandatory patch on the 16th January, 2026. However, it also states the game's own anti-tamper measures will still remain in place, so it shouldn't become totally unguarded from tampering hands.</p>
<p>The reason why? Well, the post gives the following justification: "This adjustment is intended to provide a more stable and efficient service environment. We sincerely appreciate all players who continue to support the game through legitimate use."</p>

<p>So important is this update in the eyes of developer Tango Gameworks that Hi-Fi Rush will apparently not launch unless this patch has been installed. The comments responding to this Steam post are largely filled with fans celebrating the removal of Denuvo. The software has proven controversial for a variety of reasons - one of them being the online connection requirement which has rubbed folks the wrong way over the years.</p><p>We do know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-sequel-being-considered-positively-but-tango-gameworks-considering-various-opportunities">Tango Gameworks is considering a Hi-Fi Rush sequel, among other potential projects</a>. It had been in development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-2-already-in-development-six-months-when-krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks">for six months at the point when Krafton bought the studio</a>, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-newscast-hi-fi-rush-redfall-sign-game-pass-xbox-publishing-model-failing">Tango Gameworks' sudden closure by Microsoft</a>. In recent news, new-owners Krafton has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">its intention to become an "AI-first" company</a> - good luck Tango!</p>
<p>If you've not tried out Hi-Fi, we recommend you remedy that as soon as possible. You can give <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Eurogamer's review</a> a read for an idea of what you've been missing, in which Ed Nightingale wrote: "Vibrant and self-assured, Hi-Fi Rush happily embraces the 00s' cheese - and is all the better for it."</p>

            <p>Supertrick Games, the developer of Let it Die sequel Inferno, which launches today, has issued a statement on the game's AI use following controversy from earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/made-with-ai-let-it-die-sequel-inferno-discloses-substantial-generative-ai-use">Let it Die: Inferno's AI disclosure on Steam</a>, which suggested substantial use of generative AI during development, across art, music, and voice, but it did not specify in detail exactly how AI had been used. The statement issued in response to the reaction provides that detail, and in general, the game's AI use seems less than suspected.</p>
<p>For example, the game does use generative AI to create the voices of two characters, but these characters are an AI-driven machine and a "mysterious life form", so the AI-generated voices were a deliberate, creative choice to fit the character, rather than a cost-cutting exercise.</p>

<p>"These specific cases use AI-generated voices intentionally to match the nature of the characters," the statement read. "These voices are not derived from or modeled after any human performers, ensuring no copyright concerns." Otherwise, "All in-game characters are voiced by human performers."</p><p>AI-generated art was used, meanwhile, "to generate rough base images" for background posters, InfoCast (news) insert images and in-game reading material, which the team's artists then "painted over, refined, and adjusted by hand". The AI tool also apparently helped the team observe copyright laws, although there's no explanatory detail on how.</p>
<p>Finally with regards to music, AI was used to begin the creation process for music you'll hear in the background in Iron Perch. Specifically, and I don't really understand this, so excuse my lack of sound creation technicalities, AI was used to generate stems, which I believe are collections of audio tracks, or mixes. "Once all stems were exported," the statement read, "few were manually edited, but most were rebuilt from scratch."</p>
<p>And that's it.</p>
<p>Let it Die: Inferno is the sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-is-grasshoppers-refreshingly-different-return-to-form">eccentric and asymmetrical multiplayer game Let it Die</a>, by Suda51's studio Grasshopper - Supertrick was a co-creator. This new game ditches the asymmetrical multiplayer idea for direct, real-time multiplayer, in an on-trend PvEvP framework. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/#app_reviews_hash">Initial reviews on Steam don't seem to be positive</a>, however, with a Mixed overall response.</p>
