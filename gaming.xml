			<p>It was January 2023 when the Skyblivion team originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its targeted 2025 launch window. Throughout the past couple of years, the modders have <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-now-on-its-final-stretch-release-still-planned-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuck to their schedule</a>, maintaining that they would be able to bring the ambitious total conversion project to fruition by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Today, though, Project Lead Rebelzize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a video update</a> to confirm that won't happen, as there are simply too many things left to do. The complete fan-made recreation of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will, therefore, be released at some point in 2026.</p>



<p>The good news is that the game is in a great state, and many aspects are complete or nearly complete. The world map, for example, was troublesome to implement but is now 100% finished, including all unique regions, realms, and the Oblivion Deadlands. Skyblivion fans can now get a glimpse of it through an interactive satellite-style map, <a href="https://skyblivion.com/map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now live on the project's website</a>.</p>



<p>All quest dungeons are also complete, rebuilt with new layouts, bespoke boss encounters, and unique quest rewards; only a handful of random dungeons remain unfinished. Most interiors, such as houses, shops, castles, stables, chapels, and inns, are ready. However, many Imperial City interiors are blocked until the city's 3D asset set is finalized, with the expectation to complete all locations by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Indeed, the Skyblivion team outlines the Imperial City as the single largest remaining content challenge. Quest implementation is progressing somewhat smoothly, but is still partially blocked by the remaining work needed in the Imperial City. The goal is to finish quests by Q1 2026, leaving time for playtesting and iteration before launch. Once the Imperial City, navmesh, quests, and core systems like alchemy, spells, perks, and crafting (which should be feature complete by the end of 2025) are wrapped and polished, the modders believe the project will finally be ready for its targeted 2026 release. All other major cities, like Anvil, Bravil, Bruma, Cheydinhal, Chorrol, Leyawiin, Skingrad, and the ruined Kvatch, have been implemented.</p>



<p>The User Interface (UI) is still under development. The team has moved toward a more Skyrim-like interface, with function and consistency taking precedence over aesthetics, although a custom reskin may be implemented later. Core UI work is expected to be done by the first quarter of 2026.</p>

<iframe title="Skyblivion Delay to 2026 | A Commitment to Release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yC6W0htYBOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Skyblivion team is even developing a large final fight cinematic between Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon, handled by professional animators, but production is bottlenecked by manpower in rendering, set dressing, VFX, and destruction simulation. Rebelzize calls out for volunteer specialists in those areas to apply so the cinematic can reach the desired quality. If you have such expertise and are willing to help, contact the team <a href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through this form</a>.</p>



<p>Not all features will be included in version 1.0. For example, underwater combat has been cut due to major conflicts with animation mods, although it may be reintroduced at a later date. Indeed, Rebelzize described this as a living project, which will continue to be refined with bug fixes, but also expanded with the original Oblivion DLC (Shivering Isles, Knights of the Nine), and with additional features like spell crafting, dynamic dungeons, grave-robbing, more creature variety, followers, weapons, armor sets, and more. </p>



<p>Overall, it's sad news for those who still wished to play Skyblivion during the Holidays. However, even professional games are always prone to delays, let alone volunteer projects like this one. Moreover, Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did release the official Oblivion Remastered earlier this year</a>, so those who really want to explore a modern version of the classic roleplaying game already have a way to do so.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders was Reportedly the Best-Selling Game on Steam For November 2025, Over 7.7M Copies Sold Overall]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/</link>
            <guid>1371865</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/novembers-best-selling-steam-games">Alinea Analytics</a> has ARC Raiders listed as the number-one best-selling game on Steam for November 2025 by copies sold, and has now reached 7.7 million copies sold across all platforms. It's the latest sign of how Embrak Studios' third-person extraction shooter continues to be one of the biggest games of the year.</p>



<p>This comes after Alinea Analytics reported that ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-closing-in-on-7m-copies-sold/">had sold nearly 750K copies in the week of November 16-22</a>, and that it had sold at least half of all its copies sold on Steam, with the other half coming from PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>



<p>It's far and away a bigger game than Embark Studios' free-to-play title, The Finals, particularly on Steam, where ARC Raiders is surpassing <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2073850/charts/">The Finals' peak concurrent player count</a> as <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">part of its daily player numbers</a>. Its continued success is also interesting to follow <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">as the conversation around generative AI in game development builds and evolves</a>.</p>

<p>That said, we're still in what you'd call 'the early days' for a multiplayer game. It's up to Embark to keep this momentum going now, and we'll know by next year if ARC Raiders has truly carved itself a piece of the multiplayer shooter pie, depending on where it stands at the one-year mark.</p>



<p>Elsewhere on the Steam charts, November was dominated by indie games. RV There Yet? reportedly came second behind ARC Raiders for copies sold in November 2025, with 1.9 million. Peak followed it with 1.4 million copies sold, which was then followed by Dispatch at 1.1 million, and rounding out the top five was <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-duckov-enjoys-spec-quackular-launch-with-1-million-units-sold-in-five-days/">Escape from Duckov, the Escape from Tarkov parody</a>.</p>

<p>While it's still to be determined if ARC Raiders will maintain its current spot as the multiplayer game to beat, Embark Studios can enjoy the game receiving its commercial flowers, especially since it doesn't look like it'll get its critical ones this year.</p>



<p>It missed out on Game of the Year nominations for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">Golden Joysticks</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">The Game Awards</a>, and in the latter it only carries one nomination for best multiplayer game. The conversation around 2025's best game is engulfed by the likes of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight Silksong and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. We'll know which game comes out on top in just a few days from the time of this writing, with The Game Awards kicking off on December 11, 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[An unsettling indie game about horses keeps getting banned from stores]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/837278/horses-banned-steam-epic-games-store</link>
            <guid>1371862</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Horses</em>, a first-person narrative horror game, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6zgqun5us2f">was banned from the Epic Games Store</a> just hours before it was set to launch on December 2nd. Then, a day after launch, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too">the Humble store banned it as well</a>. The decision shocked the developers at Santa Ragione, makers of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/saturnalia-review/">critically respected <em>Saturnalia</em></a>, as these storefronts were the homes they’d found for their game two years before it was preemptively banned from Steam.</p><p>Valve and Epic say <em>Horses</em> violates their sexual content policies. Humble hasn’t yet said why it banned the game after hosting it for several hours post-launch. However, Santa Ragione claims neither Epic nor Valve has clearly explained what exactly in the game is objectionable, and that these decisions have put the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">in peril of shutting down</a>. The back-and-forth has catapulted <em>Horses</em> from a little-known prestige indie title to the next battleground in the fight between game storefronts, indie developers, content policies, and creative expression.</p><p>Though all the action kicked off late last month, <em>Horses</em>’ story officially began two years ago. In <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html">a lengthy FAQ</a>, the developers explained that in 2023, <em>Horses</em> was rejected during Steam’s review process without explanation. “Steam’s policy grants broad discretion to refuse titles without providing detailed explanations. In our case, they simply stated they could not legally distribute <em>Horses</em> without clarifying why,” the FAQ reads.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">In an interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Pietro Righi Riva, one half of the team at Santa Ragione, said that the ban might have been caused by a scene involving a man and his daughter visiting a ranch where the titular “horses” are humans wearing horse masks. The daughter wants to ride one of the horses, which the player facilitates. “What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders,” Riva said.</p><p>He said that scene was part of a rough demo sent to Steam to satisfy the platform’s request for a playable build so <em>Horses</em> could get a “Coming Soon” page. Riva said that, ultimately, the character was changed in the final build. “We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of <em>Horses</em>, works much better when delivered by an older character.”</p><div><p>“Our requests for review and appeal were denied over and over.”</p></div><p>The studio stresses that Steam never explicitly explained why <em>Horses</em> was banned nor responded to any of Santa Regione’s follow-up appeals and communications. “For two years we asked for clarifications and a path to compliance, but we were directed to Steam’s general guidelines and our requests for review and appeal were denied over and over,” the FAQ reads.</p><div><p>In November, after Santa Ragione <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6ht5yj3ss23">shared <em>Horses</em>’ release date</a> and the reason why it wouldn’t be sold on Steam, Valve finally responded. A <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-scary-humiliating-and-patronising-santa-ragione-facing-closure-after-horses-barred-from-steam">statement to <em>gamedeveloper.com</em> read</a>:</p></div><p>“After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with <a href="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/tmWlCn5YzpcKpL21nF9fACJhfDX?domain=partner.steamgames.com">our onboarding rules and guidelines</a>. A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam.”</p><p>The studio says the Steam ban put the company in financial peril, as it “completely erased our ability to find an external supporting publisher or partner to fund the rest of the game as no one in the industry considers an indie game that cannot be released on Steam to be viable.” Though the developers were able to continue work on <em>Horses</em> through investments from friends, unless the game’s a hit, they say the studio will shut down.</p><p>In the two years since <em>Horses</em>’ ban from Steam, Santa Ragione found several new homes for the game, including Itch.io, GOG, Humble, and the Epic Games Store. <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1994406374273318952?s=20">In a post on X</a>, DRM-free storefront GOG said, “We’re proud to give Horses a home on GOG, giving players another way to enjoy the game. We’ve always believed that players should be able to choose the experiences that speak to them.” Humble, however, banned the game shortly after its launch there and has not responded to a request for comment.</p><p>None of those stores has near the market share of Steam, but among them, Epic’s has the most name recognition — making its last-minute ban a major blow.</p><p>As with Steam, Epic didn’t explain what in <em>Horses </em>triggered the ban, only referring to the policy on inappropriate and hateful / abusive content and the fact that games rated AO, or Adults Only, could not be distributed on EGS. (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines">Unless it’s an NFT / blockchain game, of course.</a>)</p><p>“We immediately appealed their decision through all suggested channels,” the developers’ FAQ reads, adding that when <em>Horses </em>was submitted to the ESRB for rating, it received an Mature rating (ages 17 and up), which is, as of this writing, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">still prominently displayed on the game’s EGS page</a>. Epic did not respond to a request to clarify the age rating discrepancy or the timing of the ban, referring instead to the statements Santa Ragione shared in its FAQ.</p><p>Santa Ragione is very clear about the kind of content <em>Horses </em>contains. The lengthy content warning <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/index.html">on the game’s website</a> lists “physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery (mutilation, blood), depictions of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny.” It also makes sense that, out of an abundance of caution, Steam would ban the version of the game it saw with the father-and-daughter scene.</p><p>“The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag,” Riva told <em>IGN</em>. But what makes less sense is the platform’s refusal to reevaluate the game or at least explain its reasoning. “We believe Steam intentionally keeps its policy opaque so it does not have to stand by clear rules and can adjust decisions to whatever best serves the platform at a given moment,” reads the FAQ.</p><p>According to Santa Ragione, Epic’s ban is even more confusing. It said EGS had a more complete version of the game for two months, “with the final achievements-ready build being approved for release 18 days prior to launch.” Epic’s decision to ban<em> Horses</em> reads like decision-makers getting scared in light of all the attention on the game.</p><p>In spite of all this, <em>Horses</em> still is available, and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">smattering</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">reviews</a> have been mostly positive. But with large storefronts having significant power over games and studios, the reception may not be enough to keep Santa Ragione alive. The studio says that the combination of the Steam ban and the money it owes investors “puts us in a completely unsustainable financial situation unless the game somehow recoups its development costs.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/837278/horses-banned-steam-epic-games-store]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[WD 5TB My Passport Falls to $0.02 per GB as Amazon Goes No-Margin on Storage Deals Post Cyber Monday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/wd-5tb-my-passport-falls-to-0-02-per-gb-as-amazon-goes-no-margin-on-storage-deals-post-cyber-monday-2000649736</link>
            <guid>1371853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve been banging the drum for deals on reliable, large-capacity portable HDDs for a long time now. Honestly, going without one is really like doing a high-wire act without a net, because having only the one copy of your most sensitive and essential files that lives on your laptop or desktop leaves you one mishap away from losing them forever.</p>
<p>Cyber Week’s one of the best opportunities to get protection for your irreplaceable data, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/">one of the best deals still on the board is this one at Amazon on the 5TB version of the WD My Passport external hard drive, which is just $121</a>. That’s a 16% drop from the regular $145, and it’s a stellar price for an external drive with this sort of capacity and reliability from a trusted brand like Western Digital — in fact, it’s the world’s first 5TB 2.5-inch portable hard drive. Be sure to click the black model of this palm-sized drive — inexplicably, the blue and red ones are still running at full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ransomware Protection</h2>
<p>External HDDs tend to be fairly static devices, aside from shrinking in physical size and growing in capacity. Beyond that, the features have remained mostly the same. Except now, WD has added software to the My Passport HDD that includes robust protection against the ever-growing and constantly evolving threat of ransomware.</p>
<p>A virus or malware can get into not only your laptop or desktop but also into its peripheral devices, including your portable hard drive. Once there it can install ransomware, which locks you out of your files until you pay a ransom to the hacker. The Acronis True Image for Western Digital software preloaded on the My Passport HDD not only helps you schedule automatic backups, it helps protect your entire system from ransomware, and also allows you to password-protect and give your files 256-bit AES encryption.</p>



<h2>Smaller and Faster</h2>
<p>The WD My Passport HDD comes preformatted for Windows, but can easily be reformatted for use with Macs without losing any of its protective features. WD’s given it a slimming-down from its previous models too – this streamlined version of the My Passport is just 3.21 by 4.33 inches, and exceedingly slim, so you can fit up to 5TB of your most essential files in your pocket to take with you anywhere, and its footprint at your desktop or work station is virtually nil.</p>
<p>It connects via USB-A 3.0, but it’s also compatible with USB-A 2.0 devices, and the 5Gbps data transfer speed allows you to move files to or from your PC or Mac laptop or desktop computers quickly and easily. It can be set up for automatic backups, and is also drag-and-drop ready from the time you connect it.</p>
<p>Those digital photos and videos on your computer need protection in the form of a large-capacity, fast, ultra-reliable backup drive that fits in your pocket and comes with advanced protection. So do your financial records and other sensitive personal information. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/">The WD My Passport 5TB portable external hard drive — the world’s first 5TB 2.5-inch drive — checks all those boxes, and it’s a great Cyber Week find at just $121 at Amazon.</a></p>

            <p>
Back in October, three weeks out from its release date, Yacht Club Games' first completely new game since the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a>, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mina-the-hollower-catches-a-delay-nebulously-beyond-its-previously-seasonally-appropriate-release-date">indefinitely delayed</a>. It still doesn't have a release date, and now in a new report and interview with the studio, it's sounding like the success of Mina is a "make-or-break" moment for Yacht Club Games.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a>, noting how pivotal it is that Mina does well, studio head Sean Velasco explained that "If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden. If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that’s not so good." Right now the big thing Yacht Club Games want to avoid is having a repeat of working on Shovel Knight, which in 2014 saw the founder working for months without paychecks.
</p>
<p>
Velsaco did say that "If Mina flops, we'll still be around," so it's not complete doom and gloom, but did note that they would certainly "need more money." Money is kind of the big, obvious issue in the games industry at the moment. Even very notable names like Ron Gilbert are struggling to get funding, with his unnamed Zelda and Diablo inspired RPG having been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-zelda-ish-diablo-ish-rpg-monkey-island-designer-ron-gilbert-was-working-on-has-unfortunately-been-canned">canned due to publisher disinterest</a>.
</p>
<p>
The indie scene isn't quite what it was like in 2014 when Shovel Knight first launched. These days it's all <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-are-there-so-many-bloody-roguelikes-or-roguelites-and-what-really-makes-a-game-roguish">roguelikes out the wazoo</a>, very replayable genres that keep people invested for lengthy periods of time, and safer bets than retro throwbacks like Mina the Hollower. Not to mention just how many games come out on Steam every day now. It's a rough time to get someone to tune in in this attention economy.
</p><p>
This report also lined up another potential casualty in this whole affair: that 3D Shovel Knight game that has thus far only been teased. Yacht Club Games had been split into two teams, one for Mina the Hollower, the other this new Shovel Knight. But by 2024 the studio laid off some employees, pausing development on the 3D take on Shovel Knight to focus on Mina. It does sound like at least the studio founders are looking at the game again, but for now, things are a little uncertain for Yacht Club Games.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, the massive mod remake of Oblivion in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine, won't be making its previously announced 2025 release goal, the team behind it have confirmed. Instead, the mod'll be coming out at some point in 2026, giving the team behind it extra time to overcome the final few hurdles and get it polished up.</p>
<p>This news comes a few months after ex-Skyblivion level and world designer Dee Keyes called the 2025 release goal the mod's team set in 2023 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/Kyle%20'Rebelzize'%20Rebel">"pointless and unachievable"</a>. Keyes also accused Skyblivion project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel and implementation lead Heavy Burns of rushing the project out the door and mismanaging communication within the team, subsequently sharing more of his perspective on the project in a <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/rockpapershotgun/content-article/edit/news/2384155?tab=overview">video interview with RPS sister site Eurogamer</a>. In a response to Keyes' original claims, Heavy Burns asserted that "many of the statements in his post are either misrepresented or just untrue".</p>

<p>That brings us to now and the above video, in which project lead Rebel announces the delay and offers some info on the mod's current state. "Despite the game being in the best state it's ever been, we still have some last challenges to overcome that are going to require a little bit more time," the modder said. "This is something we have known for a while, but we did not want to announce a delay without also sharing our current plans and ambitions for the release of the project.</p><p>So, how's it doing? Well, first of all the creation of its world map is "100% finished", with the team having just released an <a href="https://skyblivion.com/map/">interactive satellite version</a> on their website, so you can scroll around and see what their version of Cyrodiil looks like. Most of the dungeons are done, as are most of the building interiors, though the latter's with the exception of the Imperial City, with that being the last bit of the province which the modders need to pull together. </p>
<p>Their current aim's to have it done by the end of 2025, so quests can be finalised and remaining bits of navmeshing done early in 2026. Navmeshing, for the uninitiated, is the setting up of frameworks which allow NPCs to roam around places without bumping into everything. The modders also have playtesting of mechanics planned for early next year.</p>
<p>"As we move closer to the release date, the goal will be to spend as much time as possible polishing, balancing, and fixing our game for you guys to finally play," Rebel added. "There's no real deadline for this, as I expect we will be working on this until the day of release." Once the mod is out of the door, the lead also mentioned plans to add in some features which haven't made it into the current version, including spellcrafting, dynamic dungeons, and grave robbing. Underwater combat's had to be cut for now, but the modders also hope to potentially add that in down the line.</p>
<p>Hopefully the extra time makes delivering Skyblivion a bit more comfortable for the group, given Keyes' accusations. I'll still be interested in giving it a go whenever it emerges from the Imperial sewers, given the in-depth approach the modders look to have taken in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-says-release-date-reveals-finally-getting-closer-as-oblivion-remake-mod-shows-off-revamped-intro">reimagining The Elder Scrolls 4</a> with a lot more tweaks and additions than Bethesda's Oblivion Remastered.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I waited over a decade for Raichu to get a Mega Evolution, so I sympathize with anyone who has a beloved Pokémon they’re hoping might get one in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> upcoming </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. Now that my favorite electric rat has not just one, but </span><i><span>two </span></i><span>Mega Evolutions, the title for “most oppressed Pokémon fan waiting for a Mega Evolution” now goes to the Flygon stans, and they’re really going through it.</span></p> <p><span>Flygon was first introduced in </span><i><span>Pokémon Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>, and the dragon/ground-type beast has been a fan favorite ever since. It’s easy to see why. The insectoid dragon oozes cool while also being kinda cute in that uniquely </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> kind of way. He is very </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJk3wrvL6To"><span>“friend-shaped”</span></a><span> and also a powerhouse in battle, giving him all the makings of a generation of fans’ favorite critter.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Flygon was famously one of the Pokémon originally slated to get a Mega Evolution in the 3DS era when the mechanic was introduced, only for the idea to later get </span><a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2015/04/mega-flygon-excluded-from-xyoras-because-of-artists-block"><span>scrapped because Game Freak couldn’t nail down the design</span></a><span>. With </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>bringing back Mega Evolution and introducing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602"><span>new forms for old monsters</span></a><span>, Flygon fans have been crossing all their fingers hoping that the long-lost Mega might finally make its grand debut.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But every time Game Freak announces a new Mega Evolution that isn’t for Flygon, the light continues to dwindle from their eyes.</span></p>     <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="pt" dir="ltr">Flygon vendo Lucario ganhar a segunda mega: <a href="https://t.co/I6Emz5f7hw">pic.twitter.com/I6Emz5f7hw</a></p> <p>— Vida de Treinador (@VidaDeTreinador) <a href="https://twitter.com/VidaDeTreinador/status/1995871382920724580?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="pt" dir="ltr">Mega flygon está oficialmente MORTO<br>Não vai ter nem na DLC <a href="https://t.co/ENLLqkB9km">pic.twitter.com/ENLLqkB9km</a></p> <p>— rayquaza, pokemon até namorar #Chronoverso (@azarco91) <a href="https://twitter.com/azarco91/status/1977865459157356882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>What makes this even more painful is that there was a brief flicker of hope in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>first trailer for the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>, which showed a portal filled with Mega Stones, one of which appeared to have Flygon’s color scheme, but thus far, no Mega has materialized in the DLC’s promotion.</span></p>   <p><span>Unfortunately, with each new reveal seemingly confirming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670"><span>previous leaks</span></a><span> that don’t include Mega Flygon, it seems like the dream is well and truly dead. Unless Game Freak brings back Mega Evolutions in another decade? Maybe the third time will be the charm. I don’t know if Flygon fans can handle another big setback</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Toshiba 50″ Smart Fire TV Goes Into Clearance Mode at 51% Off, Amazon’s Deeper Post–Black Friday Discount Move]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/toshiba-50-smart-fire-tv-51-off-clearance-black-friday-2000649749</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Entertainment upgrades don’t have to blow your budget; if you know where to look. The biggest shopping events of the year – aka Cyber Monday and Black Friday – are officially behind us, but not all deals have expired. We’re still spotting plenty of great discounts across a range of categories, so whether you missed grabbing a new TV or a tech gadget, there’s still a chance to save.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3815/">Right now, Amazon is offering an unbelievable 51% discount on the 50-inch Toshiba Class C350 Series LED 4K smart Fire TV</a>. It typically sits at $350, but this discount brings its price down to just $170. The offer is open to all shoppers, meaning both Prime and non-Prime members can snap it up. Even better, there are no delivery charges to worry about, so you’re saving a bit on that front, too. There’s a catch, though. The discount is selling out fast, so there’s not a lot of time left to save. Lingering deals such as this one are hardly around for a couple of days before getting back to their original price. If you’ve been looking to bag a smart screen for less, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant Visuals</h2>
<p>The 50-inch size isn’t massive, but also not too small. It’s ideal for bedrooms, smaller living areas, and anyone who is not a fan of screens taking up an entire wall. Toshiba packs it with its revolutionary REGZA Engine ZR, which uses precise analyzing technology. The Super Contrast Booster maximizes the depth of picture color, keeping it as accurate as possible. This is paired with the brand’s exceptional AI upscaling technology, which, instead of replicating every pixel, detects the colors of neighboring pixels. It then considers the detailed texture of the real sight to decide a color for each pixel. Translation? You’ll enjoy every moment on the screen with the clarity of 4K quality.</p>
<p>Blur is actively reduced during fast-paced sequences with Ultimate Motion. There’s also a Game mode, which supports a whole bunch of gaming features, such as ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), and eARC. Combine this mode with Ultimate Motion, and you’ll be able to play your favorite titles in a much smoother manner; great for those upcoming holiday game nights. Visuals are only part of the experience, though. Sound matters just as much, and for that, the TV supports Dolby Atmos for a realistic, room-filling audio. You won’t just get to see your favorite scenes coming to life; you’ll experience them in a realistic way.</p>



<p>Fire TV support brings all your favorite content and streaming platforms to a single place, so you’re never going to be out of stuff to watch. Think Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney, Peacock, and more. Most of these require subscriptions, but if you’re not a fan of that, you can always access plenty of free, ad-supported platforms through it just as well.</p>
<p><span>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to grab a brand new display without shelling out big bucks, now is a good time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3815/">This deal takes a whopping $180 off its retail price, bringing it down to a much more affordable range.</a> Just make sure to grab yours fast, as discounts such as this one don’t last too long.</span></p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has agreed to halt all promotion and public testing of Light of Motiram - the post-apocalyptic open-world survival game Sony previously accused of being a "slavish clone" of PlayStation's Horizon series in a lawsuit - as the two companies battle it out in court.
</p>
<p>
Light of Motiram, developed by Tencent's Polaris Quest studio, emerged at the end of last year, and its accompanying images - featuring mechanised animal-like creatures and very Aloy like key character art - immediately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">drew comparisons with Horizon</a>. And Sony agreed, mounting legal action against Tencent, who it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">accused of copyright and trademark infringement</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, we've had a bit of back-and-forth - Tencent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-responds-to-sony-lawsuit-against-slavish-horizon-clone-stating-its-claims-of-originality-are-startling">accused Sony</a> of seeking an "impermissible monopoly on genre conventions", a claim Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fires-back-at-tencents-nonsense-defence-for-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">called "nonsense"</a> - and Tencent even went as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">quietly update Light of Motiram's Steam page</a> to tone down the more "egregious" Horizon similarities. But the lawsuit rumbles on.

<p>
Sony wants the court to block Light of Motiram from sale when its legal hearing gets underway next year, but in the interim Tencent has agreed to keep the game out of the spotlight. As <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/">reported by TheGamePost</a>, Tencent this week submitted a new California court filing agreeing there will be "no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram" while Sony's injunction request is being argued. This is part of a deal in which Sony will give Tencent more time to respond to its injunction motion.
</p><p>
"SIE requested, and the Tencent Entities agreed, that (a) the extended briefing schedule and later requested hearing date will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction," the filing reads, "(b) there will be no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (c) the Light of Motiram release will not be moved up to before Q4 2027, and (d) the Tencent Entities will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary injunction".
</p>
<p>
TheGamePost notes Sony and Tencent have jointly requested the court hearings - covering both Sony's injunction request and Tencent's motion to dismiss the lawsuit - be moved to the same day in January next year.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has received both netcode and hit registration improvements ahead of the Winter Offensive update, which is set to go live on the 9th December.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1996248184381641171?s=20">Announced in a Battlefield Comms post</a>, the developers have stated that work continues to enhance both components of online play. This is especially noteworthy as issues surrounding both online netcode and hit registration have been points of frustration for some players since launch.</p>
<p>"We are continuing to build on our work to make hit registration feel consistent, reliable, and predictable during every engagement," the post states. "With this update, we have improved how bullet trajectories are aligned in fast-paced situations, including cases where shots were fired while transitioning into a zoom. These improvements correct inconsistencies that could affect hit registration and the readability of where your shots were landing. We have also made updates to better handle high-density combat scenarios to ensure bullets register more reliably when multiple players are fighting in close proximity."</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, the new Battlefield 6 update has included additional gameplay adjustments to better the overall experience of getting into a firefight. The post elaborates: "In parallel, we have tightened the clarity of damage feedback so that health UI changes and damage cues feel more immediate and easier to understand during combat. While this is separate from Netcode itself, improving how damage is presented plays a key role in making hit registration feel responsive and intuitive.
</p><p>"Lastly, we have resolved an issue where clients could briefly display certain pieces of geometry as intact even though they had already been destroyed on the server. Fixing this eliminates cases where incoming damage could appear to pass through walls."</p>
<p>Other improvements include a general tweak to soldier visibility. There have also been adjustments to various weapons including changes to weapon-handling, first shot accuracy and more. Certain game modes include Rush and Breakthrough have also been altered to improve the attacker flow, aiming to stop oversaturation when it comes to defending objectives.</p>
<p>Finally, the post pledges further improvements to "clarity, responsiveness, and fairness in combat". So it seems as though this continued string of gameplay shifts from EA and Battlefield Studios won't be stopping anytime soon.</p>
<p>This update comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-was-cheater-free-in-roughly-98-of-games-after-launch">EA revealed that close to 98 percent of games post-launch were cheater free</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-flounders-battlefield-6-free-for-a-week">a week-long free-to-play offering that allowed folks to try the military FPS out without breaking the bank</a>.</p>

<p>Running With Scissors and Goonswarm are promising the ability to play as several Postal Dudes from throughout the franchise's history, and they've also packed <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise </em>with "Easter eggs, references, and familiar faces for fans who know the chaos by heart".</p><p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Bullet Paradise </em>looks pretty similar to the likes of <em>Vampire Survivors </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/megabonk-sales-1m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dece44e2-9de8-42d4-8be9-cdc04699d879" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">indie hit <em>Megabonk</em></a>, albeit from a first-person perspective; you'll battle waves of enemies, building synergies between weapons and abilities as you go.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite only being announced earlier today, <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise </em>has already found itself at the center of a controversy surrounding its logo, with fans <a href="https://x.com/RWSstudios/status/1996223528698273970" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">alleging on social media</a> that the art is AI-generated, a claim that Running With Scissors has categorically denied.</p><p>Still, with AI use <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-500-steam-next-demos-disclosed-generative-ai-usage" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="605cb384-a6e4-42b3-8104-b8d3cce6d299" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">on the rise across the industry as a whole</a> and studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">EA</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="affdbbdc-41b9-4313-aacc-396adb4aed5a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a> wholeheartedly embracing it despite its controversies, it's not unreasonable for players to be hyper-vigilant about this sort of thing.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="878">If you work in photo or video editing, you already know that every extra bit of storage you can get your hands on feels like a lifesaver. Instead of deleting files you might eventually need, it’s almost always smarter to expand your storage capacity. That’s why compact external drives are so valuable. Stash away more data without taking up much space. And even though Black Friday has come and gone, that doesn’t mean you’ve missed your chance to snag a great deal on an external SSD. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6192/">Right now, the SanDisk 2TB Creator Pro Portable SSD is discounted on Amazon well after the next big shopping rush</a>. Usually listed at $294, this rugged yet tiny SSD is currently available for just $240, which is a solid 18% off. If 2TB isn’t quite the amount you’re after—too large or not quite enough—both the 1TB (6% off) and 4TB (7% off) models are marked down as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6192/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="878">Fast Save and Load Times</h2>
<p data-start="880" data-end="1572">This small but powerful external SSD delivers remarkable performance considering its ultra-compact form factor. The “Creator Pro” branding is very intentional, signaling that it’s designed with professional creators in mind—those who rely on high-speed transfers to maintain their workflow. The SSD reaches impressive read speeds of 2,000 MB/s and write speeds of 2,000 MB/s, all while being only 2.5 inches in size. Small enough to fit in your pocket.</p>
<p data-start="1592" data-end="1907">The SSD also features a built-in carabiner loop. You can literally clip up to that’s 4,000GB of storage right onto your keychain. Attach it to your backpack, your belt loop, or anything else it can hook onto, and your files can travel anywhere with you while staying safely protected.</p>
<p data-start="1909" data-end="2332">Of course, having your data be this mobile might also raise concerns about losing it. Misplacing your bag at a café could mean someone suddenly has access to a massive chunk of your personal or professional files. Thankfully, you don’t have to worry. The drive includes password protection with 256-bit AES hardware encryption, ensuring that your information stays completely locked down. Only you can access what’s inside.</p>


<p data-start="2334" data-end="2604" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6192/">Right now, you can save up to 18% on SanDisk’s portable SSD lineup for creators.</a> The 4TB version is discounted by 7% to $400, the 2TB version is 18% off at $240, and the 1TB model is 6% off at just $160. Come grab yours now before someone at SanDisk realizes Black Friday is over.</p>
<p data-start="2334" data-end="2604" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">For a limited time, you also receive a month free subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud. With this, you get access to Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects, Lightroom, and so many more applications that creators rely on.</p>
<p data-start="2334" data-end="2604" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Be sure to check out the other offerings in the SanDisk Creator Pro lineup. Also available are a USB-C flash drive, an SSD desk drive, a microSD card, a phone drive, and a standard SD card. Not all are currently on sale, but they are all available in the same, stylish sky blue—so that’s something.</p>

              <p>Good morning! Winter has hit my area of the country hard, and so I write this with cold fingers in a chilly basement office. Will I finally break down and turn on the heat? Stay tuned to find out. Anyway, my frozen digits and I welcome you to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today we’ve got more layoffs, bad news for some<em> Battlefield 6</em> players, creepy horror game <em>Horses</em> getting banned from another store, and more.</p> <h2><em>MLB The Show</em> is getting a mobile port</h2> <p>PlayStation’s long-running baseball sim series,<em> MLB The Show</em>, is arriving on a new platform: your mobile phone. Well, assuming you live in the Philippines, <a href="https://theshowmobile.com/">where the mobile port</a> is soft launching for a regional test.&nbsp; Meanwhile, PC players longing for a great baseball simulator watch on and shake their heads. Maybe one day, Sony and the MLB will remember to port <em>The Show</em> to computers.</p>

  <h2>Testing shows a <em>BF6</em> tank skin makes you take more damage</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1pc1q3u/psa_do_not_use_the_mastery_50_ifv_or_mbt_skin_you/">A <em>Battlefield 6</em> player on Reddit posted a video that went viral</a> on the <em>BF6</em> subreddit. It shows that some tank and armored vehicle skins awarded to players who grind for hours are actually broken. Apparently, if you have these “Mastery” skins equipped, your vehicle will take more damage from RPGs and other explosives, making it much easier to destroy your tank. Yikes.</p>

 <p>A lot of players in the comments shared their own first-hand experiences using these skins and were happy to see this video seemingly proving that, no, they weren’t going mad, and in fact, their tanks were being blown up faster. Some players speculated that other vehicle skins in BF6 might have similar bugs and warned players from using any cosmetics on tanks until EA patches things up.</p>

 <h2>Eidos Montreal lays off staff for the second time in 2025</h2> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-lets-go-staff-more-layoffs-planned/">As first reported by <em>Insider Gaming</em></a> on December 2, a number of developers shared on LinkedIn that they had been fired in what appears to be a new round of layoffs at the studio behind <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> and <em>Deus Ex Human Revolution.&nbsp;</em> According to sources who spoke to the outlet, most of the studio’s internal projects have been canned, and what remains is now focused on supporting Xbox-published games like the upcoming <em>Fable</em> and recently released <em>Grounded 2</em>. This is the second round of layoffs this year to hit the Embracer-owned studio. In April, 75 employees were laid off at Edios Montreal.</p>

 <p>“There are many people who claim that artwork generated by AI is their own creation. We’ve actually ended up hiring such people, only to find they weren’t productive, which led to several problems. Because of that, we’ve changed our hiring process and it now requires candidates to draw something in person during the interview to verify their skills. As a recruiter, it’s a huge hassle, and it feels like we’re going backwards in time, but I’ve heard that several other companies are doing the same thing.”</p> <h2><em>Horses</em> has now been banned from another storefront</h2> <p>On December 3, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> that Horses is now banned from being sold on Humble. This is the third storefront to ban the controversial horror game, following Steam and Epic’s refusal to allow it to be sold on either platform. Horses is out now on GOG, for now at least.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">Saudi Arabia is going to own almost all of EA after the deal closes</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-season-2-update-skin-tone-changes-tired-stoners-character-changes-2000649710"><em>Skate 4</em> update makes everybody look more tired and stoned</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-ai-generated-english-dub-banana-fish-reaction-2000649707">Amazon has removed that terrible AI-generated anime dub</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund is already one of the wealthiest and most influential financial forces on the planet, and rumours of its interest in acquiring a major stake in Electronic Arts have been circulating for months. Now, newly surfaced information has clarified just how substantial that takeover may be.</p>



<p>For those who haven’t followed the developments, this move forms part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/could-saudi-arabia-pif-want-larger-ownership-in-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saudi Arabia’s broader push</a> to grow its global footprint through high-profile investments. The PIF has poured billions into sport, gaming, entertainment, and media over recent years—and EA now appears to be the next major name in its sights.</p>







<h2 id="h-pif-will-own-over-93-of-ea">PIF Will Own Over 93% of EA</h2>



<figure><figcaption>EA could soon be under their control. Credit to Game Developer</figcaption></figure>



<p>As was reported by <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/saudi-arabias-pif-will-own-over-93-of-ea-if-deal-goes-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Gaming Zone</a> (through a paywalled Wall Street Journal report), the Saudi PIF will acquire a massive 93.4% of EA if the deal is finalized. The remaining shares will be split between Silver Lake (5.5%) and Affinity (1.1%), making PIF the overwhelming majority owner by a huge margin.</p>



<p>The WSJ also states that the fund will need to contribute roughly $29 billion to complete the takeover—a staggering figure even by modern gaming industry standards. </p>







<p>Despite PIF’s dominant control, filing reports suggest EA will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-it-will-keep-creative-control-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retain full creative independence</a>. In theory, EA and its various teams will continue operating without interference in development decisions, future titles, or internal strategy.</p>



<p>Whether that promise holds true in the long term remains to be seen. Ownership changes of this scale often reshape companies in ways that aren’t immediately obvious. For now, all eyes will be on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-employees-publicly-oppose-sale-saudi-arabia-equity-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how EA navigates the transition</a>—and what influence, if any, its new majority owner will ultimately exert.</p>

Blizzard had said Diablo 4 was set to get an expansion in 2026 (alongside a new ranking system and leaderboards), so an appearance at The Game Awards later this month would make sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Corden’s claim was debunked by Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, who took to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geoff-keighley-posts-cryptic-image-with-the-caption-regal-inspiring-thickness-up-not-diablo.1368046/page-7#post-148323163" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a> to insist the statue had nothing to do with a Diablo 4 expansion, although that is not to say Diablo won’t show up at The Game Awards in some form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No idea where Jez is getting that, but this statue is not teasing the Diablo 4 expansion,” Schreier said. “I don't currently plan on reporting what it is, sorry, but it's a good one.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That clarification sparked a new round of speculation, with some fans pointing to the long-awaited reveal of Bethesda’s The Elder Scrolls 6. Alas, according to Schreier, it’s not that, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'll do this one more time because people are getting out of control: no the statue isn't teasing Elder Scrolls 6,” Schreier said, again in a post on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geoff-keighley-posts-cryptic-image-with-the-caption-regal-inspiring-thickness-up-not-diablo.1368046/page-17#post-148370662" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. “Now I'm gonna stop responding about this.

In truth, Geoff Keighley’s statue could relate to pretty much any video game with a demonic or hellish theme. That’s a lot of video games. But based on Schreier’s comments (“it’s a good one”) and all the effort that’s gone into making this tease happen, I have high hopes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Awards kicks off Thursday, December 11, so we don't have long to find out what the statue is about.

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Shadows Nintendo Switch 2 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-review/</link>
            <guid>1371748</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>We shouldn’t be surprised to discover that an Assassin’s Creed game is good. Admittedly, Assassin’s Creed Shadows was beset by development problems and missed its release date any number of times, but as a series, Assassin’s Creed has earned its place as one of gaming’s key tentpoles. Shadows was originally released earlier in 2025, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">proved to be another excellent action-adventure</a>, its Japanese setting opening up a new set of features for the long-running series. Now, it’s arriving on the Nintendo Switch 2, and we’ve had the opportunity to discover whether Ubisoft have managed to stuff the huge experience onto Nintendo’s latest hybrid console.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OzyD_EFZzgc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s no getting away from the fact that you can immediately tell Assassin’s Creed Shadows is running on less powerful hardware, but what has been achieved with this port once again shows the level of polish that Ubisoft are capable of delivering and the adaptability of the Anvil engine. Just as with Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft have managed to bring across the core experience across in a deeply playable form by making smart decisions with regard to the visual nips and tucks they’ve had to make.</p>


<p>Clear signs include less-detailed floor textures, simplified water effects, static bodies of water, and mild pop-in, which seemed particularly prevalent in shadows. There’s also the tell-tale sign of anti-aliasing shimmer, and at times there’s a distinct line a few feet away from your character where it almost seems to present as screen tearing. That’s only visible under certain circumstances, though, and only when you’re not in motion.</p>


<p>All that considered, Assassin’s Creed Shadows still looks great on Switch 2. When the sunlight is shimmering through the trees, fronds of grass sway in the breeze, and fallen leaves shuffle underfoot, you can’t help but be impressed by the organic, vibrant world that Ubisoft have created. There’s baked in puddle reflections, which still carry a real sense of quality despite losing the ray tracing of the beefier consoles, while birds and beasts populate every scene, albeit with less definition than elsewhere. It looked incredible elsewhere, and still looks arresting here.</p>
<p>The real key is the frame rate. Assassin’s Creed Shadows aims for 30fps on Switch 2, and that does feel clearly slower and less immediate than its 60fps brethren. Depending on how sensitive you are to such things, that, in itself, might ruin the experience for you. It can dip from there at times too, especially through night scenes with an excess of burning flame effects such as in the opening battle, and even some of the cutscenes struggle to maintain a locked frame rate.</p>

<p>However, it mostly sits at or around 30fps, and in this context, that is a strong start. Given the continual patches we’ve seen for Star Wars Outlaws, you have to assume that Ubisoft will be refining the experience further in the coming weeks, but overall it’s absolutely playable at launch. It feels hugely impressive to have Assassin’s Creed Shadows in the palm of your hand, especially given the size and scope of the game, and I’ve really enjoyed returning to the world, even with the reduced graphical fidelity and lower frame rate. It was a good game originally, and it remains a good game now.</p>
<p>Of course, if you have the option of playing elsewhere, whether on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S or PC, Assassin’s Creed Shadows does look, play and perform better. That said, you can’t carry those out the door, and the core experience remains in place on Switch 2, whether you’re playing docked or handheld.</p>

<p>If anything, this is a game that works remarkably well in handheld, as you complete the odd mission here or trek across the map there, breaking the game’s huge number of quests and side missions down into something more manageable. Thanks to Ubisoft Connect, you can also carry saves over across platforms, so if you want to double-dip, grabbing the game to continue on the go is well worth considering.</p>
<p>There is one underlying issue here at launch, and that’s crashes. I experienced a series of hard crashes after the first couple of hours with the game, but at intermittent points, so there was no clear trigger for them happening. Restarting my Nintendo Switch 2 seemed to remedy the issue, but I made sure to perform manual saves afterwards, just in case. Here’s hoping that a day-one patch will wipe out the issue, especially as I’ve not been the only player to experience them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>One of the most significant flaws of Monster Hunter Wilds when it launched earlier this year was the low challenge level offered by the launch content. The general consensus on this issue wasn't fueled by the opinion of veteran players only. Myself, a hunter far from being a series veteran, found the game way too easy, and with the launch endgame not offering anything significantly challenging, I left the game behind, returning to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak</a> for my Monster Hunter fix. However, the game's producer claims that this issue has been resolved, urging lapsed players to return to the game.</p>



<p>Speaking at the PlayStation Partner Awards 2025 Japan Asia, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-were-not-going-to-stop-here-monster-hunter-developers-talk-about-the-future-of-the-series-at-playstation-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a>, producer Yuya Tokuda talked about the challenges of balancing the game for both newcomers and veterans. </p>



<p><em>"We analyzed what kind of places beginners were stuck in, including Monster Hunter: World. We have worked on these points in turn to make it easier for new users to clear hurdles such as being able to reach certain monsters or to craft certain types of armor. In addition, we have tried to adopt as many new elements as possible that are beneficial for both beginners and existing users, such as Focus Mode. This time, as a result of making the game easy to beat even for new players and players who could not clear it before, I think the difficulty curve was a little lacking for existing users,"</em> said Tokuda-san.</p>



<p>Following its release in February, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-late-june/">Monster Hunter Wilds received multiple updates</a>, which introduced <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">additional content and a revamped endgame offering more challenges to clear</a>. While the game's update cycle has yet to be completed and there's more to come before the obligatory big expansion, Tokuda-san believes the low difficulty launch issues have been addressed. </p>



<p><em>"If you beat the game immediately after its release and stopped playing, I would appreciate it if you could pick it up again,"</em> the producer said.</p>



<p>As they say, first impressions last a lifetime, so it is understandable that many completed Monster Hunter Wilds and never returned to it due to the low challenge level and, more importantly, performance issues, which have yet to be fixed to this day.</p>



<p> Hopefully, the development team will be able to improve the game further and deliver a better experience in the future, as the new open-world progression, which modernized the experience considerably, is well worth experiencing. You can learn more about what the game does well in my <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Was The Biggest New Third-Party Xbox Game Pass Launch in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-biggest-new-third-party-xbox-game-pass-launch-2025/</link>
            <guid>1371739</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you were looking at the calendar, the week that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 launched on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S with a day one launch on Xbox Game Pass, considering the fact that this was Sandfall Interactive's debut title, and (though you may not have known it at the time) it would be competing with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, you'd be forgiven for thinking Clair Obscur didn't have a strong shot at standing out that week.</p>



<p>Not only was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Oblivion Remastered's shadow-dropping in no way a hindrance</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/">but according to Xbox Wire,</a> it became, and would remain, the biggest new third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass in 2025.</p>



<p>You might have some conspiratorial thinking around that news, thinking that Xbox started tracking this metric to jump on the Clair Obscur hype even more as we inch closer to The Game Awards and the feeling that gaming's modern zeitgeist has already dubbed Clair Obscur to be the game of 2025 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">especially after its sweep at the Golden Joysticks</a>), but this is actually something that <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/01/31/palworld-biggest-3rd-party-game-pass-launch-ever/">Xbox began tracking only last year</a>, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-is-now-the-most-popular-game-on-xbox-game-pass/">Palworld became the biggest third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass ever</a>.</p>



<p>And, in fairness, considering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCy6vC00O0c&amp;t=1s">Clair Obscur's appearance in January's Developer_Direct video</a> is at least partial proof that Xbox has been behind the Clair Obscur hype for a long time now.</p>



<p>The size of the launch is measured by the number of unique users who played the game within its first 30 days of availability, which means that in its first month of release, when the whole industry seemed consumed by the Clair Osbcur craze, a lot of players rushed to Xbox Game Pass to see what all the fuss was about.</p>



<p>"<em>This year has been so far beyond what any of us could have imagined, and it’s down to how passionate and supportive our fans have been to make that a reality</em>," said Sandfall Interactive creative director, Guillaume Broche, in an Xbox Wire post. "<em>It’s really nerve-wracking to be a new studio releasing our first game, but the support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream</em>."</p>



<p>Broche also noted that Sandfall Interactive's working with Xbox and releasing on Game Pass was a key element to getting the word out about Clair Obscur. "<em>From being there to announce our game back in Summer 2024, to coming to the studio for the Developer_Direct video in January, Xbox helped us get the word out there and reach a lot of players</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Letting a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before. The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there’s a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren’t expecting it at first</em>."</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 earlier this year</a>, he gave it a 9.5/10 and pegged it as a potential Game of the Year candidate. Fast forward to today and not only did it sweep The Golden Joysticks, winning seven awards (including Ultimate Game of the Year), <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">but it has 12 nominations at The Game Awards</a>, and could very well repeat its Golden Joysticks performance. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Many’s Sky Dev Jokes About Once Human Allegedly Stealing Their Assets]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-hello-games-once-human-teleporter-2000650107</link>
            <guid>1371721</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, a post on the official <i>No Man’s Sky</i> subreddit highlighted what clearly looks like some digital theft. Some premium cosmetics sold via a loot box in the free-to-play survival game <i>Once Human</i> look virtually identical to teleporters in space exploration game <i>No Man’s Sky</i>.</p> <p>While a circular object that can teleport someone has been a staple of science fiction since at least the film <i>Stargate</i>, the more you look at these two 3D assets, the more similarities you’ll spot; they’re virtually indistinguishable save for a different color theme. Managing director for <i>NMS </i>dev Hello Games, Sean Murray, was one of the many internet denizens who took note (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/no-mans-sky-lead-responds-to-reports-of-stolen-assets-in-fellow-open-world-survival-game-once-human-says-the-jokes-on-them-because-theyre-actually-unfinished/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>). Though instead of expressing outrage, he’s taken a more playful approach, pointing out an oversight in the original design.</p>

 <p>“Jokes on them” <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164?s=20">Murray wrote on X</a>, “we forgot to LOD those rivets 😅”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">jokes on them – we forgot to LOD those rivets 😅 <a href="https://t.co/XYvgdFXLas">https://t.co/XYvgdFXLas</a> <a href="https://t.co/KXRD3F5X1i">pic.twitter.com/KXRD3F5X1i</a></p> <p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So if the assets are indeed ripped from <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, it will come with some very unoptimized geometry for <i>Once Human</i> to wrestle with.</p>

 <h2>The heck is a LOD?</h2> <p>“LOD” stands for “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)">level of detail</a>.” Various objects in any given 3D game will have different LODs depending on how far away from the object a viewer is. The further you are, the less detail there is on the object. This aids in rendering and stress on the machine producing the geometry. There’s no sense in having a fully detailed 3D object if you’re many miles away. Here’s <a href="https://youtu.be/w0bKkGqV5JQ">a video demonstrating the technique</a> in <i>Breath of the Wild</i>:</p>

  <p>So next time you’re playing a massive open-world game, now you know why objects look a little funny from a vast distance—especially if you’re playing <i>Once Human</i> and looking at some allegedly stolen assets.</p>

 <p><b><i>Updated; 12/3/2025, 11:20 a.m. ET:</i></b></p> <h2><em>Once Human</em> devs removing the asset, conducting a ‘thorough review’</h2> <p>In <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/once-human/no-mans-sky-asset-accusation">a statement to <i>PCGamesN</i></a>, <i>Once Human</i>’s devs stated they are taking the allegations “very seriously and want everyone to feel confident in the creative work that goes into the game.” They continued:</p> <blockquote><p>With this in mind, we will replace the asset in question. We are undertaking a thorough review and will be using this moment to strengthen our internal art and design policies. We genuinely appreciate the community members who brought this to our attention. This feedback helps us improve.</p></blockquote> <p>As <i>PCGamesN</i> notes, <i>Once Human</i> has been accused of using assets based on other games before, such as Caveira’s symbol from <i>Rainbow Six Siege</i>. Maybe they’ve finally learned their lesson now?</p>

<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl was released on PlayStation 5 on November 20, 2025, a full year after it dropped on Xbox and PC platforms. It arrives on PlayStation 5 along with all the upgrades and enhancements that have been applied over the last twelve months, which means players flying the blue banner are getting a ‘better product’ than when the game first launched in 2024.</p>



<p>I’ve been toying with STALKER 2 since it dropped on PlayStation 5, getting to grips all over again with one of my top games of 2024. In my first STALKER 2 review, I said, ‘I cannot dredge up a single reason why you shouldn’t invest in STALKER 2,’ but is that still true after a year of evolution and the game launching on a new platform?</p>



<p>To find out, read on and explore my full STALKER 2 PS5 review.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-stalker-2-worth-it-on-ps5">Is STALKER 2 Worth It On PS5?</h2>



<p>STALKER 2 had a fair few issues when it was released in 2024. It needed some serious upkeep, and in the weeks that followed the launch, GSC Game World applied many fixes and patches to address the game’s biggest concerns. It stabilized, and hundreds of thousands of people poured into the game over the next year or so.</p>



<p>Today, STALKER 2 isn’t too much of a different beast, but enough has been done for it to finally feel much more polished. The game’s unique elements, like the ‘A-Life’ AI engine that was promised ahead of launch, still aren’t where they should be, but it’s a sight better than it was when it dropped on Xbox and PC in November 2024.</p>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar, STALKER 2 throws players into a harrowing, harsh post-apocalyptic environment called The Zone. It’s worth stressing that the rest of the world is mostly fine, it’s just The Zone that’s post-apocalyptic. This irradiated, mutant-infested space surrounds Chornobyl, the ill-fated nuclear power plant found in Ukraine.</p>



<p>In STALKER 2, players must contend with the threats of The Zone, both human-based and mutated, to uncover shocking revelations, align with or dispute against factions, and resolve the protagonist’s story and reason for being there in the first place.</p>



<p>It’s a pretty challenging game, and at times, it has been compared to the likes of Escape from Tarkov and Fallout, which is mostly accurate. Imagine if Fallout were set in Russia and you’re basically there.</p>



<p>STALKER 2 represents hours of gaming wrapped up in an attractive package. There’s a solid story there that takes players across a massive, mixed map, presenting them with plenty of weapons, outfits, and equipment items to get to grips with.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>worth </strong>the investment to secure a copy on PlayStation 5, but let’s go a little deeper.</p>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-is-better-than-ever">STALKER 2 is Better Than Ever</h2>



<figure><figcaption>‘Gorgeous’ isn’t the word</figcaption></figure>







<p>I’ve already sunk many hours into STALKER 2 on PlayStation 5, and I can attest to it being better than ever. My first review in 2024 was glowing, but the PS5 release takes things to the next level. It’s a marvel of a thing to come back to a game an entire year later and be presented with almost a different version, and the comparisons are pretty easily made.</p>



<p>The overall optimization of STALKER 2 has been improved; it runs better and smoothly, and there are fewer bugs throughout. New quests, UI elements, customization options, and details have been added over the last year, and some nice-to-have features like an ‘immersive mode’ are now present.</p>



<p>Even on the PS5 Slim, not even a PS5 Pro, the game looks phenomenal. The vistas in this game are something special to behold, and the weather effects, physics, and sound engine are all on point. This game has one of the best dynamic weather engines I’ve ever seen in a game, and it lacks much of a backing soundtrack, so the ambience immerses you to the max when you’re walking around The Zone.</p>



<p>The game’s difficulty balancing can be a little skewed at times, but it’s plenty forgiving if you play on a lower difficulty.</p>



<p>My favorite thing in STALKER 2 has to be the combat. Whether you’re fighting the game’s more fearsome mutants or the many human enemies that roam The Zone, you’re in for a treat. Combat is versatile and pretty dynamic, and everything from stealth to all-out guns blazing feels viable.</p>



<p>Talking about roaming The Zone, you’ll also have a great time digging through all the nooks and crannies of this game. It’s packed with secrets, collectables, side missions, and ad-hoc objectives that pop up as you probe the wider map. The world-building is phenomenal, and the atmosphere created in some environments is to die for… Literally.</p>



<p>We should also be getting some kind of expansion in the future, too, so if you get it, you’ll have more to look forward to down the line. GSC Game World is not finished with STALKER 2 by any means.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-4-great">Verdict: 4 – Great</h2>



<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl represents many hours of entertaining (if a little morbid at times) gameplay for anyone fond of the post-apocalyptic settings found in the likes of Fallout and Metro. It’s a stunning game that might present some issues at times, but GSC Game World has worked hard to optimise it over the last year or so.</p>



<p>It remains one of my favorite games in the genre, and I’d take a third playthrough in a shot, especially if GSC ever implements a more major update or some kind of expansion.</p>
