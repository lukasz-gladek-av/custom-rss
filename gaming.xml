<p>On its initial release back in February 2022, Elden Ring was an immediate hit. In just over two weeks, it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-described-as-start-of-a-new-franchise-following-enormous-12m-sales-milestone">shifted 12m copies</a>, with publisher Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware describing these sales as "a fantastic start for the new franchise".</p>
<p>By the time we got to May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-134m-copies-since-launch">sales had surpassed 13.4m</a>, and rose further to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sales-surpass-166m-worldwide">16.6m by August</a>. A year after it made its Tarnished debut, it was revealed Elden Ring had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-an-astonishing-20m-copies">sold 20m copies</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Elden Ring has likely seen a boost in sales recently, as anticipation for its Shadow of the Erdtree expansion ramps up. Shadow of the Erdtree is set to release later this month, on 21st June, across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pre-order/9n5p5sc2rz7k">Xbox X/S</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pre-order/9n5p5sc2rz7k">Xbox One</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer contributor Emma Kent has been hands-on with Elden Ring's DLC already, stating the expansion "feels like a FromSoftware greatest hits album".</p>
<p>"Shadow of the Erdtree already has the look and feel of an absolute epic. With its sombre atmosphere, intricate worldbuilding and cheeky level design, it has all the ingredients required for an additional chapter of Elden Ring's sprawling narrative," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-brings-further-depth-and-grandeur-to-fromsoftwares-masterpiece">Eurogamer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree preview</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24176933/adventure-time-movie-rebecca-sugar-side-quests-heyo-bmo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there-will-be-an-adventure-time-movie-from-rebecca-sugar-patrick-mchale-and-adam-muto.899265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176933/adventure-time-movie-rebecca-sugar-side-quests-heyo-bmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="86F9Tg">Cartoon Network is in production on an <em>Adventure Time</em> movie, featuring the talents of <em>Adventure Time</em> veterans Rebecca Sugar, Patrick McHale, and Adam Muto, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/global/adventure-time-movie-rebecca-sugar-patrick-mchale-two-spinoff-series-1236034970/">reports Variety</a>. </p>
<p id="tcVYyk">There’s scant more news about the project, like whether it’ll be released theatrically or on the Max streaming service, or which of <em>Adventure Time</em>’s sprawling cast it’ll focus on, but that lineup of creators should catch the interest of any fan of the venerable animation series. </p>
<p id="nPA0tN">The movie appears to be the first new major work from Sugar since the close of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23964548/steven-universe-stevonnie-queer-animation"><em>Steven Universe</em></a> and <em>Steven Universe Future.</em> McHale made his post-<em>AT</em> name as the creator of the beloved <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/25/13329508/over-the-garden-wall-cartoon-network-halloween"><em>Over the Garden Wall</em></a> miniseries, while Muto has continued to shepherd <em>Adventure Time</em> through a series of spinoff specials and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23894698/adventure-time-fionna-cake-review-ice-king-finale-explained-simon-betty"><em>Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake</em></a>, already renewed for a second season. </p>
<p id="tm8l82">Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network have also greenlit two spinoff series specifically aimed at a child audience — an interesting distinction to make from the movie. <em>Adventure Time: Side Quests</em> will take child audiences back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eUrwYQe3Dw">Finn and Jake’s pre-hero childhood days</a> for lore-light standalone episodes, while <em>Adventure Time: Heyo BMO</em> will aim at the preschool audience, in what appears to be a claymation series starring the lovable robot BMO and maybe Shelby the worm?</p>

In the bottom-right biome of <em>Animal Well</em>’s map, you’ll find two rooms that contain a total of five cats locked in cages. You may notice that above each cage is a black box with five lines, and those lines light up if you play the Animal Flute. If you play the right sequence of notes, the cage will unlock and the cat inside can run free. So how, exactly, do you figure out what songs to play?<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>In truth, if you’ve <em>just</em> encountered the cat cages in <em>Animal Well</em>, don’t worry about hunting down the songs you need to play just yet. Freeing the cats isn’t necessary to complete the game’s first layer. In fact, you’ll need to see the credits in <em>Animal Well</em> before you can organically solve this puzzle on your own. <strong>Your reward for freeing the cats is an item that will prove essential once you’re tracking down all 64 hidden eggs, but before that, it won’t necessarily help you out</strong>.</p><p>Nothing’s stopping you from looking up the songs and freeing the cats right away, mind you. So if that’s what you’re here for, we’ve got you covered. But before we get into that, let’s give you some more tips in case you think you can solve this puzzle on your own.</p><h2 id="h345"><a id=""></a>What you need to figure out the caged cats’ songs on your own</h2><p>If you want to figure out how to free the cats on your own, you’ll need the following items</p><p>1: The <strong>Animal Flute</strong> (you should have this by now)<br> 2: The <strong>Lantern</strong> (obtained in the final area of the game’s first layer)<br> 3: The <strong>Top</strong> (obtained in the egg room after collecting 32 eggs)</p><p><strong>I highly recommend getting the UV Lantern</strong>, which is tied to exploring the three areas hidden behind the “circular recess” gates. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-medals-e-k-s-medal-where-find-what-to-do-1851518877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-medals-e-k-s-medal-where-find-what-to-do-1851518877">You can check out our full guide about this here</a></span>. <strong>The B. B. Wand can also help you access at least one of the cat songs, though it’s not necessary</strong>. This is in a hidden area near where you saw the credit sequence play for the first time at the end of layer one.</p><p>From there, you want to explore the bottom-right biome and look for any series of five arrows chiseled into the background. The most obvious example of this is in the room where you first find the Ostrich spinning on the wheel (look at the wall after the Ostrich is gone). Take a screenshot of each sequence or write them down as you find them, and once you’ve collected all five, you’ll have everything you need to free the cats.</p><p>If that sounds like too much work for you, then here are the songs you want to play at each location.</p><h2 id="h346"><a id=""></a><em> Animal Well</em> caged cat songs</h2><p><strong>NOTE: If you just want the reward for accomplishing this ASAP, you’ll still need the Top item. </strong>So assuming you’ve already obtained 32 eggs, here are the songs you need to play.</p><figure id="" data-id="cf9431e7d29c0af4e591b78c3672e0ef" data-recommend-id="image://cf9431e7d29c0af4e591b78c3672e0ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Animal Well screenshot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Animal Well screenshot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bigmode</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf9431e7d29c0af4e591b78c3672e0ef" data-recommend-id="image://cf9431e7d29c0af4e591b78c3672e0ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Animal Well screenshot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h347"><a id=""></a><strong>Cat Room 1:</strong></h3><p>See the map above if you need to remember where this room is.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-complete-30-hours/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It’s great news for Star Wars fans with a critical work-life balance: Star Wars Outlaws will be just 30 hours in length. That’s still a substantial amount of meat on those sci-fi bones, but it’s slim enough that even the hardest-working individual could complete it in a few weeks. That’s the news from Julian Gerighty, the creative director working on the game at Ubisoft. </p>



<p>He also stressed that even for a completionist ticking every box possible, the game’s lifespan (pre-DLC, I guess) will last around 60 hours.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-still-plenty-to-do">Still Plenty to Do</h2>



<p>It’s assumed that there’s lots of content wrapped up in Star Wars Outlaws, but perhaps not the suffocating amount you’d find in a game like Assassin’s Creed. That’s the gist of what Gerighty was saying when <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/star-wars-outlaws-can-be-finished-in-30-hours-says-creative-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he spoke to VGC</a> recently, anyway. He promised that Outlaws won’t offer a swollen, oversaturated experience like Assassin’s Creed, but instead, it’ll be a more manageable title – and that was a very deliberate decision by the developer.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Very early on, we decided this is going to be a 25, 30 hours golden path adventure, 50 hours, 60 hours for completionists, and that is, for a guy with a family and a job, it’s still a fair amount of time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In his interview, Gerighty outlined some creative amendments that were made to Outlaws early on. For instance, the team had to cut swimming mechanics from the title, but in exchange, they brought in playable minigames – which are sure to be a hit with Star Wars fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws is due to hit platforms on August 30, with a couple of narrative-based expansions set to launch sometime after.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/double-exposure%E2%80%99s-best-edition-gets-you-access-two-weeks-before-launch.899256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-editions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure was just revealed by Square Enix and Deck Nine, with fans worldwide being stunned by the sudden reappearance of Max Caulfield. As the lead in the inaugural title of the series almost a decade ago, Caulfield served as the introduction to the franchise for many players, becoming an iconic presence and a firm fan favourite character even all these years later.</p>



<p>Recently, the various editions of Double Exposure were revealed across multiple platforms, and it has been confirmed that buying the best edition will net you access to the first two chapters of the game <strong>two weeks earlier than anyone else</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tough-times-for-spoilers">Tough Times for Spoilers</h2>



<p>For those not in the know, Life is Strange is a unique franchise that follows characters with ‘abilities’ as they navigate complex and often emotional scenarios. In the first game, we controlled time, in the second game, we assumed the role of two brothers, the youngest of which could move things with his mind. In the third game – True Colors – we played as Chloe, a young woman with the ability to read minds and emotions.</p>



<p>Max Caulfield’s return is a spectacle to be sure, and from the first trailer, it looks like she’s picked up a few more abilities all these years later. In Double Exposure, Max can tear into alternate universes and watch as parallel stories unfold.</p>



<p>Now, the fact that Life is Strange is <strong>heavily </strong>driven by a winding narrative, it stands to reason that spoilers will, one way or another, destroy the point of playing the game. Each title has given way to twists, turns, unexpected pitfalls, and heartbreaking scenes that leave the player gasping. With the best edition giving the first two chapters away <strong>two weeks </strong>before launch, players getting a standard edition will need to avoid social media for half a month or risk ruin.</p>



<p>Here are the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874000/Life_is_Strange_Double_Exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">various editions of Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>:</p>



<p><strong>Standard  Edition</strong></p>



<p>Comes with the full game <strong>only</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Deluxe Edition</strong></p>



<p>Comes with the full base game, and the Spooky and Decades outfit packs.</p>



<p><strong>Ultimate Edition</strong></p>



<p>Comes with the full base game, the Spooky, Decades, Final Fantasy VII, Fan Favourite, and Paw Prints outfit packs, ‘exclusive cat content’, and of course, two weeks early access to the first and second chapters of the game.</p>



<p>The game’s Standard Edition will retail for around $49.99, but the Ultimate Edition will set you back a pretty penny – $74.99 to be precise.</p>



<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure will be released globally on October 29, 2024.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ELDEN RING – Official "The Journey So Far" Catch Up Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Created by Steven Nass and Peter Henningsen, FromSoft Word is more challenging than your first fight against Manus, Father of the Abyss. If you're used to typing up a storm and editing later, you're going to be in for a hell of a fight. The Dark Souls influence is also evident through the choice of font and <em>familiar </em>background music, and the real challenge here is to see how much you can type before you're finally stopped by a grammatical error.

In Monster Hunter World, you would need to load up the story quest, go into the map, and find the monster, which would trigger the cutscene. After the cutscene finished, you could invite other players to your hunt. This was only true the first time you did each story mission, but it made playing co-op more difficult than most players would like.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"While we can say that there will be some segments where you have to witness certain parts of the story before you can actually start some of those co-op elements, in the background we've taken care to make sure that players are always connected or they can stay always connected in terms of co-op parties," Tokuda said.</p><p dir="ltr">Tokuda said that while there would still be a few instances where a cutscene would need to be viewed before you can do co-op, the overall headache would be lessened thanks to matchmaking improvements. Players can stay partied up, even though these cutscenes and the background matchmaking is always happening, so you can quickly get more players in once the cutscene ends. There will even be a notification as soon as you can invite other players to your section. While it sounds like players will have to still deal with some of these cutscenes, Capcom has taken the time to make it a much smoother and easier experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Rise did not have these issues, but that was due to there being separate single-player and multiplayer story missions, with cutscenes taking place before the mission and not during. Monster Hunter Wilds is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2025.</p>

Capcom has said that Wilds will feature herds of large monsters, giving players more monsters to contend with during each hunt.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with GameSpot, which you can read the entirety of below, Monster Hunter Wilds director Yuya Tokuda said that the game will blow past the limitations of previous entries. Instead of the max of three monsters running around at once during a hunt there will now be herds of large monsters, similar to herds of smaller monsters present in previous games. Now when you reach your target, you may have to contend with multiple of that monster at once. There will also be even more large monsters around, which Tokuda said will create more dynamic moments in the gameplay.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Monster Hunter Wilds Gameplay Trailer | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Tokuda said that, for example, the lightning monster shown during the Summer Game Fest trailer is an apex monster and the way it interacts with other monsters can change based on the number and type of monster present. It will also act differently depending on the environment, which can change thanks to weather and other shifting aspects. Tokuda said that all of this comes together to really make the upgraded environments really shine in Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p dir="ltr">Tokuda said this as part of an interview with GameSpot's Jean-Luc Seipke, alongside Monster Hunter Wilds executive director and art director Kaname Fujioka and Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto. You can read the interview in its entirety below. Monster Hunter Wilds launches in 2025 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This interview has been edited for clarity and length.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Where were you able to elevate aspects of Monster Hunter, both in gameplay and presentation, since this is the first entry built for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Kaname Fujioka: </strong>Yeah, so thank you for your question. So really what we've been able to accomplish with the new hardware is a lot of what we've been able to show you so far with the, first of all, the dynamic environmental changes that are part of the overall concept of the game, which is really exemplified in the contrast that we're trying to strike with the sense of dangerous and aggressive, intimidating nature, contrasted with the bountiful environments that we've been able to show you. All of that is dispersed and explicitly possible with the new hardware that is available to us now.</p><p dir="ltr">That also includes the number of monsters that we're able to present in the game and how they pack and they herd into large groups, not only with the amount of numbers that we're showing you, but also the precise behaviors that they each have. They all have their own desires, their own unique identities, behaviors, and this large-scale environment that's not only filled with monsters, but also filled with humans, all real time dynamically changing environment. So that seamlessness and the real time dynamic changes, everything's always moving together, interacting with each other, that's all maybe made possible by the new hardware available to us.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are there any interesting ways the team wants to have the monsters and even the humans now interact with each other almost dynamically in Monster Hunter Wilds?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Yuya Tokuda: </strong>Yeah, thank you. Really, what we were trying to present with the monster actions is just powered up nature of the ecosystems that we've been able to express in the game. Up until now, we've only really been able to display three monsters of three different types in the field, but now that's really ballooned into these packs and herds of monsters at the… that you've been able to see, kind of what we've been able to do in previous games with small monsters now on a much larger scale with large monsters also interacting in these huge groups of monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">So being able to really detail or express these ecosystems in a really detailed fashion is what we've been really excited to be able to accomplish here with Wilds. So for example, what you were able to see with the sandstorm and the Apex Monster that appeared there, that lightning-based monster, and how it interacts with the other monsters that appear only in certain kinds of the environment, that kind of dynamism, that kind of constantly changing environment is something that we've been really able to accomplish and we really want to push that aspect.</p><p dir="ltr">And specifically one thing that we're excited about in some of the smaller interactions with the monsters is seeing the small monsters latch onto, jump onto and invite the larger monsters and that thing happens more dynamically and more naturally.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Were there any major lessons or fan feedback from Monster Hunter Worlds or Rise that the team wanted to integrate into Wilds?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tokuda: </strong>Yeah, we really valued the input and opinions of players from Worlds and Rise, and listening to that as we approach and design Monster Hunter Wilds. To get into specifics, for example, now that the map is a lot bigger, we were really focused on making it easier for players to navigate the world, not just in terms of the geography but the verticality as well. There are definitely instances in previous games where players, they did have the Scout Flies guiding them towards the monsters, but there might've been situations where a monster moved locations and on the way there the monster's no longer there, it's moved somewhere else.</p><p dir="ltr">But now with the introduction of the Sacred as a trusty mounting support, it can automatically move toward your quest target or the quest monster, making it much, much easier to stay in the hunt and know how to get to where you're going. Not only that, but the map as well, it's a lot more detailed, it has a lot more features that also illustrate the verticality and the environments, so making it much, much easier for players to get around.</p><p dir="ltr">But yeah, we've really been trying to really introduce the game with a lot more qualitative improvements, so we're listening to players' feedback.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>In Monster Hunter Worlds players would have to wait for a mid-mission cutscene before they could join co-op. Has the team made co-op more seamless for story missions?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tokuda: </strong>Yeah, we've definitely taken that feedback to heart. And while we can say that the story really... We've done a much, much deeper guidance to the story this time around, we're really trying to expand on the immersive story experience for players and that's part of the concept of the seamlessness of the world and transitioning from the cutscenes right into the gameplay back into the action.</p><p dir="ltr">So we've really powered up that aspect of it, but at the same time we've been listening to the feedback of the player and the ability, and so while we can say that there will be some segments where you have to witness certain parts of the story before you can actually start some of those co-op elements, in the background we've taken care to make sure that players are always connected or they can stay always connected in terms of co-op parties and there's a lot more features now to match up... That background matching is always going on, so players will be notified as soon as they can do quests together and do gameplay together, and it's been made a lot more convenient and easy to do all around. So they've taken care to design the story with that in mind.</p><p dir="ltr">So you can rest easy in that multiplayer, that co-op aspect and that multiplayer aspect is something we've taken care to incorporate inside this game.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are there any changes to the weapons or move sets in Monster Hunter Wilds that the team is really excited about?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tokuda: </strong>On the whole... Well, to summarize what's going on in Wilds is we are presenting the full lineup of 14 different weapon types and each of those different weapon types is going to have new moves, new action, new mechanics. One of the major things that's shared among all the new updated weapons is that there were going to be moves now where in previous games you had to be stationary when the moves were executed. Now there's more positioning available you can move while performing those moves to allow you to better yourself towards monsters. So on the whole, everything has been updated with that in mind.</p><p dir="ltr">And in terms of specific weapon style mechanics, some of the greatest changes that are made to the Light Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun, and the Hunting Horn, we've done a really kind good job in making sure that they all feel a lot better, a lot crunchier here in Wilds. So we really think that you can look forward to that.</p><p dir="ltr">So we've also started to reveal some of the weapons as well, but one of the biggest things as well with all the weapon type changes is that there's now a focus mode that allows you to aim attacks in the guards, but also it allows you to perform attacks towards… that cause extra damage. And those special attacks that are available in focus mode lead into all kinds of new combos as well. And there's also... Or I guess this is a temp term here, but basically a weakness exploit attack basically that is possible with the focus mode, so that's also a major part of the updates weapons as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Both Monster Hunter World and Rise featured a ton of post-launch content, including crossovers with other games. Will Monster Hunter Wilds receive a similar level of post-launch support?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ryozo Tsujimoto: </strong>Yeah, I think it's a good question. If you've been following the Monster Hunter series, then you'll know that we really do take a lot of care to give the players a lot of content that they can enjoy, even after the game's released. But really, yeah, we can only stress that we've only been able to show you a fraction of the game and we're really hyper-focused right now on delivering the best product possible for the main game, right?</p><p dir="ltr">So you can definitely expect us to keep players interest and keep players really into the experience, even after the release. But for now we're still just putting our nose to the grinder for the main game and trying to build the best game there.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Of the monsters already shown, what new moves are you excited about and how do these monsters fit into the larger ecosystem of Monster Hunter Wilds?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fujioka: </strong>Basically, it's a difficult question to answer because there's so much about the monsters that we want to show that we like in what we've been able to do. But one of the things that first mentioned is basically how we've been able to show the differences in monster characteristics and how the monsters behave and act in the ecosystem depending on some of the new herding mechanics, for example, how threatening some monsters are and how that threatening level increases when they're in larger herds and larger numbers, versus how they can still have different characteristics expressed when they're on their own. So some of the… for example, when they herd, they behave a bit differently when they are on their own. But you can also expect that all of the individual monsters that, they also have their own unique characterization, they have their own unique characteristics expressed very in fine detail with a lot of care taken to them.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, the Apex Monster that you've been able to see in the Woodward play that we've shown you, that flying monster with the lightning attacks, that monster, for example, is something that we've taken a great liking to and we expect a lot of that Monster Hunter level attention to detail and the way that it behaves individually.</p><p dir="ltr">So you can look forward to that. Another aspect personally that… is looking forward to is that he's taken a lot of care… has taking a lot of care into how the main monster, which we haven't been able to show you details about the main monster yet, but how it's integrated into the story and how its ecology is also built into the nature of the story and how that unfolds is something that we've really liked how it's turned out. So we can't wait to show people how that's going to look.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds has a big emphasis on mounts, including combat while riding. How much of that is in the game and are there monsters where you would want to be mounted the entire fight?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tokuda: </strong>Yeah, so really to put it as simply as possible, the basic concept of dismounting or being on the ground during combat is unchanged. That is still the basic overlying principle of hunting and Monster Wilds. The Sacred is designed as a [mount] first and foremost, and if you get the chance, you'll probably see us a bit more in the demo play if you get the chance to see that. But it's a support role for the player. So the Sacred will come in when the player is in trouble, when they're in a pinch to help out. You can mount it quickly to gain some distance and to reposition yourself. And this is built into the groundwork of what the Sacred accomplishes.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, you'll get supplies into the Sacred pouch at the start of a quest. It'll have extra supplies for you. It has a weapon sling that allows you to switch very quickly between your main and your sub weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">And that support role is integrated into just how it's been designed. The Sacred itself doesn't actually attack monsters, and so when you can perform some mounted attacks while you're on the Sacred, those mounted attacks fit the purpose of providing extra mobility for you as you're in the hunt, or for leading monsters away or quickly getting from point to point. And that's also expressed in the fact that you can get onto the Sacred quickly to gather material with the Hook Slinger and to use that quickly as a Slinger shot, and things like that. So, the Sacred is allowing for all of that, and it gives you more options but it's not really going to be based around the mounted test.</p>

                <p>It's been a while since we've had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> concert--or "immersive music experience" as Epic may call it--but the next one is coming soon, and it's the first worthy of a mosh pit. "Metallica: Fuel. Fire. Fury." is an in-game concert coming to Fortnite later this month and for a limited time.</p><p>The event kicks off on June 22 with three showings, followed by three more the next day. Here's the full schedule:</p><p>Saturday, June 22:</p><ul><li>11 AM PT / 2 PM ET</li><li>2 PM PT / 5 PM ET</li><li>8 PM PT / 11 PM ET</li></ul><p>Sunday, June 23:</p><ul><li>7 AM PT / 10 AM ET</li><li>11 AM PT / 2 PM ET</li><li>2 PM PT / 5 PM ET</li></ul><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrtWx80NP-Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mrtWx80NP-Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The concert will feature six of Metallica's songs from the band's illustrious, decades-spanning catalog, created by the VR, AR, and metaverse studio Magnopus, which built the experience for Fortnite. Parties of up to four players can head to the show together. If you've previously seen Fortnite concerts like those starring Travis Scott or Ariana Grande, you know to expect an audiovisual spectacle. The concert won't be playable after these dates conclude, so be sure to make the time if it sounds like a good time. Spoiler: It's gonna be a good time.</p><h2>More Metallica in Fortnite</h2><p>But for the Metallica (or Fortnite) devotees, there's a lot more of the metal band's influence to be found all over the game. First off, the new season of Fortnite Festival is all about the metal band. You can read more about that in our coverage of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-season-4-adds-lots-of-metallica-and-a-pvp-mode/1100-6524173/" data-ref-id="1100-6524173">Fortnite Festival Season 4</a>.</p><p>In battle royale and Zero Build, you'll find a <strong>new traversal item/weapon</strong> in the Ride The Lightning guitars, which create a trail in your wake on which allies can ride.

<p data-characters="219" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, the Ubisoft title stemming from James Cameron’s <em>Avatar</em> franchise, is set to receive its first story DLC. <em>The Sky Breake</em>r, the upcoming story expansion, is going to be released on July 16.</p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">Ubisoft released the trailer for <em>The Sky Breaker</em>, which showed the Na’vi celebrating their victory after the events of the base game. The celebrations are cut short when a ship crashes down at the festival, carrying the notion that the fight for survival and their home planet is not over yet.</p> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">The DLC will introduce The Heart of the Plains, a new location, and players will also get to take on a new enemy type known as the AMP Defender. This mech-suit carries a riot shield, as if it was not already hard enough to defeat the mechs with bows and arrows.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - The Sky Breaker Story Pack Trailer | Ubisoft Forward" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWq6m8rQMHw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">The celebration shown during the start of the trailer is known as The Great Games, and there will be several challenges themed around it for players to complete. Character progression will also be extended through this DLC with 25 more ranks to gain and spend skill points. Players can now reach master crafter status, and there will be a new Legendary rarity category for items.</p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">There is a Season Pass available which grants you access to both of the planned story DLCs,<em> The Skybreaker</em> and <em>Secrets of the Spires</em>. The second DLC is planned for autumn 2024. The Season Pass costs $39.99 on the Ubisoft Store, and requires the base game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/classic-doom-gets-the-shield-saw-from-dark-ages-thanks-to-this-mod/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=classic-doom-gets-the-shield-saw-from-dark-ages-thanks-to-this-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="365" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Now that we’ve all seen the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doom-the-dark-ages-takes-doomguy-back-to-his-days-as-a-sentinel/">trailer for <em>The Dark Ages</em></a>, the brand-new <em>Doom</em> game that will be taking us back to medieval times, there was at least one thing that stood out for me: the Shield Saw. The teaser showed all the usual chaos and demon-slaying we know and love about the series, but the saw-looking shield in the Slayer’s possession is next-level.</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">Well, if you’re intrigued about getting to try it out on the denizens of hell, your chance has already arrived. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/a-modder-has-already-brought-doom-the-dark-ages-new-shield-saw-to-the-1993-original-and-its-pretty-close-to-perfect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a>, a modder has already added the “Shield Saw” seen in the <em>Dark Ages</em> trailer into the original <em>Doom</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">The mod comes from user Craneo, in which they say they just “kinda ended up trying to make actual decorate [sic] for it.” Soon after, they made the .WAD file available, which you can download from Google Drive <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NI9McMkc7WdTxEwkU_N0_ha2R8FDUAVr/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-a-slice-of-violence" data-injectable="false">A slice of violence</h2> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true">You can check out the brief footage above before you decide to download the mod. Essentially, it seems to replace the classic chainsaw from the OG in favor of the newfangled Shield Saw.</p>
 <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">We get to see the Doom Slayer hacking away at Zombies and Imps as per, but the real USP comes when they throw it at oncoming enemies. Upon contact, it basically turns monsters into a fine paste, so it’s a pretty beefy weapon.</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">It’s also just one of countless examples of how quickly the modding community can move. Remember, the teaser for the new <em>Doom</em> only went live a couple of days ago, and Craneo’s mod was released less than 24 hours later. Efficient, I’d say.</p>

<p data-characters="311" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As one of the most popular survival horror franchises in gaming history, it’s not hard to imagine that <em>Resident Evil</em> typically sells quite well. Still, it’s impressive to learn that the eighth installment – <em>Village</em> – has now surpassed 10 million units since coming out just over three years ago.</p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">A recent release from <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240611.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> says that not only has <em>RE8</em> hit this milestone, it’s also the fastest to achieve this across the whole <em>Resident Evil</em> series. This also means that, as of March 31, 2024, the entire franchise has sold more than 157 million copies worldwide. That’s since it all began way back in 1996.</p> <figure data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Welcome to the family, son!</p><p>Resident Evil 7 biohazard joins Apple’s family on July 2nd, coming to iPhone 15 Pro models and every iPad and Mac with the M1 chip or later!</p><p>Resident Evil 2 is also in development for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. <a href="https://t.co/bjSi7svSBS">pic.twitter.com/bjSi7svSBS</a></p></div>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1800186297782612202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">Selling 10 million units is impressive by anyone’s standards, and it shows that the most lucrative horror brand in all of gaming is still going strong after almost 30 years.</p> <h2 id="h-mobile-ports-are-likely-the-reason" data-injectable="false">Mobile ports are likely the reason</h2> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">The release from Capcom goes on to say that not only has the Gold Edition of <em>Village</em> been partly responsible for the recent increase in sales, but the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/you-can-now-play-resident-evil-village-on-iphone-and-ipad/">iPhone and iPad ports released last October</a> have also likely played a part.</p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">Speaking of which, the developer also announced that <em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em> will be coming to Apple products as of July 2. The post from X embedded above says that <em>RE7</em> will be available on iPhone 15 Pro, plus all iPads and Macs that sport the M1 chip.</p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="false">If that wasn’t enough, <em>Resident Evil 2</em> is also coming to Apple at some point. No release date for that port yet, but it’s currently “in development.” Also, we can assume Capcom is referring to the remake rather than the original that came out in 1998. You know what, either would be grand.</p>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While it’s been out of the limelight for a fair long while now, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-division-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s <em>The Division 2</em></a> is silently trucking along the sidelines. Updates are still coming in, alongside a somewhat modest seasonal content model. But there are some big changes coming, like the upcoming seasonal characters.</p> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">Specifically, <em>The Division 2</em> appears to be adopting one of <em>Diablo 4</em>‘s seasonal progression tricks wherein players interested in progressing through the live content of the game need to create a temporary new player character whenever a new season is released. If this sounds at odds with <em>The Division 2</em>‘s previous content model, you’re not wrong, and <em>TD2</em>‘s players are predictably unhappy with this decision.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-division-2-s-new-seasonal-changes-are-going-live-in-year-6-season-2" data-injectable="false">The Division 2’s new seasonal changes are going live in Year 6 Season 2</h2> <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">In concrete terms, Ubisoft has recently clarified what its plans are for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2221490/view/4151835704483478263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Division 2</em>‘s sixth year of live content</a>. There is a <em>lot</em> of stuff to take into account here, but the crux of it is the following:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>A unification of base <em>Division 2</em> and <em>Warlords of New York</em>‘s respective endgames.</li> <li>Removal of the World Tier difficulty system.</li> <li>Removal of the Gear Score system.</li> <li>Unlocking the majority of the game’s gameplay systems at level 40.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">This is, obviously, a <em>massive</em> re-envisioning of how <em>The Division 2</em> works at a core progression level, and it would’ve been a major enough change to shake up the playerbase all on its own. All of the changes outlined above will be going live very shortly, as part of the new Year 6 Season 1 release, but there’s more to come.</p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft is making one hugely significant change by introducing the concept of “seasonal characters” into the mix. To engage with <em>The Division 2</em>‘s seasonal content from Year 6 Season 2 onwards (i.e. not <em>this</em> season but the next, at the time of writing), you will need to create an all-new character and level them up from zero. It takes but the shortest of scrolls down the comments of Ubisoft’s patch notes on Reddit to see how the community feels about this particular change.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true">The good news is that all the earned gear and XP you accrue as part of your seasonal character’s progress through the narrative <em>will</em> get rolled back into your main, legacy characters as seasons wrap up. With that in mind, it’s not a <em>total</em> loss, though this does mean that our legacy characters will simply no longer be relevant for the latest content, which is a strange concept.</p>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">Arguably, it’s simply too late for Ubisoft to be pushing such significant changes to <em>The Division 2</em> in the game’s lifecycle. Further, some of <em>The Division 2</em>‘s gameplay systems, such as Weapon Expertise, aren’t being changed to accommodate the presence of seasonal characters, so it’s all quite strange to see in action.</p> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="false">We’ll just have to wait and see how these changes pan out in practice. Whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing that Ubisoft clarified what’s happening so far in advance, though, it’s hard to tell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and From Software have announced that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>sales have reached another impressive milestone just over a week before a major DLC expansion arrives.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1800890964925366476" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) earlier today, Bandai Namco revealed that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has crossed 25 million sales, which is pretty impressive for a game that's more than two years old.</p>
<p>It's likely that a new surge of Tarnished discovered the game after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">release date</a> for its&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>expansion was announced back in February. Further information for the expansion, including the setup for its (characteristically oblique) narrative, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer">revealed last month</a>.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has been one of the publisher's most successful games to date; last year, Bandai Namco <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-announces-declining-financial-results-for-games-as-armored-core-6-cant">revealed declining game sales</a> owing to the fact that&nbsp;<em>Armored Core 6</em>, despite proving "popular", could not compete with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-announces-growing-financial-results-due-to-elden-rings-continuing-strong">sales boost</a> in the same period the year prior.</p>
<p>Around the time of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s release, Bandai Namco <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-top-12-million-as-creators-look-to-expand-ip">declared its intention</a> to "expand" the game's IP, and there have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tencent-working-mobile-version-hit-console-game-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-02-06/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">murmurs</a> that the publisher is working with Tencent to create a mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, although nothing has been officially revealed yet.</p>
<p>Honestly, as a huge&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>fan, I'm rather hoping nothing comes of this desire, because I don't want to see the IP sullied by underwhelming projects that dilute the original game. Still, who knows? The&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>mobile game might be great. Ahem.</p>

<p>If you somehow haven't heard of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, it's an open-world action-RPG developed by&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>studio From Software.</p>
<p>The game transposes those games' characteristically brutal third-person combat into an open-world environment, tasking players with traveling to various locations and defeating demigods in order to become the Elden Lord of the Lands Between.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://poppyplaytime.com/products/smiling-critters-pride-tee" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Smiling Critters Pride Tee</a>, as it's called, features eight&nbsp;<em>Poppy Playtime&nbsp;</em>mascot toys arranged in the colors of the rainbow, with CatNap carrying a Pride flag in its disturbingly long tail.</p>
<p>Alongside CatNap, the other critters featured on the shirt are as follows: PickyPiggy, Bobby BearHug, DogDay, KickinChicken, Hoppy Hopscotch, CraftyCorn, and Bubba Bubbaphant. Naturally, PickyPiggy's color isn't in the standard rainbow, but he's just happy to be an ally, and you should be too!</p>

<p>In fact, Mob Entertainment <a href="https://x.com/mobgamesstudios/status/1798397157344452945" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced earlier this month</a> that it has donated $2000 to The Trevor Project to celebrate Pride Month, further going on to affirm that "LGBTQIA+ rights are human rights". Good for you, Mob Entertainment.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Poppy Playtime&nbsp;</em>is a pretty popular franchise, with the first game (which is needed to play subsequent chapters) attracting tens of thousands of reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>As such, Mob Entertainment's message has the potential to reach a pretty sizable audience, and given the positivity of that message, that's something to be celebrated. Let's hope the shirt gets some serious sales.</p>

<p>The games revolve around a series of toys that have, as you might expect, gone murder-crazy, and you must survive their rampage in a derelict toy factory filled with puzzles to solve and monstrous toys to avoid.</p>
<p><em>Poppy Playtime</em>'s first installment launched in 2021 and is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poppy-playtime-chapter-2-released-chapter-1-free-forever">free to play</a>, but if you want to continue the story, you'll need to buy Chapters 2 and 3.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-forward-presentation-and-impressions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As the period fans have been begging Ubisoft forever since Desmond’s first days in the Animus, Assassin’s Creed is finally exploring Feudal Japan with a new story and dual protagonist setup. Book-ending the Ubisoft Forward press conference and our last appointment of Summer Game Fest’s Play Days, Ubisoft invited us to take a deeper behind-closed-doors look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-13-minutes-gameplay/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>During a guided presentation on PlayStation 5, Ubisoft presented an intimate look following the first assassination mission involving Yasuke, the more brash and directly honorable of the dual protagonists. Standing approximately six feet tall, Yasuke is head and shoulders above most Japanese retainers and common folk that adorn the streets of Fukuchiyama. As Ubisoft Quebec puts it, there’s no social stealth for Yasuke for quite obvious reasons. Each presentation has been quite cagey about bringing up Yasuke’s skin color despite it being such a notable part of the history that resulted in him being one of the first foreign retainers under Nobunaga Oda. Yet at the same time, the music that builds up once Yasuke enters combat infuses the traditional Japanese shakuhachi and koto melodies with hip-hop beats.</p>
<p>It was the second half of the presentation that deviated greatly from what Ubisoft Forward showed off with the mission to infiltrate a castle and eliminate an allegedly corrupt Lord Hayashi. In the moments leading into the mission, the UI is populated with hints about surface-level information about the target rather than just another icon for the minimap. As players walk through the level and eavesdrop on conversations, information populates. Eventually, the lord is indicated as spending time wandering through the nightly gardens due to insomnia, giving a clear indication of the end goal.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ACSH_Screenshot_YasukeTraining_240610_1pm_PST-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As Yasuke, players lose the assassination tools, such as the grappling hook and eagle sight, in exchange for raw power. Rather than trying to jump over and scramble over a locked gate, Yasuke can instead shoulder tackle and burst through like a wrecking ball. Yasuke can go loud and alert anyone in the immediate vicinity by utilizing a matchlock tanegashima rifle that tears through armor and bone alike.</p>
<p>His playstyle in combat is about as far from the assassin’s style as one can get. A massive studded club was Yasuke’s primary weapon in the Assassin’s Creed Shadows demos, which would be swung around like a baseball bat and squish ashigaru skulls like overripe tomatoes. For enemies that take more than a single strike to down, Yasuke’s mighty swings rip through the air and smash into their armor to strip their breastplates off in the streets. Charged attacks and a trio of special skills each operated on cooldowns mix up his brutish swings all the while having the fortitude to shrug off intense blows.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Naoe hearkens back to the more refined assassination styles. In addition to the single hidden blade, this plucky shinobi wields a shorter katana and a chain-and-sickle weapon called a kusarigama. With the latter, Naoe can swing a massive chain around for crowd control but also stun enemies with the weighted end before closing the distance and stabbing the foe with the sickle end (sometimes taking more than one stab to finish them out in brutal fashion). As a much smaller and more nimble combatant, Naoe does more with her agile frame to dodge and jump around the battlefield to sidestep enemy attacks that glow red (blue-highlighted attacks, on the other hand, can be blocked and parried).</p>
<p>Ubisoft Quebec omitted a year for the period during which this particular Assassin’s Creed Shadows mission took place, although there’s still a certain range of possibilities, starting with 1579, when Yasuke arrived in Japan as a Jesuit slave and sword-bearer for the missionaries who touched ground. The Honno-ji Incident of Summer 1582 marks the death of Nobunaga Oda, so I would narrow down the majority of Shadows’ storyline to fall within the three-year window.</p>
<p>In talking with other journalists, there was the concern that Ubisoft would provide a cold opening and tutorial segment with Yasuke in chains before being brought to Japan, but there would have to be a great degree of sensitivity and care that I feel an Assassin’s Creed title is not yet capable of portraying despite the multinational development cast. Similarly, the assassination mission presented an early encounter between Yasuke and Naoe to work as colleagues rather than competing anti-Templar fellows. In the art centerpieces featuring Naoe, she is marked by a scar below her right eye that seems indicative of a key moment or failed mission.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ACSH_Screenshot_NachiFalls_240610_1pm_PST-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is looming on the horizon with a release that fans won’t have to wait much longer to check out. Ubisoft Quebec’s latest open-world action-adventure will be released on November 15th, 2024 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC (Luna, Ubisoft+ and<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/assassins-creed-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Epic Game Store</a>) and Mac (Apple Silicon), as well as iPadOS.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds Preview – Wildly Impressive]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-wildly-impressive</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-%E2%80%93-wildly-impressive.899199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-wildly-impressive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>First-person shooters have let players carry two (or even more!) weapons for decades. But I can’t explain the excitement I felt when I saw the hunter swap weapons in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>
<p>This was mid-hunt, too—though <em>Wilds </em>also blurs the meaning of “mid-hunt,” thanks to its seamless world design. In many ways, this feels like the next generation of the franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feels like a more direct sequel to <em>World </em>than <em>Rise </em>did, if that makes sense. It looks beautiful in motion, with a certain level of grandeur that befits the monstrous scale of the creatures you can fight.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Mount and Do&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/monster-hunter-rise"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a>, <em>Wilds </em>features a companion mount called Seikrets. They move as quickly as Palamutes, but they seem more agile, able to dodge enemy attacks at a moment’s notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, you can pick up items and interact with the environment while on your Seikret, which is very handy considering that the map we saw is twice as large as usual, according to a Capcom spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Players can attack while mounted as well. But more importantly, you can equip a second weapon and swap between them while on your Seikret.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the preview we saw at Summer Game Fest Play Days, the hunter started with a great sword and heavy bowgun, swapping freely between them depending on the situation. Afterward, he equipped a long sword and dual blades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re new to the franchise, it’s hard to explain how big of a paradigm shift this is. It’s sort of like going from a 1v1 fighting game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6"><em>Street Fighter</em></a> to a team game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-new-saga-of-heroes"><em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em></a>. They’re both fighting games, but the approaches are wildly different.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Storming Into Battle&nbsp;</h2>
<p>For the preview, we saw a hunter take on an Alpha Doshaguma, a bulky four-legged beast. It could tank a lot of hits, and its speed required some mounted combat just to keep up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, its herd of three fellow Doshaguma made it hard to deal with, but the cunning use of another monster’s sand trap quickly whittled down the numbers for a more even encounter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This incredibly mobile fight eventually found its way to a naturally occurring storm, bathing the entire field in an eerie blue light and buffeting winds. Lightning occasionally strikes in this space, at yours and the monsters’ perils.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To amp up the stakes, storms also contain a dreaded apex monster. In an attempt to lure the apex to the Doshaguma, the player got one-shot from full health, really illustrating the risks in the storm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the storm though, the plains sung green, as a period of abundance hit the field. It suddenly became lush and verdant, with vigorwasps (that can heal you) being plentiful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other local flora and fauna changes with the weather; special attention was given to some birds building nests during the green season. Like with other <em>Monster Hunter</em> games, planning is absolutely vital—but so are improvising and making the best of the hand you’re dealt.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Seamless World of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This feels like the grandest entry in <em>Monster Hunter</em> to date, and a big part of it is just how few barriers there were in our preview. From the hub village, we saw the player talk to some NPCs, buy some cheese, set up camp, cook a meal, then find the Alpha Doshaguma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There wasn’t a single loading screen here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can just walk out of the village, find a monster, and start hitting it. The map shows all sorts of icons about the monsters around you, and you can mark one to immediately create a quest for yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a monster marked and your scoutflies are tracking it, you can even make your Seikret auto run to it. It’s a small convenience, but it’s great for if you faint and have to return to the fight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After beating a monster, the usual 60-second timer to carve materials shows up, but you don’t have to return to the village after that’s done. <em>Rise </em>also let you continue to explore after a quest, but it still felt compartmentalized from the hub. Here, it all feels more like a living, breathing open world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some logistic questions that I still have; like if you want to farm a specific monster, would you have to reload an instance of the world after killing it? What happens if you lead a monster to the village? Are there more maps with their own hub village within?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever the answers to these questions are, I’m absolutely on board for more of what Capcom’s serving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took me five tries to learn how to enjoy <em>Monster Hunter</em>, with <em>Rise </em>finally being the first one I “got.” And now that I understand what I’m on board for, I’m ready to set aside another 100 hours for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.&nbsp;</p>

  <p id="98cnF4">The Monster Hunter series has introduced players to an array of daunting biomes over the years. Forthcoming entry <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, however, invites you to inhabit an ecosystem with its own rules and cycles — as well as its own retaliations to your hostile presence.</p>
<p id="JLoXhQ">At a hands-off session presented by Capcom during Summer Game Fest 2024, the developer showcased the planning and execution of a hunt for around 40 minutes. Alongside some promising iterations on mechanics seen in recent entries — mainly drawing from <em>Monster Hunter World</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em> — <em>Wilds</em> has a bigger emphasis on presenting environments that breathe with life, and on reckoning with how your actions affect those environments.</p>
<p id="f2rIqL">The demo started with a short glimpse at the new central hub. The cat-like Palicoes are at it again, running the stands where you’ll be crafting and upgrading gear, prepping meals and feasting to gain buffs before hunts, and taking on requests. Once you get into an expedition, however, the structure is substantially different.</p>
<p id="19pHIV">In older Monster Hunter games, the hub served as the starting point for all missions. You’d often pick a quest to tackle, grab everything you needed, and the objective would automatically take you someplace else for a specific amount of time — rinse and repeat. Later entries, depending on the mission type, toyed with the idea of a more free-roaming approach, allowing you to perform multiple hunts or gather resources in one go within an interconnected area.</p>

<p id="pHdMv0"><em>Wilds</em> leans into this approach to such an absurd degree that the hub almost becomes an afterthought. As the developer guiding the demo explained, you’re free to stick around in a map for as long as you desire or need. Missions begin once you manually start the objective, such as attacking the monster you need to attack. Once you’re done, you get a flashy mission complete screen and you can continue on your way.</p>
<p id="hAf3qj">Moments after the demonstrator arrived at the Windward Plains biome, a number of notifications appeared on screen that indicated monster appearances and other key details. As time passed, I found their frequency a bit overwhelming. It’s not as bad as a social media feed — and certainly less toxic — but I’m hoping there will be options to filter information in the final game, so you can only get notified of what you need, instead of knowing everything that’s happening in the map while you’re busy trying not to get stomped or set on fire.</p>
<p id="6JYnaL">Considering just <em>how much</em> is happening, however, the notifications also seem like a necessary evil. A day-and-night cycle, as well as weather conditions, dictate what you’ll encounter within a map at any given time — not just whether or not the Rathalos you need to defeat to craft a new pair of boots is flying around, but also which resources and smaller wildlife you can find.</p>
<p id="FJ3Z4n">There are some extreme weather conditions that wildly affect the entire map. The demo took place in a desert-type biome that was quickly overshadowed by a sandstorm. This storm also led to lightning strikes at random, turning a gorgeous landscape into a series of death traps. Wildlife quickly took notice of this, too, with some monsters fleeing toward their nests inside a cavern to protect themselves, and birds flying away from trees.</p>

<p id="omx9u1">Such conditions might lose the element of surprise after a while. Similarly to notifications, I can see sandstorms becoming annoying if you’re being affected by them every 15 minutes. If the final game nails the pacing, however, the illusion of this living, breathing ecosystem will be much more believable.</p>
<p id="K5Az8j">Players can also take advantage of the environment and its hazards during hunts. In <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, you can make use of your gadgets to set environmental traps, like luring a creature that’s chasing you to a pile of rocks that will fall on its head from a cave’s ceiling. There are other returning mechanics, such as monsters fighting each other, that seem to interconnect with the protagonism of biomes in neat ways; for example, in the demo, a monster created a sand pit from underneath the sand, which became a trap for other creatures nearby that got dragged into it. I’m also intrigued to see how the herd system, in which a group of creatures of the same type patrol together with an alpha leading the charge, will play into the final game.</p>
<p id="VcvX0Z">It’s hard to judge how the overall experience of <em>Wilds</em> will feel, considering that repetition is a pillar of the series. Some of the new additions seem to be there to surprise the player at first glance, but there’s no knowing just how much they’ll interfere with your subsequent visits. From the bite-sized showcase I saw, however, it’s clear that the new structure of biomes invites you to stay for a good while, especially with the new mounts that make traversal faster.</p>
<p id="01rJz5">After the refinements made to the series in recent years, placing the focus on the spaces you wreck havoc in seems like the obvious next step. For all the marvelous detail packed into the biomes, I hope there’s stronger messaging around the environmental impact of taming not just wildlife, but an entire ecosystem, using its resources and rules to your advantage. As much as I enjoyed seeing Palicoes making cheese next to a monster farm or baby versions of creatures sitting in their nests, Monster Hunter has never been about sightseeing. Even if the environments of <em>Wilds</em> pose a challenge on top of the already deadly creatures inhabiting them, the tools at hand to overcome these obstacles are only increasing in number. Once more, it seems that damaging the ecosystem to craft better gear and become more proficient in your hunts is the point of the game.</p>
<p id="r1QRXi"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X at some point in 2025. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-preview-release-date-1851535133<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been six years since <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> showed what the beloved action series could accomplish when it made the jump from Nintendo’s consoles back to more powerful hardware. As fun as 2021's <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em> was, it was built for the Switch and pulled back in many ways from the ambition of its PlayStation 4 and Xbox One predecessor. With <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, Capcom is remaking the multiplayer monster-slaying  loop from the ground up for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S (and PC) with cross-play, and it shows. The game doesn’t just look bigger and better, it also promises to double down on the immersive fantasy of adventuring out in a monster-filled wilderness and all that entails. </p><p>Capcom wouldn’t let me try <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, currently slated to arrive in 2025, for myself at Summer Game Fest, but I did get to watch did get to watch director Yuya Tokuda play for 30 minutes in a closed-door presentation for press and content creators. We only caught a small glimpse of what’s likely to be another massive game, and it’s impossible to know how the final product will shake out many months from now, but what I saw looked impressive, and suggested that Capcom’s Monster Hunter team is focusing on the right things. Namely: making the world of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>feel as varied, vibrant, and alive as possible. </p><p>Our demo began with Tokuda riding across large desert fields into a village where he could choose his next hunt and prepare for the challenge accordingly. The creature he would set out to kill was an Alpha Doshaguma, a fanged bear-like beast on the Windward Plains with red fur and the weight of a freight train behind it. After double-checking his equipment and picking up some cheeses being aged in the sun from a local merchant, the director uses a minimap full of icons and depicting multiple elevations to head out into the plains in search of his quarry. </p><p>A representative for Capcom narrating the event said fields in <em>Monster Hunter Wild</em>s will be twice the size of those in previous games. Mounts are now a mainstay to help with navigating these sprawling spaces, and no load times between individual areas makes exploration look seamless. Before coming to the Doshaguma, Tokuda selects a random spot to build a destructible pop-up camp where he can cook a meal to get some stat buffs. A nearby creature is killed for its meet which gets cooked in a pan with the cheeses from the village in a mouthwatering dish the hunter consumes with glee.<br></p><p>From there it’s off to the fight. It’s unclear what the normal tracking segment of a <em>Wilds</em> hunt will look like (we weren’t allowed to ask questions), but in our presentation Tokuda essentially just followed a waypoint to a group of Doshaguma and then snuck up on the one that was marked to begin fighting it. Chaos immediately broke out. Smaller beasts were lured into a nearby bramble patch where they got stuck and took damage. Tokuda similarly got the alpha to follow him into a sandpit trap before heading off to a new area. </p><p>After some fighting the battle moved into a second phase at which point a sandstorm began rolling in alongside a lightning-filled thunderstorm. The Doshaguma began fighting a dragon that had wondered into the area, which Tokuda stressed was normally supposed to appear later in the encounter, suggesting unscripted collisions between the game’s monsters and changing weather patters might make repeat hunts more varied. As the storm raged, Tokuda tried to draw the Doshaguma into nearby lighting blasts while also grapple-hooking onto overhanging rocks to down-slash with his sword. Additional special moves targeted specific wounds that could be popped for extra damage. </p><p>After leading the beast on a chase through a large cavern full of falling stalagmites that could be pulled down with the grappling hook, Tokuda came out the other side into a part of the map where the storm had cleared and the sun shone from a clear blue sky. In addition to changing the look and hazards in the world, new weather also impacts what players will find in the environment. With the sandstorm cleared, healing resources were scattered more plentifully throughout the map and smaller creatures were more likely to be found wandering underfoot. It was also here that Tokuda summoned three AI-controlled NPCs to help him finish the fight. </p><p>Tokuda was there to kill a giant Doshaguma, and so he followed it to an alcove where it was attempting to sleep and put a bunch of powder kegs right next to it. What would a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> demo be without a bit of the series’ infamous sleep bombing? The final moments of the fight involved characters circling on their mounts, shooting the beast from afar, and also grapple-hooking overhead to mount it and attack on its back. It’s the most spectacular a <em>Monster Hunter</em> fight has ever looked, and if the finished game runs that smoothly, fans are in for a great time.<br></p><p>We didn’t get a clear sense of the other things longtime fans will be obsessing over, like which precise monsters will be in the game this time around, how Capcom may have played with the way each weapon works, and dozens of other things that can sound small on their own but come to overwhelmingly define what a new <em>Monster Hunter</em> experience feels like after dozens if not hundreds of hours of play. Instead, our demo concluded with a much more lowkey reveal: migratory birds. Tokuda pulled out his spyglass, peered at a nest in a nearby tree, and revealed a few chicks waiting for their mama. </p><p>The director seemed exceptionally pleased with the promise that players will be able to birdwatch in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, seeing different ones come and go depending on the time and weather, following their own more naturalistic rhythms rather than pre-scripted rulesets. He said if a player waited around long enough, they might even see the mama bird come back and begin feeding the chicks. The possibility cut a sharp contrast with the crocodiles Tokuda had just slaughtered for getting in his way while he had been trying use his spyglass. </p><p><em>Monster Hunter: World </em>helped the dense series break out when it arrived in 2018. My sense of <em>Wilds</em> from my short time with it is that Capcom wants to build on that momentum and make the exploration feel both more natural and more streamlined, with players able to cook food, swap equipment, and choose their next hunt from the field rather than constantly trekking back to a social hub. Long known for its boss fight spectacles and involved loot tables, what I saw of <em>Wilds</em> showed its aiming to be every bit the immersive open-world experience fans of other action-RPGs might be expecting. Possibly even better. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Trooper is lying several feet away, sleeping in a sun spot.<br></p><p>“They named him Roadrunner at the shelter, and I was like, we can’t call him that, that was the most traumatic experience of his life. So I was talking to him about names, we were just chatting, and I said ‘you’re such a trooper’ and his little ears shot up. So that’s his name,” Sean explains.<br></p><p>“He <em>is </em>such a Trooper,” I coo, and watch as his ears twitch with acknowledgment.<br></p><p>Sean continues. “We spent about a year in the city—I don’t really believe in obedience training—learning trust together…and then after that year I started trying him off-leash, seeing what his boundaries were, and he just stayed next to me.”<br></p><figure id="" data-id="39d0cea25eb4e7a583a2751630dde2d8" data-recommend-id="image://39d0cea25eb4e7a583a2751630dde2d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Trooper walking behind Sean at Summer Game Fest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Trooper walking behind Sean at Summer Game Fest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Alyssa Mercante</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="39d0cea25eb4e7a583a2751630dde2d8" data-recommend-id="image://39d0cea25eb4e7a583a2751630dde2d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Trooper walking behind Sean at Summer Game Fest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sean works in theater and film as well, so Trooper has been trotting behind him in Broadway theaters and on film sets for the last nine years (yes, he’s met famous people). “I also teach yoga and meditation so he goes with me to all the classes. He loves sound baths.”<br></p><p>I ask how Sean feels about all the reactions to Trooper (several people stop as we’re talking to pet his extra-warm fur). “It makes me so happy. I think anytime that we can bring a little bit of joy and happiness to people’s lives no matter what it is, that’s the whole point of being alive. That he can do that for others, that makes me really happy,” Sean says, smiling serenely. It’s very clear where Trooper gets his vibes from.</p><p>When I tell Sean that Trooper’s being referred to as the mascot of Summer Game Fest, he laughs. “Summer Trooper Fest,” he suggests. “We were walking around at one point and the president of Xbox, Phil Spencer, came out of a building and he immediately just got down and started petting him. We have this amazing picture of it.”<br></p><p>“I think it’s important, this work is people’s lives, but to get out of a screen and get back into your body is important. Trooper’s whole role is to ground.”<br></p><p>Thank you for the moments of zen this weekend, Troop.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Every alternate route to limit the impact to our people is being considered but sadly this process of transformation will affect up to 15% of our people across the Group in Canada, UK, Poland, Czech Republic and India."</p><p dir="ltr">Sumo Group currently has 1,790 employees, so the 15% figure amounts to over 250 people. It's also worth pointing out that Tencent also owns Sumo Group. Earlier this year,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-games-lays-off-530-employees-sunsetting-riot-forge/1100-6520520/#:~:text=Riot%20Games%20Lays%20Off%20530%20Employees%2C%20Sunsetting%20Riot%20Forge%20-%20GameSpot"> Riot Games, which is also owned by the same company, laid off 530 of its employees</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Layoffs have been an unfortunate trend as of late.

<p>Elden Ring's first expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-bosses-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522484/" data-ref-id="1100-6522484">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, releases on June 21 for $40. It is a meaty expansion, taking players to the Land of Shadow and introducing 10 new bosses to defeat. Players must reach a certain part of the game to access the DLC, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-than-60-of-elden-ring-players-on-steam-arent-ready-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree-yet/1100-6524150/" data-ref-id="1100-6524150">a good percentage of PC users have not done this yet.</a></p><p>Elden Ring's overall sales numbers are expected to grow with the expansion's launch, as Bandai Namco is also releasing a bundle that includes the base game and the expansion for $80. There is also a deluxe edition of the bundle with other extras for $100.</p><p>Developed by From Software, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-not-just-a-game-bandai-namco-says/1100-6492709/" data-ref-id="1100-6492709">Elden Ring may become more than a game and jump into other areas in the future.</a> Many are wondering if From Software might release a sequel, and that remains to be seen.</p>

<p data-characters="280" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s clear as day that Bungie has shot for the moon with the new <em>Final Shape</em> DLC for <em>Destiny 2</em>. On top of a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-the-pale-heart-location-leans-into-strangeness-and-wouldnt-look-out-of-place-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compelling campaign</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-schedule-and-details-for-the-final-shape-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a stellar Raid</a>, and an impressive assortment of cool new goodies, there’s also the Dual Destiny mission, which features <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/prismatic-subclass-exotic-class-items-and-enemy-announced-for-destiny-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exotic class items</a>.</p> <p data-characters="661" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">Dual Destiny is, essentially, a bog-standard Exotic missions much as the ones we’re all accustomed to seeing as part of the usual seasonal content cadence. Dual Destiny’s unique party trick, though, is that it is very communication-heavy <em>and</em> it comes with no matchmaking <em>and</em> very specifically requires a two-person fireteam. In most cases, <em>Destiny 2</em> opts for three, or six-player fireteams with an occasional foray into four-player activities. Aside from the rare Crimson Days forays into two-player combat scenarios, we’ve never had something quite like Dual Destiny before, and the community isn’t sure what to make of it all just yet.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-destiny-2-s-exotic-class-item-mission-is-a-two-player-ordeal" data-injectable="false">Destiny 2’s Exotic class item mission is a two-player ordeal</h2> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">Of course, some players are quite thrilled with the Dual Destiny’s revelation. The mission feels like a two-person micro Raid, thanks to its hectic gameplay mechanics <em>and</em> a surprisingly aggressive timer working against the players. Its rewards, too, are quite phenomenal and highly coveted: the Exotic class items (i.e. capes, marks, and bonds) that roll randomized Exotic perks.</p>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">Exotic class items obviously enable a huge array of previously inaccessible combat builds, and so the good news is that as long as you’ve completed Dual Destiny at least once, they will seemingly continue to drop at random from a variety of Pale Heart loot sources. However, not everyone is thrilled with how “limiting” the Dual Destiny mission feels.</p> <figure data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">Since <em>Destiny 2</em> is most pointedly <em>not</em> a single-player game, it’s a given that some of its activity simply won’t be playable for those who don’t want to jump into matches with other people. Raids, for one, have been established as tense six-player activities that basically necessitate constant communication from the get-go. It shouldn’t be <em>that</em> big of a shock to see Bungie experiment with this same concept on a smaller scale.</p>
 <p data-characters="518" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">On the other hand, I do get it, as a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-may-not-be-a-solo-game-but-its-how-i-like-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo <em>Helldivers 2</em> player</a>. There’s certainly no concrete precedent for two-player PvE activities in <em>Destiny 2</em>, and Dual Destiny was, perhaps, always going to be controversial in this context. Whatever the case may be, there are <em>some</em> downsides to Exotic class items worth keeping in mind: you can’t transmog them (and they’re <em>extremely</em> visible), and you’re almost certainly going to have to grind a fair bit until you find something that suits your playstyle.</p>
 <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="211" data-injectable="false">With that in mind, some players are bound to just avoid Dual Destiny altogether and move on with their lives. Form my point of view, though, that’d be a bit of a shame, as the mission looks like great fun.</p>

However, what’s put it in the limelight lately is an allegation of unfair labor practice. The Communication Workers of America say that an entire 160-person team was laid off in retaliation for “engaging in protected organizing activities and protected speech when raising issues regarding their working conditions.”</p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">This comes via <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-against-lionbridge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release from the CWA labor union</a>, which has already filed an unfair labor practice charge against Lionbridge. It has added that the 160-team based in Boise, Idaho was told they were being let go because work on a project had ended. However, the CWA asserts that separate teams in Mexico and Poland are still working on the very same project.</p> <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="904" data-injectable="true">As if that wasn’t enough, the CWA has brought to attention a similar incident from 2016. Per <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-against-lionbridge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GeekWire</a>, Lionbridge laid off all unionized employees in Bellevue, Washington who were testing Windows apps for Microsoft. This came only two months after temporary workers had signed their first union contract. At the time, Lionbridge insisted this was due to Microsoft offering less work though former employees believed this wasn’t the case. As such, the CWA has claimed both of these waves of lay-offs are retaliation for unionizing.</p>
 <p data-characters="789" data-current-count="789" data-injectable="true">Since the affected team provided quality-assurance services to Activision, now a Microsoft subsidiary, the CWA has said it expects the Xbox company to “hold its contractors to the same standards the company has set for itself.” In the past, Microsoft has stated it has no issues with unionization efforts, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/zenimax-union-microsoft-unionization-zenimax-workers-united/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly recognizing ZeniMax Workers United</a> (a union for ZeniMax Media’s Q&amp;A department) in 2023, and it even <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-washington-post-ad-pro-union-ftc-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ran an ad in the Washington Post</a> all about how much it approves of unions. It’s worth nothing that this was during the period when Microsoft was seeking approval for its approximately $68.7 billion buyout of Activision. We’ve contacted Microsoft for a comment on the matter and will be sure to update this article should we get a response.</p>
 <p data-characters="539" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="false">There has been a noticeable surge in unionization efforts within the games industry in the last few years. For instance, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/blizzard-albany-qa-developers-vote-union-activision-labor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QA workers within Blizzard Albany</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/raven-software-qa-employees-vote-to-unionize/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raven Software</a> (two Activision studios that are now part of Microsoft) voted to unionize in 2022. In early 2023, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cwa-activision-blizzard-files-charges-return-to-office-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two QA employees within Activision were fired</a> for expressing outrage with “strong language” in response to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-return-to-office-mandate-in-april/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a mandate for a partial return-to-office stipulation</a>, but the CWA said this was a violation of workplace laws and filed charges against the company.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-guide-second-encounter-dissipation/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-guide-second-encounter-dissipation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="352" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the winners crowned from&nbsp;<em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em>‘s 48-hour&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-crowns-destiny-2-salvations-edge-world-first-winners/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salvation’s Edge Raid race</a>, it’s time for everyone else to see what The Witness is hiding in its monolith. The first encounter,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-first-encounter-raid-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Substratum</a>, set the pace for the puzzle-focused bouts in Salvation’s Edge, and the second encounter, Dissipation, continues that trend.</p> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">Not only will players continue the mechanics learned during Substratum, but Dissipation also throws a few extra twists into the mix. Everyone on the Fireteam will have to be ready to take on all roles, as the fight randomly assigns certain mechanics to players.</p> <h2 id="h-best-loadouts-and-gear-for-salvation-s-edge" data-injectable="false">Best loadouts and gear for Salvation’s Edge</h2> <figure data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">While a lot of the second encounter in Salvation’s Edge is like the first, one significant difference is the presence of a boss. As such, players will want to equip some heavy DPS weapons, with swords working exceptionally well. It’s even better if someone in the Fireteam has an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-ergo-sum-exotic-sword-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Ergo Sum Exotic sword</a> with Wolfpack Rounds, buffing all other Guardians using non-Exotic swords.</p> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="790" data-injectable="true">Like the first encounter, players will find themselves alone at points throughout Dissipation. It’s vital that Guardians can keep themselves alive to perform mechanics as needed, so players should have something in their loadout to help them survive. This could mean a Solar healing grenade, a Warlock’s Healing Rift, or even health regen via armor mods like Recuperation or Better Already.</p>
 <h2 id="h-salvation-s-edge-raid-layout-for-dissipation" data-injectable="false">Salvation’s Edge raid layout for Dissipation</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="658" data-injectable="true">The Dissipation encounter occurs in one large, open arena. The boss resides in the middle, and there are three areas where Guardians must direct their attention. There are two plates and a conductor to the left, right, and where players enter the arena. The Fireteam will want to split into three teams of two, with each team taking over an area with plates.</p>
 <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">Like the previous encounter, one of the two plates will be a starter plate, sending a burst of energy to its partner. This means both players on each team will have to bounce the energy back and forth reliably.</p> <h2 id="h-dissipation-phase-1" data-injectable="false">Dissipation: Phase 1</h2> <figure data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="527" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true">Shooting the Blight in the center of the arena will start the encounter, and each of the three groups should position themselves at the start of their areas. Yellow bar Taken will begin to appear on the sides of each location, and after eliminating the foes on each side, a Taken miniboss will spawn. Soon after the miniboss appears, a random player on that team will get the Call to Reckoning buff. Those with Call to Reckoning should head into the middle area with the boss, taking down any Taken Knights along the way.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">Once within range, buffed players can start shooting the boss’ head, stopping to pop any Blights that appear within sight. The Call to Reckoning players cannot damage the boss’ head enough to progress the encounter until all Blights are eliminated, so taking care of those should be a priority. One Blight also spawns near the entrance to each of the three plate areas, so the Guardian that didn’t get Call to Reckoning should be on the lookout for a Blight as soon as they finish their miniboss.</p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">When all the Blights are&nbsp;gone,&nbsp;and Guardians have done enough damage to the boss’s head, it’ll erupt with orange light. This will change the Call to Reckoning buff to Stolen Valor, allowing players with the buff to see which type of Resonance is required for their team’s conductor. Stolen Valor players should return to their teammate and communicate whether the Crux at the center of the conductor shows a circle or a triangle.</p>
 <h2 id="h-dissipation-phase-2" data-injectable="false">Dissipation: Phase 2</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true">Players can take positions by their plates when all three teams are reunited, and the conductor callout has been communicated. From there, each group can begin bouncing energy back and forth to generate Resonance. Dissipation, unlike Substratum, throws more than one type of Resonance at players. In addition to Pyramidal Resonance, Spherical Resonance will also appear.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">The player closing the conductor will need the same type of Resonance as the Stolen Valor buff revealed. That said, Guardians can pick up any kind of Resonance for the first two, as the third Resonance will change all stacks to that type. As long as the last Resonance collected matches the conductor reading, players won’t have trouble closing their conductor.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="775" data-injectable="true">If all three teams close their conductor, a dunk box will appear at the back edge of the arena. Players should quickly move to the box and discard any remaining Resonance to extend the encounter timer before heading over to damage the boss. The boss will throw Blights and stomp on players, but a little healing and the oppressive nature of swords should leave Guardians in a manageable position.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">Once the boss is almost defeated, it will enter a final stand, leaving about 30 seconds for the group to finish the fight. If the Fireteam does not do enough damage to push the final stand, everything resets for another go around.</p>

            <p>Results of a Capcom poll designed to find out its players' most beloved games and characters have been published, and Dino Crisis fared pretty well overall.</p>
<p>When those taking part were asked if there were any Capcom franchises they would like to see get either a sequel or a new game, the Dino Crisis series came out on tricera-top, with 80,769 votes. "Please remake Dino Crisis or release a sequel. I know my message will be one of possibly millions but please release one for us fans," one respondent wrote.</p>
<p>When asked which Capcom games players liked the best, 10,978 of 254,148 respondents listed Dino Crisis. This put Capcom's reptilian survival horror in second place for this particular category, with Devil May Cry 5 taking first with 15,157 votes. Last year's Resident Evil 4 rounded out the top three, with 9017 total votes.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is clear that even years after its most recent entry, Dino Crisis remains beloved. In fact, when Capcom first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-announces-exoprimal-a-new-dinosaur-game-for-playstation">unveiled Exoprimal back in 2022</a>, many assumed and hoped this was Dino Crisis getting some sort of reboot. However, this was not the case.</p>
<p>But will Capcom ever look at its latest community findings and decide to give Dino Crisis the remake treatment? After all, it has been steadily doing that with its Resident Evil games, with latest reports suggesting Capcom has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-currently-in-development-leak-claims">remakes of both Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a> in the pipeline. Sadly, I cannot say right now, but I have emailed Capcom to see if it has any comment on Dino Crisis' enduring popularity. It is quite impressive to see the series still rated so highly among the Capcom community.</p>

			<p>Microsoft's rumored Xbox Gamescom 2024 showcase is said to be a major event, according to Xbox insider and&nbsp;Kinda Funny XCast's Parris Lilly.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Microsoft's Xbox showcase from some days ago was among Xbox's best showcases to date. Granted, given the recent controversy over Microsoft's multi-platform route, a solid show was needed. Still, credit needs to be given where credit is due and Xbox delivered with bangers such as the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-first-gameplay-footage-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War reboot</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, but also <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-compulsion-games-upcoming-deep-south-folktale-receives-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, however, the Xbox team had much more up on its sleeve, and there's a lot more coming from Xbox as part of this year's annual Gamescom event in Cologne. At least, that is what Parris Lilly <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot31-perfect-doom.894510/page-81?post=124310400#post-124310400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> on the ResetEra forums recently. "told ya that Showcase was gonna be good and the wild thing is I had multiple people at Xbox tell me there was so much more they could have shown", the Xbox insider wrote. He added, "Gamescom is shaping up to be a big show too."</p>
<p>No additional details were shared, but we're pretty interested to learn if Microsoft indeed has more to show to the community. Games that spring to mind include Project Mara, Clockwork Revolution, Everwild, Blade, Kojima's OD, The Elder Scrolls VI, Contraband, and various others.</p>
<p>Microsoft has yet to officially confirm its presence during Gamescom 2024, but given its attendance during the annual event over the past decade, it's likely that the brand will be attending the event in Cologne this year as well. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about this year's Gamescom event. What are you expecting from Gamescom 2024? Which parties do you expect to attend the event? As covered back in April of this year - <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-skipping-gamescom-2024-switch-2-reveal-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo won't be attending the event</a>. Meanwhile, rival Sony has also yet to confirm whether it will attend the event in Germany.</p>

To set the stage, we see Caitlyn forming a special task force of enforcers with the mission of going into Zaun and taking down Jinx. Vi (Jinx’s sister and dual protagonist of the show alongside Caitlyn) is on the task force, decked out in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arcane-season-2-netflix-teaser-caitlyn-vi-enforcer-1851526004&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arcane-season-2-netflix-teaser-caitlyn-vi-enforcer-1851526004">enforcer uniform</a></span> that signals how much her allegiances have changed. </p><p>A climactic confrontation between Jinx and Vi near the end of the trailer has Vi calling her sister Jinx rather than her original name of Powder, further showing that she no longer sees Jinx as redeemable. The dour tone of the trailer is starting to make me even more worried for the show’s finale, which Jinx actor <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-sex-bethesda-amazon-1851423433&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-sex-bethesda-amazon-1851423433">Ella Purnell</a></span> teased would be “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/i-cried-arcane-star-claims-season-2-of-the-hit-netflix-show-will-emotionally-devastate-fans&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/i-cried-arcane-star-claims-season-2-of-the-hit-netflix-show-will-emotionally-devastate-fans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">devastating</a></span>.”</p><p>But there is still hope for life after <em>Arcane</em> because while it is indeed the final season of the show, Riot doesn’t seem to be done with adaptations. Anticipating fan outcry, the official <em>Arcane</em> Twitter account posted a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1800545290241667414&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1800545290241667414" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">message</a></span> from show co-creator (and Riot Creative Director) Christian Linke directly under the trailer. First off, Linke assures fans that the team has always had a specific ending in mind, so the story of <em>Arcane</em> isn’t being rushed in the finale. Linke then goes on to say that the show is “just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey,” as well as revealing that Riot is currently working on new projects across film and television that will give other <em>League of Legends </em>characters the spotlight. Linke also revealed that Riot’s partnership with Fortiche, the animation studio behind <em>Arcane</em>, is not over.</p><hr><p>As for what other characters could possibly get the <em>Arcane</em> treatment, Linke didn’t drop any hints. I personally want a pirate story set in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-new-turn-based-league-of-legends-game-is-one-of-the-1848137822&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-new-turn-based-league-of-legends-game-is-one-of-the-1848137822">Bilgewater</a></span> starring Miss Fortune, though I think a project focused on the more magical side of the <em>League of Legends </em>world is also full of potential. But for now, I’ll just wait to watch <em>Arcane</em>’s end.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of them is Emmrich Volkarin, a human necromancer who is part of the Mourn Watch faction in the magical country of Tevinter. He’s also a romance option. All the companions in <em>The Veilguard </em>are, but Emmrich being of, well, a more senior age has made him a lightning rod for extremely good fan memes poking fun at the character, and also each other, for how down bad they are for the old man.<br></p><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy?utm_source=facebook,threads,twitter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy?utm_source=facebook,threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, Busche discussed the RPG’s romance and sex scenes, and brought up Emmrich’s specifically. While she didn’t go into much detail, she did describe the mage’s love scene as “more intimate and sensual,” compared to other party members.</p><p>“Some of them are more spicy than others,” Busche told <em>IGN</em>. “Just like real life, our companions have such diverse personalities. Some of them are more physical, more aggressive, and some of them are more...we have a gentleman necromancer, for instance, that is more intimate and sensual.”</p><p>Fans proceeded to go absolutely feral.</p><p>Like the rest of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s party members, Emmrich will be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102">romanceable by any variation of protagonist Rook</a></span>. So this is equal opportunity thirst for an old man floating around the <em>Dragon Age </em>fandom. Personally, I already fell in love with a mustached Tevinter mage in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, so I’m not trying to repeat myself in the fourth game. But who knows, he may steal my heart just as Dorian did ten years ago.</p><p>If you want to learn more about Emmrich, he debuted in the <em>Tevinters Nights </em>anthology book, in which we get a sense of his necromancy skills. He has a skeleton assistant named Manfred, though it remains to be seen if he will have any opinions on the thirst people are feeling for his boss. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Epic Games has announced that legendary metal band Metallica is coming to Fortnite Festival with Season 4 alongside a brand new game mode called Battle Stage.</p>



<p>Battle Stage is a PvP mode where 16 players battle across a four-song setlist to be the last rockstar standing. Players will be able to attack each other in order to disrupt performances, and knockout them out of the battle.</p>



<p>“Each public Battle Stage match begins with up to 16 players, all competing to get the highest score on a randomly chosen song from Festival’s featured rotation,” Epic Games said. “You’ll play the same track as other players but get to choose your song part and difficulty as you riff your way to the highest score. Owned Jam Tracks cannot be selected, so no one player has an advantage. </p>



<p>“The four lowest-scoring players are eliminated at the end of each song until there’s a single victor!”&nbsp;</p>

<p>As far as new songs go, six classic Metallica songs will be available in the shop through Season 4. Those songs include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Metallica – “Enter Sandman”</li>



<li>Metallica – “Fuel”</li>



<li>Metallica – “Master of Puppets”</li>



<li>Metallica – “Ride the Lightning”</li>



<li>Metallica – “The Unforgiven”</li>



<li>Metallica – “Wherever I May Roam”</li>
</ul>



<p>Epic Games is also teasing even more Metallica songs coming to Fortnite Festival at other points of the season.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, it has been revealed that Valve is facing a £656 million ($840 million) lawsuit, with accusations surfacing that the tech titan is using Steam to ‘take advantage of UK gamers’. At the heart of the suit is the claim that Valve has been ‘rigging the market’ for years, shutting out competition and holding a monopoly over the PC gaming market.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-a-lot-of-damage-s">That’s a Lot of Damage(s)</h2>



<p>This landmark lawsuit seeks serious reparations from Valve in the United Kingdom. In 2023, Valve reported record-high revenues on Steam, pulling in more than $9 billion globally and selling more than 580 million games. This data comes courtesy of VG Insights (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwwyj6v24xo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via the BBC</a>). </p>



<p>It has been alleged by the claim filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal that Valve charges excessive commissions on games, which forces UK-based PC gamers to purchase digital software at a price far higher than they would on other platforms, such as Xbox or PlayStation. In this collective action claim, Valve has been slammed by digital rights campaigners who have branded the company as ‘unlawful’.</p>



<p>In a statement, Milberg’s Natasha Pearman, the leading partner in this lawsuit, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>UK gamers spend billions every year and Valve has a stranglehold on the PC gaming market. Competition law is there to protect consumers and ensure that markets work properly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Historically, Milberg has worked with consumers to combat the likes of Sony – in 2022, the London-based law firm took the titanic Japanese tech company to court with a £5 billion class-action suit for similar claims.</p>
