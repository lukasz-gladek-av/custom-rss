The full release will support optional cross-play between all platforms.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Abiotic Factor</em> is a survival crafting experience for one-to-six players set in the depths of an underground research facility. Caught between paranormal containment failure, a military crusade, and chaos from a dozen realms, the world’s greatest minds must survive against the universe’s biggest threats.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Home to the world’s greatest minds, GATE operates a global network of secretive research laboratories, spanning every field of scientific study—and the realms beyond.</p><p>As a GATE employee you extend the bounds of human knowledge, and seek to explain the unexplainable—including anomalies and paranormal entities: from gravity-distorting artifacts to supernatural creatures with an unbridled instinct for violence. Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually.</p><p>After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect—known as The Order—is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos.</p><p>Containment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way. Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home—for now.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p><em>Abiotic Factor</em> brings a 90s science-fiction twist and rich character progression to the <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [443 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> open world survival crafting genre. Up to six players can choose their PHDs, build their scientist, gear up, and explore a massive subterranean complex, filled with supernatural artifacts, transdimensional foes, and science experiments gone awry.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Science Meets Violence</strong> – Between alien threats hunting their next meal, trigger happy soldiers, and the world’s most advanced robotic security forces attacking personnel working overtime, there’s no shortage of danger. As a scientist, fighting isn’t your forte, so you’ll need to put your PHD to work to outwit your opponents: craft ingenious and outlandish tools, weapons and gear, from simple nets and wooden bats to laser-cannons and elaborate traps – everything your big science brain can muster!</li><li><strong>Maintain a Healthy Work-Life Balance</strong> – Make yourself at home—you’re here for the long haul. Scavenge resources from vacant offices and empty labs, raid vending machines, and steal company property to build a new base of operations as you explore the facility. When it’s time for a change of scenery, pack up your belongings and move them across the facility using handcarts, forklifts, SUVs, teleporters, and more.</li><li><strong>Form the Ultimate Think Tank</strong> – Don your lab coat and earn your PhD: from Plant Geneticist to Defense Analyst and Structural Engineer (and many, many more), each with its own advantages essential to survival. Combine traits and skills, then level up to earn perks and abilities with your fellow scientists to forge a formidable scientific force.</li><li><strong>Survive to See Your Next Day Off</strong> – Working at GATE may have been a dream job, but dying here wasn’t part of your five year plan. Explore this massive underground facility as well as many worlds beyond and take full advantage of the most advanced technology unknown to mankind in this interdimensional science-fiction <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,040 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Abiotic Factor - Console Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KFAE8NENDHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During the State of Play event, Split Fiction, the new project from Hazelight, received a new trailer showcasing some of parts of the campaign.</p>

<p>Continuing their established style, Split Fiction is a cooperative game featuring two protagonists, Mio and Zoe. The two are writers who specialize in distinct genres; one focuses on sci-fi adventures while the other creates fantasy stories. In the beginning of the game, they find themselves trapped within their own narratives.</p>



<p>With a diverse level design, stunning visuals, and highly creative gameplay, Split Fiction could be a serious contender for Game of the Year.</p>



<p>Split Fiction will be released on March 6th for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and the EA app. Players will also be able to invite a friend to play for free on any platform (with crossplay between PS, Xbox &amp; PC) using the Friend Pass.</p>

                <p>After working on every GTA title since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-iii-10-year-anniversary-edition-r/1900-6347881/" data-ref-id="1900-6347881">Grand Theft Auto 3</a> in 2001, producer and game designer Leslie Benzies left Rockstar Games after the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>. Over a decade later, Benzies is set to release his new game, MindsEye, later this year as seen during Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">State of Play</a>. And if the new trailer is any indication, MindsEye is going to be an action game with some sci-fi touches.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtfMjgFKG-w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NtfMjgFKG-w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>MindsEye puts players in control of Jacob Diaz, an ex-soldier who has a neural implant called The MindsEye placed in his head even after his military service has ended. The MindsEye is also giving Jacob visions of a covert mission he can't quite remember that may have changed his life for the worse. But as Jacob goes looking for answers, he finds himself beset by an unknown faction that's out to silence him with extreme prejudice.</p><p>As seen in the accompanying gameplay trailer below, MindsEye takes place from a third-person perspective, and GTA fans will probably be right at home as Jacob uses any means necessary to take out his foes. He can even get in cars and engage in shootouts from behind the wheel. Jacob also has a companion drone that he can use to scout enemy positions and give himself an edge in combat.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHoIAnnV9LI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="6">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WHoIAnnV9LI?start=6" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Benzies' company, Build A Rocket Boy, developed MindsEye, which will be published by IOI Partners.

Starring Rahul Kohli, Saros is arriving in 2026 for PlayStation 5, and enhanced for PS5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Revealed during today's PlayStation State of Play, Saros certainly looks like a Housemarque game. As Arjun Devraj, a Solatri enforcer searching for answers on a dangerous, shifting planet haunted by an eclipse and at least one very large, powerful being, it certainly has the air of Returnal about it. The phrase "come back stronger" definitely makes one think of roguelikes, and the spread of fireballs evokes Housemarque's bullet-hell tendencies.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Gregory Louden calls Saros the "ultimate evolution" of the Housemarque gameplay-first experience. It's a new single-player IP, but builds on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/returnal-review">Returnal's third-person action</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not exactly the same thing all over again, though. Over on the PlayStation Blog, Louden said a key gameplay distinction between Saros and Returnal is in permanent resources and progression. The world changes upon the player's death in Saros, but players will also be able to permanently upgrade their arsenal of weapons and suits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More info is expected later this year, as Housemarque plans to show a first extended look at gameplay later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">everything shown today during the PlayStation State of Play, be sure to check out our recap here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Lies of P DLC Overture Announced, Releasing This Summer]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While many didn't know what was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-new-project-state-of-play/">in store</a> for the State of Play, some had <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-teased-on-base-games-anniversary/">some guesses</a> as to what may be announced, with Lies of P's DLC being at the forefront. Unfortunately, Bloodborne remastered wasn't announced, despite many feeling it was confirmed with the DMCA takedowns of the 60fps mod and the Bloodborne Demake. However, we do have the next best thing, which is new Lies of P content. Showcased during today's State of Play, the Lies of P DLC was announced, with the title Overture. You can check out the trailer for Lies of P Overture down below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lies of P: Overture - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfS9uc-CTcs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lies of P fans knew it was coming, as the DLC was announced shortly after the release of the game, which received positive reviews on all platforms. It's been nearly two years since the base game originally launched, and now we get to see Pinocchio come back, looking more fashionable than ever.</p>
<p>The DLC will take players back to the beginning of the Puppet Frenzy, the event that led to the destruction of Krat, which you experience in the base game. Players will then get to go on a journey through time to piece together the story of the past, present, and future of Lies of P, while being introduced to new locations and getting to experience new, thrilling boss fights.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting features of Lies of P was the wide variety of costumes and weapons you could experiment with, combining the typical "fashion souls" experience with combat that was suited to your playstyle. With Lies of P Overture, players will get to experiment with more new outfits, and more new weapons. The DLC will allow players to craft new weapons and experiment with a new combat style, as well as try out new Legion Arms.</p>
<p>The DLC doesn't have a set release date just yet, but it has been confirmed by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/lies-of-p-overture-launches-summer-2025-on-ps5-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the developers</a> that the Lies of P prequel DLC will be making its way onto PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro this summer. Whether this means it's tied exclusively to those consoles for a certain amount of time or whether the DLC will be released on console and PC remains to be seen. However, considering there was no mention of PC or even Xbox at this point, it does provide a little bit of anxiety that Lies of P fans won't be able to experience it at the same time as PlayStation users.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Today, February 12, 2025, Sony held its first State of Play showcase of 2025. There weren’t any massive surprises, but there were a ton of really neat-looking games that just might snag your attention. In particular, there was a good chunk of third-person melee action, typically featuring swords slashing up some monstrosity. </p><p>Enough preamble, let’s get into everything we saw at today’s State of Play!</p></div></div><div><p>Sony kicked off their show with a nice little look at <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, in all its open-world, monster-bashing glory. If you haven’t been following this game, it’s worth checking out the trailer as it showcases a wide variety of beasts and environments. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>ships on February 28, 2025.</p></div><div><p>With some slick-looking art and 2D platforming hack-n-slash action, <em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance </em>sees<em>&nbsp;</em>the folks behind <em>Streets of Rage 4 </em>take a shot at resurrecting Sega’s classic ninja series. Let’s hope it plays as good as it looks. I mean, some of those landscapes are just too gorgeous. I could die there and be okay with it.</p></div><div><p><em>Crossworlds</em>, as the name suggests, seems like it’s putting a world-hopping spin on the <em>Sonic Racing </em>series, with mid-race portals you can drive through to take you to other realms. It has a closed beta on February 21, which you can sign up for now.</p></div><div><p>Oh hell yeah, it’s a <em>Digimon</em> game! When was the last time you played one of those? Time to stop playing <em>Palworld</em>!</p></div><div><p>With an ethereal presentation that promises a sword-swinging hero’s journey through some pretty spectacular-looking environments, <em>Lost Soul Aside</em> looks promising for fans of speedy and flashy third-person melee action. Hopefully it will be stylish enough for the more discerning fans of the genre among us. <em>Lost Soul Aside</em> launches on March 30, 2025. <br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e84214561e6f53b9312b45ecde7fa4b9" data-recommend-id="image://e84214561e6f53b9312b45ecde7fa4b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goro Majima looks at someone off camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goro Majima looks at someone off camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e84214561e6f53b9312b45ecde7fa4b9" data-recommend-id="image://e84214561e6f53b9312b45ecde7fa4b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goro Majima looks at someone off camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A demo for the new <em>Yakuza</em> title arrives this week!</p></div><div><p>Here’s a mashup you probably didn’t expect.

And other Randy. The Randys (Randies?) showed up to give us a quick look at the latest game in the cartoony-yet-always-gory <em>Borderlands</em> universe. I’ll have to wait till I get the game in my hands for sure, but from the looks of the trailer at least, the gunplay looks more solid and substantial than ever. The Randys also announced a special State of Play later this year that will go all in on <em>BL4</em>. </p><p><em>Bordelrands 4</em> launches on September 23, 2025. <br></p></div><div><p>Today’s SoP showed off even more of the upcoming <em>Split Fiction</em>, the science fiction meets fantasy fusion co-op adventure from the makers of <em>It Takes Two</em>. <br></p></div><div><p>I always sit up straight when a domineering masculine voice demands a status report. Maybe that’s something I need to work out with my therapist. Either way, <em>Directive 8020</em> is a flashy-looking science fiction horror romp that gives me some serious <em>Alien</em> vibes. Dead bodies on space stations, the creepiness of “substances” in space? Heck yeah. <em>Directive 8020</em> arrives on October 2nd.</p></div><div><p><em>Five Nights At Freddy</em>’s is getting yet another game, likely filled with even more animatronic creeps just waiting to scare the heck out of you.</p></div><div><p>With a lush, dark, and creepy aesthetic that’s giving some gentle Tim Burton vibes, <em>The Midnight Walk </em>is a fresh-looking first-person shooter with some clear stealth and puzzle elements. It arrives on May 8, 2025. It’ll also be playable on PS VR2!</p></div><div><p>I keep telling people that Octopodes are super smart. And <em>Darwin’s Paradox!</em> is all about that. This cute-looking platformer from Konami arrives later this year.</p><h2 id="h938832"><a id=""></a><em>SLIDE #16<strong>Warrior’s Abyss</strong></em></h2><p>A roguelike <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> just might be the twist to this legendary series you never thought you needed. It’s available on PS5 and PS4 today if you’re interested in giving it a shot.</p></div><div><p>These days I continue to suspect that the PS2 era was peak gaming. It’s all been downhill since then. Is that true? I don’t really know. But what I do know is that an ambitious remaster of <em>Onimusha 2</em> is arriving on May 23 if you want to get a taste of that PS2 magic.</p></div><div><p>If <em>Onimusha 2</em> wasn’t enough, today’s SoP followed it up with more <em>Onimusha</em> (nuts, right?). This one isn’t a remaster, however. Rather, with a stylish modern presentation and some great-looking physics interactions, new series entry <em>Onimusha:</em> <em>Way of the Sword </em>is definitely worth putting on your radar with an expected release window of 2026. <br></p></div><div><p>Okay, for those of you who enjoy <em>MGS3</em>, I’m happy for you. The game is fine. This remake doesn’t inspire me to put up with it again, but hey, if you want to hear David Hayter play Snake again (who wouldn’t?) It’ll probably be worth it for that alone.</p><p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> arrives on August 28, 2025—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://d&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but you knew that already, didn’t you</a></span>? <br></p></div><div><p>Give me Adam Jensen—err, I mean his voice actor, Elias Toufexis—and a moody trailer for a pretty intense-looking sci-fi game and I’ve almost  forgotten what <em>Deus Ex</em> even is. With a release date of September 4, 2025, <em>Hell Is Us</em> looks like it could be a gripping adventure.</p><h2 id="h938833"><a id=""></a><em>SLIDE #21<strong>Lies of P: Overture</strong></em></h2><p>If you were fan of 2023’s soulslike <em>Lies of P</em>, you’ll be happy to check out a trailer for its upcoming expansion, arriving this summer. </p></div><div><p>Where to begin with this one? Somehow, I imagine this is what Hideo Kojima’s dreams look like—glimpses of play with violent interuptions. Kojima isn’t involved in this game, but it still looks worth checking out as it seems quite imaginative. <br></p></div><div><p><em>Days Gone</em> might be mid at best for some folks, but I quite enjoyed it and with a permadeath mode and other features, I might be willing to give it a spin again.
