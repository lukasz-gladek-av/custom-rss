Special Edition</a> launched on Switch 1 back in 2024, and surprise! Limited Run Games has brought it back again for Nintendo's new hybrid with a host of hot upgrades.</p>
<p>As revealed in a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3mboiujxgzj2x">Bluesky</a>, this Switch 2 Edition packs in increased resolution and "improved performance" — though the frame rate specifics were not given. You can also expect higher quality assets from this release and a "downsampled display mode".</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version is now available on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tomba-special-edition-switch-2/">North American eShop</a> for <strong>$19.99</strong>. LRG doesn't appear to be offering any Upgrade Path options between the consoles at the time of writing, but we will be sure to update this post if that changes.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tlpmsv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>For those who missed the initial release, here's a quick summary of Tomba's key features and a handful of screenshots from its new eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-Save Anywhere! No more worrying about heading back to a checkpoint.<br>
-Rewind - Stuck on a difficult challenge? Try again!<br>
-Toggle for analog control<br>
-A museum crammed with classic print advertisements, original packaging and manuals, never- before-seen dev documents, and high-res original artwork<br>

<p>The Switch 2 release of 'Tomba 1' lands mere weeks after Limited Run Games launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomba-2-the-evil-swine-return-special-edition">Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return Special Edition</a> on both hybrid consoles.

			<p>Although <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyberpunk 2077</em></strong> was released in a rather poor state in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2020</strong> which required <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-release-date/">multiple updates to fix</a></strong>, the story was always considered to be among the game's strongest points. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Act 1</strong>, however, has long <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">remained one of the most controversial parts of the game's engaging story, especially the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">half-year montage</strong>&nbsp;that propels&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">V</strong>&nbsp;to the top of the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Night City</strong>'s&nbsp;mercenary world, setting the stage for the heist that would put</span> the proper story in motion.</p>



<p>For a long time, it has been speculated that the <strong>half-year montage replaced cut content</strong>, but that is not the case, as <strong>Act 1</strong> was reportedly designed the way it was from the beginning to avoid a <strong>meandering, unfocused experience</strong> that would have made most players bounce off the game.</p>



<p>Speaking on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyberpunk 2077's</em></strong> sequel creative director <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Igor Sarzynski</strong> commented on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Act 1</strong>, detailing why extending it wouldn't have made for a better experience, making an interesting comparison with the first movie in the original <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Star Wars</em></strong> trilogy: "<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">No, it wouldn't. It's like saying we should spend more time on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Tatooine</strong> with farmer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Luke</strong> before he got involved with all this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Jedi stuff</strong>,"</em> Sarzynski said.</p>



<p>Besides, extending the story of <strong>Act 1</strong> wouldn't have necessarily extended playtime for most players, as with <strong>open-world games</strong>, players are free to choose their own pace. More interestingly, however, the <strong><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></strong> creative director highlighted how the motivation in this portion of the game wouldn't have made for an engaging experience.</p>



<p><strong><em>"The motivation / goal in this section of the game is pretty vague - 'get to the top' - which, prolonged and without stakes or pressure would result in a meandering, unfocused experience,"</em></strong> Sarzynski explained.</p>



<p>In another message, the sequel creative director provided further clarification on this motivation being too vague:<em> <strong>"Do jobs, make money, make reputation" - ok but what for? what are you trying to achieve? there would have to be a more specific goal for this section. 'Do stuff' without a clear hurdle to clear would make a lot of players bounce off the game."</strong></em></p>



<p>This isn't just a vague prediction, according to <strong>Sarzynski</strong>, as building reputation <strong><em>"is not a specific, measurable goal. and it's not about my opinion, we have telemetry, UX lab, survey data."</em></strong> Feeling that a good balance was also struck in regards to the time to bond with <strong>Jackie</strong>, Sarzynski ultimately confirmed that the <strong><em>"half-year montage is not cut content. We always planned it like this</em>."</strong></p>



<p>Given <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">that&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Act 1</strong>&nbsp;remains one of the most hotly debated&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">topics in Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em>, the community's opinion on the ma</span>tter appears to be generally at odds with the way this story segment has been designed. Some like user <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcleansix.bsky.social/post/3mbpbvdf27k2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew C. McLean</a></strong> feel that the in-game <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">reputation rating</strong> would have made the "reach the top" goal more tangible. </p>



<p>While setting a goal like reaching a certain level is not the kind of storytelling <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CD Projekt Red</strong> wants to do, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sarzynski</strong> admits that something of the sort would have been doable, but <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em>"it would require a significant rewrite and introducing a storyline that contextualizes and structures this getting to the top."</em></strong> </p>



<p>Likewise, others would have loved to experience <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">V</strong> reaching the top, or spending more time with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Jackie</strong>, although in some ways, not having had that much time with this likeable character made the events of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">heist</strong> even more impactful.</p>



<p>Considering how it's possible to spend so much time in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Night City</strong> completing meaningful content that further fleshes out the franchise's universe, I understand why the developer made some sacrifices to keep the narrative pace tighter. However, it's undeniable that, for a first playthrough, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">half-year montage can feel disappointing</strong>. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see if the community's opinion on this matter will influence the development of the <strong>second entry in the series</strong>, which promises to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-includes-a-second-city-that-is-like-chicago-gone-wrong/">an even bigger game.</a></strong></p>

Others, it's for the thrill of competition. Whatever the reason is, multiplayer games are often the throughline of most people's year with games. Here are our best of 2025.</p><p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2025 Best Multiplayer Award for exceptional multiplayer gameplay and design.</p><ul><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>Elden Ring Nightreign</li><li>Mario Kart World</li><li>Peak</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/awards" rel="nofollow">Check out here</a>&nbsp;for our other award categories.</p><hr><h2>Third Place - Split Fiction</h2><p>Developer: Hazelight Studios | Release Date: March 6th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Josef Fares may forever be the man who publicly hated on the Oscars once, but let's not forget that he and his studio champion unique multiplayer experiences. <em>Split Fiction</em> is the latest of his games, and it's filled to the brim with gameplay that puts cooperation centerstage.</p><p>It starts off easy, with each player getting access to a couple unique mechanics. These mechanics compliment each other, often requiring a one-two punch to solve a puzzle or beat an enemy. It's simple, but the game layers on challenges to mix things up. These mechanics change every level and evolve over the course of each level, keeping things fresh.</p><p>Each stage swaps back and forth between fantasy and sci-fi for narrative reasons, and homages to other franchises are peppered throughout. It all culminates with a fantastic interdimensional setpiece that puts the marketing behind<em> Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em> to shame.</p><p>That doesn't even scratch the surface of some of the more unique gameplay moments in <em>Split Fiction</em>. Everyone loves the motorcycle chase scene with the CAPTCHA mini game, but no one talks about when the game turns into pinball or <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> for a minute.</p><p>Few games go in this hard on a crafted two-player co-op experience, and <em>Split Fiction</em> is an easy recommendation for two people to enjoy each other's company over a game.</p><h2>Second Place - Battlefield 6</h2><p>Developer: Battlefield Studios | October 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>In late 2021, <em>Battlefield </em>took a bit of a nosedive with the release of <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, which was widely considered one of, if not the worst entries in the series. Following that incident, Respawn developer Vince Zampella (whose legacy cannot be overstated enough) was called in to oversee the <em>Battlefield </em>series. Zampella unfortunately passed late last year, but there is no doubt in my mind he played a pivotal role in turning this series around with <em>Battlefield 6</em>.</p><p>With <em>Battlefield 6</em>, we’re met with a robust multiplayer experience comprising an absolute TON of guns and customizations, giving us some of the weightiest and most visceral combat in the series. Playing on a giant map with dozens of other players, or getting together with your own squad of friends to accomplish objectives, feels like the good ol’ days that made <em>Battlefield </em>such a coveted franchise.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Peak</h2><p>Developer: Aggro Crab, Landfall | Release Date: June 16th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>The term "friendslop" was coined recently to describe a game like <em>Peak</em>, but it undermines just how great of an experience <em>Peak</em> is. It's silly, challenging, and rewarding. Most games are generally better with friends, but <em>Peak </em>transforms into something that feels like lightning in a bottle.</p><p>Climbing the newly generated mountain every day requires a lot of effort, teamwork, and communication, which all can breed frustration and stress in multiplayer environments. But with its cartoony presentation and lighthearted atmosphere, the vibes stay relaxed.<br>Ingenious items keep the gameplay exciting, where every situation can be answered with the perfect item. The limiting inventory adds just enough tension to keep things engaging, especially with how it forces you to communicate—and opens the door for some mischievous item misuse.</p><p>Even failure is funny in <em>Peak</em>. Nothing beats hearing your friend fall as the spatial audio does its magic. Coming back as a ghost is great too, giving everyone the ability to participate and make color commentary, regardless of skill level.</p><p>For what feels like a silly joke, for what amounts to a "friendslop" game, <em>Peak</em> exemplifies what a perfect casual game night should be. This isn't for the sweaty leaderboard chasers; this is for the silly group of friends who love a good laugh.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>After a run collecting some of the best loot of your life, getting unexpectedly downed in&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> is one of the worst feelings. But perhaps a player is taking things a&nbsp;<em>smidgen</em> too seriously when they scream so loudly for help that a neighbor tries to kick their door down in panic.</p> <p>In&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, running out of health doesn’t mean instant death but rather falling belly-first to the ground, able only to crawl at a brutally slow pace while a timer ticks down until your complete death. You can no longer access your inventory, there’s no way to heal yourself with your bandages, and your only hopes are to reach an escape hatch or be revived by a fellow player. When you’re carrying some top-notch loot, perhaps exactly the items you’ve needed for so long to upgrade a workbench, this can be agonizing. Crawling to safety can sometimes be achieved, and it’s one of the most rewarding moments in the game, but it’s very unlikely. And when that timer runs out, you’re going to lose <em>everything</em> you have with you, likely including some favorite fully-upgraded weapons. It makes sense to be upset. It makes sense to shout out to other players for help.</p>

 <p>Perhaps not too loudly, however. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-player-calls-for-help-during-game-gets-door-kicked-in-by-concerned-neighbour">spotted by&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em></a>, one&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> player posted doorbell footage to Reddit of their neighbor knocking on their door in concern after hearing appeals for help, asking, “Y’all good?” and hearing, “Help me! Somebody help me!” come from inside. He then steps back and prepares to kick the door down.</p>

 <p>“My heart just about jumped out of my chest when I saw the door bulge like an explosion was behind it,” Reddit user Dreamthorp noted below the video footage.</p>   <p>It’s actually even worse than that. This wasn’t Dreamthorp’s home. He was house-sitting for a friend at the time, and thankfully the incredibly splendid neighbor (who it turns out is a firefighter) didn’t manage to kick through the door. The home’s owner apparently thought it was “hilarious,” and Dreamthorp noted that “if it was damaged in the slightest I’d buy him a new door at the very least.”</p>

 <p>It’s probably a good job front doors don’t collapse when kicked a single time like they do in the movies, given how little protection that would offer your home. Apparently the video cuts where it does as from that point on there was just a black screen, but it does to protect the embarrassment of the kindly hero as he likely bounced off it.</p>

 <p>“For context,” says the&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> player, “I was in a night raid on dam trying to extract from an elevator when a leaper landed on me and downed me right before the extract door shut. I just wanted to get stabilized so I could leave.”</p>

 <p>Dreamthorp thanked the friend’s neighbor by dropping off a six-pack outside his door.</p>   <p>Naturally, many on Reddit are skeptical, especially given the video cuts off before the kick, but Dreamthorp swears up and down that it’s real. I much prefer the reality where he’s telling the truth, so I’m opting to live in that one.</p>

                <p>Sony has filed a patent document that could potentially allow AI to take over your game for you if you're struggling with it. The documents suggest that this "ghost assistance" can be activated at any time to either guide a player through progression or assume direct control of gameplay.</p><p>As revealed in the <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US454147536&amp;_fid=WO2025080356" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patent documents</a> first filed in September 2024 (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), the AI assistance system could potentially play through a section of a game that a player is struggling with, completing it for them. Sony describes the idea of training its AI agent using "footage from many users that have played the game" and various other online sources where gameplay videos have been uploaded.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630349-sony-patent.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630349" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630349-sony-patent.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630349"></a><figcaption>An example from Sony, showing how the feature could potentially work.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630349-sony-patent.jpg"></figure><p>Over the last couple of years, Sony has worked on several features to make its video games more approachable. The PS5 console launched with the Game Help system, which offers helpful tips and tricks via short videos and images on PS5 cards that can be instantly called up during gameplay. While developers haven't widely adopted it, it's still a useful feature for the games that do.</p><p>Sony has also expanded accessibility options for several of its first-party games, while other titles like God of War Ragnarok and Horizon Forbidden West have been criticized for offering too much assistance to players via protagonist musings or nearby NPCs constantly offering advice. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-september-update-expands-ai-assistant-gaming-copilot/1100-6535091/">Microsoft is also experimenting in this space</a> with its own AI-driven assistant. Revealed last year, Gaming Copilot is designed to provide help, recommendations, and other in-game support.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-patented-an-ai-gaming-ghost-that-will-play-playstation-games-for-you-when-you-get-stuck</link>
            <guid>1398124</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A patent filed by Sony over a year ago has resurfaced, and shows the company has ideas for an AI 'ghost' that could assist players if they get stuck in a game.</p>
<p>The aforementioned patent, which was recently noticed by <a href="https://www.allaboutai.com/ai-news/sony-ai-ghost-player-patent/">allaboutAI</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/">VGC</a>, describes an "overlay" version of a player's character. When in use, this overlay character would be able to demonstrate actions, such as how to solve a puzzle or by providing "example controller input button sequences", which would in turn allow a player to then progress with the game.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>In some cases, an AI 'ghost' could also have a conversation with the player's character and give some "guidance or instruction" about what to do. Other times, the ghost could complete a section for the player. It sounds like an evolution of PlayStation's Game Help on PS5, which offers users tips and guides via videos and images on screen.</p>
<p>An image within the patent also describes mode switching, which would encapsulate four different options for users to be able to choose from. These are: Story Mode, Combat Mode, Exploration Mode and Full Game Mode .</p>
<p>"Although video game technology has seen many advances, some players find themselves in need of assistance. Games become very complicated, so players who are not experts oftentimes quit playing or find it hard to complete tasks," <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025080356">the filing reads</a>. "Players are able to do research for the game or even look up prior gameplays on internet sites, but that process is time consuming and many times not very relevant to tasks and/or scenarios currently being encountered by the player."</p>
<p>Should these AI Ghost helpers become a reality, it appears that they would be trained on existing footage of any given PlayStation game.</p>



<p>Assistance in games is, of course, nothing new. As I have already mentioned, the PS5 has Game Help, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-soon-add-ai-copilot-to-minecraft-offering-real-time-advice">Microsoft has its own Copilot AI feature</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, games more broadly often include a range of features to make them more accessible for as wide an audience as possible. This includes everything from adjustable difficulty levels to controller remapping, colour-blind modes and in-game hint systems (I personally quite liked the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returning-to-monkey-island-with-its-legendary-creators">book that Guybrush had tucked away in Return to Monkey Island</a>, but there are plenty of other examples out there).</p>

<p>As for AI, it remains an area of heated debate within the industry. In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development. In this report, Unity noted animation was the top use case. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, said that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. That number is now likely to be higher, and a more recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development.</p><p>Last year, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 lie ahead.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s narrative really kicks into gear when, after a job gone wrong, metal-infused merc protagonist V realises they're now living in the shadow of a Keanu Reeves-shaped clock. Despite this, you're free to while away hours doing a million things other than confronting your urgent mortality problem. It's something even CD Projekt themselves have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyberpunk.net/post/3m7sfrres7s2l">joked about</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prior to the heist going askew, however, there's an opening section in which V's working their way up through the ranks of Night City's underworld alongside Jackie Welles. This bit can last a while if you're happy to run after every side quest right out of the gate, but a lot of folks breeze through it, keen to be whisked into exploring all of the game's metropolis as rapidly as the action plays out in the cutscene which fast-forwards through most of the time Jackie and V spend making a name for themselves. So, in hindsight, would CD Projekt have benefitted from having this section of the main narrative run a bit longer? In the eyes of Cyberpunk 2 creative director Igor Sarzynski, the answer's a firm no, a view he's explained in a flurry of posts.</p>
<p>Writing on BlueSky (as spotted by <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-2-director-says-extending-2077s-opening-act-makes-no-sense/">FRVR</a>), Sarzynski addressed the question of extending the pre-heist act head on, arguing that it wouldn't make for a better experience and is "like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff". Random shade thrown at uncle Owen and aunt Beru aside, Sarzynski's argument for this section working better as is revolves around the idea that the main perceived benefit of giving folks more time to bond with Jackie before, er, that thing happens to him at Konpeki Plaza wouldn't outweigh the drawbacks of a more drawn-out arc prior to the fatal twist in V's tale.</p>

1. No it wouldn't. It's like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff.

</span></p><p>"The motivation/goal in this section of the game is pretty vague - 'get to the top' - which, prolonged and without stakes or pressure would result in meandering, unfocused experience," the developer argued, acknowledging that it is possible at current to spend up to 20 hours or so just exploring Watson during the pre-heist arc. As to whether the section as is offers enough time to grow close to Jackie and make what happens to him bear the emotional weight it's designed to, Sarzynski admitted that'll vary from player to player, but added: "All things considered, I think we struck a good balance."</p><p>The start of Cyberpunk sometimes feeling like a bit of a rush to get everything in position for the main narrative arc to really kick off with the introduction of Silverhand and the relic's long been an aspect of it that I've seen not necessarily as bad, but certainly something that could potentially have been improved. The cutscene montage of early jobs definitely made it harder initially for me to fully buy into the elements of the story surrounding clawing your way to Night City legend status. Ostensibly watching someone else blast through the start of that path in sped up fashion takes you out of it a bit, and you don't get as full a picture of day-to-day life with Jackie as you otherwise might.</p>
<p>There's also the matter of the game unfolding in a manner which inundates you with side stuff which essentially feels like pushing snooz on a threat of death which is supposed to feel inescapable and crushing from act two onwards. Sarzynski <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mboxdpmils2f">acknowledged that here</a>, writing: "If I were to do it again, I'd contextualize gigs and sidequests as escaping death in a different way - by creating your own legend. And maybe gate a specific ending behind doing enough side content." So, possibly a lesson which could be applied in some fashion to Cyberpunk 2 there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as someone who feels <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> - a game which also draws plenty of good from its general commitment to taking the lengthy and massively detailed route - start to drag a bit as its Western epic tale trots from the mid-game towards the end, I can very much see Sarzynski's point about act one.</p>
<p>Both approaches can make for great games. In my book, a bigger issue in the base version of Cyberpunk arguably suffers due to is Johnny Silverhand's regular presence and commentary sometimes feeling like it can undercut that game's ability not to fill moments of silence that'd be perfect for Bladerunner-style broody contemplation with chatter that may not add much to proceedings. That's a balance I felt was nailed a lot better in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty</a>, simply by having Songbird cut in as a second voice in your head and offer some variety in outside perspective on events.</p>
<p>As for Jackie, it's a bit of a cold way to put it given his fate, but I think he's got just enough of a presence to fulfil his narrative role of early-game buddy cut down in his prime.</p>

              <p>Things get so busy during day-to-day life because there’s always something new to tackle. A great computer or tablet can make juggling it all a little less frustrating.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a single 2-in-1 device that provides the ability to perform real-world work and has the qualities of a tablet, the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/ Tablet (2024) is that choice. This 13-inch Copilot+ PC comes with a very clear, interactive touch-screen that converts to a canvas, notebook and full laptop upon attaching a keyboard. With the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024), you can replace an old laptop and a tablet with one light weight device that is highly versatile.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6668/">You can purchase the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024) on Amazon today for $989.99 which is $510 less than the original price of $1,499.99 or 34% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6668/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A flexible laptop and tablet hybrid for plenty of use cases</h2>
<p>Your first impression of the device will be of the 13-inch touch-screen display. The large 13 inch screen allows for ample amounts of viewing area for multiple applications open at the same time, viewing high definition images and reading comfortably. The clarity of the text is excellent, colors appear vibrant for creative professionals, and the aspect ratio of the display offers a wide viewable area for viewing web pages and documents; even watching movies. Additionally, you can use all the normal gestures of a tablet such as tapping, swiping, and pinching, and, when you need to utilize the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet as a more conventional laptop, simply place it upright using the built-in kick stand. When paired with a Surface keyboard and Surface Pen, you create a perfect combination for writing and sketching that still makes for a convenient and portable solution to pack in a backpack.</p>



<p>It’s super easy to change form factors if you’re looking to use the Surface Pro 2-in-1 to its full potential. You can use it flat as a tablet to read books, annotate PDF files, or draw pictures. But you can also tilt the Surface Pro 2-in-1 upright with the the kick stand to watch videos, join online meeting/video conferencing sessions, etc., and attach the Surface keyboard when you need to type.</p>
<p>All told, the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024) has everything most users need to be a super flexible device. It’s the perfect alternative to an iPad or other on-the-go laptop and tablet, and you won’t have to go broke picking one up if you need that kind of versatility. We suggest picking it up now before it’s all sold out, because you might not see this Surface at such a price point again for some time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios is enjoying a rampant run through the extraction space since releasing ARC Raiders on October 30. The transformative, disruptive title has shaken up the genre and emerged as a stellar, best-selling game that has taken the world by storm. But it might not end with it being <strong>just a game</strong>.</p>



<p>The CEO of Embark Studios, Patrick Söderlund, recently revealed that multiple companies have reached out to pitch an ARC Raiders television show or movie. While he believes the IP would align quite nicely with alternate media, the studio is reluctant to do anything until they’re <strong>doing it right</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-would-arc-raiders-work-as-a-tv-show">Would ARC Raiders Work as a TV Show?</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with GamesBeat, which was hosted while <strong>playing ARC Raiders</strong>, Patrick Söderlund&nbsp;and Nexon CEO Owen Mahoney spoke about all things extraction. They touched on the future of the game, how it came to be, and even offered some insider tips on dominating the game’s multiple maps.</p>



<p>During the interview, the topic of an ARC Raiders TV show or movie came up, and Söderlund&nbsp;explained that Embark Studios has been approached numerous times.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t tell you how many companies have reached out wanting to make a TV series and movie out of this IP.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then stressed that it ‘needs to be done in the right way’ and suggested it would ‘be fun to see’ ARC Raiders represented in that medium.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

<p>ARC Raiders is nothing short of a cinematic marvel. The world-building is unparalleled, and each raid topside goes hand-in-hand with a sense of unpredictability that few games can truly capitalize on.</p>



<p>Live-action adaptations of video games are exploding these days. From the success of The Minecraft Movie and Super Mario Bros. to the ongoing unravelling of Fallout and The Last of Us in television form, fans of these games are lapping up every adaptation that hits the market.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders would likely do phenomenally well as a television series written to tell the backstory of the ARC invasion and how the survivors make their way into and ultimately dwell within the relatively safe walls of Speranza.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-demo-launches-tomorrow-save-will-carry-to-full-game/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Japanese publisher <strong>Square Enix</strong> has revealed that a demo of <strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong> will be available tomorrow (<strong>January 7, 2026</strong>) on all platforms. Data from the demo's save file can be transferred to the full game, allowing players to continue where they left off. Moreover, everyone who plays the demo will receive the 'Day Off Dress' costume for Maribel to use in the final game.</p>



<p>We first heard about a Dragon Quest VII remake in July 2025, when a rumor <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-remake-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> a potential 2026 or early 2027 launch</strong>. <span>The official confirmation came just a couple of months later, in September 2025, when, during a Nintendo Direct</span>, Square Enix&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-annuounced-for-an-early-2026-release-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>&nbsp;the planned release date of&nbsp;<strong>February 5, 2026</strong>,&nbsp;for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With this remake, the publisher has gone in an entirely different direction than with the recent <strong>HD-2D</strong> style featured in the <strong>Dragon Quest I–III remakes</strong>. Square Enix collaborated with developer <strong>HEXADRIVE</strong> (<strong>Monkey King: Hero Is Back</strong>, <strong>Voidcrisis</strong>) to craft a <strong>hand-painted diorama aesthetic</strong> that treats the game world as a miniature landscape populated by three-dimensional, doll-like characters. The character models themselves derive from actual physical dolls created during development, a deliberate choice to evoke <strong>Akira Toriyama</strong>'s original character designs.</p>



<p>In a slightly controversial move, Square Enix <strong>deliberately cut three entire islands</strong> and converted four others to optional sidequests, directly addressing <strong>the original's bloated 100+ hour structure</strong>. However, new content compensates: expanded character backstories, a new Kiefer scenario, and hints at an alternative ending absent from prior versions. The game now also supports non-linear progression, allowing players to tackle episodic arcs in varying order once the tablet fragments have been collected.</p>



<p>The signature vocation system also received a comprehensive redesign in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. The 50+ vocation roster is now streamlined to 20 per character, with "Moonlighting" enabling dual-vocation equipping and simultaneous progression. Most critically, the Career Sphere menu eliminates the dreaded mandatory backtracking to Alltrades Abbey. Monster vocations are now Monster Hearts (accessories), while a new Monster Master vocation consolidates scattered abilities. Lastly, the producer <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-feature-a-brand-new-ending-producer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>there is a new ending in the remake</strong>.</p>



<p>Starting tomorrow with the demo, everyone will be able to experience some of these changes firsthand and judge for themselves. By the way, Square Enix has also just released the opening movie of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. Check it out in the embedded video below.</p>

            <p>In what has become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amds-ryzen-9000x3d-processors-with-their-fancy-pants-cache-are-launching-november-7th">CPU tradition</a>, AMD have announced a new fastest-ever gaming processor to replace their last fastest-ever gaming processor. The newcomer, detailed at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2026">CES 2026</a>, is the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which actually shares the same architecture, socket, core and thread counts, and power usage rating as the erstwhile big dog, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. It’s mainly a quicker maximum boost clock, up from 5.2GHz to 5.6GHz, that grants it a performance edge.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>And cor, what a fine edge it is. By AMD’s reckoning, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D averages 27% better framerate results in games than Intel’s best offering, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-bets-on-efficiency-with-the-power-sipping-core-ultra-200s-series">Core Ultra 9 285K</a>. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D? 24% better. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tep42MpeD_Y&amp;list=PLTU_E21aX_rgRFQRrnvYySBt24dQUTXQC">Destroyed in seconds</a>.</p>

<p>The 9850X3D is out in Q1 2026, i.e. between January and March. There’s no pricing info yet, so we don’t know much extra that 3% will cost ya, though it’s probably worth noting that CPUs have seemingly been spared from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">stock disaster currently engulfing RAM and SSDs</a> (and threatening to drag in graphics cards while it’s at it). As such, any big bump over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D’s $479 launch price would be, at best, extremely cheeky. Here be specs, in any case:</p>
<h3>AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Zen 5</li>
<li><strong>Socket:</strong> AM5</li>
<li><strong>Cores:</strong> 8</li>
<li><strong>Threads:</strong> 16</li>
<li><strong>Base clock:</strong> 4.7GHz</li>
<li><strong>Max boost clock:</strong> 5.6GHz</li>
<li><strong>L1 cache:</strong> 640KB</li>
<li><strong>L2 cache:</strong> 8MB</li>
<li><strong>L3 cache:</strong> 96MB</li>
<li><strong>TDP:</strong> 120W</li>
<li><strong>Max temp:</strong> 95°c</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking of the 9800X3D, any healthy computer-owning mind should keep a guard up around superlatives, but I’ve got one in the RPS Test Rig and it kinda <em>is</em> the fastest gaming CPU. Or, at least, it was. Now that there’s a newer version, I’ve naturally had to spend the morning berating it for its idleness and incompetence, which is why this post is only going live several hours after AMD’s announcement.</p>

            <p>An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> player calling for help while playing the game had their door kicked in by a concerned neighbour, who thought their wails were a sign of real-world distress.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1q35psm/neighbor_heard_me_yelling_help_in_arc_raiders/">User Dreamthorp on the Arc Raiders Reddit</a> was house-sitting for a friend and decided to boot up some Arc Raiders. While playing ,they claim to have been calling to their squadmates for help when a nearby neighbour heard the commotion. Fearing the worst, they came to the rescue, kicking the door.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the door didn't break thanks to the two deadbolts keeping it locked and secure. Dreamthorp claims that the friend they were house-sitting finds the whole situation funny, and the whole story has a happy ending, with Dreamthorp posting a picture of a six-pack of Shiners left at the neighbour's door as thanks.</p>

<p>Arc Raiders continues its hot streak as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">both a top seller over the Christmas holiday</a> and one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">of the most popular games out right now</a>, players remain engaged with its blend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-aggression-matchmaking-is-now-a-thing-in-arc-raiders">hyper aggressive extraction-style PvP gameplay</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">the interesting social dynamics present in an otherwise perilous experience</a>.</p><p>As for what's to come in 2026 for Arc Raiders? There's still little in terms of official confirmation on what's coming up for the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-snow-map-condition-flickering-flames">following its winter Cold Snap event</a>. With the year well underway, there's no doubt big news for Arc Raiders is just around the corner.</p>
<p>If you're curious about Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>! In it, Rick Lane wrote: "Rich PvE combat and an unusually friendly community make Arc Raiders a more approachable extraction shooter than most, but Embark Studios' continued use of AI voice generation is a black mark against its reputation."</p>

                <p>Asus has hit the Consumer Electronics Show show floor with a brand-new set of Extended Reality glasses. Developed in partnership with Xreal, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 packs an impressive amount of technology into a slim frame for your face, allowing you to stream video directly to your eyes via a USB-C connection.</p><p>Internally, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 features 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p lenses, and it comes with an ROG Control Dock for HDMI and DisplayPort connectivity. You can also connect it to an ROG Ally via a single USB-C cable for a seamless experience. Asus says the lenses can create a 57-degree field of view and a 171-inch virtual screen at a distance of four virtual meters, covering 95% of the focused viewing area.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbIIPM7Lsrg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbIIPM7Lsrg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As you'd expect from Asus, these glasses also match the company's Republic of Gamers aesthetic, with RGB lighting on the sides. Weighing just 91 grams, the glasses also have built-in Bose speakers, and electrochromic technology allows the lenses to tint automatically or on demand to suit varying lighting conditions.

            <title><![CDATA[Our Most Wanted Games of 2026 – #30 to #26]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-30-to-26/</link>
            <guid>1398058</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We are now in the top 30 of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a> and here we’re hitting a mix of sequels, prequels, a much anticipated horror, and what could prove to be the ultimate mashup that will dominate 2026. Scroll down to find out what games have got into our top 30.</p>
<h2>30 – Slay The Spire II</h2>
<p><em>PC – “A secret Thursday in March 2026”</em></p>
<p>It was in early 2024 when we learned that smash-hit rogulike deckbuilder <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> would be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/15/slay-the-spire-2-announced-with-early-access-in-2025/">getting a sequel</a>, and it’s safe to say it has big shoes to fill. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2">Slay The Spire II</a> is separated by 1000 years from the original game, which means new slayers, new cards, and new potions to use in the challenge to beat the Spire, which will contain new challenges.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slay the Spire 2 - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttVtllHkb4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Slay The Spire II was meant to be released into early access in 2025, with Mega Crit envisioning a year to 18 months before a full release. However, development delays meant early access did not take place when initially planned, instead now penned in for March 2026. We can only hope that Slay The Spire II is more worthy successor rather than the difficult second album.</p>

<h2>29 – Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>It was in mid-2025 when Asobo Studio revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/resonance-a-plague-tale-legacy-revealed-as-a-prequel-spin-off/">Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</a>, giving us a new game in the A Plague Tale universe, though setting it 15 years before the events of the main games. This spin-off sees a new main character in Sophia, a plunderer who finds herself on Minotaur Island fighting and trying to evade an army that is chasing her, with the possibility that the Minotaur will also make an appearance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lroYak-ryyM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The description for Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy references two heroes as players will switch between the ancient Minoan civilisation and Sophia’s time. The gameplay will consist of fighting various enemies as they come for Sophia and solving the puzzles across Minotaur Island to discover answers to why Sophia is there.</p>
<h2>28 – Pokémon Pokopia</h2>
<p><em>NSW2 – 5th March 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> could easily end up as one of the most popular and best selling games of 2026 when it comes out in March. Take the popularity of Pokemon and blend it with the life sim vibes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing</a>, and you have something that very few fans of both franchises would be able to resist.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Pokopia | Extended Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDh6COB0Nqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Pokémon Pokopia, you play as a Ditto that has taken on human form who has decided to create a little slice of paradise for fellow Pokemon. Just like any other Ditto, Pokopia’s Ditto can learn moves and abilities from other Pokemon allowing it to find ways to craft the cosy little getaway. For example, Ditto can transform into Lapras to swim around the world or sprout Bulbasaur vines for some bush slashing. Ditto will have friends to help with the crafting of paradise with the likes of Professor Tangrowth, and as more spaces are created more Pokemon will be attracted to join your little commune.</p>
<h2>27 – Reanimal</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 13th February 2026</p>
<p>There is a lot of expectation behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a>. Coming from Tarsier Studios, the original developers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review/">Little Nightmares</a> and with a good long wait for their latest game since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares II</a> (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/08/little-nightmares-3-review/">Little Nightmares III</a> was not developed by Tarsier but Supermassive Games), and Reanimal looks like it could scratch that horror adventure vibe that made Little Nightmares so popular.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="REANIMAL Trailer #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACZL7VziLS8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Reanimal looks familiar to Little Nightmares but this a new universe, a new story, and an emphasis on partnership as a brother and sister search for their friends and look for a way off the island that was once their home. The pair explore the remnants of their home by land and sea, going to once familiar locations that have been twisted and have their own horrifying stories. Reanimal has been designed to have the siblings experience things together, which means it is fully playable either solo or in co-op. We don’t have too long to wait as Reanimal is out in just over a month.</p>
<h2>26 – Gears of War: E-Day</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">its reveal in 2024</a> we have not heard much about Gears of War: E-Day, the prequel to the entire Gears of War franchise that will take us to the very start of the war with the Locust on Emergence Day. The game is being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/">co-developed by The Coalition and People Can Fly</a>, with the teams putting players in the boots of young Marcus Phoenix and Dominic Santiago.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine) - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC20gLfUHeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All we really know is that will see a Sera in the immediate aftermath of invasion rather than a fallen planet suffering from years of conflict. It’s also currently only announced for Xbox Series X|S and PC, even if last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/26/gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5-review/">Gears of War Reloaded remaster brought the series to PS5 for the first time</a> with a day and date release. Anyway, for now, enjoy looking back at the reveal and its Mad World trailer above.</p>
<p><em>Did any of these games resonate with you? Come back tomorrow and we’ll have five more as we break into the top half of our list.</em></p>

            <p>The team over at Xbox has added two previously unannounced games to its Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>Game Pass subscribers can now play <strong>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition</strong> and <strong>Brews and Bastards</strong> through the service. These two titles were not previously said to be coming when Microsoft laid out its most recent Game Pass line-up plans.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> Enhanced Edition and Brews and Bastards <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-xbox-game-pass-games-for-december">join the likes of Dome Keeper and other recent Xbox Game Pass additions</a>.</p>

<p>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition is a remaster of the unsettling puzzle platformer, which tells the tale of a yellow-raincoated girl named Six, as she attempts to escape The Maw. That is to say, a strange underwater vessel inhabited by a multitude of bizarre residents.</p>
<p>The adventure was warmly received on release, with Edwin Evans-Thirlwell calling it a "masterpiece of meat and malice" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-review">Eurogamer's Little Nightmares review</a>.</p>
<p>Brews and Bastards, meanwhile, is described as an "intoxicating" dungeon crawler, which developer Mune Studio says is "overflowing with action-packed combat, potent brews and outlandish bosses". Players will need to choose an "inebriated" hero to then make their way through "hordes of drunken demons" as they try to search for the stolen Brew Stone.</p><p>As well as these two new Game Pass additions, Xbox has also detailed five games that will be leaving the service in the coming weeks. These are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>, Road 96, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, The Grinch: Christmas Adventures - Merry and Mischievous Edition and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-ascent">The Ascent</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the most recent game from Tango Gameworks, is getting a special re-release in collaboration with Limited Run Games.</p>
<p>With pre-orders set to open from 16th January up until the 1st March, Hi-Fi Rush Rhythm Edition will feature the deluxe version of the game alongside three special DLC costumes. These costumes are the Bossplay, Traditional Garb, and Teamplay outfits. It'll be available for the Xbox Series X/S and PS5.</p>
<p>Extra keen fans go opt for an even grander package with the Hi-Fi Rush Smidge Edition. This features the same Deluxe version of the game and DLC costumes, alongside a special three disc soundtrack, developer notes, and a custom box designed after the tutorial robot present in the game. There's also a bunch of in-game skins and gears for gameplay upgrades.</p>

<p>Then there's an even bolder option, the Project Armstrong Edition. This contains everything in the Smidge Edition alongside an 808 plush, a small replica of Chai's guitar, a Chai Project Armstrong pass, a glow-in-the-dark MP3 player pin, an hard cover art book, and an individually numbered certificate of authenticity.</p><p>Both the Smidge and Project Armstrong Edition will be going up for pre-order during the same period as the regular Rhythm Edition, <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/hi-fi-RUSH">and prices for each are viewable on the Limited Run website</a>. The Rhythm Edition will sell for $39.99, the Smidge Edition for $69.99, and the Project Armstrong Edition for $174.99.</p>
<p>Hi-Fi Rush has been through something of a journey over the past few years. Dropping suddenly back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">the game proved an exceptional release, receiving ample critical praise</a>. Its developer, Tango Gameworks, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">later shut down by Microsoft as part of widespread cuts</a>, which Xbox executive Matt Booty stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matt-booty-implies-tango-gameworks-closure-was-partly-due-to-leadership-change">was partly due to the studio's leadership change</a>, as Shinji Mikami left shortly after Hi-Fi Rush's release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">The studio would then be saved by Krafton</a>, who acquired the team shortly after. Late last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-and-inzoi-publisher-krafton-declares-itself-an-ai-first-company-placing-ai-at-the-centre-of-problem-solving">Krafton would then declare itself an "AI-first company"</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> on 19th February, Nacon and developer Cyanide have released a 9 minute gameplay video to showcase various elements of its stealth action shenanigans.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/609Oad5kwCE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Styx provides the narration through the video, using a bunch of new and returning gadgets and abilities to scale a vertical fortress and reach the next preserve of Quartz. Key new abilities that are shown off include using a gappling hook and floating up hot air streams with a glider, but there’s also returning elements like poisoning barrels, possessing enemies and creating gloopy clones. Add to that genre classics of dousing flames, skulking through vents and just observing and listening for new opportunities, and you’ve got the broadest stealth game in this series to date.</p>
<p>This is the fourth game Styx has appeared in, making his debut in Of Orcs and Men which led to a spin off series of games starring the goblin assassin. In this new adventure, Styx is after the new mystical powers provided by quartz, which give him abilities like mind control, but he’ll have to build a team of allies (reluctant and otherwise) to do so, while making his way through the domains of humans, elves and orcs alike, the gang flying back and forth in a Zeppelin as their base of operations.</p>
<p>The trailer ends with this base under attack, as another fleet of airships catches up to Styx and his crew!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed</a> from Gamescom last year, I said, “It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Square Enix has a nice surprise for Dragon Quest fans, <a href="https://xcancel.com/DragonQuest/status/2008298591597850979">announcing a demo for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> that will be available from tomorrow, Wednesday 7th January.</p>
<p>The free demo will be released across all platforms: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Switch, and PC via Steam.</p>


<p>Oh, and you’ll be able to carry over your progress into the full game when it releases on 5th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Opening Movie | DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GL2-tty-p4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s great to see demos released for games, and especially for remakes where you kind of just want to see if it catches the right vibes and tone when reviving a classic.</p>

<p>Square Enix have taken an awful lot of contrasting approaches to their remakes and remasters. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is sitting somewhere between the HD-2D remakes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review/">the original Dragon Quest trilogy</a> and the wholesale reinvention of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy.</p>
<p>One of the most striking things here is the art style, with Square Enix creating all of the characters as real-life dolls and then 3D scanning them into the game to capture the look that they want. However, there’s plenty of other modernising touches, from doing away with the tiresome random battles, to full embracing party automation and battle speed settings, and then there’s some parts of the story that are being reconsidered too.</p>
<p>We went hands on with the game last year, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/19/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-preview/">I said in our preview</a>, “Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is shaping up to be another fantastic remake from Square Enix. It’s a bit bewildering just how many different styles and approaches they’ve taken to revisiting their classics, but this takes a wonderful art direction and combines it with a great set of quality-of-life improvements while tweaking it to address the biggest criticisms. All in all, it should be the best way to revisit this adventure when it arrives [in 2026].”</p>

            <p>Grab your dragons and don't forget those quests, as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> VII Reimagined demo is set to pop up on Steam this week. It'll offer a taster of the revamped RPG ahead of full release next month, and any progress you make in the demo'll transfer right over, so you don't have to worry about sprinting through early game sections again.</p>

<p>Developers Square Enix and HexaDrive have announced that this demo'll arrive for PC on January 7th, putting out the news alongside the game's intro movie. <strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not make the same mistake I did and go top watch the intro movie without making sure your headphones are at a suitably reasonable volume. Anyway, the movie shows off the loveably cartoonly 3D facelift Reimagined gives Dragon Quest 7: Fragments of the Forgotten Past, just in case you missed that being revealed during last September's Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>While I have zero Dragon Quest credentials with which to offer in-depth judgement, there's an undeniable charm to the new diorama-heavy style in which Akira Toyama's designs have been rendered this time, even if some of the facial expressions occasionally get very weird. Though, this being a cutscene, it seemingly doesn't offer much in the way of showing off the revamped battle mechanics and "significantly streamlined" story Square Enix <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">have promised</a>, with both of those changes aimed at making things more accessible to newbies and veterans.</p><p>Going back to the demo, in addition to the handy save data carryover, Square Enix revealed that everyone who dips their toe into the demo will be given an outfit dubbed the “Day Off Dress” which Maribel can wear in the full game.</p>
<p>That full release is still penned in for February 5th, 2026. You can wishlist Dragon Quest VII Reimagined on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2499860/DRAGON_QUEST_VII_Reimagined/">Steam</a> if you're so inclined, and/or check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake">our review of Dragon Quest III's HD-2D Remake</a> if you're keen to inject more words about revamped lizard adventures into your brain.</p>

            <p>CES 2026 is underway in Las Vegas, and while Nvidia have passed on the opportunity to announce any new RTX 50 Super <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> – perhaps in the knowledge that they’d be hurled directly into the raging vortex of an ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">component pricing snafu</a> – the tech show has yielded some interesting GeForce news. Namely, there’s a new version of Nvidia DLSS, 4.5, launching today, that promises to sharpen up and boost performance on any RTX GPU.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Its Super Resolution component is a second-generation upgrade to the 'Transformer' upscaling model introduced with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a>, and on top of the improvements that version made over ye olde Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) of dee-ell-ess-esses past, it supposedly benefits from "greater contextual awareness" of the image it’s upscaling at any given moment. Nvidia say this produces higher-res frames with sharper detailing, less ghosting on moving images – a DLSS classic, that one – and generally cleaner, smoother anti-aliasing.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nvidia</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yah, like that.</p>
<p>No details on performance yet; DLSS 4’s Transfomer model was slightly less effective than CNN at jacking up framerates, but then the picture quality upgrade was arguably worth it, so you won’t catch me sobbing into my keyboard so long as DLSS 4.5 keeps the pace. Compatibility doesn’t sound like it’ll be much of a problem, either, as over 400 games will be compatible with DLSS 4.5 via the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-nvidia-app-is-out-now-justly-banishing-geforce-experience-to-history">Nvidia App</a>’s DLSS Override tool. The new Transformer model works on all current RTX-branded graphics cards, too – not just the latest RTX 50 series.</p><p>What you <em>will</em> need a 50 series card for is DLSS 4.5’s other major feature, Dynamic Multi Frame Generation. This won’t be out until Spring 2026, so it’s even less of an issue if you just want the new upscaler right this second, but in short, this builds on DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation (MFG) by allowing you to set a target FPS – likely one that syncs with the max refresh rate of your monitor – and only producing enough AI-hewn frames to meet that target. Instead of, as in DLSS 4 MFG, sticking to a flat 2x, 3x, or 4x multiplier, though Dynamic MFG can apparently stretch as high as 6x.</p>
<p>While the more widely known (if still Nvidia-supported) flavour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">generative AI</a> has thus far been a litany of unfulfilled promise, intellectual property theft, and weirdly, RAM prices going haywire, the very specific application of artificial intelligence and/or machine learning in DLSS – and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-redstone-explained">AMD rival, FSR</a> – is relatively benign. Instead of sending a prompt to a power-hungry data centre, where images or text are aggregated from potentially stolen original works, DLSS is trained on a single supercomputer, and its actual generation work is done entirely on your own, probably sub-1000W PC, merely to create frames from data provided by the game it’s currently rendering. Which, obviously, requires the developers’ permission, given they’re the one who integrated DLSS in the first place. I don’t know how widespread confusion between the two genAI styles actually is, but there’s my reckoning, in case you ever wonder why I’m moaning about one while accepting the other.</p>
<p>Still, as a performance tool per se, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">frame generation has issues</a>, including ones I fear may be exacerbated by a 6x multiplier. MFG has already shown us that the more generated frames your GPU shoves out, the lower your supply of 'real', traditionally rendered frames. These are the ones you want to truly keep high, as they determine how fluid and responsive a fast-paced game feels in your mousing hand – generated frames only add visual smoothness, not tactile improvements, and in fact increase input lag. I’m not sure I’d ever want to engage 4x, 5x, or 6x frame gen unless I was already getting at least 70-80fps in normal frames to compensate for the reduced responsiveness, at which point, even a 240Hz monitor wouldn’t need such hefty multipliers to max out.</p>
<p>The new upscaler sounds good, though.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#940)—Clues and Answers for Tuesday, January 6]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-6-940/</link>
            <guid>1398016</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re getting our heads into January, and by association, into 2026. What’s ahead are hundreds of NYT Connections puzzles for you to solve before we get into <strong>the next year</strong>, but that’s far too long into the distance to be concerning right now. All that matters today is that you decimate the NYT Connections puzzle presented <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<p>With that being said, I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need below. Have fun!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-6">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 6)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #940:</p>



<ul>
<li>DIGS</li>



<li>CLEAR</li>



<li>FLAT</li>



<li>DEEP</li>



<li>PAD</li>



<li>FULL</li>



<li>RICH</li>



<li>QUARTERS</li>



<li>BOAT</li>



<li>BALLOON</li>



<li>FLUSH</li>



<li>PACK</li>



<li>QUADS</li>



<li>PARTY</li>



<li>STUFFED</li>



<li>STRAIGHT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Slang or casual terms for where you live.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Think about how something might sound.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>THands you might make at a card table.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Add “animal” after each</em> <em>word</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 6:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-6-940">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 6 (#940)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DIGS, FLAT, PAD, QUARTERS</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CLEAR, DEEP, FULL, RICH</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BOAT, FLUSH, QUADS, STRAIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BALLOON, PACK, PARTY, STUFFED</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov’s Ending Was ‘Changed’, But Not How Players Were Expecting]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-ending-change-unexpected/</link>
            <guid>1398010</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games pulled a bit of a sneaky on players looking for an easier ending in Escape from Tarkov following the arrival of the 1.0 release midway through November. In the closing chapter of the game, players must navigate the Terminal map, slaying hundreds of AI enemies, to make it to a boat that marks their ultimate escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>However, a trickery in the design meant that, in a group, not <strong>everyone </strong>could get a seat on the boat. In a post on social media, one streamer asked to alter the number of seats available on the boat to get out of Tarkov, to which Battlestate said, ‘It’s changed already.’</p>



<p>But the nature of that change has players perplexed.</p>







<h2 id="h-solo-or-no-go">Solo or No Go</h2>



<p>Under <a href="https://x.com/Velion/status/2007488455002206273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Velion’s post</a> asking for ‘everyone’ to be able to escape together, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Its changed already</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This prompted many to believe that, as a group, all comers could escape from Tarkov together, no longer needing to sacrifice themselves or kill their friends at the ultimate exfiltration point.</p>



<p>However, the change that Battlestate Games implemented was something pretty drastic and <strong>not </strong>what fans were anticipating. Instead of allowing a group to escape from Tarkov, Battlestate has ensured that just <strong>one seat </strong>is available on the ZUBR boat, regardless of squad size.</p>



<p>That means if you make it through Terminal as a five-man squad, you’ll be left choosing which solo player gets to complete the game at the final post.</p>



<p>This was <a href="https://x.com/Pestily/status/2008264876163228137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed by Pestily</a>, arguably the most recognizable Escape from Tarkov streamer, in a post on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey I watched multiple runs of Terminal yesterday and even with 5 people getting to the end it’s always 1 seat now? I understand “changed” can mean multiple things but only 1? Bruh…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to comment on the change, and as always, feedback was dramatically mixed and divisive. One user wrote, ‘If this isn’t fixed soon, I’m done with this game.’ Another wrote, “I like the 1-seat change – it forces an actual decision instead of defaulting to the 5-man safety net.”</p>



<p>One Tarkov player suggested a dynamic seating structure that changes according to the ending the players have. The ‘nicer’ their ending, the more seats are available on their boat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent <span>social media release, VR-first developer Cloudhead Games announced a massive restructuring that will result in the&nbsp;<strong>layoff of 70% of its employee base,</strong>&nbsp;effective</span> January 7th. The post, penned by the company’s CEO, Denny Unger, revealed a series of issues that had landed the studio in an <strong>impossible position</strong>.</p>



<p>These included a lack of platform funding in the VR space, ‘still nascent challenges’ preventing the widespread success of VR, and the ‘general downturn of the gaming industry.’</p>







<h2 id="h-cloudhead-still-wants-to-transform-humanity">Cloudhead Still Wants to ‘Transform Humanity’</h2>



<p>The post on <a href="https://x.com/CloudheadGames/status/2008316673774715195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> from Cloudhead’s CEO was an emotional one:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The team leaving us are consummate professionals and wonderful people in general. We took great collective pride in creating a culture that was as caring about VR content as they were working to support each other.</p>



<p>Each and every one of them shared a true sense of ‘give a damn’ as we worked through still unseen projects, and they will be deeply missed at our studio. And although we have done our best to pad the landing with supports, if you have room on your team, please see the link below to our ‘Reverse Recruiting’ spreadsheet and contact them directly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The release went on to explain that the studio can’t achieve immense things alone, and referenced a drop in investment in VR technology and software as a leading contributor to mass redundancies.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Cloudhead has weathered many storms in our 14 years in Virtual Reality. Our belief remains in the power of VR as a medium, as a shared dream machine that will one day <strong>transform humanity</strong>. We have no doubt VR’s mainstream relevance is predestined, with future devices that do ‘everything’, but it will take studios like ours to be there when that time comes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cloudhead is working on an unannounced game, but previously produced Pistol Whip, Aperture Hand Lab (in collaboration with Valve), and The Gallery series.</p>



<p>Cloudhead Games is one of the earliest studios to announce a wave of mass layoffs in 2026. As the studio points out, there’s still a general downturn and a global restructuring across the gaming industry, so it likely won’t be the last.</p>

<p>That isn’t some fictional, dystopian headline; this is where we’re at right now in gaming peripheral technology. At CES 2026, HyperX and Neurable revealed a collaboration that has given way to an AI-powered, sensor-fitted <strong>neurotechnological gaming headset.</strong> It uses ‘non-invasive sensors’ to read brainwaves and encourage gamers to boost their performance.</p>



<p>The combination of HyperX’s peripheral technology and Neurable’s cognitive monitoring solutions endeavours to give players insights into their real-time brain performance and reduce their reaction times.</p>







<h2 id="h-would-you-let-a-headset-monitor-your-brain">Would You Let a Headset Monitor Your Brain?</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260105973259/en/Neurable-Introduces-Neurotechnology-Powered-Gaming-Wearable-Headset-With-HyperX?utm_source=neurable&amp;utm_medium=newsroom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> detailing everything you’d want to know about the HyperX x Neurable gaming headset, some telling tidbits of data were handed out. It was claimed that testing participants resulted in an ‘improved reaction time’ of around 43 milliseconds on average, a number that was made ‘even more pronounced’ by testing the headset with pro esports players.</p>



<p>The CEO of Neurable, Ramses Alcaide, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>HyperX allows us to bring neurotechnology to gamers at a scale we’ve never been able to reach before.</p>



<p>We look forward to the excitement of this strategic relationship, which represents a promising future of gaming, one where understanding your mind becomes as natural as understanding your mechanics. By making brain-computer interfaces (BCI) intuitive and invisible inside the tools players already use, we’re proving that neuroscience can meaningfully elevate performance and transform the way people play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>HP’s Josephine Tan echoed the sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve always been about empowering power players with the best technology to play, and now with our strategic collaboration with Neurable, we look forward to giving more insight into how one’s cognitive skills and focus impacts their gameplay to ultimately make them as competitive as possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not clear when the HyperX x Neurable headset will make it to market, and it hasn’t been suggested how much such a device would cost.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Total War: PHARAOH Is Getting an In-Game AI Advisor Powered by NVIDIA ACE]]></title>

            <guid>1397992</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Creative Assembly's</strong> <strong>Total War: PHARAOH</strong>, the latest game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-pharaoh-sands-of-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released over two years ago</a> in the iconic real-time strategy series, will soon feature <strong>an in-game AI advisor powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-kairos-npc-demo-shown-in-exclusive-ces-24-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA ACE</a> technology</strong>.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2026-ceo-jensen-huang-live-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled by NVIDIA at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a> today. This updated version of the in-game advisor reimagines the traditional strategy game guide by using on-device AI to provide real-time, context-aware assistance.</p>



<p>Total War: PHARAOH players <strong>can engage with the advisor via natural language prompts</strong> (voice or text), rather than searching through menus or FAQs. The advisor has been trained on the specific mechanics of Total War: PHARAOH and has game-state awareness (as well as using a historically appropriate tone and lore-driven mindset). For example, <strong>it can analyze why a settlement revolted</strong> or offer strategic advice based on the player's current campaign situation. The AI processes player prompts, the current game state, and data retrieved from the game's complex database, which contains up-to-date information on units, the economy, resource management, faction traits, buildings, and status effects.</p>



<p>Behind the scenes, the Total War: PHARAOH AI advisor <strong>is powered by a small language model that runs locally on the user's GPU</strong>. The studio used NVIDIA ACE developer tools to build the pipeline connecting Total War's extensive game data to the model.</p>



<p>This new feature is part of a program to <strong>investigate how Creative Assembly can make Total War more approachable, dynamic, and ultimately more accessible</strong> to players of all skill levels, without compromising any of the depth that has defined the franchise over the past 25 years. The CES 2026 announcement also included confirmation that an upcoming playtest program for this AI advisor is scheduled to launch for select community members in 2026. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>During the CES 2026 NVIDIA ACE update, we also received an update on the <strong>PUBG Ally</strong> in-game companion that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally announced at last year's Consumer Electronics Show</a>. PUBG Ally will initially be tested in the first half of 2026 via a limited-time event in <strong>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS Arcade</strong>, and will be available for players using English, Chinese, and Korean. These <strong>CPC</strong> (<strong>Co-Playable Characters</strong>) are powered by small language and speech models via <strong>efficient on-device inference</strong>. An automatic speech recognition model understands the player's voice, while a small language model (SLM) combines these instructions with PUBG Ally's perception of the game state for strategic planning and real-time reactions. A text-to-speech model then generates dynamic voice lines to communicate with the player.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At CES 2026, it was also confirmed that PUBG Ally will include a <strong>long-term memory system</strong> that lets Co-Playable Characters recall previous performances and gameplay interactions, allowing the AI to draw on these memories while interacting with the player. This definitely opens up to more immersive interactions, although it will be interesting to see how the gaming community reacts to it, given the growing anti-AI sentiment.</p>



<p>In other Total War news, Creative Assembly is working on two big games: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-medieval-iii-is-in-early-development-warcore-engine-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War Medieval III</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-announced-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: Warhammer 40,000</a></strong>.</p>
