			<p>You might not like it, but God has decided you need to spend the afterlife down in the pits of Hell. In fact, you don’t like it. You don’t like it so much that you’re going to fight back and break your way back out. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t, really. Even so, that would be a pretty daunting task if you were on your own, but thankfully there’s literally dozens of you fighting for the exact same thing in 33 Immortals.</p>
<p><iframe title="33 Immortals - Launch Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aypaB0voAWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now out in Early Access and Game Preview (with Xbox Game Pass), <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/33-immortals">33 Immortals</a> should not be confused with that other game with a 33 in the title. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is the JRPG, while 33 Immortals is a large scale co-op roguelike. You’d be forgiven for getting the names muddled up, though.</p>


<p>But what does a 33-player game actually look like? We’re mostly familiar with what a co-op action RPG looks like, and 33 Immortals generally looks like this kind of game, but the Diablos of this world typically keep you reigned in with four-player co-op, often playing with your friends and gabbing away as you do so. The closest parallel, and the stated desire from Thunder Lotus, is instead to capture the feel of an MMO raid, with the likes of World of Warcraft allowing parties of up to 30 to go together. As hinted by the name, the main mode in 33 Immortals sends 33 of you out into the Inferno to battle side-by-side. Sometimes.</p>


<p>You see, you’re not all spawned into the world together, but instead will appear in smaller groups that engender greater cooperation through the early part of a run. There’s a loose herd mentality of wanting to stick together to dispatch enemies more quickly, and then to delve into the Torture Chambers that are unlocked for you. These are challenge rooms that are limited to six players, with multiple Chambers opening up across the map, all of them needing to be completed to trigger the next stage of the run.</p>
<p>A stage-wide bombardment of flame attacks signals that, while golden rings surround your screen –&nbsp;no doubt a manifestation of God’s wrath –&nbsp;before fresh enemies spawn into the overworld and the next set of Chambers opens up. Completing Chambers is key to increasing your power, as they unlock one or two chests for you, filled with crystals and giving a stat-boosting Relic to marginally improve your stats. Each enemy defeated also drops purple ores that fill a meter until you can redeem them at a pedestal for a boost to damage, health or Empathy, which boosts your co-op.</p>
<p>It all builds up to a climactic battle against the three-headed ruler of this realm, though you first all need to gather at an ascension point and battle in a constricted arena to prove yourself worthy of this. Lucifer is a fascinating style of boss. Now with all the surviving players gathered together, the balancing act of damage and sponginess shifts. He actually has a whopping ten health bars for you to whittle away, while he summons mid-bosses and engages certain abilities that will wipe out swathes of your team if you don’t react quickly enough. One requires that you destroy his glowing bracelets, while another spawns seriously spongey crystals all across the map, needing you to destroy them all to even give yourself half an opening.</p>

<p>You don’t need to completely defeat him, though, as each health bar you chip away awards resources and keys to access the other levels –&nbsp;a 22-player Purgatorio stage that will up the ante. Each player can be revived once, returning with a fraction of their health and then their second failure ending their act of rebellion.</p>
<p>With so many players, roles are necessarily quite loose and generic. There’s four different weapons that define your character archetype. The Bow of Hope is what you start with through the opening tutorial, firing up to 6 arrows that then stay in place until you summon them back to your quiver, dealing damage to anything they pass through on the return trip. There’s more nuance to each of the others. The Sword of Justice is the tank, building up Justice points with every strike that are then quickly expended when blocking. The Daggers of Greed build up to let you perform a leaping attack, while the Staff of Sloth sends slowly arcing balls that slow enemies they hit, and can then push out a wider wave of slowing.</p>

<p>Each also has a special ability –&nbsp;the bow gives a volley of arrows for a few seconds, Sword provides bubble shields to allies, daggers let you and an ally get enemies to drop bones when hit, and the staff creates a super slow zone blanket that envelopes a patch of the screen. The unique trick here is that each ability requires one or two allies to come and stand in a rough formation in order to trigger it. That’s much easier said than done during the busiest battles.</p>
<p>I personally leant toward the Bow of Hope – it’s the first weapon I tried and I easily get set in my ways – letting me keep my distance and engage in more strategic positioning than with the daggers, but I inevitably felt quite underpowered when reaching the crystals stage of the battle with Lucifer.</p>
<p>Wrapped around this is a gradual roguelike progression system, pushing you to complete tasks, level up weapons, discover a gallery of relics that can boost you on the next run. It’s solid, if unremarkable while you’re trying to settle in on which weapon you prefer and start to focus your efforts around it – or you’ll probably want to save up and buy a pet companion to run around with you. Each return to the Dark Woods that is the pre-expedition hub sees half a dozen characters and vendors vying for your attention, the main one, and the architect of this general rebellion, being Beatrice.</p>

<p>There’s an engaging core to 33 Immortals, a minimalist tone to the combat that lets you focus on your one job while still working in tandem with allies nearby, and it builds up to a fever pitch as you ascend to the battle at the end of a run. There’s more to come for this game, with Thunder Lotus keeping the 11-player raid under wraps, but with just a few runs under my belt, I can easily see this becoming my go-to game for a medium pressure, medium length blast when I’ve got an hour to kill.</p>

			<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition has a hidden 60 FPS mode, which suggests the recent game may have been future-proofed ahead of the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>As confirmed by known modder MasaGrator, this 60 FPS mode is hidden in the game's executable but doesn't function properly, as enabling it causes some unspecified issues. While this mode could be some development leftover, it would definitely make more sense if its faulty implementation could be the basis upon which a Nintendo Switch 2 patch for the game could be built to allow the game to take advantage of the console's additional power and deliver a 60 FPS experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">About Xenoblade Chronicles X:<br>
- Dynamic resolution ranges: 504p-720p handheld, 760p-1080p docked<br>
- Game's executable has hidden 60 FPS mode. It seems to be implemented only partially since enabling it causes weird issues. As a proof screen from function that sets UI speed, 1.0.1 <a href="https://t.co/Ag09YVQ7g1">pic.twitter.com/Ag09YVQ7g1</a></p>
<p>— MasaGratoR (@masagratordev) <a href="https://twitter.com/masagratordev/status/1902517127187161128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is the best way to experience one of the most unique entries in the series developed by Monolith Soft, thanks to the improved UI, streamlined mechanics and new content, though the presentation could have been polished a little more. You can learn more about the game in Nathan's<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition brings one of Nintendo’s best open worlds to a new audience with confidence, offering up much-improved UI, smartly-streamlined mechanics, and some intriguing new content. While the game’s presentation could perhaps use a touch more polish, the game is an out-of-this-world Switch RPG worth experiencing before Nintendo launches its next hardware.</em></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is now available on Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>

                <p>They say diamonds are forever, but Nintendo 3DS game carts might be ready to give that precious material a run for its money. One Pokemon Sun player discovered just how durable the 3DS cart for the game was, as after it appeared to be lost for several years, they located it in their yard and found that it still worked fine.</p><p>"I was cleaning outside and I found this, it's my copy of Pokemon Sun from middle school,” user Lzzz4 shared on the Pokemon Sun and Moon subreddit (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/nintendo-3ds-6-years-332065/" rel="nofollow ">Automaton</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-sun-cartridge-3ds-lost-alolan-raichu-rowlet-1851770957" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>). "Last time [it] saved [was] November 7, 2018, that's probably around the time I lost it, that means its been outside for about six years and it still works."</p><hr><hr><p>While the cartridge did show some obvious signs of wear and tear from being outside for seven years--and the game label was missing--the original save data was still present. Lzzz4's team of Pokemon were ready to resume their journey in the Alolan region, and with over 100 hours logged in the game, they had amassed quite the collection of pocket monsters.</p><p>After a long break, the next big entry in the Pokemon franchise will be out later this year.

            <p>McDonald's is offering its customers the chance to purchase a £8.19 Minecraft Movie Meal as part of its promotion for the upcoming film, complete with "amazing collectibles" crafted for adults.</p>
<p>Those interested in sampling McDonald's upcoming movie meal - which will be available from Wednesday, 26th March - can choose from a Big Mac, nine Chicken McNuggets, or four Veggie Dippers. Then, to obviously make this into a meal, there will be a side and drink of choice. Now, this all sounds like a pretty average McDonald's meal, but it will be Minecraftified thanks to some free blocky McDonald's characters with each purchase.</p>
<p>One of six collectibles will be available with McDonald's A Minecraft Movie Meal, and they are: Grimace Egg, Zombie Hamburglar, Birdie Wings, Fry Helmet, Soda Potion and Big Mac Crystal. It's your call if this is worth £8.</p>

<p>Other Minecraft-themed offerings coming to the menu include the limited edition Nether Flame Sauce, which is a combination of crushed red pepper and flaming cayenne, "balanced" with hints of garlic and sweetness.</p>
<p>There's also an Apple Cake McFlurry, which the company is sure will "excite A Minecraft Movie and McDonald's fans across the UK" thanks to its apple and shortcake pieces topped with a sour apple sauce. The Apple Cake McFlurry will sell for £2.19, but there is also a mini version for £1.69.</p>
<p>"McDonald's is exploring a brand-new world with the A Minecraft Movie collaboration. We're always looking for fun and exciting ways to bring excitement to our menu and the A Minecraft Movie Meal is a perfect way to bring two icons together," said Senior Vice President Chief Marketing Officer at McDonald's UK and Ireland Ben Fox.</p>
<p>"This partnership has allowed us to bring amazing collectibles, crafted for adults, to the UK for the first-time ever! We can't wait for fans to meet their favourite McDonaldsland characters in blockified form, and to experience the new products which have been inspired by the A Minecraft Movie universe - Nether Sauce and Apple Cake McFlurry."</p>

            <p>
Final Fantasy publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has launched legal action against a developer it had partnered with to make a new Front Mission game.
</p>
<p>
Front Mission, the company's classic mecha battle franchise, was set to be revived by BlackJack Studio via a new game titled Front Mission 2089: Borderscape. 
</p>
<p>
After two years of development, Square Enix cancelled the project in October 2024, and walked away from BlackJack Studio for reasons unknown. Shortly after, BlackJack Studio announced its own "Front Mission-style game", known as Mecharashi.

<p>
Square Enix's <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/841035863/Square-Enix-suing-to-stop-this-Front-Mission-style-mecha-game-from-being-released-in-the-US">lawsuit</a> (uncovered by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/542570/square-enix-front-mission-mecharashi-lawsuit">Polygon</a>) claims Mecharashi uses the work BlackJack Studio undertook for its own project. Indeed, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3446920/Mecharashi/">Mecharashi's own Steam page</a> describes the game thus: 
</p>
<p>
"Mecharashi is a mecha-themed tactical turn-based game. The game adopts a Front Mission-style combat system, where you can assemble mechas however you want, equip a wide selection of weapons, and choose your favorite pilots to engage in battle."
</p>
<p>
Court documents filed by Square Enix include pages of screenshots comparing the unreleased Front Mission prototype made by BlackJack Studio and the developer's new project. The similarities are obvious. 
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Square Enix is seeking $150k (£115k) in compensation for copyright infringement, and an immediate removal of the game's listing from storefronts.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Mecharashi has already disappeared and reappeared from Steam as Square Enix and BlackJack Studio squabble over a DMCA notice.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-best-yasuke-abilities-to-learn-first/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a pretty unique entry in the series in terms of gameplay, as it features a somewhat clear split between the stealth playstyle of classic entries in the series and the more combat-oriented style of recent games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla with its two protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke. While both are pretty competent at what they do right from when they are introduced in the story, Yasuke, in particular, doesn't feel that good to play, even in combat. With some choice abilities, however, he becomes much more fun to play, so you should be looking into unlocking these abilities as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you're into fighting enemies head-on, there's no better choice of protagonist than Yasuke in Assassin's Creed Shadows, but you will often find yourself surrounded by multiple enemies. To fight multiple enemies effectively, you will want to equip a<strong> Naginata</strong> and learn the <strong>Crescent Strike</strong> ability. This Adrenaline ability is perfect to use when surrounded, as, by swinging the Naginata in a very wide arc, Yasuke knocks enemies down while also pushing them away, giving you some breathing room.</p>
<p>The second Naginata ability to learn as quickly as possible to make fights more fun and prevent things from dragging out too much is <strong>Impale</strong>. This ability can be used not only to reposition Yasuke but also to impale enemies on walls. If the enemy is still alive after the ability has been used, they will be knocked down and open for a grounded attack that is often fatal. Augmenting these abilities is the <strong>Combat Expert</strong> ability on the Long Katana Mastery skill tree, which increases damage with all melee weapons by a certain percentage each level, and the <strong>Increased Armor Damage</strong> on the Teppo Mastery skill tree, which increases armor damage by a certain percentage each level. <strong>Vigor</strong> abilities in the Samurai Mastery tree are also great skills to learn to get additional Adrenaline chunks and use these abilities more often.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250320131637_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If the Naginata is not the melee weapon you want to use in Assassin's Creed Shadows, there are some Long Katana and Kanabo abilities you can learn to make them more effective and fun to use as well. The <strong>Sheathed Attack</strong> and the <strong>Sheated Posture</strong> are essential abilities to learn for the samurai's signature weapon, as a charged sheathed heavy attack on a guarding enemy has the chance to knock them down, opening them for a potentially lethal grounded attack. Even if it doesn't knock them down, a sheated posture attack is generally very strong and can kill weaker enemies if they are in a vulnerable state with a single hit.</p>
<p>The powerful Kanabo is also made better and more fun to use by two abilities, <strong>Devastation</strong> and <strong>Forward Momentum</strong>. The first unleashes a second combo ender when using a different type of attack after performing the first finisher, which is often a deadly combination against any sort of enemy. The second makes attacking much faster by pressing the next button in a combo with perfect timing, allowing Yasuke to deliver more devastating attacks more often. These two abilities synergize well with each other as well as with the <strong>Combo Ender Damage, </strong>making the Kanabo one of the strongest weapon types in the game in terms of sheer damage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-jack-black-i-feel-alive-song-rock-1851771190<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It would frankly be silly at this point not to get Jack Black to release his vocal chords if he’s starring in a movie. Following the viral success of ‘Peaches,’ Black’s gloriously silly ditty sung as Bowser in <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, it looks like <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> is trying to capture some of the same magic. Will it though?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Well, OK, probably not. Where ‘Peaches’ was inherently funny, the overwrought rendition of asinine lyrics, sung in the plaintiff voice of a lovelorn Bowser, <em>Minecraft</em>’s ‘I Feel Alive’—despite being fine--feels overwritten and, well, smells a touch of desperation. But, and it’s an important but, only in the context of the cynical exercise we can see being deployed. The song itself is competent, extremely well-performed, and could easily have been a Whitesnake B-side in the mid-80s.</p><p>See, the joke is, “rock” means both rock music <em>AND</em> a thing you use in <em>Minecraft</em>! GEDDIT? Beyond that, it’s very much an ‘80s movie credits fare, the plot of the film sung to family-friendly rock riffs, and it seems inevitable that it’ll play over the credits when <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> releases April 4.</p><p>And yet, at the same time, you can totally see an enthusiastic crowd jumping up and down as they roar out the catchy chorus. Children everywhere will find the album on Spotify after they’ve seen the film and enjoy air guitar rocking out during the bridge. It’ll do its job. And, in this sense, it’s rather emblematic of the movie as a whole.</p><figure id="" data-id="f494fd31e153d7a4229b53d2a2b8aae5" data-recommend-id="image://f494fd31e153d7a4229b53d2a2b8aae5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1011" data-height="566" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jack Black as Steve in front of a portal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jack Black as Steve in front of a portal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Yet, gosh, people were rather cross. Apparently every game-related film ever made should cater exactly to each specifically entitled manbaby who might see its trailer, and any other notion is blasphemy. The greatest heresy is to point out this is a film aimed at the current generation of children who are currently propelling <em>Minecraft</em> to being one of the biggest toy and gaming franchises in the world. This is largely because each entitled manbaby has an imaginary 12-year-old nephew who thinks the trailers look <em>terrible</em>.</p><p>Anyway, the point is, <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> is being met with a lot of bad faith, and it’s going to be very interesting to see how it performs heading into this storm. Obviously no one has any idea if it’s any good at this point, although it was reported <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-live-action-first-trailer-reaction-1851703382&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-live-action-first-trailer-reaction-1851703382">that test screenings went well</a></span>, and indeed that the movie didn’t match the tone of that first trailer. If it’s genuinely bad, rather than that tedious movie critic faux-weariness that is so often deployed for kids’ films, then it could obviously hurt the juggernaut’s progress.</p><p>My 10-year-old is absolutely hyped for this, each following trailer deliberately spotlighting <em>Minecraft</em> memes that are currently huge on YouTube, of which you and I are completely unaware. Which again is to say, I have a strong feeling that the creators know what they’re doing here, making a movie that’s not for those of us who were passing code for the Java edition to friends in 2009, but rather the kid on the bus today wearing a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> school bag over their <em>Minecraft </em>joggers and hoodie, watching Skeppy on their phone. </p><p>And yeah, that’s inherently cynical. Much like the accompanying song. Then again, anyone holding out hope that this was ever going to be a Jim Jarmusch-like moody indie sleeper-hit was perhaps being a little naive. Anyway, here’s the far more excellent ‘Peaches.’</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The Communications Workers of America (CWA) is launching an industry-wide union of video game workers in North America and Canada, which it says will help "build worker power irrespective of studio and current job status".
</p>
<p>
The CWA has been at the centre of many of the successful US games industry unionisation efforts over the last few years, with 2024 seeing announcements of unions at the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/200-workers-at-bethesda-game-studio-have-unionised">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-team-forms-500-stong-union">Blizzard</a>. Its <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/membership">newly unveiled United Videogame Workers</a> (UVW-CWA) operates a little differently to a traditional certified union, however, serving as a direct-join industry-wide organisation - said to be the first of its kind for the games industry in the US.
</p>
<p>
The nature of the UVW-CWA means any freelance or full-time video game industry worker - artists, writers, designers, QA testers, programmers, and <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/faq">beyond</a> - can join if they're based in the US or Canada, with dues calculated on a sliding scale. And it's also open to industry musicians, having been launched in partnership with the American Federation of Musicians (AFM). This, the CWA says, will help "build power across the industry without the obstacles and delays that employers can impose during the traditional union certification process".
</p>
<p>
"Our mission is to take back our lives, our labour, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs," the <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/mission-statement">UVW-CWA writes</a>. "To empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers labouring invisibly to keep this industry afloat. Our goal is to create a union... to fight the whims of CEOs and private equity vultures."
</p>
<p>
"We are going to draft a video game worker bill of rights," the UVW-CWA explains elsewhere, "setting standards that have been glaringly absent from our craft for too long. It will address inequality in hiring, the pervasive reliance on crunch, healthcare for contractors, and protections against all manner of injustice. Armed with this bill, new organisers can activate with clarity of goal and action, cultivated by the shared knowledge of not only fellow game developers, but workers in the entire labour movement."
</p>
<p>
In an <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/faq">accompanying FAQ</a>, the UVW-CWA continues, "Not only do we build community and solidarity amongst video game workers, we also strive to build large-scale education campaigns about labour organising in the video game industry, provide legal support and layoff support funds for disenfranchised workers, write template contract standards, build professional development and mentorship programmes within our community, and so much more." The first of the UVW-CWA's campaigns will focus on layoffs, and a petition is being shared at this week's GDC in the hope of gaining "widespread support".
</p>
<p>
The CWA's announcement comes amid a devastating few years for the games industry, marked by extensive layoffs and studio closures. Over 25000 employees are believed to have lost their jobs since the start of 2023 - and according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gdcs-state-of-the-games-industry-survey-says-one-in-ten-respondents-laid-off-in-2024">GDC's most recent State of the Games Industry survey</a> from earlier this year, one in 10 respondents reported being laid off in 2024.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/real-wabi-sabi-in-assassins-creed-shadows-open-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Feudal Japan—and the country's culture in general—has been idolized and romanticized for decades, including during the early days of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. Ubisoft is finally answering the fans' longtime call with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a>, which brings Japan's landscape to life in painstaking detail, for better and for worse.</p>

<p>Across the nine regions in this game, I've traversed across roughly half of them, and there's an abundance of viewpoints to synchronize and take in the breathtaking scenery. And when the seasons change, the landscape meaningfully shifts in mood and tone, in ways reminiscent of an Akira Kurosawa film.</p>

<p>There's incredible attention to detail in the environment here, as to be expected in an <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game. But in some ways, unfortunately, that detail undermines the overall experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-spring-viewpoint.jpg?itok=xZm6WjCR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-spring-viewpoint.jpg?itok=A-y1yKyI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows'</em>&nbsp;Open World&nbsp;Has a Mountain of Pathfinding Problems</h2>

<p>Geographically speaking, Japan is incredibly mountainous and hilly. Modern-day Japan has tunnels for the shinkansen to go through, but back in the late 1500s, when this game is set, you either climb up or go around the mountains.</p>

<p>In a game like <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, you're running from waypoint to waypoint. Some you'll see for yourself from atop a viewpoint, others you'll find on the world map using your scouts. More often than not though, running straight toward the marker doesn't work well.</p>

<p>To make it to your goal in a straight line, you'll probably have to spend a couple minutes climbing mountains, finding the exact right slopes to run up. If it's too steep, you'll slide back down—more so <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/assassins-creed-shadows-hands-on-preview" rel="nofollow">if you're playing as the heavy tank Yasuke</a>. Your horse has an even worse time with slopes, especially when there's lots of bushes around, so it's not worth bothering.</p>



<p>Coming down the mountain isn't as bad, as long as you're mindful of fall damage. What doesn't help though, is the amount of foliage that assaults the camera from every angle. It's difficult to parse out where you're going, and it feels like wrestling instead of running.</p>

<p>Of course, this probably isn't the intended way to play; after all, we don't have gravity-defying <em>Skyrim </em>horses. Instead, there's a setting that turns on a wayfinder, and an in-game line directs you to your destination via pre-defined paths through the mountains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following this line guarantees you'll get to your destination smoothly, but it also sort of defeats the purpose of an open world. It's a classic dilemma the genre's faced for as long as <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> has been popular.</p>



<h2>Random Not-So-Random</h2>

<p>What makes things extra difficult here, though, is that exploring the not-so-beaten path often feels frustrating because of the mountainous terrain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This didn't really feel like a big problem until I hit a certain area of the map where fast travel points were sparse. The quests here also had me running back and forth, and without fast travel, I had to wrestle with slopes until I just gave up and relinquished control to the wayfinder.</p>

<p>This made me realize that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> and its seemingly "random" moments feel less magical and serendipitous.</p>



<p>For example, early on in my time with the game, I'd run into random people on the road who needed help. Some were threatened by bandits, others had their wagons break down. One guy was in debt, so I handed him some money.</p>

<p>None of these were quest markers or side quests, and they made the world feel more lived in. It reminded me a bit of <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-wild-wild-west-part-2" rel="nofollow">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> </em>in how it brought the world to life.</p>

<p>But then I did a main quest later in the game, where these same sorts of "random" events happened as a direct reaction to a story event. They were also dotted along the wayfinding path to my next destination.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the magic felt gone; despite being a big open world, I couldn't help but feel like the "intended" way to experience <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is on rails. And the joy of breaking out of that cage is constantly hampered by the map's own geometry.</p>



<h2>Beauty Within Imperfections</h2>

<p>It's a shame that traversing the map freely has so many roadblocks, because ironically, the hills and valleys have a naturally striking appeal. After climbing to the top of a viewpoint and scanning around, it's hard not to take a screenshot of what's in front of you.</p>

<p>Mountains of treetops give way to pagodas and temples, while majestic castles overlook a sea of lush greenery. When the seasons change, it makes the world feel alive. Fast traveling from fall's warm hues to a blank canvas of fresh snow never gets old.</p>



<p>Overall, Ubisoft has done a great job capturing the natural beauty of Japan in <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. But that beauty is also ironically responsible for making exploration more of a chore.</p>

<p>It's a continuation and exacerbation of a problem I've had with the current <em>Assassin's Creed</em> formula <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-origins" rel="nofollow">that started with <em>Origins</em></a>. The fastest way to get to your destination is usually by horse, which feels like an overall passive experience. But at least in previous games, it wasn't too hard to go off the beaten path and meander.</p>

<p>In <em>Shadows</em>, though, that passive experience feels more required than ever. It feels like the game might as well play itself sometimes.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has been an enormous success - like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-fourth-expansion-releases-really-really-soon">a 100m downloads enormous success</a> - so inevitably, there are now other, similar franchises that would like a piece of that action.
</p>
<p>
What other franchise like Pokémon are we talking about? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-had-to-scale-back-a-little-bit-and-hire-security-guards-palworld-developer-reveals-nintendo-lawsuit-reaction">No, not Palworld</a>. (Don't make things worse for yourselves, PocketPair.) We mean, Digimon, of course. 
</p>
<p>
So, here's Digimon Alysion - an upcoming free-to-play online card battler with a slightly odd name that publisher Bandai Namco likely hopes will get just a sniff of Pokémon's success.

<figcaption>Digimon Alysion debut trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaoHerGig5w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Footage of the game shows battles against an opponent where each player has a selection of Digimon, represented by cards, on the field. This is intercut with CGI sequences showing characters gesticulating, Pokémon Trainer-like, at the cards. It's unclear if this is actual gameplay. 
</p>
<p>
From my limited knowledge of Digimon, which is basically watching the anime 15 years ago, I recognised several creatures featured in that original generation of Digimon monsters. Nostalgia!
</p>
<p>
The trailer concludes with the message: "Project Start!" suggesting it still may be some time before Digimon Alysion actually arrives. When it does, its set to pop up on both the iPhone App Store and Google Play for Android.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">Pokémon TCG Pocket announced an overhaul of its much-criticised trading feature</a> following fan backlash - though the changes won't take effect for several months.

<p>Cheating and hacking continue to be rampant across first-person online shooters. Delta Force is another that keeps being attacked, but if you are found guilty of cheating here, expect to face extreme consequences in the form of 10-year bans, and more. </p>



<p>There seems to be cheaters everywhere you look in gaming. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cheaters-with-lifetime-bans-will-receive-a-second-chance-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite is known for handing out lifetime bans</a>—although the shooter is looking to give players reprieve—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-rules-rainbow-six-siege-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege has gone after cheaters</a>, and Call of Duty has infamously had problems with hackers over the years. </p>



<p>It’s a neverending problem, but one Delta Force is keeping on top of. Its latest cheat report indicates it’s stopped 20,000 cheaters in one week alone.</p>

<p>A March 20 post on the <a href="https://x.com/DeltaForce_Game/status/1902666885906469042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Delta Force X page</a> makes for interesting reading. “Our G.T.I. Security team are working around the clock to kick cheaters out of the game,” it says. It also mentions five types of bans Delta Force is handing out, including the hefty fine of a “10-year ban.”</p>



<p>The total number of cheaters targeted by Delta Force this week is <strong>20,024</strong>. Below, you can see the exact figures for each type of ban.</p>



<ul>
<li>10-Year Bans—<strong>1,446</strong></li>



<li>DMA Bans—<strong>365</strong></li>



<li>Devices Blocked—<strong>694</strong></li>



<li>Cheat Attempts Stopped—<strong>13,475</strong></li>



<li>Players Forced Offline—<strong>4,044</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/detail.html?father_content_id=80169c48a4720a450cab07aa9781d08ca521&amp;content_id=80169c48a4720a450cab07aa9781d08ca521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delta Force website</a> provides a more in-depth look at the bans and actions geared toward cheaters. The report doubles down that “We adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards anyone found to be in violation of our game rules,” and also provides the beginning and ends of banned usernames.</p>



<p>It’s great to see Delta Force taking the cheater issue so seriously. It’s a game on the up after the frosty reception to the Black Hawk Down Campaign DLC which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players deemed to be “too difficult.”</a></p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 11.45am UK: </strong> Thronefall developer Grizzly Games has responded to the use of its name and logo by the company behind Flight Simulator 2025 - the Microsoft Flight Sim rip-off that uses AI art which Eurogamer spotted via a PlayStation Store listing earlier today.</p>
<p>"Thanks for contacting us and thank you for bringing awareness to this topic," Thronefall developer Paul Schnepf Games said in an email to Eurogamer. "We're not associated with Grizzly Games Ltd. and they're using both our name and logo illegally. 
</p>
<p>"Furthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we’re trying to give to the gaming community. Unfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power."</p>
<p>We'll update again if we hear from Sony - or the other Grizzly Games.</p>
<divider></divider>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 11am UK:</strong> 
Flight Simulator 2025 is now available to Wishlist on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10014255">PlayStation Store</a> - but it's nothing to do with Microsoft. 
</p>
<p>
Trophies for the game caught the eye of Flight Sim fans overnight via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jfkg5q/trophies_live_for_flight_simulator_ps5_that_hasnt/">reddit</a>, though it quickly became clear this wasn't a leak of the actual Flight Sim landing on Sony's console. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Flight Simulator 2025 features what looks like AI-generated art for its cover image, and has been made by a developer named Grizzy Games Limited.
</p>
<p>
A quick search online brings up the <a href="https://www.grizzly-games.com/#games">Grizzly-Games.com website, which features a long list of supposed mobile projects </a> that also feature clearly AI-generated artwork for their title covers. 
</p>
<p>
These mobile games - Idle Command: Supply Frontline, Merge Blocks Magic Numbers, Color Page ASMR: Drawing Art, etc - all have links to download the apps via the Google Play store, but all of these links are broken. It's unclear if these games ever existed.
</p>
<p>
The single game with actual gameplay visible is City Outlet: Store Empire, which looks to be a tycoon game based in a corner of a shopping mall. You can see a trailer of it below:
</p>

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>City Outlet: Store Empire.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GERnQvhzjs8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
If the name Grizzly Games sounds familiar, then it's because this developer shares its name with the developer of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thronefall-kingdom-building-hack-and-slash-and-the-spirit-of-lumines">popular indie action title Thronefall</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the team behind City Outlet: Store Empire and Flight Simulator PS5 is also using the same Grizzly Games logo of the Thronefall team.
</p>
<p>
We've contacted both Grizzly Games for more. We've also contacted Sony, which looks set to imminently launch Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation.
</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that a knock-off game has been discovered on the PlayStation Store. What <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-looks-like-a-suika-game-rip-off-set-to-launch-on-playstation">looked like a Suika Game rip-off was set to launch on PlayStation previously</a>. Meanwhile, in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-rubbish-god-of-war-rip-off-on-the-xbox-store">we discovered a rubbish God of War rip-off on the Xbox store</a>. And in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-knock-off-removed-from-nintendo-eshop-as-sony-stakes-copyright-claim">Sony launched a copyright claim against a rip-off of The Last of Us on the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>
<p>
For now, perhaps hold off a pre-order of Flight Simulator 2025. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-xbox-exclusive-games-heading-to-ps5-and-switch-according-to-phil-spencer">real Microsoft Flight Simulator seems likely to actually turn up on PS5 at some point</a>.

            <p>Breaking news, folks: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> bug basher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is a satire on authoritarian regimes, and apparently such an effective one that the United Nations even contacted Arrowhead to ask if they'd give a talk about psychological manipulation. Speaking at GDC as part of a presentation named 'Helldivers 2: Capturing Lightning in a Bottle,' Chief Easily identifiable satire Officer Johan Pilestedt gave some insight into the game's themes, then bragged about having the UN blowing his DMs constantly (said they got in contact once). Cheers, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/the-united-nations-asked-helldivers-2-studio-arrowhead-if-itd-give-a-talk-on-psychological-manipulation-could-we-brainwash-an-entire-community-to-fight-for-a-fascist-state-would-we-be-okay-with-that-turns-out-yeah/">Percy Gamer</a>.</p>

<p>"What is Helldivers 2, fundamentally? It would probably be fun to play a co-op action shooter where you’re put in the shoes of the evil side grunts of pop culture," Pilestedt said. "We asked ourselves, could we brainwash an entire community to fight for a fascist state? Would they? Would we be okay with that? And turns out, yeah, actually."</p>
<p>"We do it all in fun and good spirits, and we actually try to get people to recognise the science of what is a totalitarian state," he said. "If you start wearing the same uniform as everybody else and do salutes constantly, you might be in a totalitarian regime." Pilestedt also told his GDC audience to stop nattering while he was making important points about capes, otherwise he'd get his best mates the UN to come down and sort them out. At least, that's what I imagine happened. "Actually, we got a message from the UN asking if we want to talk, in some form, about psychological defense against manipulation". He didn't elaborate on whether anything actually came of this, however.</p>
<p>Pilestedt went on to say that they pulled aesthetics from the US, the EU, and the UN, alongside "mantras of regimes” like Nazi Germany and North Korea. “It creates pleasing aesthetics,” said Pilestedt, "because there’s something totalitarian regimes are really good at: pleasing aesthetics."</p>
<p>PC Gamer's own use of the words "prevent Helldivers 2 from getting too depressing" in regards to these uniforms is really insightful here, I think - drab deeds in shiny boots being one of fascism's calling cards.</p>
<p>I dislike ending articles with some variation on Howzabout YoU GamErMates ArE You Still Levelling Up For Super Earth?!? (even as these words likely appear above some godforsaken survey that asks you "where you dropping"?) but I'm actually genuinely curious about how the game is these days for people that have been playing since the beginning - I fell off Helldivers 2 for no particular reason months ago and haven't returned since.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Jack Black is set to play Steve in A Minecraft Movie, but that wasn't always going to be the case. Originally, Black was actually going to play a talking pig. No porky pies here - really, a talking pig.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/a-minecraft-movie-game-microsoft-1236341672/">Variety</a>, Mojang senior director of original content Torfi Frans Ólafsson revealed Black's switch to become Steve happened "very, very, very late" in the game. Ólafsson stated the team "needed an expert and host" in the film, and so Black went from being envisioned as a talking pig to becoming Steve.</p>

<p>Now, if you saw the trailers with Jack Black as Steve, and said to yourself (or even out loud), 'hang on, that isn't Steve! That's just Jack Black in a blue shirt!'. Well, you weren't alone, and the A Minecraft Movie team is aware of those reactions.</p>
<p>"This is not my Steve or your Steve - this is Jack Black's Steve," Ólafsson said of the part. "A lot of fans responded when they saw the first teasers and trailers, like, 'Hey, wait a minute -- this is just Jack Black. This isn't Jack Black being someone else.' And maybe it is, because this is literally him interpreting this character and what it means to him."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Ólafsson got the cast and crew Xboxes for the trailers while on set, and booted up private Minecraft servers. The Mojang exec said Black logged over 100 hours on the blocky game, and became "the most passionate player" on set.</p>
<p>"He was just completely manic, hoarding stuff in the mines, searching for lapis lazuli because he liked the way it sounds," Ólafsson told the publication. "He kept saying it: 'Can I talk about lapis lazuli in the movie?'"</p>
<p>So, I guess listen out for mentions of Minecraft's blue mineral when the film releases next month.</p>
<p>To tie in with the upcoming film, the Minecraft team has also made that leaked movie pack for the game official. The  'A Minecraft Movie' in-game Hero Pack will be available from today, 20th March.</p>

</figure>
<p>The Minecraft Movie is set to release on 4th April. Along with Black's Steve, the film also stars Jason Momoa as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison.</p>
<p>Away from the big screen, an animated Minecraft series was also announced for Netflix back in May. Netflix will produce the project alongside Minecraft developer Mojang Studios, while WildBrain Studios - the studio behind Sonic Prime - will handle the development.</p>
<p>While further details are thin on the ground, it is said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">upcoming show will "feature an original story with new characters</a>, showing the world of 'Minecraft' in a new light".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>What's the going rate for a flight to attend GDC these days? I ask because I'd have loved to be buzzing my merry way about the convention walls when Snail Games USA unveiled this doozy of an AI-generated trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>'s Aquatica expansion. I'd give it a solid nine on the "we're not even trying to disguise it any longer" scale. How bad is it? Bad enough that original developers <a href="https://x.com/survivetheark/status/1901846059933942125">Studio Wildcard hastily and firmly distanced themselves</a> from the project, reiterating that their focus was on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">ARK: Survival Ascended</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>.</p>
<p>If I had to sum up the trailer in a single word, I would attempt to write that word out with four-day old regurgitated Alphabetti spaghetti, invariably failing to give voice to my flailing disgust before retiring to the corner to fart at god. This would still take approximately fourteen times more effort than whoever got paid to write "like the ocean, but worse" into their phone to tease out the following results.</p>

<p>Fans are understandably gobsmacked at the sheer gall of it, as am I, honestly. Nothing builds excitement for a new release like the company behind it proudly declaring they have no respect for the audience's taste or intelligence. It's especially jarring considering Wildcard recently revealed an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-ascendeds-first-expansion-recruits-the-studio-behind-jujutsu-kaisen-for-some-flashy-anime-cutscenes">animated trailer for their Lost Colony expansion by Jujutsu Kaisen studio</a> MAPPA. Now, I'm no art critic, but I do enjoy limbs being shown in correct quantities.</p>
<p>If I can say one positive thing about the trailer, it's that I'm actually nostalgic for the blooming synaptic flora shown at 0:43, because it reminds me of the very early days of GenAI-precursor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream">DeepDream</a>, a period where slop could at least have been said to have a distinct aesthetic rather than a distinct odour. I'm also tickled by the shirtless shark riding at 0:56 because, yes, it just looks like the cover of a smut novel about a guy who either fucks sharks or does all his fuckin' on sharkback.</p>
<p>Ah well, there's some comfort to be taken in the immediate and unanimous fan comment backlash at least. Wildcard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-ascended-will-be-sold-without-ark-2-after-backlash-but-will-still-cost-60">haven't been free of controversy themselves</a>, mind, but I suppose we're gradually becoming more wistful and appreciative of honest, artisanal fuck-ups in the face of the alternative. In the meantime, the demoralising assault from all angles on all facets of existence will continue until morale improves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>During a recent online global showcase streamed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QkXfP9rwrm8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on YouTube</a> and Twitch, inZOI Producer and Director and CEO of inZOI Studio Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim revealed several details about the highly anticipated life simulation game due to launch next week in early access. First and foremost, the pricing was confirmed to be $39.99 with no in-game purchases. This includes all updates and 'DLC' during the early access phase. The developer teased that upcoming content includes freelance jobs, ghost play, a Southeast Asian-inspired cat island called Kucingku, swimming pools and swimming skills, a family tree, new professions, and more.</p>
<p>For those who really cannot wait for March 28, the team has released a free demo called Creative Studio that lets players customize their character and home. However, there is a bit of a trick to getting access to Creative Studio, as you'll need to obtain it as a 'Drop reward' after watching streamed gameplay of inZOI on one of four streaming platforms:</p>
<p><em><b>Twitch &amp; Chzzk</b></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>First, link your KRAFTON ID with your streaming platform account. You can conveniently link your accounts on the following&nbsp;<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fplayinzoi.com%2Fen%2Fevents%2Fdrops">microsite</a>.</em></li>
<li><em>After adding inZOI to your Steam wishlist and watching a broadcast with the inZOI category for at least 15 minutes, a key will be granted.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><b>Steam</b></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you watch inZOI streaming on the&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/?snr=1_5_9_">Steam store page</a>&nbsp;for 30 minutes or more,&nbsp;<b>inZOI: Creative Studio</b>&nbsp;will be added to your Steam library.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><b>SOOP</b></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you accumulate 30 minutes of viewing on a broadcast with the inZOI category set, a key will be granted.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Drops event will run until 22 March at 23:59 UTC and may end early if the supply of codes runs out. However, fear not, as right afterward (from 23rd March 00:00 UTC until 27th March 23:59 UTC), the developers will open up inZOI: Creative Studio to everyone.</p>
<p><iframe title="inZOI: Creative Studio Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-p8SNK9jg4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Toward the end of the online global showcase, Hyungjun Kim said:</p>
<p><em>I hope that players will be able to experience things that they can’t in real life, feel a sense of control over life itself, and have the opportunity to look at life from a slight distance. It has been a rough ride and there may still be some shortcomings, but we are committed to paying close attention to feedback from our community as we continue to improve the game towards its full release as soon as possible.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires a rather powerful PC</a> if you plan to play it maxed out with the graphics settings. There will be support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution as well as the unique <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'Smart ZOI' NPC feature powered by NVIDIA ACE</a> and a .5B billion parameter Mistral NeMo Minitron small language model that runs locally on your NVIDIA GPU when playing inZOI.</p>

			<p>After around a year and a half of near-complete silence, Honor of Kings: World has resurfaced at the Game Developers Conference 2025 with a gorgeous new trailer that shows off the game's vibrant biomes and several boss fights, including some featuring a group of players.</p>
<p>Honor of Kings: World takes place in the setting of the extremely popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. In 2024, Honor of Kings was the top-grossing mobile game with $2.6 billion. Of course, this is a much different game. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-is-an-action-rpg-announced-by-tencent-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in October 2021 as an open world action RPG developed by TiMi Studio Group, developer of Call of Duty: Mobile, Pokémon UNITE, Age of Empires Mobile, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-hands-on-preview-revisiting-a-cinema-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Force</a>. It also features a collaboration with acclaimed Chinese writer Liu Cixin, known for The Three-Body Problem. Apparently, he will adapt a story called The Poetry Cloud. In May 2023, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-to-support-dlss-3-ray-tracing-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Honor of Kings: World would support NVIDIA DLSS 3 and ray tracing on PC. It is likely that before its release, it will be updated to the new DLSS 4.</p>

<p>Honor of Kings: World is playable for the first time at the Game Developers Conference 2025, and our envoy Kai Tatsumoto has an appointment to check it out, so stay tuned for our first impressions of the game. For now, it has been announced to be coming for PC and mobile; you can find the newly launched official website <a href="https://honorofkingsworld.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Reality of Twitch Viewbotting Exposed by Streamer Slip-Up]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-viewbotting-reality-exposed-streamer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reality-of-twitch-viewbotting-exposed-by-streamer-slip-up.1139787/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-viewbotting-reality-exposed-streamer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, a Twitch streamer accidentally revealed her viewbotting tool while streaming, prompting her to restart her broadcast and try to cover up the blunder by linking it to an OBS update. This is one of the few tangible examples we’ve got of Twitch streamers (and streamers on other platforms) using viewbotting tools to appear more popular than they are.</p>



<p>It’s a topic that has become all too common of late, with streamers going live to thousands of viewers but only having a few dozen people chatting at any given time – if that. In situations like this, it’s becoming much easier to cast stones at those maliciously boosting their viewer count. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-red-handed">Red-Handed</h2>



<p>In a clip that’s doing the rounds on social media, QueenGloriaRP was caught flashing up a viewbotting panel as she started her stream. It was clipped, captured, and circulated almost immediately, with users slamming the small streamer for cheating the platform.</p>



<p>QueenGloraRP had racked up just 3,600 followers when she was banned by Twitch hours after the viewbotting debacle surfaced online.</p>



<p>Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky took to social media to share his clear concerns about the situation, along with a copy of the clip:</p>



<div><article><p><span>So if this random Twitch streamer is viewbotting just 20 viewers… how many streamers are doing this? </span></p></article></div>







<p>It’s fair game for the average small streamer to worry about. They’re often punishing themselves for not netting as many viewers as the next streamer, but how often are the numbers being misrepresented by viewbotting tools? In QueenGloriaRP’s slip-up, it’s easy to see how simple it is to generate fake viewer counts, and she was only adding on a humble 20 non-existent audience members.</p>



<p>What about the larger streamers that have viewer counts in the tens of thousands? What percentage of that audience is real?</p>



<p>The panel that QueenGloriaRP revealed broke down how users will <strong>pay </strong>for their fake viewers. It looked like a token-based system was used, with more viewers equalling more credits (10 pcs for each viewer per hour). If it wasn’t bad enough that she was viewbotting, <strong>paying </strong>for the privilege is nuts on another level.</p>



<p>It’s fake growth; it’ll get you nowhere.</p>

<p>Balatro has continued a winning streak at the Game Developer’s Conference in San Francisco. At the showcase’s award ceremony, Balatro secured four major awards, including Game of the Year. It doesn’t come as much of a surprise, as the solo dev spectacle of a game has continued to take the world by storm since being released just over a year ago.</p>



<p>Astro Bot also secured multiple awards at the GDC ceremony, including Best Audio and Best Technology.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-gdc-awards-winners">All GDC Awards Winners</h2>



<p>GDC is getting bigger and brighter all the time, and it’s starting to rival Gamescom with how expansive it is. This year’s GDC Awards ceremony was a showstopper, with last year’s best games being showered with praise by attendees.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of winners from the GDC Awards:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game of the Year – Balatro</li>



<li>Best Audio – Astro Bot</li>



<li>Best Debut – Balatro</li>



<li>Best Design – Balatro</li>



<li>Best Narrative – Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>



<li>Best Technology – Astro Bot</li>



<li>Best Visual Art – Black Myth: Wukong</li>



<li>Audience Award – Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>



<li>Innovation Award – Balatro</li>



<li>Lifetime Achievement Award – Sam Lake</li>



<li>Pioneer Award – Lucas Pope</li>



<li>Social Impact Award – Life is Strange: Double Exposure</li>
</ul>



<p>Recently, Balatro’s solo developer went on record with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/localthunk-the-balatro-timeline-solo-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a feature-length blog post</a> that explained what it took to bring Balatro to life. It was a tale of a stressful, strenuous journey that left his mental and physical health in tatters for a time, but it paid off when the game launched to an overwhelmingly positive reception and made $600,000 on Steam in ‘just a couple of hours’.</p>



<p>The GDC Awards represents one of the last awards shows dedicated to 2024’s spread of games. With that buttoned up, we can now look to 2025’s best games, which have already started emerging. I’m willing to bet that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> will secure more than a few awards as the year unravels.</p>
