<p>Joining Dr. Eggman early next year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> is getting Sega Villains Stage DLC next year, which will see Joe Musashi face off against classic bad guys from past releases.</p>
<p>In August, we found out Sonic's Dr. Eggman would be first up, and now Sega and Lizardcube have lifted the lid on the second character. It's Death Adder - the fearsome giant from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/golden_axe">Golden Axe</a> series. Here's a teaser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The katana verses the axe. Joe Musashi will face off against another classic SEGA Villain – Death Adder, the fearsome giant from the Golden Axe series. Play against him, Dr Eggman and another mysterious villain in the SEGA Villains Stage DLC for SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned, these two villains will be joined by one other mysterious guest villain. And they're scheduled to land in early 2026. This reveal follows last week's game update. This particular patch improved the Nintendo Switch resolution and also addressed some bugs.</p>

Cheating has been an ongoing issue with the franchise, up to and including last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-call-of-dutys-anti-cheat-aims-to-take-out-cheaters-in-black-ops-6/1100-6527263/" data-ref-id="1100-6527263">Black Ops 6</a>. To combat this trend, Activision has unveiled the latest upgrades to its anti-cheat measures ahead of the Black Ops 7 open beta.</p><p>According to Activision, in-game detection measures have been enhanced by training "advanced machine learning systems on millions of hours of gameplay." The publisher is also stepping up its legal measures to dismantle attempts to monetize cheats outside of the game.</p><p>The primary tools being used to combat cheaters are the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-how-to-turn-on-secure-boot-on-pc/1100-6533761/" data-ref-id="1100-6533761">Secure Boot</a> and TPM 2.0 requirements for Black Ops 7 on PC. Those measures will be implemented alongside the newest incarnation of the Ricochet anti-cheat software to prevent cheaters from sidestepping or fooling them. Activision notes that it will also be removing cheaters in real time as they are detected.</p><p>Even these upgrades may not fully eliminate cheating from the Call of Duty franchise, but part of the goal behind this beta is to test these measures under live conditions. Everything learned during this trial period can be used to make these systems even more effective when Black Ops 7 launches.</p><p>Activision will conclude the open beta on Wednesday, October 8, at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. Black Ops 7 will officially launch on November 14 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<section><p>Silent Hill f's flowers are more than just a pretty touch.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Since the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> back in 2022, I've seen one question circulating online with far more fervor and frequency than any other: Does it have any connection to the rest of the series? After years of waiting and speculation, we finally have an answer.</p><p><em>Warning: Silent Hill f spoilers to follow.</em></p><p>If you've rolled credits on Silent Hill f, you're familiar with its shocking first ending. In it, it is revealed that the Hinako exploring Ebisugaoka is actually a twenty-something-year-old Hinako experiencing deep, drug-induced psychosis. Though players have witnessed what seemingly started out as an ordinary day for our high school-age main character, we come to discover that, in the real world, it's Hinako's wedding day, and she's spent the last few hours of it murdering her friends and family members. Her actions are, of course, horrific, but make sense if you do a little digging around.</p><p>Turns out, Hinako has been taking Kakura-Makakura, a natural medicine made from ground Hakkokusou seeds that are then placed in small, red capsules. Originally given to her by her friend Shu to help with recurring tension headaches, it becomes obvious that the apprentice apothecary gave her the medication without properly assessing the risk in taking it or properly considering its reputation. A stack of journal entries on Shu's desk gives us minimal insight into the medicine, as he writes he prescribed it to her to "curb her reliance" on traditional medication and made it by combining peony and kudzu root. Fortunately, documents scattered throughout the town and spirit realm give us the opportunity to learn a bit more about the medication ourselves.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577412-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_35_59_49.still006.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577412" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577412-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_35_59_49.still006.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577412"></a><figcaption>Hinako looks at a pond surrounded by white flowers in Silent Hill f.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577412-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_35_59_49.still006.png"></figure><p>According to research papers found in Silent Hill f, Hakkokusou is also referred to as "the flower of the gods." The documents go on to state that the herb is an important part of folklore, as it is known for giving those who consume its seeds the ability to converse with gods, visit their lands, and awaken dormant powers--all of which happen to Hinako. Lastly, the papers describe Hakkokusou as "notoriously difficult to cultivate as it requires a very specific environment in which to grow" and is "rarely found in the wild." It makes sense then, that the one place we find Hakkokusou in Silent Hill f is near Shu's home, which also serves as the town's apothecary.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577413-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_10_24_28.still001.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577414-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_10_30_32.still002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577415-persciption_for_my_partner_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577416-persciption_for_my_partner_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577417-persciption_for_my_partner_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577413,1300-4577414,1300-4577415,1300-4577416,1300-4577417" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4577413-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_10_24_28.still001.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4577414-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_10_30_32.still002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4577415-persciption_for_my_partner_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4577416-persciption_for_my_partner_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4577417-persciption_for_my_partner_3.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577413-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_10_24_28.still001.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577414-silenthillf_pc_10_going_to_shu_s_house.mp4.00_10_30_32.still002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577415-persciption_for_my_partner_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577416-persciption_for_my_partner_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577417-persciption_for_my_partner_3.png"></figure><p>Upon reaching Shu's house, you'll stumble upon a small pond surrounded by large, white flowers unlike any you've seen around town--and this is precisely where Silent Hill f shows us how it connects to the other Silent Hill games. Though referred to as Hakkokusou in Silent Hill f, Silent Hill fans will recognize these flowers as While Claudia, a "perennial herb found near water" that features white blossoms and contains hallucinogenic seeds.</p><p>Since the series' beginning, White Claudia has played a notable role in Silent Hill. In the first game, protagonist Harry Mason stumbles upon several documents indicating the game's cultists have been consuming the flower's seed during their ceremonies, somewhat explaining their bizarre behavior. While visiting the town's hospital, he also finds a broken bottle of Aglaophotis--a thick, red liquid later revealed to be refined White Claudia.</p><p>In Silent Hill 3, Harry's daughter, Heather Mason, calls a pendant her father gave her one of her "most treasured belongings." If you check it's item description, it reads, "There's a jewel inside, like a little red tablet." Later in the game, we find out that this jewel is actually a small vial of Aglaophotis as well. Most recently, White Claudia made an appearance in Silent Hill 2's remake, in which developer Bloober Team added a new ending that sees James take the substance and begin to hallucinate his wife Mary back before she developed her terminal illness.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577418-ff%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577418" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577418-ff%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577418"></a><figcaption>Heather's necklace.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4577418-ff%283%29.png"></figure><p>And to make this theory even more convincing, it's worth delving a bit more into White Claudia's liquid form, Aglaophotis. According to <a href="https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Aglaophotis#Silent_Hill:_Downpour" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fandom's Silent Hill page</a> for the in-game drug, "Aglaophotis may have been a factual herb, sometimes connected in identity to the European peony. The Greek doctor Dioscorides named Aglaophotisas a member of the peony family, Paeoniaceae." This directly coincides with Shu's journal entries, which describe him as using peonies to produce Kakura-Makakura. Lastly, Agura no Hotei-sama--one of the item's required to attain Silent Hill f's Fox Wedding ending--is described as a medicine bottle containing a red liquid, similar to Aglaophotis. Later on, Hinako is forced to drink the refined "flower of the gods" to help steady herself in the spirit world.</p><p>So although Silent Hill f might not take place in Silent Hill, it feels safe to say that it definitely takes place in the same world and tugs at the same threads and themes as its predecessors. It's also worth mentioning that it's among the best games in the series, with our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/v/" data-ref-id="1900-6418411">Silent Hill f review</a> calling it, "a visual spectacle, a mastercraft in psychological horror, a work of narrative brilliance, and a new benchmark for the Silent Hill series."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Electronic Arts just announced that it is going to be acquired and taken private <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">in a massive $55 billion deal</a> led by an investor group composed of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. The deal, expected to close in Q1 of EA’s 2027 fiscal year (which takes place from April 1st to June 30th, 2026), isn’t just a huge amount of money involving one of gaming’s largest publishers; it could have massive ramifications for the company, the types of games it invests in, and the people that make them.</p><p>The deal itself, a leveraged buyout, consists of about $36 billion in cash from Silver Lake, Affinity Partners, and PIF (which is rolling over its 9.9 percent equity stake it already has in EA), while JPMorgan Chase Bank will provide $20 billion of debt financing (“$18 billion of which is expected to be funded at close,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250929186526/en/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-%2455-Billion">according to EA’s press release</a>). That means that the newly private company will have to do a lot to justify the massive price tag.</p><p>“Leveraged buyouts leverage debt, which usually means more layoffs, smaller budgets for growth, and fewer risks,” Mona Ibrahim, former lead counsel at Epic Games, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7378446006037663744-MsG9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAIV1iYBHi7OPybalzIKilWBO4bTY5vJb8c">said on LinkedIn</a>. “For an industry that thrives on invention, this seems problematic.”</p><p>There isn’t a direct comparison to this situation. As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lzyd46jolc2o">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella notes</a>, “$20 billion of debt financing is a shockingly large number to have to service, while also transitioning from a public to private organization and all the implications that has on the people that work in it. We’ve obviously never seen anything like this at this scale in the industry before.” But we can look at what has happened to some of Microsoft’s big gaming acquisitions as a bit of a roadmap for what may happen with EA.</p><p>A few months after the completion of the $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard deal in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">October 2023</a>, Microsoft laid off 1,900 staffers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">across Activision Blizzard and Xbox</a>, and Blizzard’s president left the company. An <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050297/blizzard-survival-game-cancelled-layoffs">in-development survival game</a> was canceled — a notable decision given Blizzard’s past history of creating enduring, long-running franchises like <em>Diablo</em> and <em>Warcraft</em>. Microsoft has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">shut down</a> Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks, which it picked up as part of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized">ZeniMax Media acquisition</a>, and as part of a big company-wide layoff earlier this year, it cut staff at ZeniMax and <em>Candy Crush</em> maker King (which is under the umbrella of Activision Blizzard).</p><p>It also seems like that EA will continue to focus primarily on its most lucrative tentpole franchises, a direction the publisher has been headed toward for some time. You just need to look at its <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2026/q1/Q1-FY26-Earnings-Slides-FINAL.pdf">most recent earnings slides</a> to see it. EA’s “core business” slide features six games with “massive online communities”: <em>Apex Legends</em>, <em>Battlefield</em>, <em>EA Sports College Football</em>, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, <em>Madden</em>, and <em>The Sims</em>. The slide also has a small mention of EA’s free-to-play <em>Skate</em> revival, which just launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761186/ea-skate-free-to-play-early-access-release-date">in early access</a> and is another attempt from EA to make a big multiplayer game.</p><p>Basically, EA’s major roadmap features a lot of sports, big shooters in <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and additions to <em>The Sims 4</em> (and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247213/the-next-sims-is-going-into-playtesting-soon">a new <em>Sims</em> in development</a>). There are also a few smaller games tossed in here and there (like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648543/star-wars-zero-company-celebration">some <em>Star Wars</em> games</a> and a <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> remaster) and <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/library/freetoplay">a bunch of free-to-play games</a>. For the most part, the scale of these titles continues to increase. <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is being developed by <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-studios">four of EA’s most notable studios</a> in order to compete with <em>Call of Duty</em>, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247213/the-next-sims-is-going-into-playtesting-soon">the next <em>Sims</em></a> will be an ambitious shift for the franchise. In short: EA is putting more money into fewer games. And the buyout is likely to speed up this process even more.</p><p>This puts EA’s smaller games and underperforming franchises in a difficult position. After BioWare’s <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> did poorly enough that EA had to say so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349886/dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-eas-expectations">in a pre-earnings press release</a> earlier this year, it wasn’t long before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604549/bioware-layoffs-shifts-mass-effect">the beloved studio was hit with layoffs</a>. The EA Originals label has had some hits with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two">Split Fiction</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352157/it-takes-two-interview-developer-josef-fares-hazelight-studio-co-op">It Takes Two</a></em>, but other games, like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23690449/ea-immortals-of-aveum-pc-system-requirements-next-gen">Immortals of Aveum</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24146692/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-metroidvania-platformer">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a></em>, weren’t nearly as successful, so the new EA might opt not to work on more Originals projects in the future. EA has already shown itself to be ruthless even with games that seemingly have a lot of potential: it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675923/black-panther-cancelled-cliffhanger-studios-shut-down-ea">canceled its <em>Black Panther</em> game earlier this year</a> and shuttered the studio behind it, despite it being attached to a film franchise that earned more than $2 billion.</p><p>Once the deal closes, there could be other cost-cutting measures, including increased use of AI. “The investors are betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA’s profits in the coming years,” according to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133">the <em>Financial Times</em></a>, citing “people involved in the transaction.” EA CEO Andrew Wilson, who will continue to lead the company after the deal closes, has said that AI is at the “<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/ea-the-future-of-entertainment-is-interactive-as-dev-looks-to-become-launchpad-for-new-businesses/">very core</a>” of EA’s business. Given the history of some past big leveraged buyouts, EA may still have a turbulent future ahead, even if it makes big changes. Toys R Us and Hertz both filed for bankruptcies after major leveraged buyouts years earlier, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/electronic-arts-go-private-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-2025-09-29/">as noted by <em>Reuters</em></a>.</p><p>We don’t know exactly what to expect from EA moving forward given the uniqueness of this situation. Wilson <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/exciting-news-about-our-future">may have promised employees today</a> that “the future we are building together is brighter than ever,” but history suggests that things might not be so sunny.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We've made so many of these that we can't tell anymore until someone else plays it."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil has been one of the video game industry's quintessential, flagship horror games for years now, delivering everything over the years from unsettling, atmospheric haunting to outright jumpscares. But as its development team continues to search for new ways to freak people out, a few of its leaders are admitting that they're not always 100% certain what elements of Resident Evil are actually scary anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from our interview with director Koshi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazama at Tokyo Game Show 2025. We started by talking about Resident Evil: Requiem's new protagonist, Grace, and her <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-are-still-being-coy-about-leon-kennedy">differences from the more action-oriented Leon S. Kennedy</a>. That led to a discussion of why the series was pulling back on the heavy action elements in Requiem, as Nakanishi explains:</p><blockquote>I think you can broadly classify Resident Evil titles on a scale of how much they're like Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 7 was definitely on the 2 side of that, as it returned to survival horror roots and was very acclaimed for that. Resident Evil Village built on that and added in more action and gunplay and brought it toard the RE4 side of that particular scale. But if we kept going in that direction there's almost an inflation effect, where you have to keep adding more and more action to outdo the previous title, and by doing that you ultimately end up where Resident Evil 5 and 6 went, and although they're still great games, the general consensus is that they pushed Resident Evil so far in the action direction that it was no longer horror. I didn't want to have to do that with Resident Evil's ninth title where I just tried to outdo the action in Village and ended up making something I didn't want to make. Firmly swinging the scale toward the Resident Evil 2 style was our intention, and it's almost an upgrade of that Resident 2 style.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">But that led to a follow-up question where I asked Nakanishi about the other side of the coin, of trying to outdo their own scares with each new title. Nakanishi noted that their goal isn't necessarily to innovate horror, but there is a certain numbing effect that working on these games for so long has, where they really need to see audience reactions to know if what they've made is actually scary or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've made so many of these that we can't tell anymore until someone else plays it," Nakanishi says. "There was actually a bit of a worry internally before we showed the [Resident Evil: Requiem] hands-off at SGF and the first hands-on at Gamescom, was this actually scary? Because we don't even know anymore. This is our bread and better, what we make every day."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I ended up asking Nakanishi if there was anything they had cut from the game for being too scary. He couldn't recall anything specific that was actually removed from the game after it had been added, but he did remember one anecdote that might make fans of Ethan Winters chuckle:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We didn't really implement it, so it wasn't cut, but- we don't know if something's scary.

<p>However, Futter thinks the move from public to private ownership will shift the source of the ever-present demands for consistently rising profits. "All public AAA companies have overemphasized 'returning value to shareholders' over taking care of all stakeholder groups, including labor," he said. "Now, that will be shifted to keeping the company afloat amidst enormous debt payments and servicing [private equity] owners."</p>
<h2>Saud-EA Arabia</h2>
<p>The big wild card that makes this buyout different from others, analysts agreed, was the involvement of the Saudi Public Investment Fund. For the Saudis—who already own almost 10 percent of EA and minority stakes in many other gaming companies—this purchase is "very much about aligning gaming and esports alongside entertainment and sports as key diversification pillars for the Saudi economy," Niko Partners' Daniel Ahmad told Ars.</p>
<p>Niko's research shows that EA's sports portfolio could be particularly attractive to the Saudis; 33 percent of PC players and 44 percent of console players in the Middle East say the sports game genre is their favorite. Those sports games also fit well with Saudi Arabia's existing investments in the esports sector, Cole pointed out.</p>

<p>But Cole also warned that the Saudi involvement in a major US-based game publisher could draw government attention, especially when it comes to data privacy. "Games can open a Pandora's Box of consumer info and data collection, and I expect heavy US government scrutiny of the deal, both initially and ongoing," Cole said.</p>
<p>The Saudi regime's stringent position on some social issues might also have an effect on the content of some EA games in the future, analysts warned. Futter said that the removal of LGBTQIA-friendly material in the socially liberal Sims franchise would be the "canary in the coal mine" for that kind of content-based meddling.</p>
<p>Van Dreunen said that Saudi Arabia's investment "has to do with soft power" more than any specific games or content. That could mean relocating some of EA's operations or events to Riyadh, and "a stronger emphasis on global cultural reach" for EA titles. With Saudi money underwriting the risk, "the pressure to deliver quarterly profits will ease, even as the pressure to deliver cultural relevance increases," he said.</p>
<p>Whether that will lead the Saudis or EA's other new private owners to directly meddle in EA's day-to-day operations, though, remains a question. "The best case scenario is that the private equity firms leave the company alone and let leadership move forward as the experts," Futter said. "Leveraged buyouts are wildly risky (see: Toys R Us), and the only winners in situations like that are the PE firms."</p>

			<p>Techland's latest mainline installment in its Dying Light series, Dying Light: The Beast, is finally here, and players can leap into the infected-ridden resort town and forest area of Castor Woods with returning protagonist Kyle Crane back at the helm.</p>



<p>I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">reviewed</a> Dying Light: The Beast for Wccftech, and it was my first time diving into the series, which means that everything that was old hat for series veterans was brand new to me.</p>



<p>It also means there were a few things I would've appreciated knowing about Dying Light: The Beast before jumping in, which is why this guide will aim to give you five things to know about diving into Techland's latest zombie-riddled adventure.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-starter-guide-5-things-to-know-about-leaping-into-castor-woods">Dying Light: The Beast Starter Guide - 5 Things to Know About Leaping Into Castor Woods</h2>



<h3 id="h-don-t-go-out-at-night-at-least-not-right-away">Don't go out at night - at least not right away</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast. Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>A key part of the Dying Light series is its day-and-night cycle, and the terrors that you can face when the sun goes down, compared to when it's high in the sky. Going out at night is a core part of the Dying Light experience, and the tense moments you experience while being chased by one or multiple Volatile's on your way to a safe zone are where some of the best gameplay moments come from.</p>



<p>But they can also be the source of the most frustrating, if you're not prepared. That's why once you've reached the Town Hall and you're let loose in Old Town in Castor Woods, do yourself a favour and spend some time avoiding the night. Take advantage of not having to deal with Volatile's during the day and unlock the safe zones in Old Town before you start exploring the area at night.</p>



<p>Getting killed by Volatile's and losing a bunch of XP early on while you're trying to level up and gain some key skills, like being able to jump kick zombies isn't how you want to spend your early hours.</p>



<h3 id="h-craft-your-bow-and-keep-it-upgraded">Craft your bow and keep it upgraded</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first ranged weapon you'll get in the game is the Hunting Bow, and getting it crafted and in your inventory is something you'll want to do as soon as possible. It'll be on the first workbench you find in the game, which is Techland basically signposting it to you as something to get in your inventory right away, but you probably won't have the materials for it.</p>



<p>Thankfully, that's an easy fix, as the required materials aren't too difficult to scavenge. Once you have it in your inventory, it's also worth keeping it upgraded as much as possible. Particularly when you're taking on human enemies throughout the game, your bow is key to ensuring stealth-focused scenarios go well.</p>



<h3 id="h-upgrade-your-bandage-flashlight-and-throwing-knife-blueprints">Upgrade your bandage, flashlight, and throwing knife blueprints</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast</figcaption></figure>



<p>You'll be upgrading your gear and swapping out weapons over the course of Dying Light: The Beast, but the upgrades you'll want to really prioritize are your blueprint upgrades. Specifically the blueprints for your bandages, UV flashlight, and throwing knives.</p>



<p>Upgrading the blueprints for each item makes them more effective, and in the case of throwing knives, lets you craft more of them without using as many resources.</p>



<p>These three items are the ones you will likely use more than any other during your time in Castor Woods, and upgrading their blueprints as quickly as you can will have you set up for the endgame well before you get there.</p>



<h3 id="h-mash-that-survivor-sense-at-all-times">Mash that Survivor Sense at all times</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Areas like this can look devoid of resources, until your Survivor Sense reveals otherwise.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Your Survivor Sense ability can be occasionally helpful for keeping track of enemies nearby, human and zombie alike, but what it's really key for is telling you where resources are near you. You'll want to keep mashing the survivor sense as much as you can, because you're otherwise liable to miss scores of resources that you'll need for upgrading your gear and for crafting the resources you need while out in the wilds of Castor Woods.</p>



<h3 id="h-you-don-t-need-to-fight-everyone-and-everything">You don't need to fight everyone and everything</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>Particularly, if you're like me, you might feel like you need to wipe every zombie you see off the board when you see them. Absolutely not the case - it's good to keep your aggression meter up so that you can launch into Beast mode quickly when you do get into a big fight, so picking off a few zombies here and there isn't a bad idea.</p>



<p>But you absolutely don't need to fight every zombie you come across, and you're better off not trying to. Besides the fact that your weapons will deteriorate faster, you'll more than likely find yourself getting overwhelmed with all the noise you're making, and then you're back in the position of losing XP for no good reason.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you're a Dying Light veteran, than most of this was probably old hat for you, but if you were like me and are playing The Beast without having checked out the previous games, than these tips will help you start off your journey through Castor Woods on the right foot.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-battlefield-6-mass-effect-bioware-private-equity-2000629947</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-goes-private-then-what.1311985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Why does Saudi Arabia want to make games? What will the largest leveraged buyout in history mean for EA and its employees? How will the consequences of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">new $55 billion deal</a> ripple out across the rest of the video game industry? I reached out to some analysts to get their take on the sale and what it tells us about the state of gaming now, and where it’s headed. Here’s what they said.</p> <h2>A “soft-power” play</h2> <p>“This is the second-largest deal in games history—$50 billion for a mature publisher whose growth engine has stalled,” Joost van Dreunen, a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and author of <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link"><u>SuperJoost Playlist</u></a>, wrote in an email to <em>Kotaku</em>. “It shows how sovereign capital, not just Big Tech, is now dictating who controls cultural IP. It also highlights how public-market fatigue with slow-growth publishers is pushing them toward privatization.”</p> <p>Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has mandated $38 billion be invested in turning the country into a gaming powerhouse, with sizable chunks of that already being spent on buying up <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-scopely-niantic-saudi-arabia-monster-hunter-1851769360">mobile game makers</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">taking over esports</a>, and acquiring equity in <a href="https://kotaku.com/snk-saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman-mbs-king-of-fighte-1848754233">major gaming companies</a> (it already owns 10 percent of EA going into the sale). While other private equity partners are part of the sale, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/saudi-plans-for-video-game-hub-grow-with-55-billion-ea-deal?srnd=undefined"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that the majority of the funding comes from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.</p>

 <p>In the <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/electronic-arts-55b-buyout-doesnt">latest edition of his newsletter,</a> van Dreunen points to the illogic of the the deal’s financial math, which values EA much more highly than its current cash flow would suggest it should be for a leveraged buyout in which $20 billion is financed through debt. He argues the deal underpins Saudi Arabia’s willingness to overpay for U.S. cultural IP, as well as Wall Street’s loss of interest in legacy gaming businesses whose growth potential has stalled out in recent years. “At the center sits the irrational financial logic that tells you it’s about power, prestige, and staking Saudi Arabia’s claim in American entertainment,” he writes.</p>

 <h2>Gaming continues to consolidate in search of growth</h2> <p>The conventional wisdom was that amid the post-pandemic flurry of market consolidation, EA would merge with someone sooner or later. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-acquisition-apex-legends-star-wars-fifa-nbcuniversal-1848957274">It reportedly engaged in acquisition talks</a> with Apple and others back in 2022, with a potential deal to to merge with NBCUniversal eventually falling apart over price. Pundits have called on Disney to buy the publisher of <em>Madden</em> and <em>FIFA</em> (now <em>EA Sports FC</em>) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190223172654/https://kotaku.com/wall-street-journal-to-disney-buy-ea-5075163">for decades</a>. “We couldn’t be in a stronger position as a standalone company,” EA CEO Andrew Wilson said back in 2022.</p>

 <p>What’s changed since then? EA hasn’t has a new runaway success story since <em>Apex Legends</em>, which shadow-dropped back in 2019 and stumbled last year amid declining interest.<em> EA Sports FC</em>, <em>Madden</em>, and now <em>College Football</em> are the core games sustaining the publisher, but it’s unclear where they go from here. <em>Battlefield </em>is taking on <em>Call of Duty</em> again for the first time in years, but it’s an expensive live-service gambit at a time when few new multiplayer games seem to be able to stick for any length of time.</p>

 <p>“EA’s mobile games business has traditionally underperformed and should be a much larger part of its overall business,” Piers Harding-Roll, Games Research Director at Ampere Analysis, told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. “This alignment could help transform EA’s mobile business. EA’s revenue growth in recent years has been benign, so the opportunity to drive growth and build out a long-term strategy by bringing together a cross-section of expertise is attractive to both parties.”</p>

 <p>The publishers attempts to adapt its hit franchises into mobile games have either been canceled (<a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-mobile-shutdown-ea-respawn-battlefield-1850056170"><em>Battlefield</em></a>), quickly closed down (<a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-mobile-shutdown-ea-respawn-battlefield-1850056170"><em>Apex Legends</em></a>), or struggled to bring in boatloads of money (<a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/ea-sports-mobile-revenue-1-billion"><em>Madden</em></a>). “The deal creates opportunities for Saudi Arabia to strengthen its console &amp; PC presence, and provides EA with an opportunity for synergy with [Saudi-owned mobile developer] Scopely for ongoing mobile expansion, now that both are under the PIF,” Daniel Ahmad, Director of Research and Insights at Niko Partners, told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email.</p> <h2>Leveraged buyouts are a recipe for pain</h2> <p>Big private-equity deals involving lots of debt often <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/6/21024740/private-equity-taylor-swift-toys-r-us-elizabeth-warren">bring with them sharp cuts</a>. Business analysts will call this “right-sizing” or “rationalizing the business,” but what it means is people paid a fraction of their CEO’s salary get fired. EA currently has roughly 15,000 employees, a number many industry watchers expect to decline. “Leveraged buyouts deposit a large amount of long-term debt on the company being acquired and an additional $20 billion of debt will need to be serviced through cutting costs and building more margin from existing businesses to generate more free cash flow,” Harding-Roll said.</p> <p>There’s been a lot of debate on whether going private will free the company up to invest in franchises long-term rather than invest almost exclusively in games that deliver predictable quarterly returns. Could a lack of shareholder pressure yield more single-player blockbusters, or provide EA with enough runway to give the next <em>Mass Effect</em> as much time in development as it needs? Or will the debt crunch incentivize EA to lop off anything that’s not generating revenue and retreat even further into annualized sequels?</p>

 <p>“EA’s empire is heavy on sports and sprawling studios, so some ‘right-sizing’ is inevitable—expect a sharper split between the sports division and everything else, some studio consolidation, and likely relocation of certain functions to Saudi Arabia,” van Dreunen told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “Being private could also tilt its content strategy back toward longer-cycle franchises rather than quarter-to-quarter live-ops churn. <em>Battlefield</em> gets a cushion, but there will be trims and a sports-versus-everything-else carve-out.”</p> <h2>Unconventional players in uncharted waters</h2> <p>Video games are a notoriously chaotic business, mergers are inherently unpredictable, and a sovereign wealth fund has never owned one of the biggest gaming publishers in the world before (following Activision’s sale to Microsoft, EA is the biggest non-platform, non-Chinese company in gaming by revenue). While it’s reasonable to explain the deal by pointing to Saudi Arabia’s global PR blitz and synergies in sports and mobile gaming, it’s also reasonable to think it’s way too early to tell how this will shake out, especially when you throw a $20 billion loan into the mix.</p>

 <p>“I can’t say I know what it all means yet, or what this deal will result in when it comes to EA’s games and studios,” Mat Piscatella, Circana’s Director of Gaming Research, told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “I’d hazard to even attempt to speculate at this point. Of course, leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn’t been great for the acquired companies, but I do not know if that will be the case here given the parties involved.”</p> <p>“It’s very much about aligning gaming and esports alongside entertainment and sports as key diversification pillars for the Saudi economy,” Ahmad added. “The deal also begs the question of what will come in the future regarding mergers and acquisitions for the global games industry, given the ongoing consolidation trend, and the ability for smaller companies to break through to walk among the giants.”</p> <p>While more layoffs may be a grim inevitability, the analysts <em>Kotaku</em> spoke with didn’t predict any seismic shifts in the immediate aftermath of the deal, set to close next summer. “I don’t expect any significant changes to the upcoming slate of games over the next couple of years,” Harding-Roll said. “The biggest opportunities remain growth of the <em>Battlefield</em> franchise, growth of the <em>EA Sports FC</em> franchise during the World Cup 2026 and bigger exposure to mobile gaming.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Monomi Park has returned to its slime-tastic origins, more than nine years after the Early Access launch of <em>Slime Rancher</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">with its much-anticipated follow-up, <em>Slime Rancher 2</em></a>. The game's developer first released <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-sales-hit-100k-in-under-6-hours" rel="nofollow">through Early Access in 2022</a>, and after three years, it bid farewell as it finally slime dunked its way onto consoles and PCs.</p>

<p><em>Slime Rancher 2</em> sets out to continue the epic adventures of rancher and protagonist, Beatrix "Bea" LeBeau, but this time around, in a brand new location, the Rainbow Island. This new location is filled to the brim with new slimes to care for, mysteries to uncover, and areas to explore as <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> aims to deliver a bigger, slime-filled adventure, something the developer has long sought to provide since the original game's release.</p>

<h2>A Brave New Slime-tastic World</h2>

<p>This much-anticipated sequel to the 2016 farming sim game from indie studio Monomi Park continues the story as our protagonist, Beatrix "Bea" LeBeau, heads off to Rainbow Island for a brand new adventure and more slimes to wrangle! While the journey that brought her to this new location is somewhat cloaked in mystery, equally intriguing are the secrets that Bea will uncover during her stay on Rainbow Island.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-611.jpg?itok=rnrMZMx7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-611.jpg?itok=Cg5xp_lh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Much of Slime Rancher 2's early game are spent here in the Conservatory which players can personalize to their hearts' content.&nbsp;(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned earlier, <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> spent three years in Early Access, allowing the developer to continue developing the game, listen to community feedback, and patch up much-needed fixes before shipping its 1.0 version to consoles and PCs. Now, ready in its final jiggly form, players can finally pick up the story of Bea as she sets off to unknown territory with a new adventure awaiting her on Rainbow Island!</p>

<p>Much of what many loved about <em>Slime Rancher</em> is present in its sequel, like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/slime-rancher-2-preview" rel="nofollow">gameplay loop of wrangling new squishing slimes</a>, farming Plorts, exchanging them for currency, and upgrading Bea's tech to explore the island further. By the way, there are a few new slimes, features, and plenty more for new and returning players to wrangle with when jumping into <em>Slime Rancher 2</em>.</p>

<h2>It's Plortin' Time!</h2>

<p>Let's be honest: one has never played <em>Slime Rancher</em>, and to one's shock and horror, it's really a good thing we got to experience this game through its sequel. In this open-world simulation sequel, Bea boards a mysterious boat that crosses the Slime Sea, escorting her to Rainbow Island, where not only will she encounter new and returning slimes and unique resources to collect, but also discover ancient technology that she can learn and use to navigate her new surroundings.</p>

<p>From the get-go, players are given the option to turn on or off a few gameplay settings to make their time and experiences on Rainbow Island smoother. The biggest gameplay option is regarding the Tarr and Feral Slimes spawning on the island, as these slimes are incredibly hostile and can be a nuisance to deal with when exploring, so for a more cozy gameplay experience, turning them off would be wise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-561.jpg?itok=hP0G99oI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-561.jpg?itok=_jCwiVJd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>I wonder what's behind this Cotton Gordo?&nbsp;(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Each new area on the Rainbow Island is mostly easy to access, with exceptions for the Powderfall Bluffs and the Grey Labyrinth, which have specific requirements needed to unlock. It's possible for players to unlock them quite easily; however, unlocking the Grey Labyrinth will require players to acquire a particular gadget from a friend and solve some puzzles before this area opens its doors to Bea.</p>

<p>Upon arriving on Rainbow Island, Bea will gain a new home, the Conservatory, the sequel's counterpart to the Ranch from the first game, which serves as the central hub, boasting various facilities to use to earn a living as a Rancher. While the game doesn't adequately explain how players can use these facilities, the Fabricator and the Refinery being such examples, it took until reaching Day 43 to figure out how to use them both.</p>

<p>The Refinery functions as a deposit for various resources like Plorts and other valuable items before they can be used for crafting gadgets via the Fabricator, the latter allowing Bea to craft using blueprints before she can equip and use them. Our picks for gadgets to prioritize first are the Resource Harvester, Jetpack, and the Tank Booster, which the harvester lets Bea acquire items from nodes found throughout the island, the Jetpack for easier traversal, and the Tank Booster to carry and store more resources in inventory slots.</p>

<p>Exploration in <em>Slime Rancher 2 </em>is your best friend, and understanding each area and its biome, and detailing what resources can be acquired, will go a long way. It's worth stating that for each day spent on Rainbow Island, collect as many resources as possible, especially if Bea can't place them in the Garden to grow, as Bea may need them to feed various Plorts, like the Cuberries for the Phosphor Slime.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-549.jpg?itok=9P9539-H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-549.jpg?itok=aLrYLnIF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pay attention to every slime's favorite food, like Phosphor Slime&nbsp;loves Cubberies.&nbsp;<em>(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Your gadgets are equally important, too, especially the Jetpack, which allows Bea to cover greater distances and find items that are harder to reach by jumping higher and gliding for a brief time. The Jetpack will be a great gadget for exploration, but a drive must be found first, and then its upgrade must be purchased before crafting it at the Fabricator with the required resources and spending Newbucks.</p>

<p>The game's UI design is simple, clean, and very legible, which is pleasing to the eye, especially since every game element, such as the inventory slots, in-game prompts, and the Health and Energy meters, is clearly identifiable. Additionally, all items held in the inventory slots are clearly and largely displayed, which is a significant UI improvement and indeed user-friendly.</p>

<h2>Slimed Out!</h2>

<p>With massive improvements and overhauls to the game's visuals and UI designs, a fun and cozy gameplay loop, and a new location to explore to one's content, some game aspects do hold the game back from being a great sequel. While not having played the original game and putting in the work and hours wrangling slimes and establishing the Ranch, the overall story is less compelling to follow along.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-598.jpg?itok=ZEFgGnm5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-598.jpg?itok=AvrEKZYl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Beatrix's friends from the first Slime rancher game will leave messages for her which are accessed via the&nbsp;Comm Station in the Conservatory.&nbsp;(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>It does heavily rely on various NPCs that Bea established connections with from the first game, and communication with these characters is limited to video call messages. Their messages don't contribute much to the ongoing story, but equally disappointing is that these characters' stories don't progress or expand in the sequel, and at times, their appearance can be nonsensical or overbearing, but we love the gifts they share with Bea.</p>

<p>Staying with familiar NPCs that Bea reconnects with in the sequel, the game doesn't introduce new characters for her to meet that could contribute something meaningful to her journey and exploration on Rainbow Island. This excludes the new Research Drones that provide Bea with new lore for the new location that Bea can find in most areas, excluding the Grey Labyrinth and the Slime Sea, but even so, it takes a while for the lore drops to be paid off.</p>

<p>While the game's story isn't heavily emphasized, the exploration is, as there's so much of the world that can be explored, and it doesn't need every gadget to advance to the next area. However, while unlocking these new areas is gated by Gordo Slimes that Bea must feed to unblock the passages, it's reaching the endgame areas that are restricted by specific requirements, and farming for these materials can be pretty time-consuming and frustrating.</p>

<p>This can take up much of players' time locating the resources required and crafting specific gadgets to progress, before finding the hidden gates to solve the door's puzzles. Grinding for these resources makes <em>Slime Rancher 2's</em> endgame feel tedious and less thrilling, especially for those wanting to reach the game's end and to see the big story/lore payoff, but for others who enjoy the exploration and ranching more, this won't be a major concern, as there's plenty of content to enjoy until reaching those final moments.</p>

<h2><em>Slime Rancher 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-630.jpg?itok=yJqBGH4w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-630.jpg?itok=3fq766fL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The game's developer made significant improvements to Slime Rancher 2 such as the game's visuals which makes exploring in the day and night incredibly vibrant.&nbsp;(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Developer Monomi Park had the blueprint to build <em>Slime Rancher's</em> sequel, leaving room to create new, innovative features and content that would expand on what they had first achieved with the original game. They didn't need to change much of the formula, like the gameplay loop, as many of the improvements saw massive overhauls to its visuals, as the environments feel more lush and vibrant, and the textures are exquisitely clean, especially with more biome varieties present in <em>Slime Rancher 2</em>.</p>

<p>All in all, what the developer set out to achieve with <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> should be widely praised for, as the vast changes to the game's visuals are absolutely stunning and vibrant, from the vistas to the wiggly slimes we encounter. The improvements to the UI are greatly appreciated, and the diversity of biomes and areas makes exploration extremely rewarding and exciting, as no two areas feel or look the same, even if the gameplay loop can be repetitive for players.</p>

<p>Where the game lacks is the opportunity to flesh out further or expand the story, leaving much to be desired. Sure, we have some of our returning companions to aid Bea during her adventures on Rainbow Island, but at times, they add or offer so little that it makes their presence feel more like fan service than one of substance, and their interactions something that can be avoided when there's so much of the world and gameplay content more worthwhile to explore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">So many models in so many different games.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently held a fan-voted tournament to determine the greatest racing game of all time. There were a total of 32 entries split across four categories: Arcade Racing, Simulation, Street Racing, and Wild Card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Mario Kart 8 Deluxe ultimately won the fan vote and was crowned champion, it isn’t exactly known for its realism. Several other entries in the tournament give you the chance to drive cars based on real-life counterparts, including a wide variety of different Toyota models.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Toyota brand has been around for almost 90 years and competes in several different racing series, meaning there are lots of different models that can be included in racing games. And some games make very good use of that. Here are five standout titles that were popular in our fan-voted tournament and also put you in the driver’s seat of Toyota cars.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza Horizon 5 has the rare distinction of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-review"><u>getting a 10 from IGN</u></a>, and it finished as the runner-up in our fan-voted tournament, so we think it’s safe to call this one of the best racing games ever made. One of its many strengths is the dizzying number of cars in its roster. It had more than 500 vehicles at launch, and DLCs and seasonal additions have brought that number to more than 900 in the nearly four years since it released. That includes 32 different models of Toyota, ranging from classic sports cars like the 1974 Celica GT to pickup trucks like the 2020 Tundra TRD Pro to rally cars like the 2021 GR Yaris to modern sports cars like the 2022 GR86.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Gran Turismo 7</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gran Turismo 7 won the Simulation region of our tournament and made it to the Final Four before being ousted by Forza Horizon 5. It was a very close battle between the two, so this is clearly a beloved title. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gran-turismo-7-review"><u>IGN gave it a 9</u></a>, so we’re big fans too. Like the game that defeated it, GT7 also sports an incredible number of different cars. It had 424 cars at launch and has since brought that number to more than 500, which includes 41 Toyota models. In addition to the kinds of sports cars, rally cars, and pickups that are present in Forza Horizon 5, there are also LMP1 cars like the TS030 Hybrid ’12 and TS050 Hybrid ’16, as well as concept cars like the FT-1 and FT-1 VGT.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Forza Motorsport 4</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza Motorsport 4 might be 14 years old, but it still holds up as an outstanding racing game and celebration of all things four-wheeled. It had a tough draw in our tournament, dominating its first-round matchup before having to go up against the juggernaut that is Gran Turismo 7 in the second round. IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/10/06/forza-motorsport-4-review"><u>gave Forza Motorsport 4 a 9.5</u></a>, and like the two games that preceded it on this list, its vast selection of cars was a big reason why. That included 19 different models of Toyotas, highlighted by the S class 2002 Top Secret 0-300 Supra, one of the most powerful Unicorn cars in the game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Project Gotham Racing 2</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Gotham Racing 2 might not have catapulted into mainstream popularity like the previous games on this list, but IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/18/project-gotham-racing-2-2"><u>gave it a 9.5</u></a> and it holds a special place in our hearts, largely because of its focus on style in addition to speed. You earn Kudos points for doing things like powersliding, catching air, driving clean races, and drafting behind opponents. And many goals require that you finish with a certain number of Kudos points, meaning you have to balance driving fast with driving pretty, providing a gameplay experience that separates it from other racing games. That sense of style extended to the cars themselves, too. There were three Toyota models in the game, and they’re all classics: the 1967 2000GT, MR2 Spider, and 1996 Supra.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In what some might have considered a surprise, Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix made it to the quarterfinals of our tournament and put up a solid fight against Forza Horizon 5. This is the updated version of Rockstar’s third game in the series, which added new vehicles, songs, races, maps, updated UI, and brought back Tokyo from Midnight Club 2. It was a marked improvement over said predecessor, and while it was never the fastest or prettiest game around, it more than made up for that with depth and variety. IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/14/midnight-club-3-dub-edition-remix">gave it an 8.8</a>, and it let you drive, customize, and fine-tune the 1998 Toyota Supra Turbo.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/5-standout-racing-games-that-let-you-get-behind-the-wheel-of-a-toyota]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Electronic Arts is going private in an acquisition that values the company at $55 billion, EA announced today, following an initial report from<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec?mod=hp_lead_pos2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> The Wall Street Journal</a> last week. The company will be purchased by a "<a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consortium</a>" of investors that includes Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. None of this is good.</p><p>The deal is the "largest leveraged buyout on record," according to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/ea-agrees-to-sale-in-largest-leveraged-buyout-on-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bloomberg</a>, and includes $20 billion in debt. In a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leveraged buyout</a>, the purchasers largely borrow money to fund the acquisition, and can use the purchased company’s assets as collateral. Basically, this means the buyers need the company they bought to make a hell of a lot of money to both pay down the debt and make the profit they’re in it for. They’re incentivized to cut costs to get there; leveraged buyouts have spelled the end of companies including <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/heres-what-sunk-toys-r-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toys R Us</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/party-city-fired-everyone-without-severance-right-before-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Party City</a>. Despite this grim portend, CEO Andrew Wilson will stay on, and wrote in a<a href="https://www.ea.com/news/exciting-news-about-our-future" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> message to EA employees</a> that "This is one of the largest and most significant investments ever made in the entertainment industry. Our new partners... believe in our people, our leadership, and the long-term vision we are now building together."</p><p>Let's look at those partners. The PIF already owned a nearly 10% stake in EA, alongside shares in other games companies like Nintendo and Take-Two.

The Kingdom's push into gaming is the <a href="https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pet project</a> of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is alleged to have ordered the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, which he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/us-judge-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-khashoggi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denies</a>.</p><p>Suffice it to say, I doubt any of these people are motivated to, in Wilson's words, "create experiences that are bold, expressive, and deeply connected to inspire generations of players around the world."<a href="https://kotaku.com/electronic-arts-acquisition-saudi-arabia-jared-kushner-2000629849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Fans of EA's games</a> are worried what this means for some of their favorite series, including those that feature queer characters, like <em>Mass Effect </em>and <em>Dragon Age</em>. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>saw a<a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-the-veilguard-electronic-arts-sales-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> troubled development cycle</a> and has had<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-says-dragon-age-underperformance-justifies-decision-to-prioritize-highest-potential-opportunities-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the finger pointed at its sales performance</a> for the<a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> several</a><a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> rounds</a> of layoffs EA has seen in 2025, among other causes. With $20 billion in debt to pay down, those layoffs are likely to continue; if there's one thing private equity loves, it's cost-cutting, and people--you know, the ones who <em>actually make the video games</em>--are<a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> usually the first on the chopping block</a>.</p><p>Whether or not the PIF or Kushner's firm will be interested in exerting fine-level control of game content, either globally or just in their own jurisdictions, there's no doubt this deal and its attendant debt will affect the kinds of games EA puts out. The company will certainly need to lean into sure-fire hits and broadly popular series, alongside whatever schemes it can drum up to squeeze as much money from players as possible. Niche favorites or one-and-done single-player games aren’t going to pay the kinds of bills EA now needs to pay. EA was already headed down this path: Following layoffs in late May, Wilson<a href="https://www.ea.com/news/continuing-to-evolve-our-business-and-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> said</a> that EA intends to "double down on our biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities." We've already seen that playing out this year, with the company<a href="https://aftermath.site/anthem-server-shutdown-trying-for-the-first-time-bioware-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> shuttering less popular games like <em>Anthem</em></a> and a<a href="https://gamerant.com/ea-games-shutting-down-2025-fifa-23-madden-22/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> variety of mobile and sports games</a>, while touting<a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-dice-battlefield-battle-royale-free-to-play-f2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> absurd expectations</a> for the <em>Battlefield</em> series. And, like every idiot these days, EA is<a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-ai-demo-imagination-creation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> exploring AI</a>, with Wilson saying in a<a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> May earnings call</a> that "We view AI as a powerful accelerator of creativity, innovation and player connection... Across our teams, we're investing in new workflows and capabilities to integrate AI to enhance how we build, scale and personalize experiences." So this deal certainly won't mean anything good for workers at EA and its studios. And it won’t mean anything good for players of the company’s games, whether that’s sports series that will need to make more money than ever or smaller games that might get deprioritized.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond this, continuing the trend of fewer and fewer powerful people and companies owning more and more things, both in the<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/13/microsoft-closes-activision-blizzard-deal-after-regulatory-review.html#:~:text=More%20than%2020%20months%20after,from%20a%20U.S.%20district%20judge." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> games industry</a> and beyond, is no good for anyone. As companies consolidate, their leaders’ choices and priorities ripple out into everything they own, letting them alter massive swathes of industries. In the case of this consortium, those choices are motivated by far more than just a desire to make a shit-ton of money–members have ties to, or literally <em>are</em>, some of the most powerful and conservative governments in the world. The PIF is a political project above all, with games being a means to an end. Kushner is obviously susceptible to the Trump administration’s meddling, as is Silver Lake, with its rumored TikTok deal deeply embedded in Trump’s priorities. As <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games swing back into the Right’s spotlight</a>, everyone involved will surely feel the pressure of the Trump administration on whatever happens next. Once the deal closes in 2027, a handful of people are going to come out richer than ever, and a majority of people are going to get fucked.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/palestinian-voice-in-games-coalition-helps-game-developers"><h3>New Coalition Seeks To Help Palestinian Game Developers ‘Speak Loudly’ Through Games</h3></a><p>Palestinian Voices in Games aims to ‘push against the dehumanisation of Palestinians’</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Goichi "Suda51" Suda is a developer who needs no introduction for those who have a deep appreciation for Japanese games. His development studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, has created some of the most memorable action games ever, such as the No More Heroes series.</p>



<p>Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-doomed-to-an-eternity-of-heavy-metal-jokes/">Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</a>, the Japanese studio is releasing Romeo is a Dead Man, an action game with a very distinct identity that instantly feels familiar to all those who played a game directed by Suda51.</p>



<p>Right after <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-gamescom-hands-on-preview-subspace-emissary/">trying out the game during Gamescom 2025</a>, I had the opportunity to sit down with Suda51 to discuss the main inspiration behind the game's wacky story, how swordplay and gunplay will be balanced, the game's level design, and more. You can find our chat below.</p>



<p><span><b><i>NOTE: The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity and brevity.</i></b></span></p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo is a Dead Man has been called an <em>“ultra‑violent science‑fiction action game.”</em> You are no stranger to gore, but what has inspired you to bring it to a sci-fi setting?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> When I want to make a new game, I always think: <em>"What can I do to make people get interested?"</em> For Romeo is a Dead Man, when I was thinking about the game's introduction and how to make it interesting, I thought of Back to the Future, and the relationship between Marty McFly and Doc Emmett Brown. The relationship between Romeo and his grandfather Benjamin mirrors their relationship, but with a twist.</p>



<p>I wondered, what would have happened if Marty had died at the start of <em>Back to the Future</em>? I imagined Doc would try to save him — by traveling into the future. That idea inspired the introduction for Romeo is a Dead Man. After this, I started thinking about how things would go on, and the whole game concept grew from this.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo Stargazer is a unique protagonist, an FBI agent tracking criminals across space-time. What made you choose an FBI agent as your main character? What does his background bring to the experience?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> In the world of Romeo is a Dead Man, criminals travel between different time periods and parts of the universe, ignoring the laws of space-time to commit all sorts of crimes. If there are space-time criminals and fugitives, there would be space-time police too. And what would these guys be?</p>



<p>Being a massive fan of TV series by Dick Wolf <em>(Law &amp; Order, FBI franchise)</em>, the FBI came to mind, but how could FBI agents become space-time agents? With this question in mind, I came up with the background setting. J. Edgar Hoover, the first head of the FBI, discovers that there are space-time fugitives. He then somehow travels to the past to create this space-time division within the FBI, traveling through space-time to bring these criminals in.</p>



<p>While this background setting isn't in the game, this is how I decided to make Romeo an FBI space-time agent. For the rest of the game, I tried imagining how would a show based on this premise be, and went on from there.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The concept behind Romeo is a Dead man grew out of a "what-if" scenario based on Back to the Future.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo being a dead man is the central hook of the story, but has his peculiar status influenced the experience beyond just the story?</p>



<p>A: Romeo's status as a dead man has influenced combat, for the most part. When he first gets killed at the start of the game and his grandfather Benjamin puts the helmet on him, Romeo is not only saved, but becomes a "hyperfied" human, elevating from being just another dead man to The Dead Man. This also allows him to use all the different weapons and skills he has in the game, much more efficiently than a regular human ever could.</p>



<p>Q: Speaking about weapons, playing the demo, I couldn't help but notice in this small slice of the game how short-range melee weapons seem to be favored over gunplay, which felt effective mostly against flying, hard-to-reach enemies. How is the full game balanced, in this regard? Will the player be able to use any weapon type and still succeed?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> That's a pretty sharp observation. In general, the player is free to use whatever weapon they want, so both melee and ranged weapons can get the job done, but depending on the enemy type, you may want to prefer one type over the other.</p>



<p>However, some bigger enemies and bosses require the player to use both. These enemies have weak points that are difficult to reach with a melee weapon, so the player has to use guns to hit them, and then close in with short range weapons once the opportunity arises. In many ways, the combat experience is built like a loop where you cycle between weapons, and build up resources to use skills.</p>



<p>Generally, Romeo is a Dead Man leans a bit more towards close-up melee fighting, but aside from specific cases, the player can use whatever they find more comfortable to use. It was a consciuous game design from the very beginning.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> From the demo, I noticed the stage felt pretty big, but it was still a closed-off stage. So is the entire game this linear?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> It's completely linear. Maps can get big, but there's no open-world progression whatsoever. We did try an open-world approach, but we got rid of that pretty early on in the development process.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>While it leans more towards close-range fighting, Romeo is a Dead Man allows players to use any weapon type to succeed.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Although the game does feel different, I couldn't help but notice a certain similarity to the No More Heroes. Besides the linearity of Romeo is A Dead Man versus the open-world approach of Travis Touchdown's adventures, what would you say is the most prominent feature that differentiates the games?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Besides the different progression, I'd say the setting is the biggest difference. In Romeo is a Dead Man, the keyword is space.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo is a Dead Man is powered by Unreal Engine 5 like a good number of modern games. Is there anything the engine allowed you to do that couldn't have been done before? Anything that the engine made easier to accomplish.</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> There are a lot of things for sure, but I really can't get into specifics. The technical team would be able to provide deeper information on this, but I'm sure there are a lot of things that the engine made it easier to do.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo is a Dead Man is your first IP in a very long time, and you are launching a brand new game in a market where most developers rely on established series. Why did you decide to do so? Do you feel launching a new IP nowadays is more challenging than in the past?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> The proliferation of sequels and remakes isn't just seen in games but also in movies. Personally, I think this marks the current age, but it won't be like this forever. As time goes on, things will go back to the way they were before, when developers were more interested in creating new games than sequels or remakes.</p>



<p>As a developer, me and Grasshopper, we like creating new original games and working on the series we have done in the past in equal measure. There's a chance we will develop a sequel to any of our series at some point. But we will also continue making new and original games as well.</p>



<p>I personally don't think too much about making a new game or a new entry in our series. I just want to make the kind of games we want to make, regardless if a specific time favors sequels and remakes or new games. This is something that tends to change over time, and doesn't influence what we do too much.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>



<p>With its blend of time-bending chaos, quirky humor, and looped combat that rewards both melee and ranged play, Romeo is a Dead Man promises to be a signature Suda51 experience - unpredictable, stylish, and unlike anything else in the action genre today. Players can expect plenty of surprises when it launches in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

              <p>Disney’s 20th Century has announced that a new movie based on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-simpsons-best-episodes-characters-top-to-watch-list-1850309544">long-running animated TV sitcom<em> The Simpsons</em></a> is in the works. The newly announced sequel will arrive in 2027, 20 years after the release of the first <em>Simpsons</em> flick.</p> <p>On September 29,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPMgc7Yj0PE/#"> Disney and 20th Century announced on social media</a> that a new <em>Simpsons</em> film was officially in development. No plot details were shared about the movie, but Disney did post a teaser poster for the upcoming sequel. The poster features Homer Simpson grabbing a pink doughnut covered in sprinkles shaped like the number 2, likely hinting that the movie will be titled <em>The Simpsons Movie 2</em>.&nbsp; The tagline “Homer’s combing back for seconds” is included on the poster. So, good news, Homer is back. Shocking, I know, but there you go.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Woohoo!

While many have criticized the show’s quality since the late ’90, the series has remained extremely popular on TV and is considered an anchor of Fox’s Sunday block of animated TV shows. The original <em>Simpsons</em> movie premiered in July 2007 and was a huge box office hit, earning over $536 million at the global box office. That movie featured a story about a giant dome being put over the town of Springfield due to pollution. It also brought back old former writers, took years to make, and featured a more detailed art style.</span></p> <p><span>We’ve heard rumors for years of a second <em>Simpsons</em> movie, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Man_Who_Came_to_Be_Dinner#:~:text=However%2C%20according%20to,a%20regular%20episode.">including a proposed follow-up featuring the franchise’s alien characters</a> Kang and </span><span>Kodos</span><span>. That movie didn’t move forward as the writing staff couldn’t stretch the plot out to a full-length movie. But now it seems the writers and producers behind the show have finally nailed the plot for the next flick. Now we just have to wait until 2027.</span></p>
