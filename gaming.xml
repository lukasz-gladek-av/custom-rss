            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/new-heights-climbing-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Around Aftermath’s launch, I wrote about climbing game <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-jusant-gets-rock-climbing-right" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jusant</em></a> and lamented that, as much as I liked it, it wasn’t quite my ideal climbing game. In the comments, a few of you recommended an early access game called <em>New Heights</em>, which I will admit I completely forgot about until my buddy <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/12/rock-climbing-changed-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Serrels</a> reminded me of the game on Twitter recently. I played it a bunch over the holiday weekend, and while it has some flaws and is still in development, it feels a lot like the climbing game of my dreams.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2179440/New_Heights_Realistic_Climbing_and_Bouldering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New Heights: Realistic Climbing and Bouldering</em></a> is, let’s face it, not a terribly sexy title, and it’s not a terribly sexy-looking game, with only one character model and a less-than-eye-catching visual style. There’s no storyline or mountaineering narrative; instead, the game is mostly its complicated mechanics, where you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_solo_climbing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free solo</a> routes of various difficulties by using your left and right mouse buttons to control each hand, mouse+shift to control each foot, and WASD, Q, and E to control your weight placement and body positioning. You climb real world locations that include rock faces and boulders, but also what I found to be a slight over-abundance of ruins and old buildings, though you might be more keen on those location choices than I am.&nbsp;</p><p>I put all this sort of negative stuff up front to explain why it might be an easy game to make assumptions about and skip, especially in the crowd of early access. But you totally shouldn’t miss it, especially if you're a climber.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="New Heights: Climbing &amp; Bouldering - Early Access Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_NuocVSVII?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Once you wrap your head around the controls, which you can practice in a tutorial area styled like a climbing gym, you’re set loose to do what honestly feels the most like actual climbing of any climbing game I’ve played. The quality of your holds and hand and foot placement is indicated by directional arrows that change color depending on your grip direction and body placement. Too much bad positioning, indicated by yellow or red arrows as opposed to green, will start to drain your stamina meter until you fall. To deal with all this, the techniques that worked for me are the ones that best work for me in real life: bringing my feet up high, shifting my weight around, keeping my body close to the wall. Unlike other climbing games where you just navigate between holds or perform dramatic mid-air moves<em>, New Heights</em> requires full awareness of your virtual body and a careful, systematic approach.</p><figure><figcaption>My left foot should probably lower in that crack, though (Aftermath)</figcaption></figure><p>It's fascinating to experiment with turning a bad hold into a good one (or vice versa) by moving my body around, and I found myself thinking and navigating much the way I would in real life–with the added bonus that the character is much stronger and seemingly taller than me, letting me climb things I can only dream of in real life. Long climbs feel like thoughtful, harrowing adventures the way my favorite roped routes do, with safer areas and sketchier areas, and the bouldering routes are surprisingly tough, the way bouldering often is. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__zh9KFt9aI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speed-based</a> leaderboards whose scores tempt me to think about how I can improve my climbs, and even a <a href="https://frictionlabs.com/blog/connors-world-dynoing-basics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dyno</a> mechanic that’s thrilling to execute in the middle of a route. Routes of different levels feel meaningfully harder from each other, and there are player-created <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2179440/workshop/?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">areas</a> and <a href="https://newheightsgame.com/blog/how-to-create-your-own-routes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">routes</a> as well.&nbsp;</p><p>There are places where the simulation falls short, as perhaps it must for something that must be <a href="https://newheightsgame.com/blog/how-we-created-our-climber-1-the-animated-approach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>so</em></a> <a href="https://newheightsgame.com/blog/how-we-created-our-climber-2-using-active-ragdolls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complicated</a> to make work. The physics bugged out on occasion, twisting my character into horrifying shapes or letting my limbs clip through the wall. I couldn’t do some things that feel instinctive for real life climbing–in one route, I wanted to do something with my foot on an <a href="https://hardclimbs.info/what-is-an-arete-in-climbing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arete</a> that the game couldn’t simulate, and it doesn't quite seem to know what to do with <a href="https://frictionlabs.com/blog/how-it-works-the-mantle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mantling</a> or moments where you end up on flat ground mid-route. Moves I would use in real life, like <a href="https://philarockgym.com/climbing-techniques-what-is-flagging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flagging</a> or <a href="https://frictionlabs.com/blog/connors-world-how-to-dropknee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drop knees</a>, felt more like screwing around to see if I could recreate them than vital techniques. One of the biggest challenges, as some Steam reviewers note, is that the <a href="https://newheightsgame.com/blog/nature-is-beautiful" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">textures</a> don’t always correspond to the quality of a hold: something will look like a ledge or grip only to not be, which means finding a good hold is sometimes less a matter of using your eyes and more wagging your mouse around until an arrow turns green.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Fun fact: I can do this in real life (Aftermath)</figcaption></figure><p>But a lack of certain realism in a game that touts realism isn’t a dealbreaker for me. As I wrote about <em>Jusant</em>,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When I imagine what I think a “true” climbing game would be, I inevitably conjure up some kind of inelegant, <em>QWOP</em>-esque nightmare that would force you to navigate foot and hand placement, limb tension, stamina, pathfinding, and your own emotions in a way that couldn’t possibly be fun, much less technically possible.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Developer Wikkl Works seems to recognize the challenging boundaries between what’s realistic, what’s technically possible, and what’s fun. In real life, I would have hooked my foot around that arete, but in a game, controlling ankle movement and simulating using the top of the foot instead of the bottom would be a nightmare for both player and programmer. <em>New Heights</em> picks the right things to get technical about–your contact points with the wall and your whole body’s position in relation to them–to make a game that simulates so much of the strategy and feel of climbing while still simplifying things enough to be approachable and, crucially, enjoyable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a sadly lapsed climber who’s struggling to get back into shape, <em>New Heights</em> gave me so much of the pleasure I get from real climbing. It manages to be realistic without being overly fiddly or complicated, and what it lacks in visual or narrative flair it makes up with through a clear love of climbing and the places where you do it. I’m excited to see how it keeps developing through early access and so glad I took a chance on it. If you’re a climber, I think you’ll have a blast with it; if you’re not, it might give you something like a taste of one of my favorite sports.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Set between the first and second trilogies of the series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ace-attorney-investigations-collection">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</a> follows fan favourite Miles Edgeworth as he investigates a string of increasingly wild cases. Combining the original game with it’s never before released in the West sequel, the colllection has Edgeworth joined by series mainstay Detective Dick Gumshoe and newcomer (and Great Thief) Kay Faraday, the trio find themselves quickly involved with wider overarching plots involving smuggling and corruption.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ace Attorney Investigations Collection - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLFMaakr_xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout you’ll run into a host of characters from the main series, which is a mixed bag to say the least. On one hand, some excellent characters that deserved more time to shine or develop get exactly that. On the other, some of the most irritating characters from the Ace Attorney canon get to return to bother you, and Edgeworth is just as disappointed to see them return as I was.</p>


<p>We do get to enjoy more of the buddy comedy double act that is Edgeworth and Gumshoe working together though. The chemistry between the two and Kay is absolutely incredible as well, while the primary antagonist (but not villain) Agent Lang is a superb character as well. So, I guess I can’t explain too much when there’s this much great character work on display.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between this spin-off duo and the main series is the lack of courtroom shenanigans. Far from being a problem, the lack of these parts helps the narrative flow far better, with everything lining up far smoother. The result is that the stories of these games are arguably the most coherent of the series, displaying the clever ‘whodunnit?’ style writing well and giving the twists greater payoffs than ever.</p>

<p>This contributes to the gameplay feeling smoother too, as instead of the harsh transitions between investigation and courtroom, the cases are segmented into smaller narrative chunks that flow into the next towards a natural conclusion each time. Largely though, the main components of the gameplay are investigating crime scenes and listening to testimonies from other characters – business as usual for Ace Attorney fans.</p>

<p>The investigation segments allow Edgeworth to wander around areas to examine them rather than the visual novel style of the main series. Certain spots allow you then to examine in greater detail, and even choose spots that conflict with your evidence to Deduce why contradictions might exist there. As a great little quality of life feature, the game tells you when you have fully investigated a spot. This shouldn’t feel like a big deal, but it absolutely is, believe me!</p>
<p>The main purposes of these investigations are to find evidence and clues for the cases. The evidence, as well as the deductions in investigations, is used in Rebuttals. These function the same as Cross Examinations from the main series, with the player presenting evidence to expose contradictions in the testimony of the character, complete with pressing statements for more information and presenting evidence with the trademark “Objection!”</p>
<p>The clues, however, are more like vague nuggets of information or questions posed by Edgeworth or other characters during the investigations. These are used in the new mechanic, Logic. This is by far my favourite addition in these games and allows Edgeworth to reach new reasoning by combining gathered information, which can result in new items of evidence or new directions of enquiry into the case.</p>

<p>The strength of the Logic system is that it’s easy to understand, and even easier to piece together, with only rare occasions in the whole collection where the link between the clues is unclear. That simplicity is what I enjoy about it. It encourages you to think about the information you currently hold without overly blocking your progress and keeps you moving towards the solution of each chapter’s mystery.</p>
<p>Another new mechanic for the second game is Mind Chess. This is a little more vague than Logic, and sees you playing a game with a witness or other person of interest to gain information. It takes place as a conversation with the character where you need to decide when to go on the attack or remain silent based on the behaviour of the opponent.</p>
<p>If the character is aggressive, you can bide your time in silence until they calm down and let slip information you need to proceed. Oh, and as added fun, you’re timed in these sequences and mistakes take a chunk out of your remaining time. This is the closest these games get to the obtuse nonsense of the main series, and can be frustrating, but once you get into the swing of it, it’s a great little back and forth challenge.</p>
<p>Both of these new mechanics are enjoyable though and really work to diversify the gameplay beyond what would otherwise simply be point and click. I wouldn’t say that they’re as interesting mechanically as say the Magatama or Mood Matrix from the main series, but they definitely add flavour to the investigations, and – of course – they also make sense with Edgeworth’s character at this point in the overall series timeline.</p>

<p>This two game collection has remastered visuals, with the option to use the original pixel art character sprites if you would prefer that, if with the inconvenience that you can only do this from the main menu. For the most part, I would recommend going with the enhanced visuals, as the core cast look great in this updated style. It only starts to fall apart with some of the side characters who have the odd animation or facial expression that just doesn’t look right but that doesn’t overly detract from the visuals.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is absolutely incredible from beginning to end, as you would expect from the Ace Attorney series, with those classic Ace Attorney sound effects thrown in as well to add that little bit of familiarity around these new settings. The song in this game for when you have a witness on the ropes during a Rebuttal especially is exquisite, especially in the remixed version used in the final showdown.</p>
<p>One final feature to praise is the Story Mode, which removes the puzzles and let’s you just enjoy the story of the two game. Also, as is standard for these collections now, all of the music tracks in the game, plus a load of concept art and all that fun behind the scenes stuff, is all available in the Gallery. More things get added to this as you go, with in-game achievements also to be found during gameplay that you can view from the main menu, though I’d advise against viewing those until you’ve finished the games to avoid spoilers.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ace Attorney Investigations Collection finally completes the Ace Attorney series of remasters, and does so with possibly the best two games in the series! The move from the courtroom to the crime scene creates a far smoother and more cohesive narrative experience that really allows the twisting mysteries to shine like never before. Coupled with some excellent quality of life improvements, a bevy of bonus content, and some enjoyable new mechanics, it would be a crime to not indulge in this collection.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-review-law-order.970779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-review-law-order<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has done solid work in getting all the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-review-few-objections">Ace Attorney</a> games out on modern platforms. No longer confined to a single handheld, they’re accessible to more people than ever before.</p>
<p>The latest release is the last in the collections to be made available - the aptly named <em>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</em>, which includes both <em>Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth </em>and its sequel <em>Ace Attorney Investigations: Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>. Both titles were originally out on the Nintendo DS, so it has been some time since their release. <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em> is especially notable because it’s releasing outside of Japan for the first time ever.</p>
<p>To that end, Capcom has seen fit to give these games a proper remaster treatment - redrawing the pixel-based sprites in HD, as well as the backgrounds for a modernized look with the game available on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Having missed out these games before, I was keen on how different they might play compared to the courtroom trials of the mainline series. It’s lucky then that the <em>Collection</em> lets you get right to it.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot01.jpg?itok=QUoLCZh1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot01.jpg?itok=ZIpDGqAC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Upon booting the menu, you have the option of choosing to start <em>Miles Edgeworth</em> or<em> Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>. As the latter is a sequel, it makes sense to start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Right away, the game lets you choose from the original pixel style sprites from the DS version, or the updated HD ones created by the original character designer. It’s a nice touch having that option for purists’ sake.</p>
<p><em>Miles Edgeworth</em> starts off with the titular main character involved indirectly in a murder scene that took place in his very office. While we know Miles didn’t do it, the scene is immediately put into investigation as series detective Gumshoe helps assist, and Miles himself digs deep into unmasking the culprit.</p>
<p>I suppose it shouldn’t be surprising, what with ‘Investigations’ in the title, but right away it’s one of the main things you’ll be tasked with despite Miles being a prosecutor. He’s found a new role for himself by solving crimes out in the field, and much of the story is focused on how he gets roped into these messes - often as a target, and even as a suspect in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting turnabout, with much more agency placed on the story, and the larger and murderous plots at play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot02.jpg?itok=AJJQPuV4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot02.jpg?itok=DfaZI8OK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As with the other Ace Attorney games, <em>Miles Edgeworth</em> is presented in a visual novel format with a lot of reading, some point and click interaction during the investigation sections, and selecting choices to advance the plot while interrogating suspects. There’s even some gimmicks like recreating the crime scene in a simulation, and is something that puts Miles in more of a direct role, along with other new characters.</p>
<p>My only complaint is there’s no voice acting despite the modern updates. It feels a bit outdated in that aspect, but it’s ultimately a trade off for getting these games at all.</p>
<p><em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>, being a direct sequel, is fairly similar in game design to its predecessor. The story continues once again with Miles Edgeworth of course, but this time he finds himself in the middle of a presidential assassination plot.<br>
Right away, Miles is tasked with understanding the aims of the shooter, their identity, and the evidence of the gunfire. As the investigation continues, Miles finds himself caught up in a setup that eventually leads to some unexpected arrests.</p>
<p>The story is arguably more complex than it was in <em>Miles Edgeworth</em>, with Miles himself put under risk of losing his own badge, and having to further work with rivals to uncover the truth. I largely appreciated his role here because it gave him a lot of depth and nuance. It made me want to see his success to the end.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot03.jpg?itok=iYRiZMBq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot03.jpg?itok=Q7xWpC1H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>, several new gameplay elements have been added to the series’ usual visual novel presentation. There’s the usual investigation segments, including talking to suspects and searching for clues, but the former adds a new mechanic called Mind Chess.</p>
<p>Mind Chess is a game that Miles sets up when a suspect doesn’t want to testify. He will question them as always, but these timed segments rely on making decisions that metaphorically destroy the suspect’s chess pieces. Listen to what they have to say, and select the best option to press the truth out of them.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting mechanic that adds a bit of tension, and more layers to help uncover contradictions in testimonies.</p>
<p>The <em>Investigations Collection</em> has been updated throughout with an eye pleasing style that cleans up everything in HD. I found the sprites were especially standout, with the dialogue portraits and investigation items having more of a hand drawn look to them compared to previous games.</p>

<p>It’s a solid transition from the DS graphics in any case. The music is still there, and again, you can use the old pixel sprites if you really want. Overall it’s a great remaster, and even better that it’s the vehicle we finally get to play <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em> in. With it finally here, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-review-few-objections">Ace Attorney collection</a> for the modern age is finally complete.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
The Ace Attorney Investigations is another great release from Capcom that brings Miles Edgeworth back in a starring role. Despite the lack of voice acting, the remaster captures the feeling of the series quite well. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

The annual event, in the German city of Cologne (or Köln to the locals), is the largest, most visited gaming exhibition in the world, dwarfing its nearest rivals, and has outlasted many alternative public and industry events. It adapted rapidly to covid, and became a successful online event when others wilted. And it somehow seamlessly combines a massive-scale industry event with an even more enormous public convention. So why is Gamescom so successful, where others struggle?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://abc7.com/e3-expo-canceled-electronic-entertainment-video-game-conventions/14174924/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://abc7.com/e3-expo-canceled-electronic-entertainment-video-game-conventions/14174924/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">E3 is officially dead</a></span>. It’s easy to blame covid, the cause of the Los Angeles event’s cancellation in 2020, 2021 and perhaps 2022, with the resulting demise and lack of online replacement leading to major publishers pulling out of 2023’s event until it was cancelled too. But really, its time had been up long before. For the majority of its life from 1995 to 2016, it was an industry-only event, and regularly pulled in 50,000 to 70,000 visitors (apart from during the bizarre decision to host it in an aircraft hangar in 2007 and 2008). Come 2017, as numbers and interest had begun to dwindle, E3 offered 15,000 public tickets at the same time as the number of exhibitors plummeted by a third. It was already looking very peaky before covid was even a factor.</p><p>Yet Gamescom, which delivers an industry event very similar to E3 (taking place in a monstrously large convention center that takes 15 minutes to walk end-to-end, with building-sized booths for major publishers decorated to match their games, and labyrinthine halls of business booths and meeting rooms), does this at the same time as offering a public exhibition that’s three times the size of PAX West. And add to this an opening night event featuring a wealth of massive-name exclusive reveals and trailers, hosted by the prince of gaming himself, Geoff Keighley. Which makes it all rather a big deal. And no diss to Germany, but it’s not exactly the first country that comes to mind when thinking about the games industry. So what makes Gamescom so persistently successful?</p><figure id="" data-id="a7b9020c0ece9b86ead19f4ce514c786" data-recommend-id="image://a7b9020c0ece9b86ead19f4ce514c786" data-format="jpg" data-width="1403" data-height="789" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Saint Geoff stares in wonder at Indiana Jones' release date." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Saint Geoff stares in wonder at Indiana Jones' release date." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a7b9020c0ece9b86ead19f4ce514c786" data-recommend-id="image://a7b9020c0ece9b86ead19f4ce514c786" data-format="jpg" data-width="1403" data-height="789" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Saint Geoff stares in wonder at Indiana Jones' release date." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Gamescom is a hybrid show,” says Tim Endres, the director of Gamescom, “that’s the USP.” He’s not talking about the combination of industry and public, but rather the overlap of in-person and online. And interestingly, this wasn’t something that began because of covid. In fact, the event had the jump on the virus by a full year, via the presence of the first instance of Opening Night Live in 2019. The flashy stage show that matches Keighley’s other annual ventures like Summer Games Fest and The Game Awards draws in an impressive live crowd (this year doubled to 5,000 people in the room), but a gargantuan online audience.<br></p><p>“This is the sixth year that we’ve been doing Opening Night Live,” said Geoff Keighley in a Zoom call the night before the event. Explaining why it has proved so successful, he stated, “Through the pandemic we were able to do a virtual show, and then come back live here at Gamescom. It’s really a global celebration.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-2024-record-number-of-exhibitors-internationality-and-global-reach&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-2024-record-number-of-exhibitors-internationality-and-global-reach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This year saw 40 million people tune in</a></span>—numbers any TV network would sell its soul to see—and it establishes the online presence of Gamescom in a massive way.

The Voldemort-like nature of the deceased event was an odd shadow during our chat, but I attempted to be more general when trying to understand why Gamescom survived the last few years. His answer: “Because we took place.” Endres primarily credits the incredible fortune of having gotten the show’s online nature established ahead of the global shutdowns in 2020 as a part of the reason for the event’s survival—they weren’t scrambling to try to invent some sort of last-minute digital version of their show, but rather building on an infrastructure that had already begun development. “We never cancelled, we never lost the contact to the community or the industry, so we were able to have a good pace for the restart after the pandemic.”</p><p>Boasting 1,400 exhibitors (E3 would hit 500 at its early peak) from 64 different countries, Endres says this makes the event the most truly international. It’s hard to deny this—I think back to U.S. events I’ve been to, where North American companies dominate the show floor,  international exhibitors scattered around them. In Cologne, there was still a massive American presence—especially in the form of Microsoft and Xbox—but unsurprisingly the European numbers were far higher. Fifty percent of trade visitors came in from outside the country. “That means the world’s here at Gamescom,” said Endres. It’s also true of public visitors, with 10 percent coming from outside the country, meaning over 30,000 people travelling to Germany for the event.</p><p>Microsoft’s enormous amount of floor space was striking, and made me wonder whether Sony and Nintendo might be getting left behind. “Of course we’d love to see them too at Gamescom,” said Endres. “We’re in constant [contact] with them, and if they don’t come one year, it does not mean it’s a decision for the future.”</p><p>But Gamescom is also spreading outward. In 2021, Gamescom Asia was established, an annual event in Singapore, and 2023 saw the first Gamescom Latam, hosted in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Interestingly, despite the existence of those regional events, those countries are also present at Gamescom in Germany, which perhaps makes sense given the different nature of the shows. Gamescom Asia, for instance, is predominantly a show about mobile gaming—a platform that doesn’t have a large footprint at the European show (with the odd exception of <em>Dark and Darker</em>). It also sees the other big players getting involved, with Nintendo having sent games to Latam, and PlayStation showing up for Asia.</p><figure id="" data-id="e8bcbb287b86c076e731e76f5d2a604e" data-recommend-id="image://e8bcbb287b86c076e731e76f5d2a604e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pokemon had a presence for the first time this year." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pokemon had a presence for the first time this year." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Gamescom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8bcbb287b86c076e731e76f5d2a604e" data-recommend-id="image://e8bcbb287b86c076e731e76f5d2a604e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pokemon had a presence for the first time this year." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Which all sets up a rather big, obvious question, doesn’t it? Gamescom is massively successful, has gained international recognition as the biggest gaming event in the world, and has survived where that other big name in industry trade shows has failed. That would leave one rather obvious region that Gamescom isn’t reaching, one that has a large void where an event used to be, loosely replaced by a digital-only event that happens to be hosted by Geoff Keighley…</p><p>“You <em>must</em> be looking at the United States,” I say. On my audio of the interview there’s then a long silence, before laughter in the room from a couple of onlookers. I then say, “For my recording, there was a slight shrug.” Endres laughs, called out on his presumably accidental body language, and then stammers toward the company line. “What we see at Gamescom is this massive increase in internationality here in Cologne, and it’s going to be the core event in Cologne, and we have a worldwide reach starting from Cologne, and then with our satellites we have a different reach. And Sao Paulo is not far from the U.S… But right now we’re focusing on making Gamescom Cologne bigger, and Latam and Asia bigger, and then we’ll see what the future brings.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The latest big PlayStation game, the multiplayer shooter Concord from developer Firewalk Studios, was a misfire upon release earlier this month and might have sold only 25,000 copies.</p><p>GameDiscover.co analyst Simon Carless told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Concord likely sold 10,000 units on Steam and 15,000 on PlayStation as of the end of August. Concord struggling to sell would not be a surprise, as the game <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">peaked at 697 concurrent players on Steam</a> and is <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/d0446d4b-dc9a-4f1e-86ec-651f099c9b29/6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently outside the top 100 best-selling games on PlayStation.</a></p><p>Circana analyst Mat Piscatella told IGN that fewer than 0.2% of PS5 active players were logged into the game on Monday, August 26. Liam Deane, an analyst at Omdia, told the website, "The Steam numbers are so bad that even without the exact data on the PS5 side we can be pretty certain that the game is doing very badly."</p><p>The analysts that IGN spoke with said Concord failed to move units and drive engagement due to a variety of reasons, including a lackluster marketing campaign, a relatively high price point ($40 USD), and a lack of stand-out features in a market already filled with similar types of games.</p><p>Midia Research analyst Rhys Elliott said Concord should have launched as a free-to-play game, or as part of the PlayStation Plus subscription catalog like Quidditch Champions is doing for its own launch today, September 3. Elliott pointed out that it's not too late, as Sony could add Concord to PlayStation Plus, but admitted, "The damage might have already been done. First impressions matter."</p><p>Concord is Firewalk's first game. It was in development for more than eight years, <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1826122649963245882" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to lead designer Joe Weisnewski</a>. "Concord has so much humanity and depth to it. I really hope people give it a shot. Insanely proud of the game and we’re strapped in and ready to push it for years to come," the developer said.</p><p>Sony was at one point planning to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-surpass-17-million-10-live-service-games-coming-by-2026/1100-6500204/" data-ref-id="1100-6500204">10 live-service games by 2026</a> but later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">cut the figure in half as the company outlined a plan to focus on quality over quantity.</a> Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Online, once described as the developer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-is-naughty-dogs-most-ambitious-title-ever-druckmann-says/1100-6510559/" data-ref-id="1100-6510559">most ambitious game ever</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">was canceled</a>.</p><p>According to a report, one of the last major decisions that former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan made was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/" data-ref-id="1100-6518727">mandate for PlayStation's teams to make more games-as-a-service titles</a>. A number of PlayStation developers were said to be upset by this, and the blame apparently fell on industry veteran Connie Booth. A 30-year veteran, Booth left PlayStation in October 2023, and no reason for her departure was ever provided. Some believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/" data-ref-id="1100-6518727">she was fired.</a> Booth is now an executive at Electronic Arts.</p><p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-concord-early-and-what-time-it-unlocks/1100-6525754/" data-ref-id="1100-6525754">Concord Season 1: The Tempest</a>, launches in October--it adds a new character, new map, new variants, and additional cosmetics and rewards. It also introduces a new season of weekly cinematic vignettes that will further flesh out the narrative. Season 2 is scheduled for January, with Season 3 expected in April.</p>

The freemium title surpassed 13 million downloads when it was still in open beta and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamdb.info/app/677620/charts/">delivered an all-time peak of around 68,000 concurrent players on Steam</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> roughly three years ago.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As interest in the project surged, developer 1047 Games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/1047-games-nets-100-million-to-expand-and-support-sci-fi-shooter-i-splitgate-i-">secured over $100 million in funding</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> via an investment that valued the studio at $1.5 billion. The company openly admitted that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "achieved a level of success that we could not have anticipated and that few indie games are fortunate to reach."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That acknowledgement, however, was bundled into a statement that confirmed the studio would </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-splitgate-i-receives-its-final-update-as-developer-1047-games-moves-to-its-next-project">no longer be supporting the shooter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Why? It&nbsp; had simply become too successful, too quickly. "We are, in a way, bailing water while also trying to keep everyone who bought a ticket to board our ship happy, while also trying to turn our boat into a rocket ship," added the company, back in 2022.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time, 1047 Games said it was saying "see you soon" to the title rather than "farewell." Now, the company has returned with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a full-blooded sequel that features a new faction system, four versus four gameplay, and (quite naturally) loads of bloody portals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer about how 1047 Games will ensure the sequel can go the distance, studio founder, CEO, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">creative director Ian Proulx says the company is now fully aware that "content is king."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="1047 Games boss hopes ">1047 Games boss hopes <span>Splitgate 2</span> will still be thriving in a decade</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I want [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">] to be a game that people are playing in 10 years from now, on a much larger scale of course," says Proulx. "I think we had 200,000 concurrent players in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at our peak. Success to me would be more than that—and more than that in years from now."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Proulx feels there wasn't a lot the studio could have done to sustain the original title because it ran out of runway. "We didn't have the resources [to support </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">]. We didn't have the tech," he says. "Our thought was 'we're going to have a bump in players. We're going to have have slow and steady growth over time.'</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Even if we knew [that wasn't going to be the case], there wasn't a whole lot we could have done about it. We were a very tiny team [of under 20 people]. So we were just fighting to keep the lights on with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To avoid a repeat, Proulx has been "obsessing" over what goes into delivering a "world class" live ops experience. The key, he feels, is making sure 1047 Games is ahead of the curve when launch day arrives. "[We have to be] ready technically, in terms of the servers. But also we need to be ready from a content perspective and make sure we have plenty of stuff to come," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We ask Proulx about his admission that developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was akin to bailing water out of a sinking ship. Elaborating, he explains 1047 Games struggled to convince </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players to stick around for more than a month—piling more pressure on a team that was already gasping for breath. The interest was there, but players didn't have a reason to properly engage with the shooter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Content is king," says Proulx. "That's one thing I learned for sure: players always want more. I'll put it this way: in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we saw players come in and play for around three to four weeks—and they'd have an amazing time and leave a good review—but after [that period] most players would run out of things to do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It took us around seven months to deliver a new season that had content. The way I'm looking at it this time is, step one, I need to make sure that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has enough content. Instead of three to four weeks being a typical play pattern, I need to extend that. Hopefully, to six, eight, twelve, twenty, thirty weeks. Whatever it is—I need that to be longer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's to give the team more time [to develop new content]. Then, by the time that number hits—because inevitably, it doesn't matter if you have the best game on the planet—by the time that happens we need to have delivered a major content update."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Proulx explains the development team is putting a lot of "care" into how it defines small updates, medium updates, and large updates. He says those varying additions will provide a sense of momentum and notes a small update might be a "featured game" while a medium update could be a "new map." He envisions larger updates as full-blown seasons, but reiterates the team is still figuring out the details.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oua2iTVFbJI?si=anIOMUAFTQgN9t6U" height="150px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On a technical level, Proulx is adamant </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> must be infinitely more scalable than its forebear, and says 1047 Games now has the personnel to make that happen. "Once we did get the funding [for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">], it forced us to think 'wow, there's a lot we could do if we could do it all over again,'" he says, comparing the original to a "school project" that was pushed beyond its limitations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[We thought] wouldn't it be nice to redo these things? Wouldn't it be nice to redo the code and make it more scalable. And when I say scalable—I mean scalable both in terms of handling more players but also in having more people work on it. Our code base in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was fine for 20 people to work on, but with 175 people it was very easy to step on each other's toes. So, we restructured a lot of the code so that if somebody's working on a gun, for example, they don't break a character.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We thought about the [prospect of a redo] very early on, but ultimately said 'that's not a good idea because we're still learning a ton. We've got a big playerbase. People love this thing. We've got to keep doing this.' I'm a big believer in 'you've got to be a student of the game,' but just over year [later] we made the decision that it was time to move on. At that point, we felt like we'd made everything we needed to learn to make the game of our dreams."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Proulx expects to remain a student following the launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2025, but explains 1047 now has the ability and foresight to adapt more effectively. "We have a plan—and by the way, the plan is totally bogus and is absolutely going to change. But at least we have an approximate plan that is good on paper. We have the resources to build towards [that], but we've structured it in a way so there's not a lot of red tape," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We know the second we launch we're going to learn a bunch and that plan is going out the window. That's part of the [learning curve]. Another part is having content in your back pocket, so if there are fires of any kind we'll be ahead of schedule instead of always playing catch up. We also have redundancy on the team itself, so if somebody gets hit by a bus we've got a number two in place."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Outsourcing partners are part of the plan for ">Outsourcing partners are part of the plan for <span>Splitgate 2</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">1047 Games has already enlisted the help of outsourcing partners, who aren't doing much yet but can provide assistance if (or perhaps when) things kick into overdrive. Proulx says those structures have been put in place because he's an out-and-out optimist that feels you need to plan for success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[I ask] 'what will happen in the best case scenario?'" he says. "I'm very confident in the game. We're giving [our outsourcing partners] a little bit of everything [across art, animation, and audio] so that if and when this game takes off, we've already got the contract. We've got the relationship, and now we just crank it out."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Proulx's sense of optimism extends to the wider game industry. When asked how developers can thrive in an environment that seems ready to crush all but the biggest success stories, he suggests adversity is an opportunity for growth. "I think we're a couple of years away from coming out of this [situation]," he says. "There's definitely a hole that has been dug and an overcorrection, [but] I'm still an optimist. I think you're going to see a lot of very cool games being announced.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think we're going to see more hits. The best companies are going to come out of the dark times, because they're the ones who face adversity and keep going, just like we have. Those are going to be the ones who learn the most—to find a way to win when it's difficult. If they get through this, when things bounce back they're going to do an amazing job."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/graft-new-cyberpunk-rpg-harebrained-schemes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shadowrun Returns&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>BattleTech&nbsp;</em>developer Harebrained Schemes has announced its latest project, a grim cyberpunk RPG by the name of&nbsp;<em>Graft&nbsp;</em>that's currently in development for PC.</p>
<p>Harebrained was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-interactive-acquires-harebrained-schemes-after-battletech-team-up">purchased</a> by its former parent company Paradox Interactive back in 2018, but following weak sales of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lamplighters-league-announced-by-battletech-developer-paradox">2023 tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>The Lamplighters League</em></a>, Paradox and Harebrained <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-harebrained-schemes-are-parting-ways-following-weak-sales-of-latest-game">parted ways</a> earlier this year, allowing Harebrained to pursue its own indie agenda.</p>
<p>Now, the studio is back with&nbsp;<em>Graft</em>, a game that "splices together tense survival horror with a dark RPG experience", according to the description on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141390/GRAFT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Steam page</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/harebrained-schemes-graft-rpg.jpg?itok=ey_S19I7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/harebrained-schemes-graft-rpg.jpg?itok=YmrAKVy1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Graft&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>Shadowrun Returns&nbsp;</em>developer Harebrained Schemes' newest RPG.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Graft&nbsp;</em>will take place aboard the Arc, a "continent-sized station filled with biomechanically enhanced citizens". Since this is a cyberpunk RPG, you probably know how that's going to go.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the superstructure slowly begins to succumb to some kind of unknown decay, and so you must escape the Arc, navigating its winding pathways and labyrinthine corridors in order to scavenge resources and search for a way out.</p>
<p>According to Harebrained,&nbsp;<em>Graft&nbsp;</em>will offer "a visceral new twist on classic survival horror combat". From the brief gameplay teaser included on the Steam page, it doesn't look like the game will have turn-based battling.</p>
<p>It will, however, allow you to augment your body with the titular Grafts, which are essentially parts you can scavenge from your foes or find scattered across the Arc. Each Graft "carries with it some small piece of its previous owner", Harebrained says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/graft-harebrained-schemes-arc.jpg?itok=Ggu_6XEf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/graft-harebrained-schemes-arc.jpg?itok=MDIko4Jv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll explore a megastructure known as the Arc in&nbsp;<em>Graft</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Grafts will flood your system with "strange cravings and half-glimpsed memories", and you'll need to work out "what each of these fragments means to you". The Steam page rather heavily leans on the Ship of Theseus metaphor, wherein a ship's parts are gradually replaced until nothing of the original ship arguably remains.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Graft&nbsp;</em>yet, and we also don't know if it's coming to consoles or not. Stay tuned for more on this one as and when we get it.</p>

Now we have a more extensive rundown of what Mario and Luigi will be up to this time around. </p><p>A new page of info on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/a4000ce6-792e-49cb-8a9e-75497a691f4f&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/a4000ce6-792e-49cb-8a9e-75497a691f4f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo’s Japanese website</a></span> mentions the following: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Game takes place in a new world called Conectal Land that Mario and Luigi explore on a ship-like island after getting sucked into a mysterious vortex </li><li>﻿This region’s “drifting islands” includes various themed locals like Gran Gran Island (rocky), Tuis Island (tourist resort), Savireta Island (ancient), Xenialver Island (urban), and Kandang Island (fire and ice)</li><li>Mario and Luigi can group their normal abilities into more powerful “combination attacks” that require more sophisticated timing to maximize their effectiveness</li><li>They also have new “Brother Attacks” that cost brother points and unleash massive damage in exchange for inputting special timed button presses. </li><li>The main antagonists are a group of three called the “Boldrud Squad” that conspire in the shadows of Conectal Land to mess things up for Mario and his friends. </li></ul></blockquote><p>A trailer for one of the Brother Attacks in question shows Mario and Luigi jacking up a storm cloud for a powerful lightning attack. Rapidly alternating button presses fills up a gauge resulting in a rating of excellent and an attack that clears the battlefield.

            <p>Microsoft is kicking off the cooler months with its next batch of Xbox Game Pass titles.</p>
<p>Day one additions within September's first wave of games include Star Trucker, which is available today, as well as Age of Mythology: Retold and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/train-sim-world">Train Sim World</a> 5.</p>
<p>Here is the full list of titles heading to Game Pass in the coming weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3rd September:</strong> Star Trucker (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>4th September:</strong> Age of Mythology: Retold (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S)</li>
<li><strong>5th September:</strong> Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>

<p>So, what of those games? Well, our Matt was rather taken with Star Trucker when he gave the demo a whirl on Steam earlier this year.</p>
<p>"Star Trucker's demo is a treat, and there's suggestion of some real depth here - surprisingly so, when it could easily have positioned itself as a fun, throwaway gimmick and moved on," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-trucker-who-needs-a-mountain-vista-when-youve-got-the-whole-of-space">Star Trucker feature from February</a>. </p>
<p>
"It's promising stuff - slick, wonderfully atmospheric, and perfectly pitched somewhere between a sly wink and a straight face - and I can't wait to properly truck off when the full game shows up later this year. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> might have mountains, but who needs mountains when you've got the whole of space out your window?"</p>
<p>As for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a>, we called it a "lumpy and loveable extreme sports playground" on its initial release. "There are bumps and bruises along the way, but the exuberance and energy on offer here make Riders Republic a worthwhile adventure," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riders-republic-review-lumpy-and-loveable-extreme-sports-playground">Eurogamer's Riders Republic review from 2021</a>.</p> <div>

<p>As is the case with every month, the arrival of these new games means that others will be leaving Game Pass. The following games will leave the service on 15th September:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ashes of Singularity: Escalation (PC)</li>
<li>FIFA 23 (Cloud, Console, and PC) EA Play</li>
<li>Payday 3 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Slime Rancher 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>SpiderHeck (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>You Suck At Parking (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-remaster-censored-japan<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>remaster has been censored on consoles by the Japanese ratings board, co-creators Suda51 and Shinji Mikami have confirmed.</p>
<p>In an interview with Japanese platform <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2024/08/31/144656.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameSpark</a> (with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-has-been-censored-on-consoles-in-japan-suda51-confirms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">additional reporting by VGC</a>), Suda51, real name Goichi Suda, said that the development team at Grasshopper Manufacture had to "prepare two versions of the game" in order to appease Japanese ratings board CERO.</p>
<p>Suda says that this process "had a tremendous impact on [the team's] workload" and that it "extended the development period", although he doesn't say exactly which elements of&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>were censored.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-censored-demon.jpg?itok=0MhzHaQ6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-censored-demon.jpg?itok=hzeglMhJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>will be censored in Japan.</figcaption></figure><p>A quick look at the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/30865/shadows-of-the-damned/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ESRB rating</a>&nbsp;reminds us that the game is full of gore, violence, and sexual imagery, as well as copious amounts of swearing, so it's probably one of these elements to which CERO took umbrage.</p>
<p>Speaking in the same interview as Suda, co-creator Shinji Mikami describes CERO as a board that "[doesn't] play games", but that tries to "prevent [players'] enjoyment by restricting...works with regulations".</p>
<p>Suda says it would make him "sad" if many players gravitated exclusively towards the Steam version because they wanted to play it without restrictions, "considering it's available on a variety of platforms". As a reminder, only the console versions have had to undergo censorship in Japan.</p>
<p>He goes on to say that he wonders "who the restrictions are aimed at", speculating that they're not "aimed at the customers who play the game".</p>

<p><em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, a remastered version of 2011's horror-themed action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>.</p>
<p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-remaster-announced-by-grasshopper-manufacture-grasshopper-direct">in June last year</a>, the game is a remaster of a project that features something of an all-star lineup; not only was&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>co-created by industry legends Shinji Mikami and Suda51, but it also features music from&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>composer Akira Yamaoka.</p>
<p>Although we can't be sure yet, it's unlikely that the censorship of&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>in Japan will affect the state of the game in the West.</p>
<p>The game is currently set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2535440/Shadows_of_the_Damned_Hella_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10008909" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered/9ng837368mt7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on October 31st (which feels very appropriate indeed). Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

Each piece will require you to be level 50 to equip, but if you’re able to accept and complete the mission, you’re already there.</p><p>After “The Ultimate Weapon” is turned in, three new shop NPCs named “Sundry Splendors” will be added to each of the starting cities, Limsa Lominsa, Gridania and Ul’dah. They will sell you a piece of Augmented Ironworks gear of your choosing in exchange for Tomestones of Poetics. It doesn’t matter which one you talk to, as their inventory and pricing is the same across all locations. It’s also worth mentioning that previously these vendors sold Ironworks Gear, and then an item called a “Carbontwine” was used to turn them into Augmented Armor Pieces—however after a game update, they now sell the latter directly and no Carbontwine is needed.</p><p>There are two primary methods to obtaining Tomestones of Poetics. One of the fastest is by completing the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-daily-roulettes-guide-1851625306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-daily-roulettes-guide-1851625306">Main Scenario Duty Roulette</a></span> once a day. Upon completion, this will reward you with 350 Tomestones. While this is a lot of the currency, these roulettes can be fairly tedious, as it only offers one of three quests, all rather lengthy with multiple boss fights and unskippable cutscenes. Luckily, you have another option to grind these out, as you can complete a High-Level Duty Roulette.</p><p>This will enter you into a random Level 50 or higher dungeon that you have unlocked. The great thing about this option is not only do you have a wider variety of content to play through, but you also get 100 Tomestones after the Duty is completed, as well as the normal Tomestone payout for completing the dungeon and certain bosses inside. To maximize efficiency, you can do both daily, but if you are tired of the Main Scenario Roulettes, just stick with the High-Level Ones.</p><h2 id="h604484"><a id=""></a><strong>Is It Worth Buying</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="e1b5d19d2d4da69931923248e1e41aa6" data-recommend-id="image://e1b5d19d2d4da69931923248e1e41aa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The shop screen for Sundry Splendors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The shop screen for Sundry Splendors." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e1b5d19d2d4da69931923248e1e41aa6" data-recommend-id="image://e1b5d19d2d4da69931923248e1e41aa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The shop screen for Sundry Splendors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the point in <em>FFXIV </em>where you are able to purchase the Augmented Ironworks Armor, your current setup is most likely the one gained from completing your Job Questline (assuming you were up-to-date on it). The Augmented Ironworks Set is significantly better than these, but you also have to spend a lot more time obtaining the currency. Given the somewhat quick rate you have been upgrading your gear, it may seem like a waste of time to spend hours grinding out Main Scenario Roulettes and High Level dungeons to obtain enough poetics to purchase the entire set, made longer by the sheer number of components each contains. However, there is some benefit to taking the time to obtain what is currently the best armor available.</p><p>“The Ultimate Weapon” was the original ending of <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, after <em>Final Fantasy XIV’s </em>relaunch. Between its release and the first expansion, <em>Heavensward,</em> Square Enix added roughly 80 quests in a series of patches. Given the level cap of the game at this time was 50, you really won’t otherwise obtain useful gear until you start accepting quests above this level, which won’t happen until well into <em>Heavensward</em>. Since the patch quests can take up to 20 hours to complete, and the midpoint of Heavensward is close to an additional 20 hours, the Augmented Ironworks Armor will be useful for roughly 40 hours of content, and that’s just with a single class.</p><figure id="" data-id="c5979d6ce50164526fc3bd5835fcc80a" data-recommend-id="image://c5979d6ce50164526fc3bd5835fcc80a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some tank armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some tank armor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5979d6ce50164526fc3bd5835fcc80a" data-recommend-id="image://c5979d6ce50164526fc3bd5835fcc80a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some tank armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As an additional benefit, many different jobs share identical Ironworks Sets. For example, the tank classes—Paladin, Warrior and Dark Knight—all use the “Fending” Ironworks sets. So, if you’re maining a Paladin and then decide to level up your Warrior, the equipment can be re-used for that job. The one caveat is that the secondary (or tertiary) job must be level 50, but it is still a good way to get extra mileage out of the rather expensive sets of armor.</p><p>The Augmented Ironworks set is one of the best armors in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> when it becomes available, and given the long stretch until you are able to receive better gear, as well its utility among multiple different jobs, spending the time to grind it out is well worth it. However, none of the main scenario quests are so difficult that an insanely powerful set of gear is needed, so if you would rather spend your-in game time on other tasks, you aren’t missing out. Honestly though, they also look pretty badass.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The harshest words came in Discord posts following the reveal, with Jyamma CEO Jacky Greco saying "obviously they don't care about Enotria and they don't care about you."</p><p>Greco said Jyamma has Xbox Series X and S versions of the game ready to go but hasn't received support to actually release them on the platforms for two months. IGN has asked Microsoft for comment.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Obviously they don't care about Enotria and they don't care about you.</p></div><p> "Despite our best efforts and the hard work of our dedicated team, we’ve encountered challenges that have delayed our release on the Xbox platform," Jyamma said in the delay announcement.</p><p>"We apologize for any disappointment this may cause and sincerely thank you for your understanding and patience.

I spent a lot of money for porting and they decided to ignore us."</p><p>Development on Enotria seems to have otherwise gone relatively smoothly, though a short delay did push it from August 21 to the September 19 release date.

			<p>Freedom of choice in narrative horror games has always been a tough genre to get right. Until Dawn and The Quarry are probably the best examples of this, where your choices really matter and a poor choice or a missed button press can completely change who’s going to make it through to the end. Imagine my excitement when Supermassive Games and Behaviour got together to collaborate on The Casting of Frank Stone, set in the Dead by Daylight universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Casting of Frank Stone | Features Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qP8o0YjIxm0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Its story spans three separate time periods, telling the tale of the evil Frank Stone and the movie made by a bunch of plucky teenagers in the very Mill where the murders took place.</p>


<p>My first concern was whether it would only appeal to fans of Dead by Daylight and not to a wider audience. Thankfully, the story does well to stand on its own and mostly explain everything that’s going on, establishing some origins and adding to the Dead by Daylight universe. Of course, as a fan of Dead by Daylight, it was great to see an abundance of Easter Eggs and references thrown in the mix, including the ending, which put a big smile on my face.</p>
<p>If you’ve never played Dead by Daylight before, then certain elements might be lost on you, but don’t necessarily detract from enjoying the experience. Quick time events have been replaced with the signature DBD skill check, and there are even some sections where you have to repair generators.</p>


<p>Whether or not the story is as strong as the previous Supermassive games will of course be subjective, but I can say it’s intricate enough to provide a lot of replay value should you strive to discover all the different branching paths, save all the characters and collect anything you might have missed.</p>
<p>One absolute godsend of a feature for this is the Cutting Room Floor. Once you’ve finished the game, you have the option to see the whole timeline and all the potential branching paths you can take, with everything you have discovered available to view. It really shows off how much there is to see and do, and completionists are going to have a field day trying to do everything. One of the best parts about this, is you can play the game from most of the previously discovered points without the need for a chapter select, so if you missed something or wanted to make a different choice from a certain section, fill your boots. It’s not a unique feature for this game, but it’s a really great way to manage everything.</p>

<p>Compared to the larger rosters of Until Dawn and The Quarry, The Casting of Frank Stone has more in common with The Dark Pictures Anthology series, having a slightly lower number of characters to manage through the games trials and tribulations. I personally wish there were more characters, as I find the Supermassive games at their best when there’s more to manage, but it’s not a deal breaker. The intimate number of characters will likely appeal to more people just looking for a fun time with a horror experience, so I can’t slight Supermassive for that.</p>
<p>I do appreciate that there’s not a huge reliance on collectables, and what there is in the game feels meaningful. It’s nice that you don’t have to spend a majority of your time searching every dark corner for memorabilia, but you can find cute dolls for all the original killers from Dead by Daylight, and some discovered items will give you bonus dialogue choices, as a neat way of rewarding those that do scrounge around.</p>

<p>The moment to moment gameplay is what we’ve come to expect from Supermassive games. Moving around is fine and there’s a run mechanic to get from A to B a little quicker, but I found the running felt a little janky from time to time, with a slight knock into a wall interrupting the animation and it then taking a second to get going again. Also, characters would follow and sometimes get in the way, preventing me from moving, which could be a little frustrating, even if it was solved with a little wiggling and pushing.</p>
<p>Other minor technical issues involved infrequent, but noticeable, graphical pop in and lip syncing issues on PS5. The worst was when my character’s head and body twisted all the way round and I could only get it back to normal when I tried to open a door – suitable for the horror genre, but probably not intentional. A day one patch and further updates will certainly be able to iron out these kinks, but they were minor&nbsp;and don’t impact the overall experience.</p>
<p>As a horror game, there weren’t as many jump scares as I’d have personally liked, but this game is seeded in tension, with heart pounding moments where you are trying to escape Mr Stone who is slowly approaching. In some sections you have a camera, which also helped to provide some tense moments alongside the fraught decision making, with Supermassive once again making all your choices feel like they matter. Sometimes these aren’t even obvious, such as with giving a character an item early in the game, which leads to a truly unexpected outcome later.</p>
<p>And, if you’re struggling to make a decision, these games always lend themselves well to being a party game, with a multiplayer mode where everyone is assigned a character to play. It’s always a laugh.</p>

						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>Over the years, Behavior Interactive's Dead by Daylight has become a worldwide phenomenon and one of the most popular multiplayer games still running today thanks to its unique gameplay and the setting, which, from the limited information available in-game, seems to be much deeper and complex than it what may seem at first glance. With The Casting of Frank Stone, developed by Supermassive Games, this setting is now at the forefront, receiving much-deserved development that should please every fan of the original game.</p>
<p>Despite being a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-casting-of-frank-stone-gets-official-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight spin-of</a>f, the studio behind Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology managed to create an adventure that can be thoroughly enjoyed even by those who aren't into Dead by Daylight, making The Casting of Frank Stone a game that can be enjoyed by every sort of player, granted they can look past a few issues.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Casting-of-Frank-Stone%E2%84%A2_20240829170952-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Casting of Frank Stone stars a diverse cast of characters, including police officer Sam, the young wannabe actor Jaime, her girlfriend and up-and-coming movie director Chris, their friend Linda, who's also working on a movie career, and Madison, a young woman who, on paper, doesn't seem to have any relation with every other character. Their destinies, however, are tightly linked with Frank Stone, a serial murderer who acted in the town of Cedar Hills in 1963 and was killed by officer Sam himself during an investigation focused on a missing boy.</p>
<p>The heroic act of the police officer, however, did not truly spell the end of Frank Stone. Decades later, the serial murderer continued to threaten the lives of many, and it was in 1980 that Jaime, Chris, and Linda realized how there was much more behind the serial murderer than just simple madness.</p>
<p>As you may have surmised from the above, The Casting of Frank Stone is set in different timelines - 1963, 1980, and 2024 - and most of the main cast appears in multiple timelines, their destinies not only chained together by their hometown but by the movie Murder Mill shot in the same steel mill Frank Stone worked at, and died in. Bringing them all together is the mysterious Augustine Lieber, who seems to have a strong interest in the movie for some reason. During the course of the adventure, the mystery unfolds multiple timelines, which alternate rather often, giving players the answer to every question as they go from one critical choice to the next, in true Supermassive Games style.</p>
<p>The story of The Casting of Frank Stone is definitely among the game's best features, if not the very best. Supermassive Games managed to create a story that, while rooted in the lore of Dead by Daylight's universe, is thoroughly enjoyable even by those, like myself, who aren't too familiar with it.&nbsp; The multiple timelines also work quite well, and it is extremely interesting to see how characters have changed over the years. Some of the twists of the story contribute to making the experience memorable, although Dead by Daylight fans are unlikely to be shocked by most of them. The writing is also very solid, and so is the voice acting, so much that, at times, it feels like watching a real movie and not playing a video game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Casting-of-Frank-Stone%E2%84%A2_20240829180237-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As is tradition for Supermassive Games, the story is at the center of The Casting of Frank Stone, and the gameplay features all revolve around it. Very often, during the course of the game, players will have to make choices that have an impact on the story as a whole and the fate of certain characters, potentially even saving them from death. Keeping track of all these choices is made easy by the Cutting Room Floor, a special mode where it is possible to see the many possible outcomes of any given decisions, the percentage of players who made them, and even receive some hints of what they may lead to if yet to be experienced. Needless to say, this addition is extremely welcome to discover everything the game has to offer, as there are a lot of different potential outcomes that would have been difficult to keep track of without such a mode. Additionally, the Cutting Room Floor makes it easy to pinpoint collectibles, as the mode details what can be found in any sequence that features a little bit of exploration.</p>
<p>Besides making choices and exploring some small closed-off areas in a third-person view, The Casting of Frank Stone doesn't offer a whole lot of gameplay. Some of the playable sequences feature simple environmental puzzles that can be completed easily and even some very straightforward combat powered by the camera, an item that plays a rather important part in the story as a whole. Every now and then, players will also have to complete quick-time events called Skill Checks, which is the only gameplay mechanic that made the jump from Dead by Daylight into The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p>All of this results in a game that has a very short run time, around 6 hours or so for a first playthrough that doesn't utilize the Cutting Room Floor to go back and experience the consequences of different choices. With a relationship system that keeps track of what each main character thinks of others and the aforementioned many potential outcomes, those who wish to see everything the game has to offer will spend way more than 6 hours with The Casting of Frank Stone, although that time will eventually get stale as the game doesn't really offer much in terms of gameplay. Still, with the story being so enjoyable and the characters so compelling, it wouldn't surprise me if most players completed multiple playthroughs, one after the other, to reach an ending they would find most satisfactory.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Casting-of-Frank-Stone%E2%84%A2_20240830175735-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, The Casting of Frank Stone looks gorgeous. Locations and character models are extremely detailed, and the wise usage of lighting gives the game a great atmosphere that only makes it all the more engaging. On PlayStation 5, the game comes with a single display mode that runs at a relatively smooth 30 FPS, with little to no stuttering, which isn't always guaranteed for a game powered by Unreal Engine 5. Though it seemed to have been an isolated case, I wasn't able to get the game running on my PC (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32GB RAM), always crashing on startup, so if you have similar specs, it may be a good idea to confirm the game can actually run on your machine before purchasing. For the record, the demo ran fine, and the issue has yet to be fixed at the time of writing.</p>
<p>To be honest, I wasn't expecting much of The Casting of Frank Stone, given how I only have a passing knowledge of Dead by Daylight, but after a few hours, I was hooked. This is a testament to the quality of the experience, which manages to be a great one for all sorts of players, granted they can stomach the little gameplay the adventure features, and the short run time for a single playthrough. The asking price of $39.99 is maybe a little too high for a six-hour-long game, but if you are into well-constructed horror stories, it could be a price worth paying.</p>

<p>The Casting of Frank Stone is yet another hit from Supermassive Games, delivering an engaging horror story deeply rooted into the lore of Dead of Daylight equally enjoyable by fans of the original game and those with no knowledge of the multiplayer game created by Behaviour Interactive. While its short length and limited gameplay may slightly hinder the experience, the game remains a worthwhile purchase for those who appreciate well-crafted supernatural horror stories.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suicide-squad-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs.970641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A number of QA workers at&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>studio Rocksteady have been laid off over the past month or so, a new report has alleged.</p>
<p>Rocksteady staff have apparently told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>&nbsp;that the studio's QA department has been slashed from around 33 staffers to about 15 over the past few weeks. Eurogamer says the staff members told them that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>was directly cited as a reason for these layoffs.</p>
<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>publisher (and Rocksteady parent company) Warner Bros <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">declared back in February</a> that the live-service looter shooter had underperformed compared to its expectations for the game. In May, the publisher <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said the game was a major factor</a> in a $200 million revenue drop.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad-tentacle.jpg?itok=xDUKXmXd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad-tentacle.jpg?itok=-GirNEF_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>may look pretty, but its sales sure don't.</figcaption></figure><p>The Eurogamer report goes on to say that it's not just Rocksteady QA being hit by layoffs, and that one employee was "told they were being made redundant in the middle of their paternity leave".</p>
<p>According to Eurogamer, Rocksteady management has acknowledged "that product quality will now suffer as a result" of these layoffs. Rocksteady staff also told the site that the remaining staff at the studio would now be "shouldered with more work" (that's a Eurogamer quote, not a Rocksteady quote).</p>
<p>It seems like a pretty bizarre decision to me to cut staff at Rocksteady's QA department in response to the failure of&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</p>
<p>After all, I don't think it's their fault the game flopped; surely, whoever insisted&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em> remain on its live-service course, despite that pretty obviously being a hugely unpopular decision, would be a better point of scrutiny.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-batman-arkham-knight.jpg?itok=7AUTTtxc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-batman-arkham-knight.jpg?itok=2lYr2tgb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rocksteady is also known for its&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>This news comes at what appears to be a rather inconvenient time for Rocksteady. If a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/james-gunn-the-batman-rumors">recent LinkedIn employee listing is to be believed</a>, the company is currently embarking on a new, as-yet unannounced project, which began development in June.</p>
<p>With the loss of many of its QA employees, it looks like Rocksteady will now have to work even harder to make sure that project's fully ready before it's released. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Rocksteady.</p>
