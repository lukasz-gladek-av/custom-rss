		<p>Sony and developer Firewalk will be holding an open beta weekend for their upcoming hero shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>. Both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/concord-gets-flashy-cinematic-trailer-gameplay-reveal-beta-test-confirmed-with-august-launch/">an open beta weekend</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/07/concord-price-beta-preorder-details-for-ps5-and-pc-confirmed/">an early access weekend for pre-orders</a> will be taking place in July, across both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and PC, on the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concord Beta Early Access</strong> – 12th-14th July</li>
<li><strong>Concord Open Beta</strong> – 18th-21st July</li>
</ul>
<p>The early access weekend will be available to all those that pre-order Concord, but each person that pre-orders any edition of the game will actually get five codes for the early access weekend, meaning to you can bring yourself and four friends to create a full fireteam of Freegunners.</p>


<p>During the beta, you’ll have four maps to play on and there will be four game modes introduced by the second weekend: Trophy Hunt (Team Deathmatch), Cargo Run (Search &amp; Destroy), Clash Point (like single capture point Search &amp; Destroy), Area Control (uh… Control)</p>
<p>The two pre-launch test weekends will also have full cross-play support, though this is an optional side to the game (as it should be in any competitive shooter).</p>

<p>The full launch for Concord is then set for 23rd August, both physically and digitally for £34.99 here in the UK and $39.99 / €39.99 / ¥4,480 in other regions</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jqQJhjf_3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Firewalk and Sony have big ambitions for their shooter, looking to usurp the formula laid out by Overwatch almost a decade ago. It will drop you into the shoes of the crew of the North Star, taking on high-stakes jobs that will see you facing off against other Freegunner crews. With 16 class-based characters each with contrasting abilities and gear, the parallels to Overwatch are clear, but there is a key distinction to how the game plays as some gear and gadgets will be able to have effects that persist between rounds &nbsp;– traps, lane-blockers, shield barriers and more can shape an entire match between teams.</p>
<p>There’s also a greater emphasis on story being built directly into the game.&nbsp;Each week will open with a new cinematic vignette that will feed into the character building and overarching universe that Firewalk is creating, aiming to go beyond the character building of other examples of the genre.</p>

This gives each of the three episodes a canon explanation while not requiring them to actually make sense. With no responsibilities to stay consistent with existing lore, Remedy really lets loose in ways you wouldn’t expect even after playing <em>Alan Wake 2</em>. And as the entire DLC is a TV show, it just makes sense for it to have a theme song. </p><p>Simply titled “Night Springs,” the theme is a synth-pop tune that will quickly worm its way into your head. The lyrics talk about many of the weird happenings that can occur in the show’s titular town, with examples including getting caught in a time loop and finding a solar system in a bowl of soup, among others. Each one sounds like it could be its own bite-sized episode, and they all fit right alongside the stories we do play through. </p><p>Upon finishing the first episode, “Number One Fan,” the theme song plays for the first time and It feels so good to hear the pop anthem play after gunning down enemies in a rose-tinted world as the psychotic (but incredibly loveable) Waitress. Now I listen to the theme song and I think about how fun the DLC is. It’s just a feedback loop of good times between the song and the game. </p><p>Not that I needed more proof that things are better with a theme song, but this year’s indie journalism satire sim<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/times-and-galaxy-review-journalist-sim-mass-effect-1851547336&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/times-and-galaxy-review-journalist-sim-mass-effect-1851547336"><em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em></a></span> also has one. Spoiler alert, it rules. Before you even build your unique robo reporter in the game, an animated intro plays set to a catchy tune. What works in this theme song is how it introduces you to the basic premise and cast of the game. You are going to report a bunch of stories across a number of beats (arts, politics, and more) and do it alongside the staff of the titular paper. Give it a listen and try not to be excited about the game. I, for one, have sung the lines “Space is a lonely void. We’ve got the whole thing covered. From the trash heaps of Aug to places undiscovered” more times than I can count (or would like to admit).</p><p>All I’m saying is that no game would be made worse by adding a theme song. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/keeping-an-open-mind-about-the-halo-4-soundtrack-453101141&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/keeping-an-open-mind-about-the-halo-4-soundtrack-453101141"><em>Halo</em></a></span>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-first-hands-on-plenty-of-balancing-left-to-go-and-not-much-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Concord was originally teased last year with a simple video that showcased a ship cruising through space. I think a hamburger was involved. Anyway, after seeing that short teaser, I honestly expected to see a story-driven FPS  – this is a first-party Sony game, after all – but maybe it’d be something like an MMO, a la Destiny. I was on board for a new experience regardless, but then I was somewhat surprised to learn that Concord is, in fact, a 5v5 shooter.</p><p>And now that I’ve played it, I’m very glad that Concord does plan on keeping up with its world lore and ongoing storyline, since some of my favorite FPS games like Overwatch and Apex Legends do this seasonally as well . Additionally, each season that releases will be free to all players, who only have to purchase the game and enjoy future updates to come.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord - June 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>While I enjoyed my time in the limited hands-on preview overall, I have several concerns for the longevity of Concord and what it has to offer. Concord’s meat-and-potatoes formula is a pretty standard 5v5 set up, with two teams choosing their preferred character before diving into an objective-based team battle.</p><p>During the preview, I was able to play three of six modes that will be available at launch: Trophy Hunt, Cargo Run, and Clash Point. Trophy Hunt was the only one that featured respawns in the match and was basically Kill Confirmed team deathmatch.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While I enjoyed my time in the limited hands-on preview overall, I have several concerns for the longevity of Concord and what it has to offer.</p></div><p>Cargo Run, meanwhile, was a single-life match where the objective was to run to the center, steal a Blue Buddy package and plant it at one of two sites. If planted, the enemy team could go and stand on the package to diffuse it and take it back. And finally, Clash Point was a round-based single-life game mode with the objective being to control the only capture zone in the entire map multiple times to get the victory.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The single-life modes were tough to warm up on while still getting to know the game, as failure obviously means you’re out of the action for a bit. And while Concord is a fairly straightforward FPS, I have a core criticism a mere two months from its August 24 launch: in the build I played, the movement felt extremely floaty and required a bit of time to get used to. This is exacerbated by the fact that each Freerunner character you can play has a unique set of movement and skills they bring to the team, so each time you swap to a new character, you’re then attempting to learn and configure your brain to how they work. So you can imagine that it gets a bit disorienting.</p><p>And while Concord will be released on PC day and date with PS5, I was only able to preview this on the PS5 with a controller, and so with that in mind, I’d say the movement is heavily reminiscent of Destiny and Halo. Again, it is incredibly floaty, which could be a fun element if it is done well. However, the way the preview build felt, the feather-light jumps and hang time really did not match the amount of fast-paced fights that could occur at any time in the matches.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While Halo does utilize a similar floaty jump mechanic, the rest of the mechanics and gameplay in Halo justify that reasoning and do not make it feel like the odd element out. Grenades also feel light when lobbed through the air, the various abilities in Halo all have the same weight and cadence to them, and the match pacing reflects the balancing between the base game mechanics. Players in Halo, even in competitive ranked matches, do heal over time after avoiding taking damage for a while.</p><p>Similarly, Destiny is a game that’s more PvE related and thus does not need the incredibly snappy mechanics that Halo or Concord need in PvP fights. Even in the PvP fights in Destiny, the usual TTK is slower since the fights can be drawn out due to the different class abilities allowing for slower or faster play, depending on how players choose to engage (i.e. more directly or more reserved). Each class also has different movement capabilities and healing abilities that ensure match pacing stays consistent throughout.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>So the problem in Concord, at least in this preview version, is that it takes little pieces from games like Halo and Destiny and mixes them together in a formula that doesn’t quite come together for me as of yet. Concord actually utilizes the same type of dodge  animation from Destiny that pulls you out in third person. While I liked this element in Destiny, in Concord it doesn’t quite work because there’s a  brief-but-noticeable delay between your input of the dodge and the actual deployment. This can make or break your life since timing is everything in competitive play and a single hesitation, or simulated hesitation through the delayed input, can punish you greatly.</p><p>Sony says there will be six total maps at launch, so perhaps some of the game modes will feel better paced and optimized on the others when spread out. But the way things stand currently, most maps felt very oddly misshapen. Some lanes were too long or big and barely saw rotations while the second lane in another map would just feel entirely too small and cause prolonged team fights due to its claustrophobic size.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Concord touts its competitive nature and fast-paced fights. I love all of that but found that the competitiveness risks being unwelcoming to new players attempting to learn the game because most of the game modes are single-life-focused. </p><p>It’s important to note that even if you are an incredible player, Concord is not a game that allows for many 1v2 fights to be won. Unlike a game of Apex or Halo where you can potentially outsmart your opponents and win in 1v2 scenarios, Concord is so heavily a team game that you’re not able to succeed if you’re on your own. While this <em>is</em> the point of team FPS games, it’s pretty punishing for modes like Trophy Hunt where you’re encouraged to go off and get kills for the objective.</p><p>Another reason these lopsided matchups are impossible to win is the fact that each character in Concord has their own health pool and hitbox. This would be fine if these characters had your traditional classes, but Concord doesn’t utilize your typical class system. Usually, each class has their own health stats that you can expect each character in that label to have.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Gameplay Trailer Screenshots - State of Play 2024</h3></div></output><p>Taking a look at Overwatch, for instance, most Tanks have a base health of anywhere from about 525 to 700 (with combinations of shields or armor in game for specific characters that have them like DVA and Reinhardt). In Concord, it was incredibly difficult to tell what exactly the health pool was for any of the classes since nothing was really quite established with their system.</p><p>For example, 1-Off is a cute robot who sucks up trash and is most definitely a tank character with his big physique and clunky movement and hard-hitting weaponry who has 300 health. However, Teo, who is essentially a DPS that plays like your traditional ground soldier-like character with no tank qualities, has 220 health as a Concord Ranger class. But Roka, another character who is essentially a DPS, is classified as a Haunt and has 170 health. </p><p>What these non-traditional classes mean is extremely confusing. In the preview, we weren’t given details on each class and what the terms mean, but it all seems a bit arbitrary when the health pools and damage numbers vary so much, causing an even further division of game balancing.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Trailer Screens</h3></div></output><p>Overwatch also utilizes the system of ensuring there is a roster for the amount of characters allowed from each class. Concord currently does not utilize a mechanic like that and allows players to use whatever characters they want, since these class systems are not traditional. While this is fun in theory, in my brief experience playing a competitive game like Concord, it doesn’t pan out too well. </p><p>Another reason Concord is so heavily a team-based game is that each character has their own running speed and damage output. It could be argued that this is an extension of the lack of clear classes, but I did want to focus on this as its own balancing issue. The DPS on characters is pretty important since you’re allowed to have a team of whatever characters you want.</p><p>There were some definitely “overpowered” characters in the preview build that you really did need on your team if you wanted to win, especially in Trophy Hunt. Let’s look at the rocket launcher Freegunner, Roka.</p><p>She’s able to deal 43 damage with direct hits while firing rapidly and establishing her lock-on target almost instantly. After having done some watch backs, it seems there’s no real answer to what the distance of Roka’s splash damage is and how much it does consistently. So far I’ve seen it hit from a decent distance for 12 damage, then also hit for 27 damage closer to the target. Roka also has eight total rockets to use before she has to reload so these numbers add up.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The ever-ongoing battle between controller aim assist versus keyboard and mouse movement seems to just be aggravated here.</p></div><p>Comparing this to Overwatch’s Pharah, another rocket-launcher-wielding character, she only does 40 damage to an enemy when it is a <em>direct</em> hit, with her splash damage being about half that. She also only has six rockets before having to reload and does not have any abilities for lock on fire.</p><p>Obviously comparing these two games head-to-head isn’t fair to either, but it’s important to note the difference between balancing. It’s entirely possible that with time, Concord will be able to get a better grasp for how its balancing should be maintained. But the way it stands currently, I’m concerned for the more casual players’ experience and general approachability.</p><p>The option to play crossplay with PC and PS5 will be available at launch which is good news for players like me who have friends on both platforms, but it’s a bit of a double-edged sword. The preview build I played showcased heavy aim assist on controllers. It was most noticeable on Roka, the rocket launcher character, since her weapon locks-on. I would find myself having to really rip the thumbstick away to get her to turn away from the nearest enemy that I didn’t even want to target.</p><p>The other characters I played didn’t feature nearly as aggressive aim assist, but I could feel the magnetization there, which was a bit frustrating and concerning considering the option for crossplay would be enabled at launch. While yes, you can argue that on PC you can do more rapid movement adjustments on the fly, the ever-ongoing battle between controller aim assist versus keyboard and mouse movement seems to just be aggravated here.</p><p>Fortunately, there are still a couple of months to go until Concord’s launch – still a decent bit of time for the balancing and tweaking of every aspect of the game that always happens at this stage of the development process. Fingers crossed Concord is able to tighten up its floaty controls and address its character balancing before it drops on August 24 for PS5 and PC.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

After all, Elden Ring’s history and lore — much like that of most other Miyazaki-directed games — is fractured and obfuscated by intent, with hints as to its true nature often found only in the descriptions of obscure items, or through conversation with NPCs. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>This works in a video game, where players are at liberty to explore and seek out answers organically, but could prove difficult to parse in another artistic medium lacking a similar level of agency.

            <p>
This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss the cancelled Xbox project Keystone: Microsoft's plans to launch a relatively cheap streaming console.
</p>
<p>Keystone popped up yesterday in an old patent which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-what-xboxs-ill-fated-cloud-gaming-console-might-have-looked-like-according-to-newly-surfaced-patent">detailed the prospective hardware in fresh detail</a>, though we have of course seen it in the wild before - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-phil-spencers-shelf-is-teasing-the-xbox-game-pass-streaming-box">on Xbox boss Phil Spencer's shelf</a>. Spencer has addressed Keystone's cancellation, and blamed it being shelved (literally) on Microsoft not being able to make it a cheap enough proposition.</p>
<p>But does the end of Keystone mean Microsoft is abandoning its cloud gaming plans entirely? No, of course not - and Xbox Cloud Gaming remains. And in the future, as internet speeds improve and streaming games becomes more common, could we see Keystone Version 2? Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy to discuss.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-3-1-was-just-added-to-all-nixxes-ports-from-marvels-spider-man-remastered-to-ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just a few minutes ago, Nixxes (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-nixxes-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Sony</a> to work on its PlayStation to PC ports) confirmed the addition of AMD FSR 3.1 to several games, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-remastered-pc-is-a-solid-debut-for-nixxes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-miles-morales-pc-is-another-great-port-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-pc-not-polished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-forbidden-west-is-another-solid-pc-port-from-nixxes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-dlss-upscaling-fsr-3-frame-gen-simultaneous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the message posted by Nixxes about the new feature:</p>
<p><em>We have been working closely with AMD to incorporate FSR 3.1. This performance-enhancing technology can be used with recent graphics cards from AMD, Intel and NVIDIA.</em></p>
<p><em>AMD FSR 3.1 includes frame generation and offers improved FSR upscaling quality. It also allows you to use AMD FSR frame generation in combination with any upscaling technology available in the game for your graphics card.</em></p>
<p><em>AMD FSR 3.1 also includes a Native AA option that applies high quality anti-aliasing without upscaling, for improved image quality. To enable this option, set Upscaling Method to Off and select AMD FSR 3 Native AA from the anti-aliasing options. This setting can be used in combination with or without frame generation.</em></p>
<p>Each game may also have received other unique minor changes/additions beyond AMD FSR 3.1. For example, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart (all games originally made by Insomniac) also updated Intel XeSS to version 1.3 with XeSS Native AA option and introduced the ability to start the game with a controller from the launcher. The two Marvel's Spider-Man also got general stability improvements. For Ratchet &amp; Clank, Nixxes fixed an issue where shooting surfaces would not show bullet hole decals.</p>
<p>For Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut, Nixxes fixed an issue with the HDR Max Luminance slider that caused it to cap at 1000 nits and improved the Legends co-op multiplayer matchmaking. Out of all the games listed above, Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition got the most changes, including some performance improvements and brand-new settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a Cinematic Face Detail option in the Graphics menu.</li>
<li>Added a Stylized Mouse Cursor option in the Mouse &amp; Keyboard menu.</li>
<li>Added an Output Mode option in the Audio menu.</li>
<li>Various optimizations and performance improvements.</li>
<li>Improved audio for Logitech G HUB Surround Sound users.</li>
<li>Ammo Crafting is now remappable on Mouse &amp; Keyboard.</li>
<li>When using a Nintendo Switch Pro controller, buttons are now working and show as intended.</li>
<li>Buttons are now working as intended when using Nintendo Button layout on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>The Toggle Vista Prompt now works correctly when using Mouse &amp; Keyboard controls.</li>
<li>Various user interface fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-steam-user-reviews-are-mixed-citing-excessive-difficulty-and-performance-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mixed Steam user reviews</a>, which bemoaned performance issues and excessive difficulty, the overall response of the community on the first and only DLC for 2022's Game of the Year has been excellent. Shadow of the Erdtree also got fantastic scores, including from Wccftech's Francesco De Meo, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awarded the expansion a 10/10</a>:</p>
<p><em>It did not take long to get back into the engaging adventuring loop of the Elden Ring experience, searching for map fragments to get a better look at the map, placing markers where points of interest are seemingly located, and getting amazed by beautiful vistas, immense castles, and sprawling haunting forests, unaware of the dangers that lurked inside of them. With open-world fatigue setting in earlier this year due to the many open-world games released in 2024—like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Rise of the Ronin, and the PC versions of Horizon Forbidden West and Ghost of Tsushima—Shadow of the Erdtree's open-world design stands out as a testament to how the Elden Ring experience still surpasses anything else on the market. As such, I believe a perfect score is justified, even with the evident lack of significant innovation and some technical hiccups.</em></p>
<p>FromSoftware is also still working on improving the expansion post-launch. A calibration update was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-balance-gets-tweaked-with-update-1-12-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a>, and the developers have also confirmed more Shadow of the Erdtree balance tweaks and bug fixes are on the way for a future update. We'll let you know once it goes live, of course.</p>

Along the way, players can capture other bounties while partaking in third-person combat and light platforming. And soon, you’ll be able to play (or replay) this fan-favorite <em>Star Wars </em>game via a fancy remaster.</p><p>On June 27, Lucasfilm announced that <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter </em>is being remastered by Aspyr. The remastered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Bounty_Hunter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Bounty_Hunter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bounty Hunter</em></a></span> is set to arrive on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 1. It will cost $20. Here’s the first trailer for this new version of <em>Bounty Hunter.</em></p><p>This remaster of the game will feature improved textures, a new dynamic lighting system, and it even adds a flashlight to Jango Fett’s arsenal of tools and weapons. That flashlight will help in some areas of the game that are really dark. Back in the day players complained about the lack of a flashlight, so 22 years later, Aspyr is finally fixing this problem. </p><p>The bigger and more exciting news is that this new remaster finally makes good on an Easter egg left in the original game’s files. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/jango-fett-returns-in-enhanced-star-wars-bounty-hunter-coming-to-ps5-august-1/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/jango-fett-returns-in-enhanced-star-wars-bounty-hunter-coming-to-ps5-august-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As mentioned in a PlayStation blog post about the remaster</a></span>, in <em>Bounty Hunter </em>there was a low-res texture that contained a secret message: “Cash in all the bounties to play as Boba.” This wasn’t a feature in the OG game. However, in the remaster, after completing the game, players will be able to replay <em>Bounty Hunter</em> as Boba Fett. </p><p>Does it make any sense within the narrative of this game? Nope!

              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I don’t envy the developers behind Concord. The hero shooter subgenre is a difficult space to break into, and cultivating a dedicated playerbase is even tougher. After seeing Concord’s gameplay reveal last month and its lukewarm response, I would have told you Firewalk Studios’ debut title would likely fall flat on its face.</p><p dir="ltr">However, after spending a few hours with Concord earlier this month, it’s clear that PlayStation and Firewalk Studios have built a solid foundation for its sci-fi multiplayer shooter. Mechanically, Concord sits somewhere between Overwatch and Valorant. Gun combat plays a big role in the moment-to-moment gameplay, but fast reaction times and pinpoint accuracy aren’t the be-all end-all of firefights. Each hero, or Freegunner as they are called, boasts a unique primary weapon, a distinct movement style, and two primary abilities. The lengthy time to kill lets all these different abilities shine without undermining the tight and responsive gunplay. Success requires good team composition, an understanding of each character’s abilities, and a bit of raw skill.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325525-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_42_02.still006.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325525" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325525-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_42_02.still006.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325525"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325525-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_42_02.still006.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">While most Freegunners still fit into a traditional role--such as a support or tank--they feel a bit more flexible than their Overwatch counterparts. You'd think Star Child, the blue and red behemoth with a large health pool, would be the ideal tank. But thanks to his well-rounded kit--including a primary ability that essentially turns him into a wrecking ball that charges across the battlefield--and his shotgun that doubles as an axe, he can fit into an offensive DPS role with hit-and-run tactics. In the back half of one game, I racked up a half dozen kills by outflanking the enemy team.</p><p dir="ltr">All 10 of the Freegunner’s I tested out felt deadly in their own way, while still playing towards specific roles. Vale is a sniper equipped with a bolt-action sniper rifle, a pistol, proximity mines, and an enhanced vertical leap. She thrives at range where she can pick off weakened enemies, but thanks to her trip mines, she can also control the flow of the battlefield. All three maps I played consisted of three interconnected lanes, and while a couple trip mines carefully placed along one of these corridors likely won’t stop an enemy team, they are sure to slow them down.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Lennox is Concord’s Cole Cassidy, formerly McCree. Armed with a six shooter, explosive throwing knives, and a self-heal ability, Lennox feels like your standard high-skill DPS character. Lining up headshots is key, and activating his abilities at the right time can get you out of some sticky situations. Lennox captures that high risk, high reward playstyle. His self-heal makes him viable for lone wolf tactics, and if you can consistently land headshots, most enemies won’t last long.</p><p dir="ltr">My favorite Freegunner was Haymar, a crossbow wielding spellcaster that can hover around the map. Her Flameshot Bow fires an incendiary bolt that can deal significant damage on direct hits. Her abilities consist of a blinding flash that disorients enemies and a wall of fire that can create chokepoints. Flying around combat zones essentially flash banging enemies and laying down walls of fire while teammates cleaned up the stragglers was a blast.</p><p dir="ltr">Freegunners and their abilities aren’t set in stone, either. Firewalk Studios hopes to keep combat fresh with something called Combat Traits. Each Freegunner has a set of Combat Traits that act as perks. For example, Lennox had one that let him automatically reload when he dodged. This felt a little unbalanced in a PvP setting--especially when the main drawback of revolver is its slow reload speed--but it definitely has me curious how these Combat Traits could affect a Freegunner and their role within the team.</p><blockquote><p>Firewalk Studios has opted to lean into that asymmetry of its characters.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Flexible Freegunner roles and Combat Traits feed into Concord’s asymmetric combat. Each Freegunner has their own set of strengths and weaknesses thanks to their varied health pools, weapons, and abilities. This means some heroes may pair well with each other while others don’t. For example, there’s a support character named Daw who can put down AOE heal stations and force fields that block all incoming and outgoing fire. Daw is great for holding down objectives and keeping Star Child covered at long range. However, my team quickly learned that Daw’s force field ability could negatively impact all of our medium to long range heroes at crucial moments. Jabali on the other hand can heal teammates with a bit more precision thanks to his healing orbs, similar to Zenyatta’s Orbs of Harmony from Overwatch. Seeing how all these different Freegunners could compliment each other and counter the other team’s makes firefights feel dynamic and unpredictable.</p><p dir="ltr">Firewalk Studios has opted to lean into that asymmetry of its characters. While this will undoubtedly make specific matchups difficult, this imbalance forces you to work as a team, and use your character’s entire kit. Of course, the Firewalk Studios team will be monitoring balance once the game ends up in players hands, but according to Claude Jerome, the lead gameplay designer, that asymmetry is crucial to Concord’s heroes.</p><p dir="ltr">This asymmetry is not reflected in Concord's game modes and map design. I had the chance to check out three different game types: Trophy Hunt which is basically Kill Confirmed from Call of Duty, and Cargo Run and Clash Point which are round base modes with no respawn. As someone who’s played over 500 hours of Rainbow Six: Siege, Cargo Run and Clash Point were the highlights for me. The limited respawn and objective based gameplay required a level of coordination that you don’t always get in team deathmatch style modes. Unlike Siege and Valorant, Concord’s symmetrical maps meant that both teams were at an even playing field at the start of each round. This makes it easier to focus on team composition relative to your team rather than your starting location.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325531-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_53_48.still007.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325531" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325531-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_53_48.still007.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325531"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325531-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_53_48.still007.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325526-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_31_37.still005.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325527-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_10_17.still004.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325528-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_03_32.still003.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325529-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_01_33_49.still002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325530-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_01_30_41.still001.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325526,1300-4325527,1300-4325528,1300-4325529,1300-4325530" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1512/15120939/4325526-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_31_37.still005.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1512/15120939/4325527-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_10_17.still004.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1512/15120939/4325528-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_03_32.still003.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1512/15120939/4325529-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_01_33_49.still002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1512/15120939/4325530-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_01_30_41.still001.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325526-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_31_37.still005.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325527-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_10_17.still004.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325528-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_02_03_32.still003.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325529-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_01_33_49.still002.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4325530-01_concord_trophyhunt_ps5_vale%28sniper%29_teo%28soldier%29_loss.00_01_30_41.still001.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Concord’s mechanics may tread a lot of familiar ground within the hero shooter genre, but the way Firewalk Studios’ heroes, maps, and game modes compliment each other feels fresh. Each Freegunner has just enough flexibility to break out of their role if they need to, the simplistic arena-style maps prioritize smart ability usage over intimate map knowledge, and the game modes are just complicated enough to encourage teamwork. I’m curious to see if and how Concord holds up with more maps, characters, and game modes in the mix.</p><p dir="ltr">While I was impressed by the combat, I’m not entirely sold on the universe and the story Concord hopes to tell. Freegunner’s are outlaws that speed around the galaxy looking for adventure. Each week, Firewalk Studios will release a two minute vignette that plays when you boot up the game. These vignettes will shape an ongoing narrative that players will experience together.</p><p dir="ltr">Before my hands-on session, the studio showed us the first one, and its tone gave off a we-have-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-at-home sort of vibe. Maybe it could build to something more interesting, or maybe I’ve just grown tired of that Marvel-esque tone, but it didn’t do much for me in the moment. I also wonder how Concord plans to onboard new players if they’ve missed the first few weeks of the story. According to the devs, they will make all those vignettes available on YouTube, but I can’t imagine players will actively seek those out.</p>

                <p>There are many wacky video game controllers out there, but it's fair to say that Dr. Tom Tilley has designed an unprecedented way to play Super Monkey Ball. In a viral internet video, Tilley shows off a DIY controller that's perfect for the game: a physical monkey in a ball that rotates like a trackball to handle the in-game simian.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIlI3aXOIXA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gIlI3aXOIXA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tilley showed off some aspects of the build in the video. It shares its basic design with a soccer-ball controller that the hacker built for use with Katamari Damacy. The sensor appears to be an upside-down ball mouse that's held in place with plastic balls (seemingly from old deodorant sticks) and mounted on a cardboard rack. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the design is Tilley's 3D-printed model of Super Monkey Ball's cute mascot AiAI, who looks remarkably on-point.</p><p>Reached via email, Tilley explained the inspiration for the controller. "We lived in Thailand for about 10 years and while we were there I played an obscure Japanese arcade game called Armadillo Racing from 1992. The game cabinets have a trackball that you use to steer your armadillo and I thought it would be fun to try and recreate the experience."</p><p>"When I put some video up online people suggested trying it with Katamari Damacy and Super Monkey Ball and it felt very intuitive playing these games. When I was editing a thumbnail to go up on YouTube with some video playing Super Monkey Ball I photoshopped AiAI in a ball in place of the actual soccer ball and I think that was the genesis of going, "'Maybe I could use this with an actual monkey ball.'"</p><p>Tilley also explained some aspects of its creation: "The ball sits on top of an optical mouse to detect the mouse movement but there's still some variation in height as you roll the ball so the mouse tracking would be intermittent. To compensate, another deodorant roller is glued onto the mouse and the ball sits on top of this roller. As the soccer ball moves it turns the deodorant ball underneath the ball and the mouse sees it moving just as if you were moving the mouse over a surface."</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://x.com/DrTomTilley/status/1805843351217819935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">follow-up post</a> on social media, Tilley said some upgrades are planned: "The legs are hinged and I've added some mount points where AiAi's knees should be," Tilley clarified to GameSpot. "I'm hoping to add a trailing wheel with a crank that will push the legs backwards and forwards as the ball rolls to make it look like AiAI is running inside the ball." We'll keep an eye out to see if Tilley can pull it off. The latest entry in the Super Monkey Ball series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble/" data-ref-id="5000-618874">Banana Rumble</a>, released on Switch earlier in June.</p>

        <p>Partnership begins next month, enables players in 25 countries to stream games via their Fire TV Stick</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Microsoft and Amazon are partnering to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to more devices: specifically, the latest models of Amazon's Fire TV Stick.</p>
<p>The Xbox firm announced in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/27/xbox-cloud-gaming-amazon-fire-tv/">blog post</a> that the Xbox app will be made available on Fire TV in 2 selected markets from next month, enabling anyone with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership to access the cloud gaming titles in Microsoft's library.</p>
<p>To begin with, the app will be limited to two devices: Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Stick 4K Max, which were both released last year. These retail for $49.99 and $59.99 respectively, with Microsoft positioning this as a more affordable way to get into Xbox gaming.</p>
<p>Players will need a compatible Bluetooth-enabled wireless controller (which, as <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/xbox-gaming-on-amazon-fire-tv">Amazon's blog post</a> confirms, includes PlayStation's DualShock 4 and DualSense controllers) to access these titles.</p>
<p>While an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership is needed for the full library of titles, the Xbox app will give non-members the opportunity to play Fortnite.</p>
<p>The partnership is the latest in Microsoft's efforts to bring Game Pass via cloud gaming to more devices, following a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-tv-key-to-taking-cloud-gaming-mainstream">similar partnership with Samsung</a> and its Smart TVs.</p>

And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/26/concord-feels-like-destiny-meets-overwatch">You can read&nbsp;<em>Game Informer's</em>&nbsp;full Concord preview thoughts here</a>, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today's New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation's HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game's 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What's more, if you manage to complete the game's campaign, you'll unlock a Boba Fett skin, allowing you to play through the entirety of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter&nbsp;</em>as another of the most notorious bounty hunters in the galaxy.</p>

<p>The studio was also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jason-schreier-confirms-kotor-remake-done-by-aspyr-media">the original developer</a> on the long-awaited&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-knight-of-old-republic-remake-kotor-remake"><em>Knights of the Old Republic&nbsp;</em>remake</a>, although development on that project was apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/theres-new-knights-of-old-republic-studio-taking-reins">taken over by Saber Interactive in August 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Outside the galaxies of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>, Aspyr has ported a number of other games to modern systems, the most recent of which being&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered"><em>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em>, it's a 2002 shooter originally developed and published by LucasArts.</p>
<p>The game sees bounty hunter Jango Fett hired by a Sith Lord to take down a Dark Jedi. Along the way, he becomes embroiled in a criminal conspiracy, because hey, what else is a Fett to do?</p>
<p>The remaster of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on August 1st. Watch this space for more info.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/albatroz">Albatroz</a> is a "backpacking adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>" that takes place in The Forbidden Lands, a photogenic wilderness "where two worlds converge". You are jaded city worker Isla, and you are here to search for your missing brother, who was himself searching for the mystical mountain of Albatroz - locally known as "the walking mountain", for reasons that you will never guess. There's no combat, and no enemies that I can see - instead, you'll occupy yourself with equipment management, repairing your dinky car, and improving your hiking skills using points earned by doing favours for villagers along the way.</p><!--more-->
<p>This, truly, is a combination of elements precision-tooled to entice the long-haul <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> fan burned out on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It's a game of verdant valleys and big skies, whose otherworldly elements are kept in check by the practicalities of travel and survival. It's on show at Gamescom Latam 2024 at the São Paulo Expo centre - the first Latin American edition of Gamescom - and they've released a new trailer below.</p>

<p>Speaking as somebody who can't finish a workday without wanting to hurry Bilbo Baggins-style out the door and straight into the nearest moderately-sized national park, I am dead keen on the "backpacking RPG" getup. I am considerably less keen on the game's being presented as a big vibrant metaphor for wrestling with loss and the process of self-discovery.</p>
<p>The trailer dialogue is so on the nose it gives me a nosebleed, and well, when is heading off into the wilderness <em>not</em> some variation on the act of letting go in order to find yourself? I'm probably being very condescending and unkind to developers Among Giants, here. I'm sure the sentiments are heartfelt. But I'm fervently hoping the full version involves much less poignant self-reflection and philosophising, and a lot more silent hiking and beholding.</p>
<p>The writing isn't all monuments to mortality. There are those villages, each of which has its history and spread of personalities. Providing these trips into town are appropriately spread out, I can imagine them being a nice change from the isolation of hiking - it depends how "vast" the environments are in practice. As for the survival elements, you can pass out if you run out of supplies, but it doesn't look like you'll be limping back to town with broken ankles and a case of dysentry. This feels much closer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons">Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons</a> than The Revenant.</p>
<p>Albatroz is out this year. There's a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2171880/Albatroz/">Steam</a>, which I'll be trying out later, unless I do succumb to the call of the open road, in which case I'll probably get as far as the local Dominos before heading back home to watch House Of The Dragon. If you enjoy going for long walks but would prefer a bit more friction, why not go for a stroll in Sons Of The Forest? Alice O (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pretty-walking-simulator-sons-of-the-forest-offers-peaceful-seclusion">says it's lovely in there</a> and she has yet to lie to my face.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-reaches-5m-players-in-first-week.913404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24187358/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-copies-sold<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="jCH23B"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> sold 5 million units in its first three days of availability, publisher Bandai Namco announced Thursday, an impressive figure that equates to about one-fifth of the original game’s overall fanbase. </p>
<p id="YUp9Tc">Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware announced in June, nine days ahead of the DLC’s launch, that <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1800890964925366476"><em>Elden Ring</em> had sold 25 million copies</a> since its release in February 2022. (It was the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23070948/elden-ring-sales-chart-npd-call-of-duty-best-sellers">bestselling game in the U.S. that year</a>, according to analysts.)</p>
<p id="3ZSoqi">That some 20% of all <em>Elden Ring</em> players have jumped into the notoriously difficult DLC is impressive, especially when you factor in the completion rate of the feats required to even access <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. Two weeks prior to the DLC’s launch, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176047/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-preparation-achievements-completed">more than half of all <em>Elden Ring</em> players across multiple platforms hadn’t defeated the two bosses</a> — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">Starscourge Radahn</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Mogh, Lord of Blood</a> — required to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24087766/how-to-access-dlc-start-location-requirements">access the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> map</a>.</p>
<p id="wDdokG">Even today, more than 20% of <em>Elden Ring</em> players haven’t accomplished the most basic of feats: reaching the Roundtable Hold, where many of the game’s NPCs reside.</p>
<p id="icqjKG">Completion rates for felling Starscourge Radahn and Mogh, Lord of Blood have gone up since then, but, in some cases, only by a fraction of percentage points. It appears that the most dedicated <em>Elden Ring</em> players are the ones continuing into <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which isn’t much of a surprise. But that stick-to-itiveness hasn’t prevented some players from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24186312/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-difficulty-too-hard-git-gud">complaining that the DLC is unfairly hard</a>.</p>
<p id="ERQdww"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s early success only serves to reinforce what FromSoftware has already said: that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22980899/elden-ring-new-franchise-fromsoftware">Elden Ring is a new franchise</a> for the developer that it hopes to “[expand] beyond the realm of games.”</p>
<p id="p72EeD"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. If you’re struggling, check out Polygon’s extensive <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree </em>guides</a> to finding the all-important <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178006/scadutree-fragment-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Scadutree Fragments</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24183189/dlc-remembrance-all-rewards-how-to-get-sote">boss Remembrances</a>, and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180256/all-new-dlc-weapon-locations">weapons</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180257/all-spell-locations">spells</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24177999/talisman-locations-all-dlc-sote">talismans</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180255/all-new-dlc-armor-set-locations">armor</a> you’ll need to make the <em>Elden Ring</em> DLC slightly easier.</p>
