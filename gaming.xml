      </p></div><div><p>Berlin-based creative agency INSTINCT3 has announced the establishment of Sidekick Publishing, a full-service publisher for indie, A, and AA game studios. <span id="more-983809"></span></p><p>The publisher aims to “fill a gap in the competitive publishing landscape,” leveraging its global publishing expertise with INSTINCT3’s creator-led marketing and community building expertise.</p><p>The new venture is led by industry veterans Jasmin Oestreicher and Melvin Frank.</p><p>“After ten years in publishing and marketing and the past four years at our agency, serving as managing director since 2024, I know how valuable experience can be,” said INSTINCT3 CEO and Sidekick Publishing co-CEO and co-founder Jasmin Oestreicher in a press release. “But I also know how quickly you can lose touch if you rely too much on the past. Especially with a gaming audience that is highly sensitive to inauthentic or overly commercial content, what matters are bold ideas, local sensitivity, and creators who work for lasting impact, not just quick profit.”</p><p>Sidekick Publishing co-CEO and co-founder Melvin Frank added, “Over the past year, we’ve worked on a variety of releases—each one teaching us something new about what works, what connects, and what lasts for our concept. Sidekick is our way of taking all those lessons, combining them with our unique creator and community expertise, and raising the bar for how we support indie developers. The goals are simple: focus on games that resonate well with our approach and make every next launch our best one yet.”</p><p>The first game slated for release under the Sidekick Publishing brand will be 2.5D pixel zombie apocalypse <a title="Genres > Roguelike [352 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> <a title="Genres > Action [2,926 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> <em><a title="Games > Deadly Days: Roadtrip" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/deadly-days-roadtrip">Deadly Days: Roadtrip</a></em> from developer <a title="Companies > Pixelsplit [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/pixelsplit">Pixelsplit</a>, which is due out for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,886 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3026450/Deadly_Days_Roadtrip/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> hasn't been flush with new releases, I think it's fair to say, but Nintendo has offered up a nice lot of games in its Nintendo Classics games portal. The next GameCube game to arrive has been revealed, and it's the wonderful Chibi-Robo!</p>
<p>Classic GameCube games are an exclusive feature of the Nintendo Switch 2 and are only available to players who have the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. Chibi-Robo! joins a line-up that already includes the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a>, Super Mario Strikers, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chibi-Robo is a four-inch-tall robot who's arrived at the Sanderson house with the goal of helping the family get the most out of life and find happiness. Day or night, he'll help however he can, whether that's by cleaning or looking for lost items. In this chibi action-adventure title originally released for the Nintendo GameCube system in 2006, you'll aim for the top of the Chibi-Rankings by gathering Happy Points and Moolah (aka money)! It's rumored that Chibi-Robo will become Super Chibi-Robo if he reaches the top of the rankings...but between a daughter who only speaks in the language of frogs and toys that come alive when humans aren't around, Chibi-Robo has his work cut out for him in the mystery-packed Sanderson house!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with Chibi-Robo, Nintendo has released a trailer for the Nintendo Classic release which you can watch below.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/inzoi-coming-ps5-next-year-xbox-port-under-consideration/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inzoi-is-coming-to-ps5-next-year-xbox-port-under-consideration.1268739/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, inZOI Studio (an internal developer of Krafton) <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1955436672444928385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that their namesake game will be released <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Sony's PlayStation 5 console</a> in early 2026, while an Xbox port is still under consideration:</p>



<p><em>We‘re excited to announce that inZOI is scheduled to launch on PlayStation 5 (PS5) in 2026.</em> <em>Our team is working hard to bring you the best possible experience on PS5. (An Xbox release is also under consideration, but not yet confirmed.) The official release date and additional details will be shared at a later time.</em></p>



<p>inZOI is a life simulation game that debuted on Steam Early Access on March 28. It had a lot of hype going for it, as it proved when it <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became a million seller just one week after launch</a>.</p>



<p>However, recent user reviews on Steam are 'Mixed', with only 47% of the 618 reviews left in the last month giving it a thumbs up. Some fans believe that inZOI needs a lot more content and features before it can launch out of early access. </p>



<p>Given the projected early 2026 PS5 launch and the fact that early access games do not generally debut before version 1.0 on Sony's console, it's a fair assumption that the developers are sticking to their original one-year early access phase. The 1.0 release on PC and PS5 could therefore be internally scheduled for March 2026, though of course, the team should do well to heed the community's concerns and possibly delay the full launch if it serves the purpose of addressing their feedback and delivering a better final product.</p>



<p>In June, inZOI also <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-gets-official-modkit-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received an official Modkit update</a> that allows users to craft and share user-generated content (UGC) with a specific tool available for free via the Epic Games Store. It is unclear whether that will be available on PlayStation 5; consoles are usually more restrictive in this area.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 already boasts over 600,000 pre-order sales on Steam and has a whopping wishlist total of 2.7m, according to new data.</p>



<p>The EA title is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated games of the year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over half a million players</a> jumping in during the first Open Beta weekend. The Battlefield 6 Open Beta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/">return</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/"> this weekend</a> and could hit similar numbers, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new map and modes being added.</a></p>



<p>While Open Beta numbers don’t necessarily guarantee success, it appears the stars are aligning for EA with Battlefield 6 as the pre-order sales and wishlists on Steam suggest the community is ready to purchase.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-eye-watering-pre-order-data">Battlefield 6’s Eye-Watering Pre-Order Data</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Impressive. Image via Alinea Analytics</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to data from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a>, over 600,000 pre-orders have been placed for Battlefield 6 on Steam, while a whopping 2.7m players have added the title to their Steam wishlist.</p>



<p>The data adds that this translates to revenues of around $35m on Steam alone, with Battlefield 6 sitting at number two last week for revenues on Steam and number three for totalsales. Of course, this only equates to one platform, too.</p>



<p>Battlefield’s 6 impressive numbers have been rising for a while, however, taking just a few days to surge past the 500,000 wishlist mark when the game was added to Steam last month, including a staggering period from July 25 to 30 with between 95,000 and 150,000 players adding the game to their wishlists each day.</p>



<p>Those numbers put Battlefield 6 in sixth position in Steam’s top wishlisted games, behind only Hollow Knight: Silksong, Subnautica 2, Deadlock, Borderlands 4, Light No Fire, and ARC Raiders. </p>

            <p>Popular life sim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, already released on PC, has been confirmed for release on PlayStation 5 during the first half of 2026. While PS5 players keen for more life sim options are in luck, Xbox owners need to wait to see if the game will arrive on their consoles. Publisher Krafton has stated that an Xbox release of InZoi is "under consideration."</p>
<p>For console players worried about how InZoi will work outside of the PC space, Krafton has stated that the console version will be full-featured and be optimised for consoles. Given the game is some way from release we'll need to be patient to see if these claims are backed up.</p>
<p>InZoi raced to 1 million players on PC within one week of the game's release on Steam in March.</p>
<p>Aside from announcing plans to consider the game for Xbox, InZoi is also releasing on Mac on 20th August. On Mac players will need Apple silicon Macs with an M2 chip or newer and 16GB or more of unified memory.</p>
<p>We felt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">InZoi had potential</a> to be a big player in the life sim market when we played the game back at release, although it was far from the complete package.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grounded 2 has surged past the three million player mark just a few weeks into its early access lifespan, it has been revealed.</p>



<p>The Obsidian Games title, a sequel to the initial game that was fully released in September 2022, has capitalized on the popularity of the franchise to set impressive numbers.</p>



<p>Most impressive, however, is that this is still extremely early on in Grounded 2’s lifespan, with a full release not officially set and plenty to come in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grounded-2-roadmap-2025-2026-content-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a>, so the signs are certainly promising.</p>



<h2 id="h-grounded-2-s-impressive-numbers">Grounded 2’s Impressive Numbers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Promising signs. Credit to Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/aarongreenberg/status/1955458077597348194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Microsoft’s vice president of games marketing, Aaron Greenberg, revealed the latest numbers from Grounded 2, with over three million jumping in.</p>



<p>These numbers cover only those on Xbox Series X|S and PC, via Steam or the Xbox App, with Grounded 2 yet to be released on any other platforms, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grounded-2-coming-to-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-grounded-2-on-playstation-xbox-or-switch-all-grounded-2-platforms-consoles-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>



<p>That means there is still ample opportunity for further boosts to the Grounded 2 player base, especially when you factor in updates including new tools, rideable bugs, and bosses.</p>



<p>Grounded 2 has already massively surpassed the original title on Steam, with a concurrent record of just shy of 50,000 set after launch, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2661300/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. In comparison, the highest concurrent player peak for the initial title is just over 32,000, set in 2021.</p>



<p>All in all, it’s very encouraging signs for the future of Grounded 2 and the franchise overall, with plenty more surges expected in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, during its <a href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/pearlabyss/pearlabyss.php?c=pearlabyss&amp;y=2979" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q2 fiscal year 2025 presentation</a>, South Korean developer Pearl Abyss announced the delay of Crimson Desert. The upcoming action/adventure game was previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch in Q4 2025</a>, but it has been pushed back one quarter, as the Pearl Abyss CEO revealed:</p>



<p><em>Currently, Crimson Desert has been in the process of voice-overs while also carrying out tasks such as console certification in preparation for its release. In the case of marketing, we plan to participate in Gamescom and PAX West this August to showcase our open-world build. And in September, we will join the Tokyo Game Show to strengthen our marketing efforts in the Japanese market.</em></p>



<p><em>The launch of Crimson Desert, our first large-scale AAA console game, has been unavoidably delayed by one quarter, from the previously announced schedule. This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations. We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</em></p>



<p><em>The release date has been internally confirmed for Q1 2026. However, given the change in launch timing, we will announce the date at a more appropriate time based on business considerations, rather than making an announcement at Gamescom next week.</em></p>



<p>Unfortunate news for anyone looking to play Crimson Desert this year, to be sure, but no doubt the final version will benefit from a little bit more polish. Besides, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally meant to be launched as far back as Winter 2021</a>, but then the developers went back to the drawing board and reworked it considerably from the original MMO-like plan into a single player open world game. At this point, a few more months won't make that much of a change.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the executive's quote, Crimson Desert will also be <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-is-bringing-crimson-desert-back-to-gamescom-with-another-playable-demo-at-this-years-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable in a new build at Gamescom</a>, PAX West, and Tokyo Game Show. We will be there at Gamescom to check out this new version and report back, so stay tuned. As a reminder, the game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently confirmed that we’ll be seeing Resident Evil: Requiem gameplay during the Opening Night Live ceremony at Gamescom, set to take place on August 19. Even more recently, notable Resident Evil leaker ‘Dusk Golem’ took to social media to uncover a series of tidbits regarding the next major release in the legendary franchise.</p>



<p>In a series of posts, Dusk Golem claimed that new lighting and shadow engines have been implemented, the AI system is unique and intelligent, and some open-level areas in Raccoon City <strong>will require a vehicle to traverse them</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-to-feature-last-of-us-part-2-combat">Resident Evil: Requiem to Feature ‘Last of Us Part 2’ Combat</h2>



<p>Dusk Golem has been a goldmine for Resident Evil leaks, but it’s always worth prefacing this with the ‘take it with a pinch of salt’ recommendation. Everything is always subject to change.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955489759536771403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a series of posts</a> on social media, Dusk Golem revealed stacks about the upcoming Resident Evil: Requiem, all of which could be confirmed or refuted next week when gameplay is shown during Opening Night Live.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Right now officially they’ve talked about as you mentioned the ability to switch between first &amp; third person on the fly (&amp; basically designing two different games alongside each other to accomplish this as require big retooling to work with both), the new lighting/shadow engine, hair engine from Pragmata. </p>



<p>Additionally we know the stalker uses a new dynamic AI system they’ve done to behave uniquely &amp; intelligently on the fly. There’s few other innovations, some I know, but also sure I don’t know all of them. </p>



<p>A small handful I don’t mindsharing is they’ve been working hard to achieve having good performance <strong>on open-level designed areas like Raccoon City, along w/a vehicle to travel around it. The combat with Leon has seen huge innovations, honestly some Last of Us Part 2-isms</strong>, but also its own innovations.</p>



<p>There’s been effort to provide more environmental physic systems and interactivity for Grace’s segments where she has to work with the environment more, &amp; balance light &amp; darkness. And more I won’t say, &amp; sure more I don’t know. But they have a lot more to reveal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dusk Golem later shared an image of Alice from the Resident Evil movie series riding a motorcycle ‘without any context’, suggesting that we’ll be using a similar mode of transport in Resident Evil: Requiem.</p>



<p>Do these leaks gel with what you’re expecting from Resident Evil: Requiem? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It has been announced that Crimson Desert, the upcoming open-world action title from Pearl Abyss, has been pushed back to Q1 2026. This news was announced during a recent earnings call and accompanied by a clear explanation.</p>



<p>The team at Pearl Abyss emphasized that the plans to showcase Crimson Desert at Gamescom will remain unchanged. Next week, the game’s open-world build will be rendered playable at Gamescom for the first time, and in September, the same demo will be available to explore at the Tokyo Game Show.</p>



<h2 id="h-unavoidably-delayed">‘Unavoidably Delayed’</h2>



<p>Talking on the delay of Crimson Desert during a recent earnings conference call, the Pearl Abyss team said:</p>



<blockquote>

In the case of marketing, we plan to participate in Gamescom and PAX West this August to showcase our open-world build.

<p>It was then stated that Crimson Desert has been given an ‘internally confirmed’ release window of Q1 2026. There will be a follow-up announcement in due course, unveiling a firmer launch date. It was stressed that Crimson Desert’s release date <strong>will not </strong>be revealed at Gamescom.</p>

<p>It's tagged as <a href="https://x.com/The_Zelda_Movie">@The_Zelda_Movie</a> and in the bio mentions how the film is coming "exclusively to theatres in 2027". This follows the previous confirmation that the film would arrive on <strong>7th May 2027</strong>.</p>
<p>Notably, this account, which originally joined the platform in November 2023, has been verified as an affiliate of Sony Pictures (which is already following it back). This new page is also following the official PlayStation account. As you might recall, Sony is co-financing this project.</p>
<p>Apart from this, there have been no official news updates from the account just yet, but the page has reposted multiple stories about the cast announcements. While it's not following any Nintendo accounts just yet, it has reposted <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1945433161124688335">Miyamoto's recent update from the Nintendo account</a> about the actors.</p>

<p>As you can see, the social account page also has a simple banner with the title 'The Legend of Zelda' in the middle.</p>
<p>Again, this follows on from the actor reveals last month – confirming Bo Bragason as Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. You can find out more about this movie in our full guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>

They follow on from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/double-dragon-gaiden-doubles-the-fun-with-a-free-dlc-update-on-switch">Jeff and Abore</a> earlier this year in April. Here's the official rundown about each fighter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Evil Marian</strong> - Once a trusted ally, Marian is now under the grip of an unknown, malevolent force. Cold and distant, she floats above the ground, lashing out with psychic blasts and violent telekinesis. Her eyes are vacant, her voice devoid of emotion—something ancient has taken hold of her...and it’s not letting go.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Super Anubis</strong> - For years, whispers claimed Anubis was a fraud, a cult figure with no true power. But now, Super Anubis has emerged: levitating, glowing, and summoning dark forces beyond comprehension. The question lingers—was he a fake all along...or a prophet finally revealed?</p>

<p>As part of this release, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is currently on sale on Switch and Steam for 65% off. Since its original release in July 2023, this title has also received multiple other game updates, boosting the character roster and adding online play.</p>

<figure><a title="Grand Theft Auto Trilogy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8fa8bdfdd1f85/grand-theft-auto-trilogy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Rockstar Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/game-key-cards-dont-sit-right-with-us-lost-in-cult-dives-into-its-new-physical-games-line">arrival of Game-Key Cards</a> on the Switch 2, there has been ongoing discussion about the future of third-party physical releases. Even during the Switch generation, certain hard copy releases didn't always live up to expectations, opting to include a download code instead of the actual game.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/story-of-seasons-publisher-says-physical-switch-2-releases-are-the-right-decision-for-us">some more welcome stories</a>, and with this in mind, <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/51707-gta-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-sees-physical-release-with-no-download-required">there are reports today</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/grand_theft_auto_the_trilogy_-_the_definitive_edition">Grand Theft Auto: Trilogy</a> is now available as a proper physical release on the original Switch platform after all this time.</p>
<p>This information comes via an Amazon listing for North America, with the box art no longer including a small banner mentioning download requirements. According to the same page, the release of this version was last month, and the page for the Switch release requiring a download is still live (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/gta-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-release/">thanks for the heads up, Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>You can see the 'before' and 'after' shots in the social post below, which asks who will "take one for the team" and find out if this is actually the real deal by ordering a copy. Notably, it's also cheaper than the existing version that requires a download.</p>

<p>Although this is just a single listing, it's already got quite a lot of attention from Switch owners who have wanted a physical version with no downloads required to play. If it is accurate, hopefully, it comes with the more recent updates <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/rockstar-games-announces-acquisition-of-dev-behind-gta-trilogy-upgrades">by the developer 'Video Games Deluxe'</a>, who took over from the 'Grove Street Games' port team.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:178939,123546 @ 1755076138 -->
<p>If we hear any updates about this new listing for the GTA Trilogy or see it pop up in more locations, we'll let you know. Would you be interested in a proper physical release of this collection on Switch? <em>Tell us in the comments.</em></p></section>

<p>Chibi-Robo returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced it will be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> to the Switch 2's GameCube library next week on <strong>21st August, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This title was one of the many games confirmed alongside the reveal of the GameCube library for the Switch Online service. It originally made its debut on the GameCube in 2005/06 and was developed by the team at Skip.</p>
<p>Here's some official PR about what to expect from this title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The little robot who wants to bring happiness to all!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Chibi-Robo is a four-inch-tall robot who's arrived at the Sanderson house with the goal of helping the family get the most out of life and find happiness. Day or night, he'll help however he can, whether that's by cleaning or looking for lost items. In this chibi action-adventure title originally released for the Nintendo GameCube™ system in 2006, you'll aim for the top of the Chibi-Rankings by gathering Happy Points and Moolah (aka money)! It's rumored that Chibi-Robo will become Super Chibi-Robo if he reaches the top of the rankings...but between a daughter who only speaks in the language of frogs and toys that come alive when humans aren't around, Chibi-Robo has his work cut out for him in the mystery-packed Sanderson house!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To play Chibi-Robo on Switch 2, you'll need to have an active subscription to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service.</p>
<p>Some of the other GameCube titles confirmed for the Switch Online's GameCube service include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>. This next update follows on from last month's release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a>.</p>

                <p>More than three years after its original launch on Nintendo Switch, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition has been rereleased. Notably, the MSRP for the new physical edition is $30, half the price of the original and the digital version on the eShop. Collectors will be even more pleased by Rockstar's decision to put all three games on the Switch game card this time.

At this time, Amazon has a broad delivery estimate of one to two months, but this will likely change. Amazon is typically conservative with these estimates, and the current window probably stems from not having any units on hand just yet.</p><p>Retailers, including Amazon, still have the old edition on their storefronts, so make sure you buy the right version. The old edition has a text box next to the ESRB rating that reads "Download required. See back." The new edition drops that disclaimer, as it no longer requires an additional download from the eShop.</p><p>The original physical version only included two of the games on the game card, forcing players to download Vice City from the eShop. With Vice City and updates for each game, Switch players typically needed to download close to 10GB of data from the eShop.</p><p>We can't think of another situation quite like this one for a Nintendo Switch release, especially when you consider the new, better physical edition also happens to be half the price of the old one.</p></div>                      </div><p>GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition includes three classic Grand Theft Auto games from the PlayStation 2 era: GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. The collection had some major performance and visual issues at launch, and many of those problems remained unfixed until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-gets-long-overdue-console-patch/1100-6527714/" data-ref-id="1100-6527714">Rockstar overhauled the experience on consoles</a> last fall. It's by no means perfect for any console, but it is in a substantially better state than it was at launch.</p><p>It's unclear if the price of the digital edition will receive a permanent price drop to $30 on Nintendo Switch. At this time, it's one of the rare Switch games with a higher MSRP on the eShop than the physical edition.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-nintendo-switch-games-hit-all-time-low-prices-at-walmart/1100-6533821/">Mario Nintendo Switch Games Hit All-Time Low Prices At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-dark-ages-limited-edition-xbox-wireless-controller-gets-massive-discount/1100-6533850/">Doom Limited Edition Xbox Controller Gets Massive Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-0-directors-cut-for-switch-2-is-discounted-for-the-first-time/1100-6531083/">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut For Switch 2 Is Discounted For The First Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crkd-gibson-les-paul-wireless-guitar-controllers-consoles-and-pc-buying-guide/1100-6529788/">CRKD's Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controllers Are Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rebuild-of-evangelion-blu-ray-editions-neon-genesis-evangelion-complete-series/1100-6533665/">Two Rebuild Of Evangelion Movies Are Finally Returning To Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-star-wars-3-in-1-clone-wars-mandalorian-adventure-gift-set-walmart-2025/1100-6533571/">New Lego Star Wars Gift Bundle In Stock At Walmart - 3 Sets For $45</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-minecraft-5-in-1-world-explorer-walmart-gift-set-2025/1100-6533572/">Lego Minecraft 5-In-1 Gift Set Up For Grabs For $45 Exclusively At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-deals-limited-edition-restock-guide/1100-6526172/">Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma For Switch 2 Gets First Discount</a></li>   </ul> </div>

And in September, we will join the Tokyo Game Show to strengthen our marketing efforts in the Japanese market.</p><p>“The launch of <em>Crimson Desert</em>, our first large-scale AAA console game, has been unavoidably delayed by one quarter, from the previously announced schedule. This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations. We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</p><p>“The release date has been internally confirmed for Q1 2026. However, given the change in launch timing, we will announce the date at a more appropriate time based on business considerations, rather than making an announcement at Gamescom next week. We are grateful for your continued interest in our company, and we will do our utmost to deliver an even better experience going forward.”</p><p><em>Crimson Desert</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,088 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,669 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,886 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/CRIMSON_DESERT/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Some of the developers who worked on (and are still working on)<a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-no-animal-killing-zoo-1851781328"><em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> hopped into a Reddit AMA to answer fan questions about Ubisoft’s latest entry in its stabby historical fiction franchise. Not all of the questions and answers were revealing, but buried in the AMA were some interesting pieces of information about the lore of <em>Assassin’s Creed,</em> upcoming games in the series, more updates coming for <em>Shadows</em>, and a confirmation on some features that <em>won’t</em> be added in future updates.</p> <p>Here are 10(ish) things we learned about<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/hi_were_simon_andr%C3%A9_and_luc_developers_on/">August 12 AMA on the Assassin’s Creed subreddit</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The war between Assassins and Templars will continue</strong></h2> <p>When a fan asked if players can expect more content about the franchise’s classic conflict between Assassins and Templars, <em>AC Shadows</em> level design director Luc had this to say:</p> <blockquote><p>“The Assassins vs. Templars conflict has always been a core pillar of <em>Assassin’s Creed.</em> With <em>Shadows</em>, we wanted to properly set our protagonist in the setting before expanding on the Assassins vs. Templars. Now that it’s done on the main game, we scratched the surface with <a href="https://youtu.be/FUrqLJdXO7E?si=u7RxcL6GmFSvoomX">the <em>Critical Role</em> story drop</a>, and you can expect more deep dive in this conflict in the near future.”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>Why Ubisoft Didn’t Include The Modern-Day Storyline</strong></h2> <p>Another user asked where Basim was and if his modern-day storyline, which began in <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>, will ever return or if Ubisoft had moved on. Once again, Luc replied to this question and explained why it was missing and teased more to come in the future:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“We have complex new characters that were introduced in <em>Shadows</em> that we didn’t feel there would have been enough spotlight for Basim as well. With <em>AC Shadows</em> we are putting in place the first stone of new means to deliver the Modern Day story line with the Animus HUB. That is not the end of it, and we are listening to your feedback. While Modern Day is not the main focus of the story we tell with <em>Shadows</em>, it remains important for our community, so you can expect it to be expanded at some point, in some fashion…”</p></blockquote> <h2><b>The Team Isn’t Retconning<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> Lore</b></h2> <p>A seeming expert in<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> lore asked a bunch of long questions about the franchise’s universe and how they were worried that parts of it from older games, such as Isu artifacts, were being ignored or even retconned completely. Again, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/comment/n8bab6m/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Luc swooped in to provide an extended answer you can read here,</a> but this bit is his confirmation that the team isn’t erasing <em>AC</em> lore; they just aren’t always including it in games unless it makes sense.</p> <blockquote><p>“The <em>AC</em> lore is very complex and keeps expanding as we are creating new games. We are not retconning what we have done in the past, but we do not necessarily mention everything in every game if it doesn’t directly support the narrative we are building. In our timeline Japan wasn’t unified yet, and not mentioning Shao Jun and her apprentice doesn’t mean that they couldn’t have co-existed.</p> <p>“Similar to this, the fact that there is no Isu artifact in the main game of <em>Shadows</em> doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist in the world of <em>Shadows</em>; it just wasn’t a story device that we needed for the story we wanted to tell.”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>More Story Updates Will Be Added To <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></strong></h2> <p>One last answer about <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> and its narrative. This time, someone asked about whether any new story updates or additional expansions will be forthcoming. Simon, associate game director on <em>Shadows</em>, replied:</p> <blockquote><p>“We are hard at work [on] more free story drops that will come in the future – nothing we can announce yet though! We’ll let you sink your teeth into the<em> Claws of Awaji</em> [expansion] first, and you tell us if you want more!”</p></blockquote> <figure id="attachment_2000001632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001632"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001632">Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>Making Yasuke Or Naoe Your In-Game Companion</strong></h2> <p>One really interesting question that resulted in an equally interesting response was about Ubisoft adding a feature to <em>Shadows</em> that would let players call the other main character as a companion.<em> AC Shadows</em> live producer André said that the feature would be “cool” but admitted that its unlikely to happen because it would involve a lot of work.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“That would be a cool feature for sure!! We would love to do this also but at the moment it is not in development but I can tell you we have discussed about this internally but a lot of technicalities as to be overcome so we can’t deliver such a feature.”</p> <p>“For example, the quality of our main character is so high we would need to spawn them in a much lower quality to not explode the memory. Another element would be to develop an AI for them that is fitting with our balancing. No technical problems can’t be overcome, but it would require a lot of effort. More than we are willing to spend on this feature without compromising every other features our players are waiting for. In short, it is not planned at the moment. If it changes, we will let you know.”</p></blockquote> <h2><b>Changing Seasons From <em>Shadows</em> Will Likely Show Up In Future <em>AC</em> Games</b></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">One of the coolest parts of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> is how, over time, the seasons change across the map. This affects not only the look of the world, but also how you explore it. For example, it can make rivers freeze up and offer new paths to the player. It’s a nifty feature, and when asked if it will be included in future <em>AC</em> games, André implied that the tech will be shared with other Ubisoft teams and that he wouldn’t be surprised to see seasons in a future installment.</p> <blockquote><p>“I’m super happy to see you enjoyed that improvement in our world-building. We can’t promise anything for the future <em>Assassin’s Creed,</em> but what I can tell you is that our development team is sharing the tech and knowledge for future installments, so they can decide if they want to integrate the dynamic seasons. Developing those seasons required a lot of effort to put together, so every game will need decide if it’s important enough to invest all the time needed to deliver it compared to other features. I can tell you that internally everyone finds it amazing, also, so I would not be surprised to see it again in the future!”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>Social Stealth Could Return In The Franchise</strong></h2> <p>Speaking of features that could return, someone asked why social stealth was missing from <em>Shadows</em> after playing such a big role in <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">2023’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a>. And Ubisoft confirmed that hiding in crowds and on benches is still a part of the series.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“For <em>Shadows</em>, our stealth team chose to put 100% of their energy on the moment-to-moment tactical shinobi experience, which left no space for Social Stealth… That does not mean that Social Stealth is gone from the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise, though!”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong><em>Mirage’s</em> Parkour Helped Improve Naoe’s Moves In <em>Shadows</em></strong></h2> <p>When a player asked if <em>Mirage</em> had an impact on <em>Shadows</em>, specifically the game’s parkour, André admitted that due to how buildings are built in Japan and the team’s desire to keep the action grounded, they rebuilt parkour and didn’t reuse <em>Mirage</em> star Basim’s move set. That said, the parkour in <em>Mirage</em> did affect the post-launch updates that improved and expanded Naoe’s move set. Here’s part of André’s answer:</p> <blockquote><p>“The <em>Mirage</em> team’s dedication to parkour is what inspired us to do more post-launch parkour updates, and we use a lot of their work as stepping stones for Naoe’s improvements in post-launch and to involve some experts from the community in those discussions.”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>No Discovery mode coming&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Some bad news: There won’t be a non-combat-focused educational mode added to <em>Shadows</em> as we have seen in past games like <em>Valhalla</em> and <em>Origins</em>. With André delivering the disappointing news bluntly: “But to get to the core of your question, we do not currently have a ‘Japan Discovery Tour’ like we had for ‘Viking Age’ in the works.”</p> <h2><strong>Also, No New Hair Options Are Being Added In Any Updates</strong></h2> <p>And some more bad news: Ubisoft doesn’t plan on adding new hair customization options for either of the main characters in <em>Shadows</em>. Here’s André’s transparent answer to someone asking about more hair choices:</p> <blockquote><p>“We will not add more different type of hair for our character because, to be blunt, it is extremely costly. The complexity is to have the physic works appropriately in all scenarios we have.”</p></blockquote>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Dropout.TV is becoming a surprisingly big name in the streaming world as an inexpensive service that <a href="https://variety.com/2023/streaming/news/dropout-subscribers-double-new-shows-sam-reich-1235829675/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">puts its fans and employees</a> above maxing out profits. Game Changers is already an ambitious show, but now host and Dropout CEO Sam Reich is thinking about what it would mean to bring Dropout into the world of video games, according to an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-video-game-sam-reich-interview-dimension-20-2000616708" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcPXAf_a4e8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OcPXAf_a4e8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Reich told Kotaku that if Dropout did release a game, it would be based on either Game Changers or Dimension 20, the service's successful tabletop roleplaying series (which played a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dungeons-and-dragons-dimension-20-madison-square-garden-1235258992/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold-out show at Madison Square Garden</a> earlier this year).</p><p>"I think that we would be into that, and we've talked about it," Reich said. "At this point, it's honestly, more than anything else, just a bandwidth issue...If we're going to do it, we want it to feel like us."</p><p>Part of that means direct involvement from Dropout and the Game Changer team.</p><p>"We're not going to farm the IP out to some third party," Reich said. "We want it to feel personal. And it needs to be something, therefore, that we're excited enough about and feels differentiated enough from what's out there that it feels worth our time."</p><p>Game Changer is, technically, a game show of sorts, but you won't see random people off the street competing. Instead, Game Changer features a rotating cast of comedians and performers doing a sort of competitive improv game. Each episode is different than the last; episodes begin with host Reich pretending to assume that players know how the game is played, and the players emphatically disagreeing. The show has become increasingly ambitious (and sometimes quite manipulative), and just completed its seventh season. Some more straightforward episode concepts have included players competing for second place, forcing the players to look for increasingly well-hidden buzzers, and having comedians known for crowd work compete to see who does the best crowd work with a crowd hand-picked for the occasion.</p><p>Meanwhile, some of the most ambitious episodes have included an episode that gave players a year to accomplish a number of tasks, a "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" spoof that ended with a fan-favorite player taking home $100,000, and an episode where people competed to make the most viral video to advertise Dropout.TV. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oO4kgmYivoQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one such video</a> featured Dimension 20 DM Brennan Lee Mulligan pretending to announce his departure from Dropout.TV to make shoes for American Girl Dolls).</p><p>It's not hard to imagine a Jackbox-style game for Game Changer, where players are asked to perform improv tasks and be judged by their friends and family. Dimension 20, meanwhile, could be a simple RPG or a huge AAA-style RPG based off of one of the Dimension 20 hosts' concepts.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unionized-workers-at-arkane-a-microsoft-owned-studio-demand-that-microsoft-divest-from-israel%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98sinister-project-for-gaza%E2%80%99.1268496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added Microsoft to its list of priority targets</a> due to the company’s entanglement with the Israeli military via Azure cloud and AI services. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A recent Guardian report</a> revealed the grisly details of said arrangement, claiming that Microsoft’s “cloud-based storage platform has facilitated the preparation of deadly airstrikes and has shaped military operations in Gaza and the West Bank.” Now game developers at Microsoft-owned studio Arkane, creator of <em>Dishonored </em>and <em>Deathloop</em>, have lent their voices to the chorus demanding that the company stop powering Israel’s assault.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/08/open-letter-from-the-arkan-studios-union-section-to-microsofts-and-its-subsidiaries-management/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an open letter</a> to leadership at Arkane, Zenimax, Microsoft Gaming, and Microsoft more broadly, workers unionized under French union STJV did not mince words about Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians, lending their support to BDS and the Microsoft-worker-led <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No Azure For Apartheid campaign</a>.</p><p>“Arkane Studios’ STJV section joins BDS and the No Azure for Apartheid in their demands for Microsoft to stop supporting the Israeli regime,” Arkane workers wrote. “We think that Microsoft has no place being accomplice of a genocide, and as Microsoft employees, we don’t want to be part of this sinister project for Gaza. Moreover, we think it’s our responsibility, as tech workers, to raise the alarm, and to ensure that our technologies are used to make the voices of the oppressed heard, and not facilitate their demise. Finally, in a more direct manner, we think this could very well affect our life directly, by reducing the audience for our games, thus directly compromising the viability of Xbox Games, and, in the long run, our very own jobs.”</p><p>The letter includes a list of specific demands, which echo those of No Azure For Apartheid: an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, termination of all ongoing or future contracts with Israeli occupation forces, disclosure of all ties to the Israeli military, protection of pro-Palestinian speech within the company, and “a transparent, independent and public audit of Microsoft technologies, contracts, services and investments to make sure they are not used to violate the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, and Microsoft’s own Human Rights Statement, in Palestine or anywhere else.”</p><p>Ultimately, Arkane workers believe that Microsoft should put its money where its mouth is.</p><p>"Microsoft has a responsibility toward its employees, as we have one toward the company,” Arkane workers wrote. “As stated in the company’s commitment to human rights, and regularly used in the company talk points, ‘Microsoft is committed to protecting fundamental rights.’ But so far, Microsoft has failed both its teams [and] its customers by being actively complicit of the invasion and war crimes happening in Gaza. If those core values are more [than] just talking points to sell more products, it is now more than due time for Microsoft to commit to them."</p><p>Of course, this is just an open letter. As it stands, nothing here is compelling Microsoft to turn over a new leaf that even comes close to matching the intoxicating aroma of ill-gotten cash. But these things have a way of snowballing. When Badru, the creator of open-world tactics RPG <em>Tenderfoot Tactics</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed his game from Xbox in solidarity with BDS</a> earlier this year, he told Aftermath: “Whether we're able to make Microsoft change or not directly, part of the point of targeting them is to be able to advocate around this and show these connections. Otherwise, nobody's interested in Azure Cloud. Nobody wants to talk about whatever Microsoft's bullshit AI is doing. These boycotts create opportunities for us to shine a light.”</p><p>Now news organizations <a href="https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are investigating</a> <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%92%D7%A8-%D7%A9%D7%9C-8200-%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Cloud</a>, and mainstream coverage is shifting more and more to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/world/middleeast/gaza-starvation-aid-israel-netanyahu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critique and decry Israel’s actions</a>, especially its long-term starvation of Gazans. Meanwhile, international sentiment continues to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-says-no-starvation-gaza-amid-backlash-rcna224129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn against Israel</a>. A letter like this both arises from and contributes to that slow cooker of pressure, as do possible future actions like work stoppages or strikes, which STJV-affiliated game workers have <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/02/struggle-pays-a-deal-was-found-at-dont-nod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employed before</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/paypal-only-processing-steam-purchases-eur-cad-gbp-jpy-aud-usd/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/paypal-is-only-processing-steam-purchases-in-eur-cad-gbp-jpy-aud-and-usd.1268490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An image has appeared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mnzovo/steam_paypal_unavailable_update/">Reddit</a> that includes a statement explaining that PayPal is no longer processing Steam purchases in currencies other than the following six: Euros, Canadian Dollars, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollars, or United States Dollars.</p>



<p>The image shows an answer from Steam Support as to why using PayPal in the user's current currency (which is presumably not one of the above six) is unavailable. "<em>In early July 2025</em>," the statement reads, "<em>PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam. This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD, and USD.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future,</em>" the statement continues, "<em>but the timeline is uncertain. We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this</em>." The statement then concludes by suggesting the user try a different payment method, including adding funds to their Steam wallet.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is the first official statement from Valve on the issue, though players have been complaining about the problems on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/595154293314559955/">Steam forums since early July</a>, which lines up with the timeline shared by Valve. One user who commented on the forum linked above claims to have made a purchase on Steam through PayPal, not in one of the aforementioned six currencies just three days prior to July 12, 2025. So we at least have some idea as to when this began.</p>



<p>It's unclear as to why PayPal's acquiring banks are blocking any purchases on Valve's platform not in one of six currencies, but the timeline of everything has many speculating that it has something to do with the current issues around <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-prohibiting-content-violetes-banks-rules/">payment processors seemingly putting pressure on Valve to remove certain kinds of games from its platform</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond the timing, there's no concrete connection between PayPal's affiliated banks no longer processing purchases on Steam due to the campaign to have certain kinds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ukie-says-payment-processors-should-have-confidence-in-age-rating-systems/">adult and NSFW content removed from videogame platforms like Steam and Itch.io</a>. </p>
