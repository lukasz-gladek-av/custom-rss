            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Monomi Park has returned to its slime-tastic origins, more than nine years after the Early Access launch of <em>Slime Rancher</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">with its much-anticipated follow-up, <em>Slime Rancher 2</em></a>. The game's developer first released <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-sales-hit-100k-in-under-6-hours" rel="nofollow">through Early Access in 2022</a>, and after three years, it bid farewell as it finally slime dunked its way onto consoles and PCs.</p>

<p><em>Slime Rancher 2</em> sets out to continue the epic adventures of rancher and protagonist, Beatrix "Bea" LeBeau, but this time around, in a brand new location, the Rainbow Island. This new location is filled to the brim with new slimes to care for, mysteries to uncover, and areas to explore as <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> aims to deliver a bigger, slime-filled adventure, something the developer has long sought to provide since the original game's release.</p>

<h2>A Brave New Slime-tastic World</h2>

<p>This much-anticipated sequel to the 2016 farming sim game from indie studio Monomi Park continues the story as our protagonist, Beatrix "Bea" LeBeau, heads off to Rainbow Island for a brand new adventure and more slimes to wrangle! While the journey that brought her to this new location is somewhat cloaked in mystery, equally intriguing are the secrets that Bea will uncover during her stay on Rainbow Island.</p>

Now, ready in its final jiggly form, players can finally pick up the story of Bea as she sets off to unknown territory with a new adventure awaiting her on Rainbow Island!</p>

<p>Much of what many loved about <em>Slime Rancher</em> is present in its sequel, like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/slime-rancher-2-preview" rel="nofollow">gameplay loop of wrangling new squishing slimes</a>, farming Plorts, exchanging them for currency, and upgrading Bea's tech to explore the island further. By the way, there are a few new slimes, features, and plenty more for new and returning players to wrangle with when jumping into <em>Slime Rancher 2</em>.</p>

<h2>It's Plortin' Time!</h2>

<p>Let's be honest: one has never played <em>Slime Rancher</em>, and to one's shock and horror, it's really a good thing we got to experience this game through its sequel. In this open-world simulation sequel, Bea boards a mysterious boat that crosses the Slime Sea, escorting her to Rainbow Island, where not only will she encounter new and returning slimes and unique resources to collect, but also discover ancient technology that she can learn and use to navigate her new surroundings.</p>

<p>From the get-go, players are given the option to turn on or off a few gameplay settings to make their time and experiences on Rainbow Island smoother. The biggest gameplay option is regarding the Tarr and Feral Slimes spawning on the island, as these slimes are incredibly hostile and can be a nuisance to deal with when exploring, so for a more cozy gameplay experience, turning them off would be wise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-561.jpg?itok=hP0G99oI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-561.jpg?itok=_jCwiVJd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>I wonder what's behind this Cotton Gordo?&nbsp;(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Each new area on the Rainbow Island is mostly easy to access, with exceptions for the Powderfall Bluffs and the Grey Labyrinth, which have specific requirements needed to unlock. It's possible for players to unlock them quite easily; however, unlocking the Grey Labyrinth will require players to acquire a particular gadget from a friend and solve some puzzles before this area opens its doors to Bea.</p>

<p>Upon arriving on Rainbow Island, Bea will gain a new home, the Conservatory, the sequel's counterpart to the Ranch from the first game, which serves as the central hub, boasting various facilities to use to earn a living as a Rancher. While the game doesn't adequately explain how players can use these facilities, the Fabricator and the Refinery being such examples, it took until reaching Day 43 to figure out how to use them both.</p>

<p>The Refinery functions as a deposit for various resources like Plorts and other valuable items before they can be used for crafting gadgets via the Fabricator, the latter allowing Bea to craft using blueprints before she can equip and use them. Our picks for gadgets to prioritize first are the Resource Harvester, Jetpack, and the Tank Booster, which the harvester lets Bea acquire items from nodes found throughout the island, the Jetpack for easier traversal, and the Tank Booster to carry and store more resources in inventory slots.</p>

<p>Exploration in <em>Slime Rancher 2 </em>is your best friend, and understanding each area and its biome, and detailing what resources can be acquired, will go a long way. It's worth stating that for each day spent on Rainbow Island, collect as many resources as possible, especially if Bea can't place them in the Garden to grow, as Bea may need them to feed various Plorts, like the Cuberries for the Phosphor Slime.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-549.jpg?itok=9P9539-H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-549.jpg?itok=aLrYLnIF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pay attention to every slime's favorite food, like Phosphor Slime&nbsp;loves Cubberies.&nbsp;<em>(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Your gadgets are equally important, too, especially the Jetpack, which allows Bea to cover greater distances and find items that are harder to reach by jumping higher and gliding for a brief time. The Jetpack will be a great gadget for exploration, but a drive must be found first, and then its upgrade must be purchased before crafting it at the Fabricator with the required resources and spending Newbucks.</p>

<p>The game's UI design is simple, clean, and very legible, which is pleasing to the eye, especially since every game element, such as the inventory slots, in-game prompts, and the Health and Energy meters, is clearly identifiable. Additionally, all items held in the inventory slots are clearly and largely displayed, which is a significant UI improvement and indeed user-friendly.</p>

<h2>Slimed Out!</h2>

<p>With massive improvements and overhauls to the game's visuals and UI designs, a fun and cozy gameplay loop, and a new location to explore to one's content, some game aspects do hold the game back from being a great sequel. While not having played the original game and putting in the work and hours wrangling slimes and establishing the Ranch, the overall story is less compelling to follow along.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-598.jpg?itok=ZEFgGnm5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-598.jpg?itok=AvrEKZYl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Beatrix's friends from the first Slime rancher game will leave messages for her which are accessed via the&nbsp;Comm Station in the Conservatory.&nbsp;(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>It does heavily rely on various NPCs that Bea established connections with from the first game, and communication with these characters is limited to video call messages. Their messages don't contribute much to the ongoing story, but equally disappointing is that these characters' stories don't progress or expand in the sequel, and at times, their appearance can be nonsensical or overbearing, but we love the gifts they share with Bea.</p>

<p>Staying with familiar NPCs that Bea reconnects with in the sequel, the game doesn't introduce new characters for her to meet that could contribute something meaningful to her journey and exploration on Rainbow Island. This excludes the new Research Drones that provide Bea with new lore for the new location that Bea can find in most areas, excluding the Grey Labyrinth and the Slime Sea, but even so, it takes a while for the lore drops to be paid off.</p>

<p>While the game's story isn't heavily emphasized, the exploration is, as there's so much of the world that can be explored, and it doesn't need every gadget to advance to the next area. However, while unlocking these new areas is gated by Gordo Slimes that Bea must feed to unblock the passages, it's reaching the endgame areas that are restricted by specific requirements, and farming for these materials can be pretty time-consuming and frustrating.</p>

<p>This can take up much of players' time locating the resources required and crafting specific gadgets to progress, before finding the hidden gates to solve the door's puzzles. Grinding for these resources makes <em>Slime Rancher 2's</em> endgame feel tedious and less thrilling, especially for those wanting to reach the game's end and to see the big story/lore payoff, but for others who enjoy the exploration and ranching more, this won't be a major concern, as there's plenty of content to enjoy until reaching those final moments.</p>

<h2><em>Slime Rancher 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-630.jpg?itok=yJqBGH4w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slimerancher-2-screenshot-630.jpg?itok=3fq766fL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The game's developer made significant improvements to Slime Rancher 2 such as the game's visuals which makes exploring in the day and night incredibly vibrant.&nbsp;(Picture:&nbsp;Monomi Park / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Developer Monomi Park had the blueprint to build <em>Slime Rancher's</em> sequel, leaving room to create new, innovative features and content that would expand on what they had first achieved with the original game. They didn't need to change much of the formula, like the gameplay loop, as many of the improvements saw massive overhauls to its visuals, as the environments feel more lush and vibrant, and the textures are exquisitely clean, especially with more biome varieties present in <em>Slime Rancher 2</em>.</p>

<p>All in all, what the developer set out to achieve with <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> should be widely praised for, as the vast changes to the game's visuals are absolutely stunning and vibrant, from the vistas to the wiggly slimes we encounter. The improvements to the UI are greatly appreciated, and the diversity of biomes and areas makes exploration extremely rewarding and exciting, as no two areas feel or look the same, even if the gameplay loop can be repetitive for players.</p>

<p>Where the game lacks is the opportunity to flesh out further or expand the story, leaving much to be desired. Sure, we have some of our returning companions to aid Bea during her adventures on Rainbow Island, but at times, they add or offer so little that it makes their presence feel more like fan service than one of substance, and their interactions something that can be avoided when there's so much of the world and gameplay content more worthwhile to explore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">So many models in so many different games.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently held a fan-voted tournament to determine the greatest racing game of all time. There were a total of 32 entries split across four categories: Arcade Racing, Simulation, Street Racing, and Wild Card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Mario Kart 8 Deluxe ultimately won the fan vote and was crowned champion, it isn’t exactly known for its realism. Several other entries in the tournament give you the chance to drive cars based on real-life counterparts, including a wide variety of different Toyota models.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Toyota brand has been around for almost 90 years and competes in several different racing series, meaning there are lots of different models that can be included in racing games. And some games make very good use of that. Here are five standout titles that were popular in our fan-voted tournament and also put you in the driver’s seat of Toyota cars.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza Horizon 5 has the rare distinction of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-review"><u>getting a 10 from IGN</u></a>, and it finished as the runner-up in our fan-voted tournament, so we think it’s safe to call this one of the best racing games ever made. One of its many strengths is the dizzying number of cars in its roster. It had more than 500 vehicles at launch, and DLCs and seasonal additions have brought that number to more than 900 in the nearly four years since it released. That includes 32 different models of Toyota, ranging from classic sports cars like the 1974 Celica GT to pickup trucks like the 2020 Tundra TRD Pro to rally cars like the 2021 GR Yaris to modern sports cars like the 2022 GR86.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Gran Turismo 7</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gran Turismo 7 won the Simulation region of our tournament and made it to the Final Four before being ousted by Forza Horizon 5. It was a very close battle between the two, so this is clearly a beloved title. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gran-turismo-7-review"><u>IGN gave it a 9</u></a>, so we’re big fans too. Like the game that defeated it, GT7 also sports an incredible number of different cars. It had 424 cars at launch and has since brought that number to more than 500, which includes 41 Toyota models. In addition to the kinds of sports cars, rally cars, and pickups that are present in Forza Horizon 5, there are also LMP1 cars like the TS030 Hybrid ’12 and TS050 Hybrid ’16, as well as concept cars like the FT-1 and FT-1 VGT.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Forza Motorsport 4</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza Motorsport 4 might be 14 years old, but it still holds up as an outstanding racing game and celebration of all things four-wheeled. It had a tough draw in our tournament, dominating its first-round matchup before having to go up against the juggernaut that is Gran Turismo 7 in the second round. IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/10/06/forza-motorsport-4-review"><u>gave Forza Motorsport 4 a 9.5</u></a>, and like the two games that preceded it on this list, its vast selection of cars was a big reason why. That included 19 different models of Toyotas, highlighted by the S class 2002 Top Secret 0-300 Supra, one of the most powerful Unicorn cars in the game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Project Gotham Racing 2</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Gotham Racing 2 might not have catapulted into mainstream popularity like the previous games on this list, but IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/18/project-gotham-racing-2-2"><u>gave it a 9.5</u></a> and it holds a special place in our hearts, largely because of its focus on style in addition to speed. You earn Kudos points for doing things like powersliding, catching air, driving clean races, and drafting behind opponents. And many goals require that you finish with a certain number of Kudos points, meaning you have to balance driving fast with driving pretty, providing a gameplay experience that separates it from other racing games. That sense of style extended to the cars themselves, too. There were three Toyota models in the game, and they’re all classics: the 1967 2000GT, MR2 Spider, and 1996 Supra.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In what some might have considered a surprise, Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix made it to the quarterfinals of our tournament and put up a solid fight against Forza Horizon 5. This is the updated version of Rockstar’s third game in the series, which added new vehicles, songs, races, maps, updated UI, and brought back Tokyo from Midnight Club 2. It was a marked improvement over said predecessor, and while it was never the fastest or prettiest game around, it more than made up for that with depth and variety. IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/14/midnight-club-3-dub-edition-remix">gave it an 8.8</a>, and it let you drive, customize, and fine-tune the 1998 Toyota Supra Turbo.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/5-standout-racing-games-that-let-you-get-behind-the-wheel-of-a-toyota]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Electronic Arts is going private in an acquisition that values the company at $55 billion, EA announced today, following an initial report from<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec?mod=hp_lead_pos2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> The Wall Street Journal</a> last week. The company will be purchased by a "<a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consortium</a>" of investors that includes Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. None of this is good.</p><p>The deal is the "largest leveraged buyout on record," according to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/ea-agrees-to-sale-in-largest-leveraged-buyout-on-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bloomberg</a>, and includes $20 billion in debt. In a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leveraged buyout</a>, the purchasers largely borrow money to fund the acquisition, and can use the purchased company’s assets as collateral. Basically, this means the buyers need the company they bought to make a hell of a lot of money to both pay down the debt and make the profit they’re in it for. They’re incentivized to cut costs to get there; leveraged buyouts have spelled the end of companies including <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/heres-what-sunk-toys-r-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toys R Us</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/party-city-fired-everyone-without-severance-right-before-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Party City</a>. Despite this grim portend, CEO Andrew Wilson will stay on, and wrote in a<a href="https://www.ea.com/news/exciting-news-about-our-future" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> message to EA employees</a> that "This is one of the largest and most significant investments ever made in the entertainment industry. Our new partners... believe in our people, our leadership, and the long-term vision we are now building together."</p><p>Let's look at those partners. The PIF already owned a nearly 10% stake in EA, alongside shares in other games companies like Nintendo and Take-Two. It has also<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> invested heavily in co-buyer Affinity Partners</a>, the firm formed in 2021 by Donald Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. Affinity faced inquiry by the Senate<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/25/jared-kushner-affinity-partners-firm-senate-inquiry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> last year</a> over, according to Senator Ron Wyden, fears that "Affinity’s investors may not be motivated by commercial considerations, but rather the opportunity to funnel foreign government money to members of President Trump’s family." Kushner is apparently a fan of EA’s games, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/electronic-arts-acquired-largest-ever-private-equity-buyout-rcna234432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a>, “I’ve admired [EA’s] ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games — and now enjoys them with his kids — I couldn’t be more excited about what’s ahead.”</p><p>Silver Lake, meanwhile, is<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-25/oracle-silver-lake-mgx-discuss-45-tiktok-stake-board-seats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> rumored to be</a> one of the new owners of the US-based TikTok, in a long-running clusterfuck of a deal that could also see Oracle and MGX grab a slice.</p><p>But the PIF is a uniquely concerning partner. <strong>(Update, 9/29/25, 3:16pm--</strong>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/saudi-plans-for-video-game-hub-grow-with-55-billion-ea-deal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the PIF is providing "more fresh capital" than Silver Lake and Affinity.<strong>)</strong> It's the money arm of Saudi Arabia's plunge into gaming, using subsidiary Savvy Games Group to acquire games like<a href="https://aftermath.site/saudi-arabia-scopely-pokemon-go-street-fighter-esports-human-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Pokemon Go</em></a> and pushing massively into esports, with the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/technology/saudi-arabia-video-game-investment.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> New York Times</a> writing last year that "Savvy Games Group now owns 40 percent of the total e-sports market share… The P.I.F. and its subsidiaries have spent roughly $6 billion buying up game companies and $14 billion on stock investments." The<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/14/saudi-arabia-savvy-games-embracer-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> collapse of a $2 billion deal</a> between Savvy and Embracer in 2023 precipitated mass layoffs and studio closures at Embracer that further exacerbated the games industry's freefall.

With $20 billion in debt to pay down, those layoffs are likely to continue; if there's one thing private equity loves, it's cost-cutting, and people--you know, the ones who <em>actually make the video games</em>--are<a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> usually the first on the chopping block</a>.</p><p>Whether or not the PIF or Kushner's firm will be interested in exerting fine-level control of game content, either globally or just in their own jurisdictions, there's no doubt this deal and its attendant debt will affect the kinds of games EA puts out. The company will certainly need to lean into sure-fire hits and broadly popular series, alongside whatever schemes it can drum up to squeeze as much money from players as possible. Niche favorites or one-and-done single-player games aren’t going to pay the kinds of bills EA now needs to pay. EA was already headed down this path: Following layoffs in late May, Wilson<a href="https://www.ea.com/news/continuing-to-evolve-our-business-and-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> said</a> that EA intends to "double down on our biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities." We've already seen that playing out this year, with the company<a href="https://aftermath.site/anthem-server-shutdown-trying-for-the-first-time-bioware-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> shuttering less popular games like <em>Anthem</em></a> and a<a href="https://gamerant.com/ea-games-shutting-down-2025-fifa-23-madden-22/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> variety of mobile and sports games</a>, while touting<a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-dice-battlefield-battle-royale-free-to-play-f2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> absurd expectations</a> for the <em>Battlefield</em> series. And, like every idiot these days, EA is<a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-ai-demo-imagination-creation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> exploring AI</a>, with Wilson saying in a<a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> May earnings call</a> that "We view AI as a powerful accelerator of creativity, innovation and player connection... Across our teams, we're investing in new workflows and capabilities to integrate AI to enhance how we build, scale and personalize experiences." So this deal certainly won't mean anything good for workers at EA and its studios. And it won’t mean anything good for players of the company’s games, whether that’s sports series that will need to make more money than ever or smaller games that might get deprioritized.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond this, continuing the trend of fewer and fewer powerful people and companies owning more and more things, both in the<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/13/microsoft-closes-activision-blizzard-deal-after-regulatory-review.html#:~:text=More%20than%2020%20months%20after,from%20a%20U.S.%20district%20judge." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> games industry</a> and beyond, is no good for anyone. As companies consolidate, their leaders’ choices and priorities ripple out into everything they own, letting them alter massive swathes of industries. In the case of this consortium, those choices are motivated by far more than just a desire to make a shit-ton of money–members have ties to, or literally <em>are</em>, some of the most powerful and conservative governments in the world. The PIF is a political project above all, with games being a means to an end. Kushner is obviously susceptible to the Trump administration’s meddling, as is Silver Lake, with its rumored TikTok deal deeply embedded in Trump’s priorities. As <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games swing back into the Right’s spotlight</a>, everyone involved will surely feel the pressure of the Trump administration on whatever happens next. Once the deal closes in 2027, a handful of people are going to come out richer than ever, and a majority of people are going to get fucked.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/palestinian-voice-in-games-coalition-helps-game-developers"><h3>New Coalition Seeks To Help Palestinian Game Developers ‘Speak Loudly’ Through Games</h3></a><p>Palestinian Voices in Games aims to ‘push against the dehumanisation of Palestinians’</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Goichi "Suda51" Suda is a developer who needs no introduction for those who have a deep appreciation for Japanese games. His development studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, has created some of the most memorable action games ever, such as the No More Heroes series.</p>



<p>Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-doomed-to-an-eternity-of-heavy-metal-jokes/">Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</a>, the Japanese studio is releasing Romeo is a Dead Man, an action game with a very distinct identity that instantly feels familiar to all those who played a game directed by Suda51.</p>



<p>Right after <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-gamescom-hands-on-preview-subspace-emissary/">trying out the game during Gamescom 2025</a>, I had the opportunity to sit down with Suda51 to discuss the main inspiration behind the game's wacky story, how swordplay and gunplay will be balanced, the game's level design, and more. You can find our chat below.</p>



<p><span><b><i>NOTE: The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity and brevity.</i></b></span></p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo is a Dead Man has been called an <em>“ultra‑violent science‑fiction action game.”</em> You are no stranger to gore, but what has inspired you to bring it to a sci-fi setting?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> When I want to make a new game, I always think: <em>"What can I do to make people get interested?"</em> For Romeo is a Dead Man, when I was thinking about the game's introduction and how to make it interesting, I thought of Back to the Future, and the relationship between Marty McFly and Doc Emmett Brown. The relationship between Romeo and his grandfather Benjamin mirrors their relationship, but with a twist.</p>



<p>I wondered, what would have happened if Marty had died at the start of <em>Back to the Future</em>? I imagined Doc would try to save him — by traveling into the future. That idea inspired the introduction for Romeo is a Dead Man. After this, I started thinking about how things would go on, and the whole game concept grew from this.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo Stargazer is a unique protagonist, an FBI agent tracking criminals across space-time. What made you choose an FBI agent as your main character? What does his background bring to the experience?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> In the world of Romeo is a Dead Man, criminals travel between different time periods and parts of the universe, ignoring the laws of space-time to commit all sorts of crimes. If there are space-time criminals and fugitives, there would be space-time police too. And what would these guys be?</p>



<p>Being a massive fan of TV series by Dick Wolf <em>(Law &amp; Order, FBI franchise)</em>, the FBI came to mind, but how could FBI agents become space-time agents? With this question in mind, I came up with the background setting. J. Edgar Hoover, the first head of the FBI, discovers that there are space-time fugitives. He then somehow travels to the past to create this space-time division within the FBI, traveling through space-time to bring these criminals in.</p>



<p>While this background setting isn't in the game, this is how I decided to make Romeo an FBI space-time agent. For the rest of the game, I tried imagining how would a show based on this premise be, and went on from there.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The concept behind Romeo is a Dead man grew out of a "what-if" scenario based on Back to the Future.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo being a dead man is the central hook of the story, but has his peculiar status influenced the experience beyond just the story?</p>



<p>A: Romeo's status as a dead man has influenced combat, for the most part. When he first gets killed at the start of the game and his grandfather Benjamin puts the helmet on him, Romeo is not only saved, but becomes a "hyperfied" human, elevating from being just another dead man to The Dead Man. This also allows him to use all the different weapons and skills he has in the game, much more efficiently than a regular human ever could.</p>



<p>Q: Speaking about weapons, playing the demo, I couldn't help but notice in this small slice of the game how short-range melee weapons seem to be favored over gunplay, which felt effective mostly against flying, hard-to-reach enemies. How is the full game balanced, in this regard? Will the player be able to use any weapon type and still succeed?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> That's a pretty sharp observation. In general, the player is free to use whatever weapon they want, so both melee and ranged weapons can get the job done, but depending on the enemy type, you may want to prefer one type over the other.</p>



<p>However, some bigger enemies and bosses require the player to use both. These enemies have weak points that are difficult to reach with a melee weapon, so the player has to use guns to hit them, and then close in with short range weapons once the opportunity arises. In many ways, the combat experience is built like a loop where you cycle between weapons, and build up resources to use skills.</p>



<p>Generally, Romeo is a Dead Man leans a bit more towards close-up melee fighting, but aside from specific cases, the player can use whatever they find more comfortable to use. It was a consciuous game design from the very beginning.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> From the demo, I noticed the stage felt pretty big, but it was still a closed-off stage. So is the entire game this linear?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> It's completely linear. Maps can get big, but there's no open-world progression whatsoever. We did try an open-world approach, but we got rid of that pretty early on in the development process.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>While it leans more towards close-range fighting, Romeo is a Dead Man allows players to use any weapon type to succeed.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Although the game does feel different, I couldn't help but notice a certain similarity to the No More Heroes. Besides the linearity of Romeo is A Dead Man versus the open-world approach of Travis Touchdown's adventures, what would you say is the most prominent feature that differentiates the games?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Besides the different progression, I'd say the setting is the biggest difference. In Romeo is a Dead Man, the keyword is space.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo is a Dead Man is powered by Unreal Engine 5 like a good number of modern games. Is there anything the engine allowed you to do that couldn't have been done before? Anything that the engine made easier to accomplish.</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> There are a lot of things for sure, but I really can't get into specifics. The technical team would be able to provide deeper information on this, but I'm sure there are a lot of things that the engine made it easier to do.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Romeo is a Dead Man is your first IP in a very long time, and you are launching a brand new game in a market where most developers rely on established series. Why did you decide to do so? Do you feel launching a new IP nowadays is more challenging than in the past?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> The proliferation of sequels and remakes isn't just seen in games but also in movies. Personally, I think this marks the current age, but it won't be like this forever. As time goes on, things will go back to the way they were before, when developers were more interested in creating new games than sequels or remakes.</p>



<p>As a developer, me and Grasshopper, we like creating new original games and working on the series we have done in the past in equal measure. There's a chance we will develop a sequel to any of our series at some point. But we will also continue making new and original games as well.</p>



<p>I personally don't think too much about making a new game or a new entry in our series. I just want to make the kind of games we want to make, regardless if a specific time favors sequels and remakes or new games. This is something that tends to change over time, and doesn't influence what we do too much.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>



<p>With its blend of time-bending chaos, quirky humor, and looped combat that rewards both melee and ranged play, Romeo is a Dead Man promises to be a signature Suda51 experience - unpredictable, stylish, and unlike anything else in the action genre today. Players can expect plenty of surprises when it launches in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

              <p>Disney’s 20th Century has announced that a new movie based on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-simpsons-best-episodes-characters-top-to-watch-list-1850309544">long-running animated TV sitcom<em> The Simpsons</em></a> is in the works. The newly announced sequel will arrive in 2027, 20 years after the release of the first <em>Simpsons</em> flick.</p> <p>On September 29,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPMgc7Yj0PE/#"> Disney and 20th Century announced on social media</a> that a new <em>Simpsons</em> film was officially in development. No plot details were shared about the movie, but Disney did post a teaser poster for the upcoming sequel. The poster features Homer Simpson grabbing a pink doughnut covered in sprinkles shaped like the number 2, likely hinting that the movie will be titled <em>The Simpsons Movie 2</em>.&nbsp; The tagline “Homer’s combing back for seconds” is included on the poster. So, good news, Homer is back. Shocking, I know, but there you go.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Woohoo!

While many have criticized the show’s quality since the late ’90, the series has remained extremely popular on TV and is considered an anchor of Fox’s Sunday block of animated TV shows. The original <em>Simpsons</em> movie premiered in July 2007 and was a huge box office hit, earning over $536 million at the global box office. That movie featured a story about a giant dome being put over the town of Springfield due to pollution. It also brought back old former writers, took years to make, and featured a more detailed art style.</span></p> <p><span>We’ve heard rumors for years of a second <em>Simpsons</em> movie, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Man_Who_Came_to_Be_Dinner#:~:text=However%2C%20according%20to,a%20regular%20episode.">including a proposed follow-up featuring the franchise’s alien characters</a> Kang and </span><span>Kodos</span><span>. That movie didn’t move forward as the writing staff couldn’t stretch the plot out to a full-length movie. But now it seems the writers and producers behind the show have finally nailed the plot for the next flick. Now we just have to wait until 2027.</span></p>

The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ridepods-race-with-head/id6752268828?platform=iphone"><em>RidePods - Race with Head</em></a> gameplay is relatively basic – you’re just steering a motorcycle through oncoming traffic at high speeds – but instead of swiping the screen or tiling your phone, you control the bike’s movements by tilting your head from side-to-side while wearing AirPods.</p><p>The game only works with Apple’s wireless headphones that support Spatial Audio including the AirPods Pro, the AirPods Max, and the third and fourth generation AirPods. Spatial Audio relies on the accelerometer and gyroscope included in those AirPods models to track the movements of your head and adjust the position of the audio accordingly. Tanis announced the game’s release on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45362365">Y Combinator</a> and while they said they had to reverse engineer the Spatial Audio feature to make their game work, Apple does provide <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreMotion/getting-motion-activity-data-from-headphones">developers with access to headphone motion data</a> so they can incorporate features like fitness tracking into their apps.</p><p><em>RidePods</em> isn’t the most polished iOS or iPadOS game I’ve ever played. There are random graphical glitches such as the road occasionally disappearing, and from the limited amount of time I’ve spent dodging traffic it appears that you’re racing on a perfect straightaway that never curves. It feels more like a tech demo than a fully realized game, but the controls are surprisingly nuanced. I tested it with the second generation AirPods Pro and the AirPods Max and using my head to steer felt both more natural and responsive than I thought it would be.</p><p>The bike responds well to subtle movements, even when using just a single AirPod earbud. If you turn off Automatic Head or Ear Detection in your AirPods’ settings, you can even use your headphones or a single AirPods earbud as a handheld controller, but it requires a lot more finesse with your movements and definitely ups the challenge.</p><p>The app includes a setting for controlling the motorcycle’s braking and acceleration by tilting your head forwards and back, but I couldn’t detect that having any discernible effect on the bike’s speed. You can also toggle between a first-person and third-person view of the riderless motorcycle, and for those wanting to share their high scores with the world, the app includes a record function that captures both the gameplay and a selfie video of you playing in a single clip.</p><p><em>RidePods - Race with Head</em> isn’t a game I’m going to return to frequently, but I can see the potential of using headphone motion controls for mobile gaming. It’s completely free, but I would definitely pay a tidy sum for a hands-free version of <em>Solitaire</em> that lets me move around stacks of cards using nothing but subtle head gestures and motions.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/787396/ride-pods-race-with-head-apple-airpods-spatial-audio-motion-controls]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="d74d8513ba786"><a title="Tokyo Game Show Main Visual" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d74d8513ba786/tokyo-game-show-main-visual.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Tokyo Game Show</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the release of Switch 2, fans of their handheld hybrids will be relieved to hear that, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/feature-heres-10-games-we-played-at-tgs-2024-coming-to-switch">compared to last year</a>, there were many more Nintendo games to play at the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>This time around, the massive displays put up by the likes of Capcom and Square Enix had a lot for Nintendo fans to experience, while dotted throughout mid-sized and small booths alike, there were plenty of games to discover.</p>
<p>That said, many of the games (like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>) launched during or around the time TGS ran from <strong>25th to 27th September,</strong> with others having playable demos you can experience at home (like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>). As such, I’ve gone ahead and curated this list to 10 games from mostly big to a couple of smaller ones that were more or less exclusive to TGS.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the big boys.</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>

<h2 id="resident-evil-requiem-switch-2">Resident Evil Requiem (Switch 2)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="ffc70d8675086"><a title="RE9 Switch Screenshot" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ffc70d8675086/re9-switch-screenshot.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I raised an eyebrow when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/resident-evil-requiem-has-been-officially-confirmed-for-switch-2">announced for the Switch 2</a> during the last Nintendo Direct; it seemed too graphically cutting-edge to make it onto less powerful hardware. However, after sitting down with the game for a run-through of protagonist Grace Ashcroft’s escape from a haunted hotel, Capcom thoroughly impressed me with this port.</p>
<p>It was so impressive, in fact, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-footage-a-surprisingly-tense-port">I wrote a full hands-on with some offscreen S2 video footage</a>.</p>

<h2 id="monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-switch-2">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection (Switch 2)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="ae2ba2916d5ab"><a title="Flying Rathalos" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ae2ba2916d5ab/flying-rathalos.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Capcom didn’t disappoint when it came to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, either. I also played this handheld on a Switch 2. It quickly became my personal Game of the Show, though I’m a bit biased because I absolutely loved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_stories_2_wings_of_ruin">Wings of Ruin</a> and can’t wait for another iteration of what I consider the best creature-battling system out there.</p>
<p>Ditching the customisable protagonist, Twisted Reflection instead stars a man named Leo, the Captain of a group called the Rangers and also royalty of some sort, as his Palico buddy kept calling him Your Highness.</p>
<p>In the demo, he’s tasked with showing a young recruit named Thea — and by extension, me — the ins-and-outs of a complex battle system by taking down some Velocipray and later a Paolumu before a frenzied Chatacabra served as a boss fight that almost wiped my team of a Rathalos, Yian Kut-Ku, and Tobi-Kadachi.</p>
<p>It ran great on the Switch 2’s small screen with little pop-in as I climbed towers to get a better view of the surrounding area. The colourful, sprawling world I saw from up there brought to mind the first time I climbed a Sheikah Tower in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>; as such, you can probably guess that I’m super excited to play more when it releases in <strong>March 2026</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="mega-man-star-force-legacy-collection-switch-1">Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection (Switch 1)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="773a5dfb55c2c"><a title="Mega Man Star Force Meeting Omega" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/773a5dfb55c2c/mega-man-star-force-meeting-omega.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let’s get the final Capcom game out of the way: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_star_force_legacy_collection">Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection</a> brings together all three Star Force games and their respective versions; at TGS, I could only sample the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mega_man_star_force">Mega Man Star Force</a> from the Nintendo DS and not the second or the third, which were on 3DS.</p>
<p>I played through the opening moments of the Dragon version where Geo receives a Vizualizer headset that allows him to see the Wave World and meet Omega-Xis, an alien lifeform that helps him take out other aliens invading the Earth. While much of the demo was spent mashing through dialogue — learning about Geo’s missing father, the BrotherBand system, and arguing with classmates — I played on a comically large TV for a port of a DS game and came away impressed with how crisp it looked.</p>
<p>This was especially true of the 3D, grid-based battles that were right at home on a bigger screen. Still, I’ll likely play mostly handheld when it comes out sometime in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (Switch 2)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="1ac30c53eb7ad"><a title="Mineru Fighting" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1ac30c53eb7ad/mineru-fighting.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Koei Tecmo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, publishers other than Capcom had games for the Switch 2 at TGS this year, and one of them was Koei Tecmo’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, a follow-up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>. I’m not much of a musou fan, but I am a big Zelda fan; as such, I put a couple of dozen hours into Age of Calamity and am fairly excited for this follow-up.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed sitting down with the docked version is how well it ran. Age of Calamity was a stuttery mess on Switch 1 and I half expected to see slowdown as I swapped between Zelda, Rauru, and Mineru as they fought through waves of <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Little_Frox">Little Frox</a> and <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Soldier_Construct">Soldier Constructs</a> before taking on a boss <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Frox">Frox</a> in the Depths beneath Hyrule.</p>
<p>Not only did I use Zonai Devices like Flame Emitters, I also activated team-up attacks between the playable heroes. Zelda and Rauru, for example, each shot a beam of light from a hand that I aimed separately with the left and right sticks.</p>
<p>However, Mineru’s kit stole the show. Instead of dashing, she summons a Zonai Device wheel to ride on, and at the end of her attacks, she’ll often spawn vehicles made up of Zonai Devices to deal sweeping damage over large areas. I’ll get the chance to master her moveset when Age of Imprisonment releases on <strong>6th November</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="once-upon-a-katamari-switch-1">Once Upon a Katamari (Switch 1)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e294ae7d9b3cb"><a title="Once Upon a Katamari Village" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e294ae7d9b3cb/once-upon-a-katamari-village.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I haven’t played a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy</a> before, but the fun I had with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a> at TGS convinced me that might’ve been a mistake. With a huge ball of rolled-up refuse drawing attention in one of the main halls, it was a hard game to miss and the first one I played when I arrived.</p>
<p>I had a grand old time rolling a massive ball around a small Japanese village reminiscent of Kyoto — complete with a couple of pagodas and a castle — on my way to a very unimpressive D Rank. In fact, the staff stepped in and turned on the ‘easy’ controls for me rather than the classic set a couple of minutes in. I didn’t need to admit my failure, but here we are.</p>
<p>Regardless, I had fun jiving to an upbeat electric track that repeatedly assured me that I am a star. Fortunately, I’ll have another chance to get a higher rank when Once Upon a Katamari comes out in under a month on <strong>24th October</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="dragon-quest-i-andamp-ii-hd-2d-remake-switch-1-andamp-2">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="94455f0c87106"><a title="Dragon Quest I Solo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/94455f0c87106/dragon-quest-i-solo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> wasn’t playable at TGS, I did sit down with <strong>the PlayStation 5 version</strong> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>. While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">DQ III HD-2D Remake</a> suffered on the original Switch, the Switch 2 enhancements brought it more on par with beefier hardware, so I expect to see this dual prequel follow-up running just as well when it releases on <strong>30th October</strong>.</p>
<p>I played Dragon Quest II first, which began in the town of Beran. I immediately noticed how much more involved the party members are in this narrative sequel. You see, we travelled south by boat to a shrine where a mermaid granted us the ability to travel underwater — a new addition to Dragon Quest II <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-remakes-brand-new-underwater-region-is-beautiful">that you may have already seen gameplay of already</a> — and each of the party members showed off a bit of personality here. The Prince of Cannock, named Cookie for some reason in this demo, shied away from receiving a kiss from the mermaid, for instance.</p>
<p>I spent a bit of time floating about on my way to rescue other mermaids from a monster invasion, picking up gear from sparkly spots underwater much the same way I did in Dragon Quest III and battling classic Dragon Quest monsters by turning the battle speed up to Very Fast and setting all members to Show No Mercy, as <a href="https://dragon-quest.org/wiki/Rubiss">Rubiss</a> intended.</p>
<p>I did jump over to Dragon Quest I after that, a game I have little experience with, and travelled as the solo hero chasing down good old Robin ‘Ood after he stole the Thief’s Key from a shady merchant. Regular enemies didn’t stand much chance against my hero, equipped as he was with a Thorn Whip and a Zap spell, but facing Robin ‘Ood and two of his lackeys alone made for a difficult fight that I couldn’t overcome.</p>

<h2 id="professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam-switch-1-andamp-2">Professor Layton and the New World of Steam (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="39d143cfe183f"><a title="Layton and Luke" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39d143cfe183f/layton-and-luke.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You may remember I included Level-5’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</a> in last year’s roundup alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam-new-world-but-feels-like-the-old-prof">a full hands-on</a>, which would normally disqualify it for this one like it did <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>. However, this time around I got to explore a different section of the game while using the Joy-Con 2’s Mouse Mode to solve puzzles in the American city of Steam Bison.</p>
<p>I unfortunately found the mouse control awkward and a little painful while standing up to play. Regardless, I managed to solve three puzzles and talk to quite a few denizens of Steam Bison while Layton searched for Luke before the demo clock ran down; this feels like a much more 'alive' setting than previous Professor Layton games.</p>
<p>Quite literally the first puzzle in the game did confound me, though. It required searching for something unusual on a statue on the town square, but it wasn’t so much of a puzzle as it was a trick. I won’t spoil it, but it requires you to more or less ignore the instructions (click and submit an unusual spot on the statue) for something a bit more obscure.</p>
<p>The next puzzle, however, required me to drag-and-drop cogs onto a barge to ferry them across the river in the proper sequence, and that one felt much more Professor Layton-esque to me. Unfortunately, we’ll all have to wait to see the strength of the puzzles for a while, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam-has-been-delayed-until-2026">it's been delayed to <strong>sometime in 2026</strong></a>.</p>

<h2 id="little-nightmares-iii-switch-1-andamp-2">Little Nightmares III (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="f9e228c27b35c"><a title="Little Nightmares III" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f9e228c27b35c/little-nightmares-iii.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Stuart Gipp reviewed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_ii">Little Nightmares II</a> for Nintendo Life quite well back in 2021, and the third entry looks to improve upon the last in every way. While I played <strong>the PlayStation 5 version</strong>, I found the 20 minutes I spent with this little horror game equal parts disturbing and charming.</p>
<p>It does, however, seem like a game primarily designed for co-op. As the demo began, I had to choose between two characters: the bow-wielding Loss or the wrench-wielding Alone. I went with Alone, and fortunately the AI was functional enough to control Loss as we worked together to solve puzzles and avoid grotesque, brutish enemies in a haunted circus environment.</p>
<p>At one point, Loss had to shoot the head off small zombie men for me to whack with my Wrench. In another section, Loss automatically went to pull a switch at the precise moment I turned a crank to power it. Still, it seems very much like a game you’d need to play with a friend to get the full experience.</p>
<p>If you do have a friend in mind, you don’t have long to wait to give Little Nightmares III a shot - it comes out on <strong>10th October</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide-switch-2">SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide (Switch 2)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="8e0a48dd65f23"><a title="Ghostly SpongeBob" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8e0a48dd65f23/ghostly-spongebob.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: THQ Nordic</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>No, really—I was shocked at how much <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide">SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide</a> channelled that Nintendo 64-era collectathon energy when I played a <strong>PC version</strong> at TGS. But if you played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_the_cosmic_shake">SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_the_cosmic_shake">SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake</a>, you probably know better than me that these are some top-tier 3D platformers.</p>
<p>As always in Bikini Bottom, something’s going awry: this time around, the ghastly Flying Dutchmen curses SpongeBob and the townsfolk when his order at the Krusty Krab takes too long. This, of course, turns SpongeBob and other townsfolk into ghosts.</p>
<p>After a short tutorial, the game handed me control of Patrick as I made my way to rescue SpongeBob, jumping, gliding, collecting coins, and bopping evil ghosts throwing buckets of chum at me as I did so.</p>
<p>While this wasn’t the Switch 2 version, you can expect to play SpongeBob’s latest absurd adventure for yourself fairly soon: it comes out on <strong>18th November</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="d-topia-switch-1-andamp-2">D-Topia (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9684a836fa356"><a title="D-Topia Store" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9684a836fa356/d-topia-store.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Annapurna Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Annapurna Interactive doesn’t often miss as a publisher. With games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sayonara_wild_hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/stray">Stray</a> under their banner, I took note when I saw their brightly lit booth on the TGS showfloor. While one of their games, <a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/games/demi-and-the-fractured-dream">Demi and the Fractured Dream</a>, channelled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> energy, I came away most intrigued by <a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/games/dtopia">D-Topia</a>.</p>
<p>In it, you assume the role of a young man as he arrives at a place called — you guessed it — D-Topia that markets itself as a utopia that maximises human happiness and comfort. Your character is assigned the number 046 and sets off to work as a Facility Mechanic, which entails solving problems for local residents.</p>
<p>This usually involves some kind of logic puzzle: the ones I experienced were math-based, requiring me to move numbered blocks to their proper spot. However, certain obstacles like lasers and unmovable blocks make this a bit more challenging.</p>
<p>I expected things to get a little creepy but only found a talking mouse that claimed higher intelligence than humans; that said, the conclusion of the demo hinted that someone — or something — is investigating 046. I’m curious to see what that’s all about when it releases <strong>sometime in 2026</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 is out on all platforms in a little more than a week from the time of this writing. With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">momentum built from its extremely popular open beta</a> and the work the Battlefield Studios put in to develop this new entry into the shooter franchise with Battlefield Labs, for the first time in years, Battlefield will <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">have a chance to really compete</a> with Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Which is why it's not a surprise that, with its latest trailer for Battlefield 6, EA decided to take a direct shot at Activision and Call of Duty. The live-action trailer begins with actor Zac Efron, professional basketball player Jimmy Butler, singer Morgan Wallen, and MMA fighter Paddy Pimblett walking along a war-torn New York City bridge, each kitted out based on different classes with Efron geared up for Assault, Butler for Engineer, Wallen for Support and Pimblett for Recon.</p>



<p>As Efron begins to talk, he and the rest of his crew are unceremoniously blown up. Following in their smoke is a squad of more appropriately-dressed looking soldiers, with one asking "<em>Who was that?</em>" followed by a quick, "<em>Doesn't matter, let's move</em>," response.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6: Official Launch Live Action Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EunkRPRzECg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The rest of the trailer plays out as a live-action stylized version of a match in Battlefield 6, with the focus back to the coming game, but the entire opening is what takes a shot at Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Little details like Pimblett's weapon being painted in a custom skin with multiple decals on it, Butler's charm dangling from his rocket launcher, and the inclusion of celebrities themselves are all shots at the modern state of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>The charm and weapon skin are obviously shots at Call of Duty's monetization, though it's not like EA and Battlefield have much of a leg to stand on there when you can customize your weapons in Battlefield just the same. What has more of a foundation is how each celebrity comes from a different part of entertainment and culture. It's seemingly a shot at how Call of Duty includes celebrity cameos and skins that make Call of Duty look more like Fortnite with its mixing and matching collaborations.</p>



<p>Even the song that plays throughout the trailer, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, by Smashing Pumpkins, is a shot at Activision and Call of Duty, as the Smashing Pumpkins' classic was previously used in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk5AXoDLf_k">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II's marketing campaign</a>.</p>



<p>There's also the timing of the trailer's release, which is just days ahead of Call of Duty Next, where the marketing campaign for Black Ops 7 will go into full gear leading up to its launch in November.</p>



<p>It's a clear Battlefield vs. Call of Duty version of SEGA's 'does what Nintendon't' style marketing, with Battlefield framed as a serious and intense shooter, and Call of Duty as a cosmetic-driven, celebrity endorsement-fueled, and decidedly less-serious alternative.</p>



<p>At a time when Call of Duty is at what seems to be an inflection point for <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">its ongoing identity crisis</a>, and following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-movie-in-the-works-paramount-skydance/">news of a Call of Duty movie in the works</a>, the trailer hits all the right points for players, as you can clearly tell from a quick scroll through the comments on the trailer.</p>



<p>While the trailer is all fun and games, the reality of how strongly Battlefield 6 will be able to compete with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is more grim than EA would like. It would be a pretty big shock if Battlefield were able to outsell Call of Duty in any metric, really. Especially considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-games-almost-half-of-all-best-selling-playstation-games-in-us/">how much of a hold the series has over the fans who come back to it</a> year after year.</p>



<p>Hopefully, at the very least, Battlefield 6 can prove to shooter fans that Call of Duty isn't the only major war shooter in town, and that the series is really back this time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO has been crushing it with its video game sets. I honestly can't think of a single miss. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-the-lego-nintendo-entertainment-system-and-it-contains-a-hidden-surprise">The LEGO NES</a>  set, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-the-lego-pac-man-arcade-which-actually-moves-and-plays">LEGO Pac-Man arcade cabinet,</a> and even the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-sega-genesis-controller-where-to-buy">SEGA Genesis controller</a> (which was only available as a Gift With Purchase) all paid loving homage to the source material and managed to squeeze in clever surprises and Easter eggs. I'm happy to say the LEGO Game Boy, in spite of its smaller size, still managed to sneak in a few surprises, but if you're hoping for something as elaborate as the NES Easter Egg, or the hand-crank movement and hidden '80s arcade scene of the Pac-Man set, definitely temper your expectations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Big Is the LEGO Game Boy?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">At 421 pieces, the LEGO Game Boy is the smallest of the available video game console sets LEGO has issued over the years, but in spite of a relatively small brick count, its efficiency of parts still makes for an exceptional whole. When it's fully assembled, it looks everything the part of the original, although it's just a touch smaller.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/img-6298-1759163502613.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It also comes with bricks to build a small display stand, and a second, smaller display stand that shows off a cartridge and also serves as a place to store the extra lenticular game screens.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Its efficiency of parts still makes for an exceptional whole.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three game screens in all: one for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-land">Super Mario Land</a> that has Mario hitting a block to reveal a star, one for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-1993">Link's Awakening</a> that shows Link and Zelda gazing to the sea as gulls fly over head, and one that's just the Nintendo logo scroll when you power on the Game Boy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Swapping screens is no factor at all, you just pop off the back panel and drop it in place. It's held secure with a little lever that's easy to move and has just the right amount of give to keep it from moving without pressing so hard as to deform the thin lenticular sheets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since this model is based on the original Game Boy and not its later revisions, the graphics are in the sickly greens of that original 160 x 144 display. They're sharp, too, and look exactly like how you remember them. They're lovely. I hope they make more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">LEGO Game Boy We Build</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How Long Does it Take to Build the LEGO Game Boy?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In order to get the most appropriate timing on the LEGO Game Boy as I could, I popped in my Blu-ray copy of the 1989 Nintendo feature-length commercial "The Wizard." My goal was to see if I could complete the build before Fred Savage, Jenny Lewis, and the titular Wizard made it to California.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm happy to say, in spite of having to get up to let my dogs out and then back in, I snapped the final piece into place just as Jenny Lewis stepped onto the dry soil of California on the way to the world Nintendo championships, so just about an hour after I pushed play. Not a bad build time, and again, the final results are so much better than it feels like should be possible with a set this size.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The parts on the inside evoke the look of the inside of a real Game Boy</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Since it's a 421-piece build, there are only five bags of parts inside the box, and they're small bags. I have a little organizer basket from Walmart, the sort of thing you put on a shelf to store buttons and doo-dads for crafts, and I use it to organize parts bags when I build sets. For this build, it was overkill. I still used it, but really, there was no need to. I'm just a creature of habit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was surprised at the color selection of the bricks: lots of greens, browns, gold, and copper-colored pieces. Then it occurred to me the colors for the interior mimic the colors of a printed circuit board. That's one of the first Easter eggs. As you're putting it together, the parts on the inside you'll never see again evoke the look of the inside of a real Game Boy, or any electronic gizmo of the era. It's obviously not a 1:1 representation of the circuitry, but it's a close enough approximation that I was suitably impressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cartridges also follow this circuit board aesthetic on their insides, and the coolest Easter Egg in the set is in the Link's Awakening cartridge. Now, LEGO didn't need to do this at all, because again, once you put it together, you never see it again, but inside of the Link's Awakening cart is a "back up battery" piece. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't know, in order to keep save files on those old carts, there had to be a small coin-cell battery providing a trickle of power to keep the electrons dancing soldered onto the board. Link's Awakening was one such cart, and they went ahead and added that detail into the LEGO version, for no reason other than to please people like me. The Super Mario Land cart had no such battery back up and so the LEGO version doesn't either.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/img-6300-1759163502613.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The stickers for the carts are exact replicas of the ones on the originals, and I went into a state of hyper concentration to make sure I placed them exactly where they needed to be. Usually I put on LEGO decals with the same tweezers I use for scale models, but this time I just went raw dog on them and did pretty well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">LEGO Game Boy Controls</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The power switch, D-pad, A and B buttons, contrast, and volume knobs, and start and select buttons are all functional. Well, "functional" meaning "they move." The power switch in particular feels exactly like the one on the original Game Boy. When you switch it on, it's so accurate to how you remember it feeling, you can't help but expect to hear that familiar chime. Obviously it doesn't, but your brain will fill in the details.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When you switch it on, you can't help but expect to hear that familiar chime.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the buttons don't feel exactly like they did on the original unit, but they still provide enough tactile feedback to get the job done. After the power switch, the A and B buttons probably feel the most accurate, with a little rubber band system rigged up to give them a little resistance and travel when you press them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">No LEGO Game Boy Tetris</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're going into the LEGO Game Boy hoping for a Tetris Easter egg, or any Tetris content at all, you're going to be disappointed. While Tetris was the original pack-in game for the Game Boy, and no doubt helped to popularize both the console and the game itself, it's nowhere to be seen here. My guess is it has to do with licensing, as Tetris wasn't a Nintendo game but was merely licensed to Nintendo back in 1989 and it was almost certainly easier to include two first-party Nintendo titles with the kit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if you were hoping for a little Tetris homage hiding inside, I'm sorry to say there just isn't one. Take it up with The Tetris Company Inc.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/img-6285-1759163502613.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The LEGO Game Boy is scheduled for an October 1 release date, but Amazon and other retailers have gone ahead and broken street date. That means a lot of people spent their weekend putting together this delightful little LEGO Game Boy kit, and between its short build time and excellent final result, I recommend picking one up if you have any nostalgia for the good old days of the 4-battery OG Game Boy. The kit is also pretty reasonably priced at $59.99, and you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmO545?object_uuid=e5f07918-923b-47d1-b552-43b3ea8f25b3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">go ahead and pick it up right now</a> and get it on, or even before, its October 1 release date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seth Macy is Senior Social Commerce Producer, and just wants to be your friend.

"Every time I come up with a new idea for how to play a story in Skyrim... I may make one or two or three with a new character and then I'm bored again. So that's why I'm going to stop uploading anything to do with Skyrim. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm tired, I'm not having any fun with it anymore, probably because of all the little kids on there," Curry continued, saying that she was no longer "getting any feedback" from her viewers in the same way that she used to. "All I get is 'Hi Grandma, I love you Grandma' — that isn't what I'm spending my time making and uploading videos for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Curry has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beloved-skyrim-grandma-retires-from-making-gameplay-videos-at-88-years-old">announced her retirement before</a>, only to eventually return — such as earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyrim-grandma-is-playing-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-and-chat-is-helping-out">when she began playing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> — but this time the Elder Scrolls legend suggested she really was now done. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In her video today, Curry repeatedly told anyone still wanting Skyrim content from her to download the fan-made mod which adds her as an in-game follower (it's available from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45956" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus Mods</a>). Alternatively, Curry said she had a bible study YouTube channel she would continue to post videos to, and encouraged any fans who were interested to follow her there.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Official Anniversary Edition and Upgrade Overview Video Breakdown</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Curry made no mention of waiting for her planned appearance in The Elder Scrolls 6, whenever that finally arrives. Bethesda has previously said it will add Curry to its upcoming project in some capacity, though there's no sign of the game materialising any time soon, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while">despite its teaser trailer being released more than seven years ago</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The regulars that have been with me a long time - because I've been playing Skyrim and uploading it for about 15 years - those I will still appreciate hearing from," Curry said. You usually have my email and I will be leaving a vlog once in a while when I have something to talk to you guys about." In the description box for the video, Curry has also left her postal address, in case anyone wanted to get in touch via physical mail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think that's about all I have to say," Curry concluded.

<p>"Because we are committed to launching all editions together, this new date applies to both physical and digital releases worldwide," the developer said. "We truly appreciate your patience and understanding, and we're sorry for this further delay."</p><p>Issues surrounding US President Donald Trump's controversial tariffs have prompted delays and price increases for a variety of products, including games. Microsoft, for example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">just recently announced another Xbox price hike</a>, while the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-price-hikes-announced-for-the-us-every-system-going-up-by-50/1100-6534127/" data-ref-id="1100-6534127">PS5 recently got more expensive as well.</a></p><p>Terminator 2D: No Fate focuses on Sarah Connor as players try to stop Skynet and its machines from wiping out the human race. Players will also be able to control the adult John Connor during levels set in the future war against Skynet.</p><p>Terminator 2D: No Fate will be available on Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC on November 26.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-day-one-collector-edition-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6530886/" data-ref-id="1100-6530886">two physical editions of Terminator 2D: No Fate</a> were announced earlier this year. There's a standard edition for $60, and a $120 collector's edition that features a reversible box art sleeve, a cloth poster, a 25mm collectible metal arcade coin featuring the game's logo, a full-color manual, and a collector's box.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-retro-trailer-judgement-day-snes-1851766852"><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em></a> is an upcoming video game adaptation of the original ’90s action movie sequel that is designed to look, sound, and play like classic 2D games from that era. <em>No Fate</em> looks really awesome. But sadly, due to ongoing tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump, this cool-looking <em>Terminator</em> game has been delayed (again) from October to November.</p> <p>On September 28, <em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> publisher Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau announced that the upcoming side-scrolling action game was being delayed a second time until November 26. <a href="https://www.reef-entertainment.com/post/terminator-2d-no-fate-release-date-moved-to-november-26-2025">In a statement posted to the publisher’s official website</a>, the company blamed the delay on “ongoing global trade and tariff changes” that caused shipping issues with components needed to produce the Day One and Collector’s Editions versions of the game. And because the studio and publisher want to ship the game to all platforms and users at the same time, <em>No Fate’s</em> release date was pushed back. This delay affects digital and physical copies worldwide.</p>  <p>“We truly appreciate your patience and understanding, and we’re sorry for this further delay,” said Reef Entertainment. “The team is working hard to make sure your wait is worth it, and we can’t wait to share <em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> with you all this November.”</p> <p>This isn’t the first delay for<em> Terminator 2D: No Fate.</em> In July, the 2D action platformer based on James Cameron’s iconic action flick starring Arnold Schwarzenegger was delayed from its initial release date of<a href="https://www.reef-entertainment.com/post/terminator-2d-no-fate-release-date-moved-to-october-31-2025"> September 5 to October 31, just in time for Halloween</a>. But that’s not happening anymore, and you can directly blame Trump, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-tariff-price-trump-nintendo-1851775491">who continues to screw around with tariffs haphazardl</a>y, causing global chaos for those trying to buy, ship, or import products or resources to the United States.</p>

<p>There's the beta of the n-game AI-powered assistant, Gaming Copilot, expanding to Game Bar on Windows PC and hitting the Xbox mobile app next month. You've got a revamped Xbox PC app, which simplifies finding your apps, games, and history into a couple of easier-to-navigate menus. And then PC gamers get three specific updates: a visually cleaner Social widgets experience, a Network Quality Indicator tool designed to help you understand and troubleshoot your connection, and a feature to make game saves sync easier across devices.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox's major new update this month is Offer Wallet, a "unified wallet solution" that simplifies how you access and claim Xbox offers. This is in addition to a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591" data-mce-href="/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> dynamic background, as the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/">multiplayer beta starts on October 2</a>.</p><p>Gaming Copilot is a rather controversial addition to the Xbox ecosystem. Revealed earlier this year and designed to provide help, recommendations, and other in-game support, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-copilot-to-help-xbox-players-beat-games-in-real-time/1100-6530113/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-copilot-to-help-xbox-players-beat-games-in-real-time/1100-6530113/">Gaming Copilot is a Steam-like overlay</a> that puts the essentially AI assistant right in your face.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Finnish developer Mainframe Industries and publisher New Tales announced that Pax Dei, the studio's social sandbox MMORPG, will launch version 1.0 on October 16. The game has been on Steam Early Access since June 18, 2024, which is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/pax-dei-early-access-qa-mainframe-talks-improvements-from-the-wilderness-alpha-monetization-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last time we spoke to the development team</a> (we previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mainframe-ex-ccp-remedy-ceo-the-industry-is-headed-towards-cloud-native-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed Thor Gunnarsson in 2020</a>, when the game still hadn't been fully unveiled).</p>



<p>Over this year and a half of early access development, the game received several updates, but the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1995520/Pax_Dei/">Steam user reviews</a> remain at a meager 54% score (Mixed), while recent reviews are even worse with a 38% score. Anyway, Founders will have access to the game starting on October 14, and they also get a free copy of the game to gift to a friend. Everyone will begin on new shards (servers) with new characters upon release, so any progress made during early access will be reset.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Pax Dei is available for $29.99 on the official website, Steam, and Epic Games Store, and can be played via GeForce NOW. Starting on October 16, it will be included with the PC Game Pass subscription. The base game comes with two character slots and one month of Premium Membership, which offers +50% Grace on Daily login and Gold Offerings, +50% XP boost, and the exclusive ability to build your own home in the game. Outside of that bundled month, the Premium Membership costs $6.99 a month if you want at least one plot.</p>



<p>Mainframe Industries is already planning other post-launch updates. Verse 5, due this Winter, will introduce Feudal Shrines, which are control points that Clans will fight over. Then, Verse 6 will implement Feudal Alliances, allowing clans to join forces in war and peace. In 2026, the developer plans to further expand other systems, beginning with Grace and the game's economy. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-removes-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite-after-the-show%E2%80%99s-recent-twist.1311793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Beyond his appearance in <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/mortal-kombat-1-guide-peacemaker-fatalities-strategy/">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, Peacemaker has made another videogame appearance by joining the ever-expanding world of Fortnite earlier this month. It was a collaboration with the Peacemaker TV series, currently airing, that's written and directed by DC co-boss James Gunn. However, one of the dance emotes that came with the bundle of Peacemaker-based items has been removed following the release of the series's most recent episode, which unveiled a darker truth to what was sold as an emote dance to kids.</p>



<p><em><strong>Spoiler alert for Peacemaker season two episode six</strong></em></p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-pulls-controversial-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite-following-big-twist-in-the-tv-shows-latest-episode">Eurogamer</a>, the 'Peaceful Hips' emote was <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447">removed from the game while Epic investigated</a> "<em>into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote</em>." Refunds were issued to players who purchased the emote preemptively, assuming that the emote would not be added back into the game. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're disabling the Peaceful Hips Emote in Fortnite as we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote. Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks.</p>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The dance, which you can see in the video below, can seem innocent enough out of context. But the context is what counts, and in context, it's clear why the emote was quickly removed.</p>



<p>That context is that in episode six of Peacemaker's second season, the title character discovers he's in an alternate Nazi-run universe, with the dance, specifically how he moves his arms, imitating a swastika. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Peacemaker’s dance emote from Fortnite has been disabled.</p><p>“As we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote. Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days.” <a href="https://t.co/hwHqOiid1o">pic.twitter.com/hwHqOiid1o</a></p></div>— DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) <a href="https://twitter.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1972176095580754324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It seems that James Gunn held back the true meaning of the dance from Epic, and once the truth was revealed during the episode, Epic moved quickly to remove the emote from the game. Gunn even promoted the arrival of Peacemaker in Fortnite in a post on <a href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1967015798939283554">X (formerly Twitter)</a> that, in hindsight, carried more weight than we could've known at the time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Who knows why the dance's meaning wasn't shared before its release in Fortnite. Busy as he is, surely Gunn would have seen updates from Epic as they were creating and animating the dance that would be in the game and available to millions of players, many of them children. It's unclear who at Warner Bros. was aware of this and if anyone at Epic knew what the dance would symbolize. </p>



<p>Gunn must have been aware, to some degree, that Epic would do something about the emote once episode six aired. It could be that this was all meant to be just a publicity stunt, though it'll be curious to see what further implications this stunt has on any future collaborations between Epic and Warner Bros, and if Epic adjusts how it approaches future collaborations with other partners.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New details have been revealed on a new D&amp;D Beyond digital supplement. The Fey-themed <em>Lorwyn: First Light</em>, will bring new player options and adventures to Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024. In addition, it officially brings yet another Magic: The Gathering setting into the fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The Lorwyn: First Light Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2069-add-a-delightful-twist-to-forgotten-realms" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast revealed what players can expect from the <em>Lorwyn: First Light</em> digital supplement. It will contain new Fey-inspired player options and monsters alongside a new Fey Domain of Delight: Lorwyn Shadowmoor.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-first-light-shadowmoor-wilt-leaf-liege-artwork.jpg?itok=Pdpk03_D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorwyn-first-light-shadowmoor-wilt-leaf-liege-artwork.jpg?itok=7Z9LsDkc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those familiar with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>, that name may not be that new. Shadowmoor was introduced to the ubiquitous card game in 2008. It introduced creatures of fables and fairytales living together in a domain of perpetual midsummer. Now, much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-and-magic-gathering-worlds-collide-in-mythic-odysseys-of-theros" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Theros</a>, Ravnica, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/strixhaven-arrives-in-dungeons-and-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Strixhaven</a> before it, this land is now represented in the world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Lorwyn: First Light</em> supplement will contain the following:</p>

<ul><li>2 Backgrounds</li>
	<li>2 Feats</li>
	<li>2 Magic Items</li>
	<li>8 Monsters</li>
	<li>2 New Player Species and Advice on Playing 8 Player Species in the Lorwyn Shadowmoor setting</li>
	<li>2 Adventure Examples and a Map for Both</li>
</ul><p>The official post states that Lorwyn: First Light will be available as part of the Forgotten Realms Ultimate Bundle. This bundle includes physical and digital versions of the upcoming Forgotten Realms supplements alongside two other digital supplements: <em>Astarion's Book of Hungers</em> player supplement and the prewritten adventure <em>Netheril's Fall</em>.</p>

<p>While the bundle contains a lot of material for the latest edition of D&amp;D, it does sit at a considerable MSRP of $159.99. However, in the original announcement for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-details-emerge-on-new-dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-supplements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Forgotten Realms bundle</a>, Wizards of the Coast did confirm the digital supplements would be available as standalone purchases at an MSRP of $14.99. A less daunting price point if you just want the fey-themed material for your table.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-fire-max-11-tablet-hits-lowest-price-yet-ahead-of-prime-big-deal-days-hundreds-cheaper-than-an-ipad-2000627185</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-fire-max-11-tablet-hits-lowest-price-yet-ahead-of-prime-big-deal-days-hundreds-cheaper-than-an-ipad.1311784/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’d be telling you that this limited-time deal on the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet is hot, or that it’s fire, or that it’s a scorcher, but honestly, would you still respect us in the morning? So we’ll dispense with the terrible puns and cut straight to the deal, because it’s one of the better ones we’ve seen in a while on this great, affordable tablet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4376/">It’s 32% off for a limited time, turning a very good $280 price into a great one at just $190.</a></p>
<p>To put things in perspective, the Amazon Fire Max 11 is an 11-inch tablet with an octa-core processor, 14-hour battery life, expandable storage of up to 1TB via microSD card, and 2.4 million pixel resolution. As an Amazon product it blends seamlessly with the rest of the Amazon ecosystem, including Prime Video, Kindle, Audible, and Luna, along with your smart home devices via either Alexa or the Device Dashboard. And here’s the kicker — at this sale price it’s over $700 less than the 11-inch M4 iPad Pro, and $375 less than the 11-inch M3 iPad Air.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4376/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Features, Not Price</h2>
<p>There are probably metrics and benchmark tests that put those pricier iPads ahead of the Fire Max 11, but not nearly enough to quantify the price difference. The octa-core processor at the heard of the Fire Max 11 is certainly no slouch when it comes to streaming, multitasking, and gaming on Luna. The 128GB of storage is small, but so easily and inexpensively expandable thanks to the microSD card slot that the Apple tablets lack.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 speeds, a robust 14-hour battery life, 8MP camera, and options to expand into a more laptop-like experience with the sold-separately Fire Max 11 Keyboard Case — which also happens to be&nbsp;<em>way</em> more affordable than Apple’s Magic Keyboard — all make the Fire Max 11 highly competitive even before you do a price comparison. Once you check out those numbers, this isn’t even a fair contest.</p>



<h2>Beautifully Basic</h2>
<p>When you look at the Fire Max 11 — and this is the latest, most updated iteration of the Fire Max — in the context of being a fully integrated part of the massive Amazon ecosystem, it’s a brilliant tablet, especially for just $190. It’s not going to compete with a laptop as a productivity machine, although this deal does come with a free 3-month Microsoft 365 trial, but as an e-reader, streaming device, smart-home control panel, and light gaming device, it’s an exceptional tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-octa-core-processor-lockscreen/dp/B0B2SFTGQ6?tag=kotaku01-20">This model of the Amazon Fire Max currently on sale for just $190</a> has the max 128GB storage and also comes with lockscreen ads deactivated. The $90 savings on this deal are great, and even greater when you tack them onto the hundreds you save by avoiding the super-bougie competitor tablets.</p>

That’s exactly what’s happened with a partnership to give out free codes for rare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>Shiny Pokémon</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i></a><span>, as scalpers have found a way to ruin something else for everyone.</span></p> <p><span>Here’s what was supposed to happen: from September 26 to October 15, fans who visit GameStops or EB Games locations would be able to get a code to receive either a Shiny Koraidon or Miraidon, the legendary Pokémon that grace </span><i><span>Scarlet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>‘s covers. These alternate-colored variants have never been available before, so if you’re the kind of collector who wants every Shiny, this is a pretty big deal. No purchase was required to get one of these codes; all you had to do was show up at participating locations. However, many fans are reporting that their local stores are running out of codes weeks before the promotion ends next month, and some locations say they won’t be getting more. Some customers report that stores still have codes but have been </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonScarletViolet/comments/1nqg2ay/local_gamestop_shiny_koraidon_and_miraidon/"><span>giving them out only as a promotional item</span></a><span> alongside other purchases, despite the official word on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s website </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/get-shiny-koraidon-or-shiny-miraidon-at-gamestop-and-eb-games"><span>saying no purchase is necessary</span></a><span>.</span></p>   <p><span>Sometimes these events are digital, meaning that you could download an event Pokémon in a store or through the game itself and go on your merry way. But when they involve a physical card with a code on it, supplies actually </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> limited, and when something is limited, a scalper is waiting just around the corner to swoop in. This also happened the same day as a new </span><i><span>Trading Card Game</span></i><span> set drop, so these people smelled blood in the water, and not only got the codes, but have started listing them for sale on places like </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=shiny+koraidon+and+miraidon&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1311"><span>eBay</span></a><span>. Some of the prices are fairly cheap at less than $10, while other sellers are getting bold and asking for much more. Even if the price is cheap, these codes are supposed to be free, so even a dollar is a profit for scalpers.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>As some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFl1XUEqcls">commentators have pointed out</a>, <em>Pokémon </em></span><span>loves brand synergy, which is why every facet of its business releases new products around the same time. The games come out, new TCG sets come out alongside it, and more plushes of new critters show up on the Pokémon Center website, so it makes sense that it would offer these rare Pokémon on the same day people are showing up to game shops to buy the new TCG sets. That said, adding scarcity to a digital good just emboldens some of the worst people to keep taking advantage of other fans. Hopefully, these stores get more codes between now and when the promotion ends in October, because only sending enough for one weekend sounds like poor planning on everyone’s part.</span></p>

              <p>The $55 billion sale of Electronic Arts to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and a group of other private equity investors is a big deal. Some people are going to make a lot of money off it. Others may lose their jobs when the interest bill for the debt-financed portion of the leveraged buyout comes due. CEO Andrew Wilson, who will remain in charge of the <em>Madden</em> and <em>Battlefield</em> publisher even after the sale closes, is thanking his employees.</p> <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">“This moment is a recognition of your creativity, your innovation, and your passion. You have built some of the world’s most iconic IP, created stories that have inspired global communities, and helped shape culture through interactive experiences,” he wrote in a companywide email to staff after the deal was announced on Monday, a copy of which was obtained by <em>Kotaku</em>. “Everything we have achieved–and everything that lies ahead–is because of you.”</p> <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">EA stockholders, which would include Wilson, will receive $210 per share. The executive was granted <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target">$31 million in cash and stock awards</a> for the company’s last fiscal year, up $5 million from the year prior, even as the company laid off rank-and-file employees and hit sales snags in <em>EA Sports FC</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. The 25 percent premium on the company’s mid-August share price comes with a catch, however. A whopping $20 billion of the buyout comes from debt, the interest on which could exceed hundreds of millions of dollars annually, or the budget of multiple AAA blockbusters per year.</p>

 <p>“We are entering a new era of opportunity,” Wilson wrote in his email to staff today. “This is one of the largest and most significant investments ever made in the entertainment industry. Our new partners bring deep experience across sports, gaming, and entertainment. They are committed with conviction to EA–they believe in our people, our leadership, and the long-term vision we are now building together.”</p>

 <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>Our mission at EA to—Inspire The World To Play—continues to guide everything we do. Our values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged. With continued rigor and operational excellence, we can amplify the creativity of our teams, accelerate innovation, and pursue transformative opportunities that position EA to lead the future of entertainment. Together, we’ll create experiences that are bold, expressive, and deeply connected to inspire generations of players around the world.</p> <p>I am excited to continue as CEO, working alongside our leadership team to advance our strategy. United by our vision, we will deliver experiences that transcend platforms and empower players everywhere to create worlds, characters, and stories that are bold, interactive, and deeply connected.</p> <p>Thank you for your creativity, your commitment, and the passion you bring to EA every day. This is a historic moment, and with the support of our new partners, the future we are building together is brighter than ever.</p></blockquote> <p>EA instituted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lp5wtvv7lc2n">a return-to-office policy earlier this year</a> which would require anyone living within 30 miles of an EA office to come in at least three days a week, while others not designated as remote would need to relocate. At the time, Wilson said the goal was to ignite the “kinetic energy that fuels creativity,” but some employees saw it as a way to incentivize more “voluntary” layoffs.</p> <p>Alongside the likelihood of layoffs are questions about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record and the new ownership’s potential impact on creative freedom within the company and public messaging, including its annual Pride events across its various franchises, most notably <em>The Sims</em>. Wilson told staff EA’s “values” will remain unchanged, but didn’t lay out specifically what they are. The sale is set to close in mid-2026 pending shareholder and regulatory reviews.</p>
