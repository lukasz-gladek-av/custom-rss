      <p>If <a href="https://aftermath.site/steel-ball-run-jojos-bizarre-adventure/"><em><u>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</u></em></a> is the gold standard for surreal manga odysseys, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=10205&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Keisuke Itagaki</u></a>’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/baki-hanma-netflix-yujiro-obama-che-guevara-anime-1850741340?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Baki the Grappler</u></em></a> is its bare-knuckled cousin in the martial arts genre. While other formative martial arts manga and their anime adaptations maintain a sense of hyper realism with the fidelity of their fisticuffs, <a href="https://kotaku.com/baki-hanma-netflix-yujiro-obama-che-guevara-anime-1850741340?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Baki</u></em></a>’s manga arcs and Netflix anime adaptations planted its flag as one for the sickos who aren’t here to save the day and just want to fight—no matter how outlandish the reality-breaking terms are.&nbsp;</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>Shonen Champion Comics</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><em>Baki</em> follows <a href="https://baki.fandom.com/wiki/Baki_Hanma?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Baki Hanma</u></a>, a street fighter so obsessed with combat that he treats sanctioned tournaments and back-alley brawls with equal reverence. His goal is to become the strongest being alive—a title currently held by his father, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw5ip70R8xQ&amp;pp=ygUSYmFraSBuZXRmbGl4IGFuaW1l&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Yujiro Hanma</u></a>. Throughout Baki’s pursuit of greatness and his stepping out of his father’s looming shadow, his hero's journey takes him through a gauntlet of increasingly deranged opponents including roided-out brawlers and prehistoric cavemen. All of this is vividly brought to life by Itagaki, who emphasizes and exaggerates human anatomy and the many ways muscles can bend and break. <em>Baki </em>is one of my unapologetic favorites for its ridiculously over-the-top, hype-filled fights, which have been trucking for 35 years now and show no signs of slowing down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xniBk7zAKMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Baki Hanma | Official Trailer | Netflix Anime"></iframe></figure><p>But with every creative comes an editor whose job is to harness, rein in, and cheer on the creator's vivid imagination and keep them from getting lost in the hot pursuit of their ambitions. So, in celebration of the <a href="https://baki-30th.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>manga’s 35th anniversary</u></a>, I spoke with <em>Baki </em>editor and Itagaki’s longtime collaborator Yuki Yokoi about the series' humble beginnings, inspirations, adaptations, and where they plan to take it in the years to come.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="ja" dir="ltr"><p>▏▏▌35周年ッッ、続報に期待せよッッ‼︎ ▌▏▏</p><p>世界最大級のポップカルチャーの祭典<br>ニューヨーク・コミコン2025の<br>「Beyond Baki: Cosplay, Editing &amp; New Challenges」<br>内で、2026年に「刃牙」シリーズが35周年を<br>迎えることが発表されたッッ👊</p><p>今後も続々と様々な展開を予定ッッ💥… <a href="https://t.co/leLTfkIH75?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/leLTfkIH75</a></p></div>— 刃牙35周年プロジェクト【公式】 (@teambaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/teambaki/status/1977540036565328150?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</p><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> First off, congratulations on celebrating <em>Baki’s </em>35th anniversary. Looking back, did you or Keisuke Itagaki envision <em>Baki </em>would become a global phenomenon, especially with its recent resurgence thanks to its Netflix anime adaptation?</p><p><strong>Yuki Yokoi:</strong> Because this work features such unique and compelling characters, I always felt it deserved much more attention both in Japan and around the world. Back around 2010, as the editor in charge, I was driven by a sense of frustration that the series hadn’t yet been discovered internationally. So seeing it finally receive the recognition it truly deserves now feels deeply gratifying.</p><p>As for its adaptation into anime, I believe the theme of “strength”— a concept that transcends language and culture—has been successfully conveyed to audiences worldwide through Netflix’s global platform and its simultaneous release in multiple languages.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTMMdMVFRWE?start=16&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Insanity of Grappler Baki and Why You Should Care"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong><em>Baki</em> is often described as a celebration of human anatomy—sometimes to absolute surreal, obsessive extremes with relation to musculature. How does <em>Baki </em>balance that anatomical intensity with the emotional and philosophical depth of martial arts?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> When it comes to Itagaki-sensei’s detailed depictions of the human body, he does refer to anatomical and medical texts as well as human body atlases. However, his main reference materials are original scrapbooks he’s created himself, filled with cutouts from bodybuilding magazines that show individual muscle groups of various athletes. He keeps these clippings organized by body part, often focusing on the strengths of Mr. Olympia champions and other top competitors.</p><p>Of course, he also watches a wide range of combat sports footage, including UFC and boxing. It’s true that bodybuilding champions dehydrate themselves and push their bodies to the extreme before stepping on stage, which isn’t necessarily healthy. But Itagaki-sensei’s creative drive comes from his own fascination—a desire to depict scenes where those bodybuilder physiques actually fight and prove their strength in battle.</p><figure><blockquote>— 刃牙35周年プロジェクト【公式】 (@teambaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/teambaki/status/1702630665722953830?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">September 15, 2023</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>The series continues to evolve with new arcs and characters that somehow trump the last arc’s grand spectacle. What’s the secret that keeps <em>Baki </em>going strong after all these years?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> I believe the secret behind the series’ constant evolution lies entirely in the appeal of the characters that Itagaki-sensei creates. When he studied under manga master <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuo_Koike?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kazuo Koike</u></a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuo_Koike?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Gekiga Sonjuku</u></a>, a school that taught the art and methodology of storytelling, he learned the principle “If the character stands out—if it’s truly compelling—the work will sell.” Because of this, Itagaki-sensei often refers to himself as a “character craftsman.”</p><p>The worlds he builds are filled with these kinds of unforgettable characters — people who, the moment they appear, inevitably bring drama with them. As new and equally powerful personalities continue to emerge, the story’s momentum and vitality are constantly renewed.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Were there any narrative paths that were considered early in the series that were ultimately avoided to instead be the series fans know today?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> I once heard from the very first editor in charge that the initial draft of <em>Grappler Baki </em>actually began with a scene of Baki spending an ordinary day at school. If the series had started that way, perhaps the <em>Baki </em>saga might have taken a very different path.</p><figure><blockquote>— 刃牙35周年プロジェクト【公式】 (@teambaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/teambaki/status/1967845913529102693?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">September 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> How did you and Itagaki feel seeing <em>Baki </em>gain traction in the West? Were there any unexpected reactions or cultural interpretations of its characters and tales that stood out to you?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>This may be similar to my earlier answer, but since this series is filled with such distinctive and fascinating characters and revolves around the universal theme of “strength,” which resonates across the world, I strongly believed it would find success once it could finally be delivered to North American audiences in an accessible way. I had confidence that it would become popular once people had the chance to see it.</p><p>That said, since the anime adaptation available on Netflix begins with the second part of <em>Baki The Grappler</em>, I expected that some viewers might feel a bit lost without knowing the first part of the story. However, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that many fans had already found ways to experience the first part through other means.</p><figure><blockquote>— Netflix Japan | ネットフリックス (@NetflixJP) <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixJP/status/1963939407855046922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Now that the first part has officially begun publication as an English-language comic, I sincerely hope that North American readers will pick it up as well—not only to fill in the missing parts of the story, but to experience the full scope of the <em>Baki </em>universe from its very beginning.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>With new manga adaptations and special editions of <em>Baki </em>rolling out, what’s the guiding principle behind these expansions? Are they meant to recontextualize the story or simply offer fresh entry points for longtime and newcomer fans alike? Aside from new translations and lettering, will there be any textual changes or addenda to the original manga in these editions, or is the goal more about preservation and presentation?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> It’s the latter meaning. <em>The Grappler Baki</em> published this time by <a href="https://x.com/KodamaTales?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kodama </u></a>represents the beginning of the <em>Baki </em>series, a story arc that has not yet been streamed on Netflix as part of the anime adaptation.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today is the official release day of Keisuke Itagaki's Baki the Grappler by <a href="https://twitter.com/KodamaTales?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@KodamaTales</a>!!

</figure><p>For fans who discovered the series through the anime, this release serves as a way to fill in the missing parts of the story, while for longtime readers already familiar with it, it provides an opportunity to own a high-quality, official publication.</p><p>This edition is based on the complete edition format released in Japan and has been produced using Japan’s high-standard printing and paper quality, ensuring that it can be appreciated as a collectible item by dedicated fans.</p><figure><blockquote>— Kodama (@KodamaTales) <a href="https://twitter.com/KodamaTales/status/1973467084651896981?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">October 1, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong><em>Baki</em>’s Muhammad Ali tribute from Yujiro Hanma was a powerful moment, framing him not just as a fighter but as a symbol of resistance against racial injustice. What inspired that reflection, and how do you and Itagaki see Baki’s role in engaging with political themes?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>Itagaki-sensei himself once competed as a boxing athlete, even being selected to participate in a national sports event for Japan, and his deep passion for the sport heavily influenced his creative vision. The character Yujiro Hanma, born from that admiration for boxing’s greatest stars and Itagaki-sensei’s own ideal of strength, was developed with the intention of showing mutual respect and recognition between Yujiro and real-world fighters — a way to bring the character vividly to life.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8CcYYVplX2o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Yujiro Hanma Respected Muhammad Ali"></iframe></figure><p>In Japan, manga historically began as something like a casual pastime—something you could finish reading during a single train ride, much like a piece of cheap candy you enjoy in passing. Because of that, Itagaki-sensei often says that manga must remain accessible and easy for anyone to understand.</p><p>Rather than delving into political or social themes, his work has always focused on the universal and timeless theme of “strength”—a quality that everyone, regardless of background or culture, can aspire to and be moved by.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> As a series, <em>Baki </em>has featured <a href="https://x.com/minedo_r/status/1892493589613051990?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>several presidential cameos</u></a> over the years. Is there a decisive favorite for Itagaki? What went into the decision to craft those moments as mainstays chronicling its sprawling stories alongside American presidential administrations?</p><p>The current president of the U.S., Donald Trump, is<a href="https://x.com/DaFeenom/status/1224426904079470593?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u> no stranger to manga cameos</u></a> with the likes of the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/donald-trump-death-note-manga-election-2024-2000520605?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Death Note</em> one-shot</u></a>. However, his recent cameo in <em>Baki</em> stirred quite a bit of buzz in the West. Can you share what inspired that inclusion and how it was approached tonally and artistically? Was there fear of blowback from how extreme it might’ve been taken in comparison to other presidential cameos in the series?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> I haven’t really heard Itagaki-sensei mention having a particular “favorite” president character. The depiction of Yujiro Hanma having a personal treaty with the United States was created as a way to express the overwhelming power and larger-than-life presence of his character. As a result, that idea has been carried forward and reinterpreted with each new U.S. president portrayed in the story.</p><p>Each depiction reflects Itagaki-sensei’s imaginative interpretation of how a real-world leader might react if they were to actually encounter someone like Yujiro Hanma. While, of course, it is entirely fictional, Itagaki-sensei is always careful not to portray the real individuals in a disrespectful manner, instead crafting these moments as character-driven episodes meant to entertain and enrich the world of the story.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TsK2IhO-gXc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Baki Hanma VS Kengan Ashura OP | Fly High by ATARASHII GAKKO! | Netflix Anime"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>With <em>Kengan Ashura</em> often mentioned in the same breath as <em>Baki</em>,<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baki-hanma-vs-kengan-ashura-review?ref=aftermath.site"><u> culminating in a crossover exhibition for both fandoms in the books</u></a>, what kind of clashes would you love to see between <em>Baki </em>and other popular fighting manga universes?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> <em>Baki </em>and <em>Kengan Ashura </em>are both Netflix Original anime series, and since <em>Kengan Ashura</em>’s creator, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=165156&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Yabako Sandrovich</u></a>, is a longtime fan of the <em>Baki </em>series, the collaboration came about quite naturally. The project was also made possible thanks to the close working relationship between editor <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=232520&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Sho Kobayashi</u></a> and myself, which allowed the idea to take shape smoothly.</p><p>If future opportunities arise with works that share a similar tone and creative connection, I would definitely like to pursue more collaborations like that.</p><p>On a personal note, since Itagaki-sensei once worked on the manga adaptation of <em>Garouden</em>—which also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garouden-the-way-of-the-wolf-review-netflix?ref=aftermath.site"><u>has a Netflix Original adaptation</u></a>—I would love to see a crossover story between those worlds someday. Of course, that’s purely my own wish as a fan.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know?

</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Fans have been clamoring to see <em>Baki </em>in a fighting game—be it <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Tekken</em>, or even <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. If you could choose one fighting game to feature a <em>Baki </em>guest appearance, which would it be and why?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>If I had to choose just one, I would say <em>Tekken</em>, in terms of narrative compatibility. The series shares a core storyline centered around a father–son conflict, which makes it feel thematically aligned with <em>Baki</em>.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> If you had to sum up the spirit of <em>Baki</em>’s future in one word or phrase, what would it be?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>Perhaps the right word would be “expansion.” Itagaki-sensei continues to extend the story vertically by drawing new chapters, while at the same time, we are developing numerous spinoffs that broaden the world horizontally. Various forms of media adaptations are also currently in preparation, allowing fans to experience and enjoy the <em>Baki </em>series through multiple touchpoints.</p><p>In addition, we are planning a range of merchandising initiatives that will let fans engage with the series on a deeper level. Through these efforts, we aim to expand the universe of <em>Baki </em>and create many different ways for audiences to immerse themselves in its world.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>As <em>Baki </em>enters a new era in 2026, what can fans expect in terms of tone, themes, character evolutions, or showcasing of martial arts yet to be featured in the series?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>&nbsp;The latest series in the original manga saga, Part 6: <a href="https://baki.fandom.com/wiki/Baki_Rahen?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Baki Rahen</u></em></a>, is currently being serialized. In this installment, the story focuses on new battles and developments among the characters surrounding Baki. Within it, <a href="https://baki.fandom.com/wiki/Jack_Hanma?ref=aftermath.site#:~:text=He%20received%20from%20him%20a,him%20even%20more%20mentally%20unstable."><u>Jack Hammer</u></a> has established a new fighting style known as “Goudou” (the Way of Biting). In this way, there is a strong possibility that previously-introduced characters will continue to evolve, developing new techniques and fighting methods in their ongoing pursuit of strength.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_berseria_remastered">Tales of Berseria Remastered</a>, which will be coming to Switch on <strong>27th February 2026</strong> for <strong>$39.99 / £34.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right, this is <em>not</em> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/tales_of_xillia_2">Tales of Xillia 2</a>, which series director <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/tales-of-xillia-2-remastered-on-the-way-with-more-to-come">Yusuke Tomizawa previously teased was "still in progress"</a>, just not formally announced. Guess we'll have to wait a bit longer for that one...</p>
<p>Still, Berseria is a <em>bit</em> of a surprise, given that it's available on PC and PS4 (and PS3 in Japan). So it's relatively accessible, unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Graces f</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Xillia</a>, which were stuck on the PS3.</p>
<p>But hey, Tales of Berseria is a good one! It's also much darker than the other games in the series, following Velvet on a quest for revenge after she's struck by tragedy at the hands of a person she trusts. The Remastered version will bring with it various quality-of-life enhancements, early access to the Grade Shop, map icons, the ability to turn off encounters, and access to a bunch of DLC.</p>


<p>The cast is great, the combat is great, and we're excited to try it on Switch. Of course, expect the usual caveats with the Switch port such as 30fps. When will one of these get a dedicated Switch 2 version, Bamco?</p>
<p>Tales of Berseria originally released back in 2017 in the West, and it got a great review from out sister site Push Square, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/tales_of_berseria">who scored it an 8/10</a>.</p>

			<p>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord developer TaleWorlds Entertainment is set to release the biggest expansion yet for its strategy action game. War Sails, which adds naval combat to the ever-expanding war sandbox within Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord. The new expansion <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-sails-naval-expansion-mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-out-november-26/">will launch a week from the time of this writing, on November 26, 2025</a>, and ahead of that launch, TaleWorlds Entertainment has debuted a new gameplay trailer showing off the kinds of intense naval battles players will take part in.</p>



<p>The new eight-and-a-half-minute gameplay showcase shows a battle between the latest faction entering the game, the Nords, and the Khuzaits in a nighttime river battle.</p>

<p>The battle is an impressive display of what's to come for Mount and Blade II fans, with a whole new combat element arriving in the game for the first time. When War Sails arrives next week, it'll be available on all platforms simultaneously and can be purchased for $24.99.</p>



<p>For players not purchasing the expansion, there will be a free update going live that same day, adding a slew of updates and fixes to the game for all players, including overhauled mission atmospheres, overhauled spear bracing, improvements to melee, ranged, and cavalry combat, expanded modding capabilities, and more.</p>



<p>If you are purchasing the expansion, then you'll be able to build your naval fleet with 20 unique ships, including 15 warships, four trading ships and one civilian fishing vessel across an expanded Calradia. All of the ships are modelled after historic examples of medieval ships, and players will be able to undertake a naval campaign as part of the new expansion, where you'll be battling the elements as much as you are battling enemy fleets.</p>



<p>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord is already a cinematic action strategy experience with its epic ground battles, so this step into naval warfare is the next natural evolution of its sandbox gameplay. We'll see how it lands with players when War Sails arrives next week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In one particularly memorable sequence in <em>Demonschool </em>— the new tactical RPG from Necrosoft that, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/764346/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-game-delays-cloverpit-faeland-aeterna-lucis">after a few hiccups</a>, releases on November 19th — I throw a doll at a zombie’s head, dispatch it with a roundhouse kick to the jowls as I watch my friends sweep demons off the floor in vortices of blood, and celebrate by returning to town and petting a dog. All in the name of passing a college assignment that I’m juggling alongside deciphering a millennia-old apocalyptic prophecy and making new friends.</p><p>For <em>Demonschool</em>’s demon-hunting protagonist, Faye, that would all preferably be achieved by kicking the apocalypse, and coursework, into submission across 10 in-game weeks of reference-laden gore.</p><p>Necrosoft isn’t shy about those inspirations, either. Launching from a setup that screams <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, a color palette ripped from Dario Argento’s <em>Suspiria</em>, and a smörgåsbord of horror — your first in-game quest is to track down a videotape that kills you within three days of viewing — <em>Demonschool </em>injects its own philosophy into what it draws from what’s come before. If “take your time” in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3">Persona 5</a></em>, another of <em>Demonschool</em>’s many influences, felt more like a threat in a 100-plus-hour game, <em>Demonschool</em>’s deployment of the phrase is more sincere. There’s no time pressure to its main quest and, but for a few rhythmic missteps, the time you spend in <em>Demonschool </em>is yours to do with as you will.</p><p>That time will be split between two things. The first: exploring an island and engaging with its increasingly eerie residents — including a child whose ambition is to grow up to be a bench — and the comic interludes you and your growing band of new pals consistently wind up in. Upon arriving on the island, for instance, Faye drags reluctant new best friend Namako to explore, only to end up in a fight with local thugs (a hobby of Faye’s we’ll revisit shortly). “We’re hitting the town,” she tells Namako. “Pretend those guys are the town!”</p><p>The rest will be spent in <em>Demonschool</em>’s rendition of grid- and turn-based combat, with a focus on positional gameplay, where you’ll be maneuvering characters behind enemies. Faye’s basic attack pushes enemies back a square — enemy attacks can similarly influence your position — while Namako can phase through demons and drag them toward her original position. Drive enemies between characters and you can unleash a powerful combo; do enough damage and you can access characters’ special moves. Tactical combat becomes a string of considerations of how to maneuver enemies into your line of attack and stay out of range of their (often devastating given characters’ limited health) rebuttals.</p><p>That’s just the “planning phase.” The “action phase” follows, in which everything you’ve made your characters do is played out and, in the right combinations, sees your team weave around one another in cinematic — and cool-as-hell — ballets of punching, kicking, and arcane magic.</p><p>It lends a directorial bent to already tactically deep gameplay, as you decide not just what will finish a fight but how to look good while doing it. Which is fortunate, because you will be getting into <em>a lot </em>of fights. Getting to know your friends? Time for a fight. Completing an incremental step of a weekly assignment? Fight. Taking a break with a side quest? Fight. Going to the restroom? Fight… with 50 ghosts.</p><p>This isn’t unusual for an RPG, though these are unavoidable scripted events rather than random encounters, nor are these battles especially hard. But not being able to move to a new screen without running into a fight can get old fast. It only took me until the second week to toggle on the “almost invincible” accessibility option — <em>Demonschool </em>lets you rewind your movements and restart battles without penalty to clean up mistakes, too — just for a cognitive break while encountering fights every few minutes.</p><p>There’s a hint of self-awareness about the frequency of fights, which <em>are </em>occasionally refreshed as you develop new skills and find new companions, as Namako early on bemoans not being able to walk into Temsk’s cemetery without being ambushed by gangsters and the undead (yeah, Namako, I know how you feel).</p><p>The weight of that specific frustration is lessened, however, by everything else <em>Demonschool </em>offers. Let’s be honest: main quests are fine, but I’d rather decorate my clubhouse with friends, explore Temsk’s nightlife, and pull demon fish from the depths in a now-obligatory-in-RPGs fishing minigame.</p><p>There is a refreshing lack of extravagance to this side content, especially compared to where Necrosoft draws its inspiration from. Like all good high school horror, <em>Demonschool </em>is less about fighting the big bad than bringing together a found family of complex and relatable misfits to do so. In its straightforward approach to this aspect of <em>Demonschool</em>, Necrosoft not only lets its writing — particularly of its characters, who genuinely develop and grow — shine through, but also relieves potential for frustration. But for the odd misplaced karaoke lyric, if you spend time with your friends you become closer to them.</p><p><em>Demonschool </em>has rough edges, particularly in how it balances its excellent writing with slightly-too-frequent (though still interesting) combat. But in its open approach to its influences — while avoiding feeling like a lesser copy — its wit, and its charm, it builds a unique identity from its melting pot of inspirations to leave its deficiencies far outweighed by how much there is to love.</p><p><sub>Demonschool <em>launches on November 19th on the Switch, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTgxMTk="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Geoffrey Bunting</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/770090/demonschool-review-switch-xbox-ps5]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/snag-the-lego-thestral-family-set-for-just-49-after-a-30-discount-at-amazon-2000645216</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-harry-potter-thestral-drops-to-almost-free-ahead-of-black-friday-early-shoppers-are-already-draining-stock.1358128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Harry Potter introduced us to a whole bunch of cool (and scary) creatures, but few are as quietly haunting as the Thestrals. In fact, these bat-winged creatures are only visible to those who have witnessed or processed death. And now, thanks to LEGO, you can bring a pair home – that too for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5694/">The Thestral Family set usually retails for $70, but we just spotted it for 30% off on Amazon, which drops the price to just $49</a>. It makes a great holiday gift for the Potterhead in your life, or even a fun treat for yourself if you’re looking to bring key elements of the Wizarding World home. Just note that Amazon has listed it as a limited-time markdown, which is why we highly recommend getting your orders in quickly. The sale is likely going to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5694/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Attention to Detail</h2>
<p>This set is designed for ages 10 and up. You get a total of 548 pieces, which come together to build two posable Thestrals (one adult and one baby), plus a mini Forbidden Forest tree. With under 550 pieces, it won’t exactly be a large project you need to dedicate your entire weekend to, but also not too short.</p>
<p>The attention to detail is impressive on the creatures with striking skeletal forms and distinctive bat-like features. The adult Thestral stands over 9.5 inches tall, and even both come with fabric wings that fold out for flight poses. The head, legs, and wings are articulated, meaning kids can adjust them according to the scene they are trying to recreate. Maybe fold out the wings when it’s roaming through the Forbidden Forest casually, or keep them up when it senses a threat nearby!</p>



<p>Speaking of the Forbidden Forest, the small tree adds to the atmosphere, pulling the set together nicely. Like all LEGO sets, this one comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. It’s quite easy to follow, but if you also have the option to install the LEGO Builder app for 3D instructions. It lets you zoom in on each step, see it from all angles, track your progress, and more.</p>
<p>All things considered, this set can be a great holiday gift for a Harry Potter fan in your life, and you can even get it for yourself. Just be sure to grab it up before the sale expires.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-clears-its-macbook-air-m4-to-new-all-time-low-now-officially-2x-cheaper-than-macbook-pro-2000645418</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-clears-its-macbook-air-m4-to-new-all-time-low-now-officially-2x-cheaper-than-macbook-pro.1358125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple doesn’t do Black Friday promotions, at least on its official website. It prefers to keep prices premium while offloading inventory quietly through Amazon during big sales events. That way, the company preserves its brand image and still moves units at competitive prices via third-party retailers. For Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">the 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage drops down to $749 on Amazon from its usual list price of $999</a>, an all-time low. That pricing makes the Air officially half the cost of the base MacBook Pro at $1,599 and creates a value gap which is impossible to ignore.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Performance Without the Pro Price Tag</h2>
<p>The M4 chip brings Apple’s recent silicon architecture to the Air lineup and delivers performance that rivals many Pro models. An eight-core CPU tackles multiple browser tabs and video calls simultaneously without the lag that plagues older Intel-based laptops. The ten-core GPU pushes enough power for casual gaming, 4K video editing in Final Cut Pro and 3D modeling in lighter applications like SketchUp. <strong>Apple Intelligence features run entirely on-device through the Neural Engine</strong> and it processes requests locally rather than sending data to cloud servers for privacy-conscious computing.</p>
<p>The 16GB of unified memory is double what Apple was offering in base configurations just two years ago and finally provides some headroom for professional workflows without forcing upgrades that can get very costly. The unified architecture allows CPU and GPU to share this pool of memory dynamically and allocates resources where they’re needed, rather than partitioning the RAM into separate zones.</p>



<p>The<strong> Liquid Retina display measures 13.6 inches, with a resolution of 2560 by 1664 pixels</strong> and up to 500 nits of brightness. That makes text and colors sharp enough for both content creation and consumption. True Tone automatically adjusts white balance according to ambient lighting to reduce eye strain during long work sessions. The screen supports P3 wide color gamut for displaying more saturated colors compared to standard sRGB panels, which makes photo editing and design work quite accurate.</p>
<p>This 256GB SSD has enough storage for operating system files, essential applications, and a working library of current projects, although creative professionals accumulating large photo or video libraries will want more external storage. Apple’s SSD delivers sequential read speeds of over 2000MB/s, launching applications and opening files almost instantly under heavy workloads that keep laptops responsive. The speed difference between SSDs and traditional hard drives is still dramatic, eliminating much waiting that used to characterize older laptops.</p>



<p>Going easier,<strong> it lasts up to 18 hours on light tasks like surfing the web</strong> or working in documents – a full workday plus evening use without having to hunt for chargers. It’s about 15 hours of video playback which should get you through the longest cross-country flights with runtime to spare. The fanless design ensures it runs silent no matter your workload, pulling off what Windows ultraportables promise but seldom deliver without thermal throttling or whine.</p>
<p>You’re getting M4 performance, 16GB of memory, Apple Intelligence integration, and that <strong>build quality that keeps MacBooks functional for 6-plus years for $749</strong>. That’s half of what the entry MacBook Pro costs, despite minimal real-world performance differences for the average user.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FromSoftware games are confusing at the best and easiest of times. Elden Ring’s huge popularity and mainstream breakthrough have meant that more eyes are on the company’s ambiguous storytelling than ever. If you’ve ever wanted to understand the nitty-gritty of Elden Ring, YouTuber VaatiVidya has explained all.</p>



<p>You might not have heard the name VaatiVidya, but if you’ve any interest in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-expansion-dlc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a>, you need to. The YouTuber has racked up over 3 million subscribers on YouTube and has become popular for their Elden Ring lore explainer videos. Well, that visual and audio content is now coming to the written medium in the form of a new (and somewhat pricey) book.</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-lore-in-book-form">Elden Ring Lore, In Book Form</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Quality. Credit to VaatiVidya</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://youtube.com/post/Ugkxxl2QfRJDpRsk_HP0kzlQBg9jYy1PQU6D?si=9X2K9FGpqhQWFArG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VaatiVidya</a> used their YouTube channel to deliver a proud statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“So…I’m writing a book! An interpretation of Elden Ring’s lore. It’s my YouTube channel in physical form, and it’s called “Lore Bound”. Preorders are available at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=backstage_event&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbTBNU0lNQkVOYmVHUGVRYTMxY1N6dmw4dWtLQXxBQ3Jtc0trc2wwX2FOUGtXTEwwblRKQS1sQXlXbmlHNDBnSXc1bHFfTy1GZU5HcGcyendQdG1MbHl0YjZISGo3dElHTzZBU3FkQjRIeEZMMnlxNDZWLXV3N0VNYkVpLXkxZGpKRDhLeHRwaFY3SmFTb2dhUEpSbw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tuneandfairweather.com%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://www.tuneandfairweather.com</a> This book will bind together everything I’ve learned from Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree, and Nightreign into one single volume. My old video scripts will be updated, new illustrations will be commissioned, and every effort will be made to ensure each page is clear and engaging.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From characters to areas of the land, the book will be an all-encompassing encyclopedia of Elden Ring lore, knowledge, and explanations.</p>



<p>Prices start at $42 for the softcover edition, reach $95 for the deluxe edition, and ask as much as $144 for the full bundle. If you have doubts about the content or the nature of the book, the ‘Lore Bound: Elden Ring Explained (free digital sampler)’ might pique your interest as it gives you a digital copy of one whole chapter—free of charge.</p>



<p>If you’re an Elden Ring fan, it might be worth purchasing. You must wait until at least Q3 2026 for the book, but it should be one of the most in-depth Elden Ring books and lore explainers to date.</p>



<p>Will you buy it? Is it the perfect gift for all ER fans?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-goes-much-farther-than-the-hd-2d-remakes.1358119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I like to think of the mainline Dragon Quest series sort of like a donut. A donut may have sprinkles on top, be glazed, or maybe tied in a knot, depending on where you get it, but at its heart, you know what to expect when you bite into one. You know you will get a delightful treat of fried dough, sweet, and usually covered with some sort of other goodies, and in Dragon Quest’s case, you know you can expect a grindy turn-based RPG, the distinctive designs of Akira Toriyama, and the vexation that comes with trying to dispatch smiling metallic blobs. That familiarity is comforting and the differences exciting, all at the same time. Dragon Quest is the same way, and even after nearly 40 years, even the latest entries all these years later, feel like a DQ game. After sinking my teeth into the upcoming Dragoon Quest VII Reimagined, slaying slimes and solving mysteries, this latest looks to retain that same DQ goodness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined marks the third iteration of Dragon Quest VII, the best-selling entry in Japan, following the original 2001 PlayStation release just before the PS2, and the mid-2010s 3DS remake. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined Release Date Trailer - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Running around the dreary village of Wetlock, where my demo took place, I got a good look at the new art style of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined in action. Coming off the sprite-based goodness of the HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy remakes of Dragon Quests I &amp; II, seeing this new handcrafted style was quite a spectacle. The use of real-world materials as textures in the clothing and gear of the main characters, thanks to the highly detailed puppets that were made and scanned in, gives this version of DQVII, and Prince Kiefer’s broad chin, a distinct vibe and feeling all of its own.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The use of real-world materials as textures in the clothing and gear of the main characters, thanks to the highly detailed puppets that were made and scanned in, gives this version of DQVII, and Prince Kiefer’s broad chin, a distinct vibe and feeling all of its own.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to Reimagined’s producer, Takeshi Ichikawa, he explained that this shift in style was done to better capture the unique proportions and style that the characters in Dragon Quest VII have. “They're drawn shorter than the other mainline Dragon Quest characters. So we kind of wanted to leverage that. We explored a lot of ideas of visual styles that leverage the adorableness and the cuteness of those short characters.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking out my reverence for sprite-based games, the new style of Reimagined is impressive, but at least for me, it took some getting used to, and one that I’m not entirely sold on just yet. As you might expect from a DQ game, the distinctive art of Akira Toriyama is expertly rendered in this new way, but with representations of real-world materials such as the weave that made up the Bag O’ Laughs enemy, or more pronounced scales, felt… odd? It’s hard to describe, but it’s that “off” feeling whenever you see a more realistic version of your favorite cartoon or anime character, like seeing actual hair strands on Goku. Okay, maybe it isn’t that level of odd, but you get my point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also noticed that the colors seemed rather muted compared to what I’ve come to expect from these games and Toriyama’s Dragon Quest work. The green of the hero’s little hat and outfit that I am used to being a vibrant spring-time green looked more like the color of a cloak – like what a sneaky elfish ranger may wear when trying to be seen among the brush, for instance. I’m also a bit bummed that we are losing out on party members changing their appearance based on the vocation they have equipped that was featured in the 3DS version, but I imagine making that many outfits for the puppets would have taken a considerable amount of time to do, and then scan in for the game, so I’m willing to forgive that one. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Trimming the Fat</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Square previously mentioned that, for Reimagined, the team removed non-critical storylines and other content, including Grondal, El Ciclo, Providence, the Casino, and more, to streamline the experience and make it more approachable. One area that the team has paid special attention to is the opening few hours, which, speaking from experience, really drag on, with your first encounter with a slime not coming until close to three hours in. It was a barrier that caused even Ichikawa-san to give up the game back when he first played it as a child in elementary school. Thankfully, he promises that you will be slaying your first critter within an hour of starting up the game this time. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I realize hearing terms like “streamlining” or “more approachable” – along with the mention of cut content – may be off-putting to hear for some folks, or even causing some to be concerned that Reimagined will be a “diet” version of Dragon Quest VII. Obviously, the small snippet I did get to try out doesn’t give me much insight into how the cut and adjusted narrative content impacts things. At least from a gameplay standpoint, Reimagined feels just like a Dragon Quest game should, with the new mechanics and features feeling right at home.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Get a Second Job</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Quest VII is part of the small and exclusive club of series, alongside the likes of Dragon Quests VI, IX, and III, that features a vocation system that lets you swap around the jobs, and as a result, the abilities of your party members. Reimagined further expands on this with the introduction of Moonlighting, which allows each character to have not just one, but two jobs, with abilities to pick from and level up, giving me flashbacks to Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age. I am a self-admitted job-system sicko, and even though a ton of jobs were still locked and hidden in the snippet I played, I could have easily spent my entire time tinkering around with different combinations of roles and seeing how they played off of each other. I appreciated that Reimagined also clearly shows what the requirements are to unlock new vocations, too, meaning I will be able to really target the ones I want when Reimagined  releases!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After fights, I would earn vocation points that act as experience that will level up whatever ones I had equipped. It looks like Reimagined pulls from the 3DS version’s school of vocations, as my characters could only use skills of the jobs they had equipped.  Vocations also come with associated “Perks” —special actions they can take when specific criteria are met, essentially a Limit Break of sorts. These can be big attacks, heals, or buffs that will help you turn the tide of particularly nasty boss fights, which Dragon Quest games are never lacking in. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Finding Fragments</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The aspect of Reimagined that I was most interested in checking out and seeing how this latest version would handle was the magical fragments, which are, debatably, the most defining mechanic of this seventh installment. These artifacts, which you collect and then stick together like LEGO to reveal new locations to visit, can be a real pain to find. The previous 3DS remake had a special finder on the system’s bottom screen that would alert you when one was nearby, and really eliminated a good bit of the frustration and headache from tracking the suckers down, so I was really curious how this new game would address it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This time around, fragments simply will show up on your minimap. When you collect them, they will appear greyed out, alongside a support system with the strange Caretaker and adjusted locations for the pesky tablets to make the whole hunt easier. I do hope there is still some challenge in finding fragments in the final release. I don’t need to feel like Indiana Jones uncovering a long-lost and forgotten artifact, but I don’t want to feel like a toddler picking out the square from an assortment of circles and triangles either. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tweaked for You</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There were other handy little tweaks and additions that aided me in my quest to discover missing townsfolk around Wetlock. I stumbled on special Goddess statues that I could save and heal at, which made them far more attractive spots to do some level and job grinding. Reimagined brings over some of the help options from the HD-2D remakes, like being able to toggle fully healing when a character levels up and adjustable difficulty settings, among others, to help bring this tale into the modern era with modern expectations. One unfortunate feature that Ichikawa-san and the team weren’t able to work out was a good way to use the lizard-gecko creature in this new game, never making it past early discussions on how you could utilize this creature. But at least our favorite little critter has made its triumphant return to the character art for the hero after being completely absent from the 3DS release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Dragon Quest VII first came to the West in 2001, a year after the PlayStation 2 was released, its dated sprites on 3D backgrounds were competing with the evolutionary leap of the RPG in Final Fantasy X that same year. The 3DS version suffered a similar though not as troublesome, release window in the States, coming to the aging handheld a mere six months before the Switch would begin its campaign to conquer the world with the likes of Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Super Mario Odyssey, and a little game called The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, redefining what was possible with a handheld gaming device. Dragon Quest VII Reimagined marks the first time that this story is being told from a standpoint of being already outdated on arrival in the West. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After my 45 minutes were up, I had successfully solved the mystery of the disappearing citizens of Wetlock, climbed to the top of a tower to avoid a devastating flood, and vanquished the monster behind it. All in all, a typical day in the life of a Dragon Quest hero and his friends. While many aspects of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined are still a mystery, all of those special little qualities and personalities that have kept this series going for almost 40 years are still on display. I am eager to see all that this new version has to offer and just how the removal of some story beats and addition of new ones impacts the overall campaign, along with what the new gameplay mechanics bring to the Dragon Quest DNA. 2026 may just be the year that the rest of the world really sees what has made Dragon Quest VII the best-selling entry over in Japan, giving it the stage to finally shine.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-goes-much-farther-than-the-hd-2d-remakes]]></content:encoded>

"Protrusions on its forehead, chest, back, and the backs of its hands are where the electric energy is particularly concentrated. The protrusions steadily emit a pale blue light. If Zeraora stores up lots of energy and then unleashes attacks, those attacks will pack enough power to take down multiple nearby opponents at once."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-trailer-reveals-release-date">previous trailer for Z-A's Mega Dimension DLC debuted designs for Mega Chimecho and Mega Baxcalibur</a>.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a> return this December, but how were the nominees selected and who determines the games that actually win? And does the public have any say? All of these are questions you might be wondering ahead of the event next week, and here's what we know about the key details.</p><h2><strong>What games are eligible?</strong></h2><p>To be <a href="https://thegameawards.com/faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eligible</a> for The Game Awards this year, games must be "available for public consumption" on or before Friday, November 21. Any game releases after then will be eligible for next year's show. This also means that games released on or after November 22, 2024 are eligible for this year's event.</p><p>Live-service games that released in a previous year are eligible for all categories, provided the voting jury determines that "their inclusion is merited due to new content, improvements, or service updates." There is also a dedicated category, Best Ongoing Game, which recognizes such titles.</p><h2><strong>How are nominees selected?</strong></h2><p>The Game Awards website states that an international jury of more than 100 media and influencer sources--including GameSpot--form a coalition that votes to decide on the nominees.</p><p>"Each voting outlet completes a confidential, unranked ballot based on the collective and diverse opinion of its entire editorial staff, listing out its top five choices in each category," reads a line from the website.</p><p>Ballots are counted and the five games that appear the most on ballots get selected as the nominees. Any category that comes up tied gets pushed to six (or more) nominations. This year, there were six nominees for multiple categories, including Game of the Year, Best Performance, Best Independent Game, and Best Family Game.</p><p>For the eSports, accessibility, and Best Adaptation categories, a "specialized" jury comes together to select those categories.</p><h2>How are winners selected?</h2><p>The Game Awards are ultimately decided upon by the same voting jury, but public fan voting factors in as well, which is why you may have seen developers call upon their fandoms to vote for their game. The voting jury controls 90% of the vote, with public fan voting making up the other 10%.</p><p>People can vote on The Game Awards website, or in China, people can make their selections on Bilibili. Voting closes on Wednesday, December 10 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET.</p><p>Some have called on The Game Awards to adopt a 100% pubic fan vote stance where the fans have all the say, but the organizers say this would create "several challenges."</p><p>"First, given that some games are exclusive to one platform, a public vote puts single-platform games at an inherent disadvantage over multi-platform titles. In addition, it is important that winners cannot be socially engineered in any way. We find that a blended vote is the most credible and authentic way to select winners," the team said.</p><h2><strong>No fees</strong></h2><p>All games are "automatically eligible" for The Game Awards, with no submission process at all, and this means there is no fee for a publisher or developer to put their game forth for consideration. "The Game Awards strongly believes that no game developer or publisher should have to pay to have a game considered for nomination," the team said. Not every awards show works this way, as developers/publishers <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/gamescom-award" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pay to have their games considered at the Gamescom Awards</a>, starting at €440 ($508 USD).</p><h2><strong>Is Geoff Keighley involved?</strong></h2><p>Geoff Keighley is the creator and host of The Game Awards, but he is not a member of the voting jury. He has been very public about his close friendship with Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima, which has raised some eyebrows over the years at The Game Awards.</p><h2><strong>Other bias concerns</strong></h2><p>The Game Awards is funded, in part, by sponsors--some of whom have games in the running for awards. The organizers claim "there is no connection" between sponsorship and nominations/awards. The voting jury is "wholly unaware of who is sponsoring or participating in other elements of the program," according to The Game Awards. The group also claims that the nominees and winners are not shared with the developers beforehand, with teams finding out "at the same time as the public."</p><p>"The Game Awards does not disclose winners in advance of the live ceremony. There are no exceptions to this rule," the group said.</p><hr><p>The Game Awards will be held on December 11, and streamed live around the world. In addition to naming all the award winners, the event promises game announcements, trailers, and other reveals.</p>

                <p>Developer Sucker Punch Productions has revealed a new patch for the open-world samurai sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a> that introduces a New Game Plus mode on November 24, which lets you literally bring a gun to a swordfight ... or at least more of them.</p><p>The studio <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY8MXfksWuw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a video</a> to the official PlayStation YouTube channel showcasing Ghost of Yotei's New Game Plus update as part of the upcoming free patch 1.100.000. The mode does exactly what you'd expect: allows you to replay the entirety of Atsu's revenge tale with all of the gear and skills you've already unlocked, giving you an edge--or a bullet--on the battlefield, which means you don't have to unlock the two different guns again. You'll start Atsu's journey already strapped.</p><p>You can also replay challenges with stat tracking to set scores for certain duels, experience harder difficulty options in the settings menu, and purchase new gear (like charms, dyes, and cosmetics) from a new merchant.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY8MXfksWuw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vY8MXfksWuw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Sucker Punch Productions' senior communications manager Andrew Goldfarb <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/19/new-game-plus-comes-to-ghost-of-yotei-november-24/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed more details about the free update</a> on the PlayStation Blog. He explained that patch 1.100.000 will also feature new accessibility options (such as directional button remapping), an enhanced photo mode, two new Trophies, and an extra upgrade tier for your existing armor and weapons.</p><p>In other Ghost of Yotei news, we recently learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-scaling-back-a-key-game-feature-was-difficult-but-the-right-call-dev-says/1100-6536303/" data-ref-id="1100-6536303">the game's cool time-bending mechanic</a>--which allows Atsu to return to her past to relive key story beats--was scaled back. The original plan was to let you do this whenever you wanted, but with it demanding extra work, creative director Jason Connell said the "right choice" was to narrow its scope, which honed its efficacy.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei has been a success for Sucker Punch Productions and Sony. The action-adventure game has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-sales-draw-even-with-ps4-and-ghost-of-yotei-has-a-big-debut/1100-6536128/" data-ref-id="1100-6536128">sold 3.3 million copies since its October 2 launch</a> on PS5 and has been generally well-received by critics and fans alike. We awarded it a 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a>, calling it a sequel that truly "builds and improves upon its predecessor."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> lore expert VaatiVidya is releasing a book, following over a decade's worth of YouTube videos covering the work of FromSoftware.</p>
<p>The forthcoming book, titled Lore Bound, will focus on Elden Ring, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC, and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> spin-off.</p>
<p>"It's my channel in physical form," the creator said in a video. Of course, it's not officially endorsed, but includes VaatiVidya's own interpretation of the ambiguous lore set forth by FromSoftware's writers.</p>

<p>There are other lore experts included, too, as each chapter will include boxouts with extra information and alternate takes from other fans. It also includes illustrations from John Devlin and Sebastián Franchini.</p>
<p>"Every Elden Ring video I've created first began as a script - lore written to be as concise and entertaining as possible for you all," said VaatiVidya. "So really it feels natural to transform these scripts into a book."</p>
<p>In collaboration with publisher Tune &amp; Fairweather, the book will come in a softcover edition for £32 (or with a sleeve for £50), as well as a deluxe edition for £72 with hard binding.</p>
<p>Lore Bound is set to be released in Q3 of 2026, but can be <a href="https://www.tuneandfairweather.com/collections/the-vaati-collection">pre-ordered now</a>.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>It's also not VaatiVidya's first book. His previous book, Soul Arts, features fan art inspired by FromSoftware's games and is still available from the same publisher.</p>
<p>Though there are plenty of Elden Ring lore videos on YouTube, VaatiVidya is generally considered the pre-eminent lore expert, providing in-depth analysis full of detail. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VaatiVidya/videos">videos feel definitive, if not official</a>.</p>
<p>Lore Bound is testament not only to VaatiVidya's own work, but the work of FromSoftware and Game of Thrones author George RR Martin, who created a rich world ripe for interpretation.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-of-thrones-creator-says-theres-some-talk-about-elden-ring-film-but-his-involvement-could-be-limited">Martin hinted there was "some talk" of an Elden Ring film</a>, but his involvement will be limited as he's behind on his latest book. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-live-action-film-officially-in-development">film was then officially announced</a> back in May.</p>

<figure data-uuid="17dd7efc036ac"><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/17dd7efc036ac/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>After 105+ minutes of gameplay and breakdowns, we have finally arrived at the launch week for Masahiro Sakurai's latest joint, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>
<p>The game is mere hours away from boosting onto Switch 2 on <strong>20th November</strong> (that's tomorrow!), and that means that it's time to take a look at the reviews and give you a summary of all the different opinions out there.</p>
<p>We'll start with our own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">review</a>, naturally, where the wonderful PJ O'Reilly granted Air Riders a 'Great' 8/10, praising the sheer amount of content and depth of the racing — once you get your head around what's going on. Here's a snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193790 @ 1763568005 -->
<p>But are we alone in our admiration? Let's take a look around the web and find out...</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with a whopping 9/10 review from <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-2-best-racer-791012-20251119">GamingBible</a>, where the outlet enjoyed just about everything the game had to offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> may fall short in terms of track selection compared to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but I’ll be damned if it isn’t the best racing game released this year, and one of the best first-party Nintendo games to launch on the Nintendo Switch 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kirby-air-riders-review/">The Gamer</a> opted for a 4/5, giving particular respect to City Trial mode and the game's overall presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even more so than the kart racing adjacent Air Ride, City Trial isn’t for everyone, and I can see a lot of people being put off by how relentlessly hectic and loud it can become. Still, as a connoisseur for carnage, I can’t wait to keep playing online and get wrecked by real players instead of CPU bots</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>On much the same page, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-air-riders-review/">VGC</a> also awarded Air Riders a 4/5, even if it conceded that Road Trip, not City Trial, is the standout mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All this combines for a game that appears almost insultingly simple at first – virtually any action except for the special attack is performed with a single button – but hides a hidden depth in its vehicle diversity and special moves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These good times continued in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review">IGN</a>'s 8/10 review, where the outlet sang the praises of the game's scope and strangeness, but felt the overall formula and controls didn't stack up to multiplayer mayhem elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest hurdle to enjoying its dizzying amount of content is how it all controls, as its frantic pace and slippery one-button control scheme is endearingly novel, but occasionally too simple for its own good</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/kirby-air-riders-review">GFinity</a> went marginally lower in its 7/10 review, appreciating the frantic excitement of it all, but feeling slightly let down by some game modes and the generally overwhelming nature of the race structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a game that fully embraces its mayhem, with it rather unapologetically overloading your senses. Sometimes that’s overwhelming, sometimes it’s confusing, but more often than not, it makes Kirby Air Riders uniquely entertaining</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, for a contrasting opinion, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review-nintendos-pink-puffball-rides-24741030/">Metro</a> wasn't as keen on Air Riders, giving it a 4/10 after struggling to get on with just about every game mode on offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, however, you want to play an irritating, formless, racer that’s simultaneously overcomplicated and far too simple then Kirby Air Riders is the game for you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, Kirby Air Riders is sitting on a 78 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kirby-air-riders/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a> score based on 64 critic reviews. Hey, at least there's not long to wait until we all get to go hands-on with the full game tomorrow.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-ceo-says-game-characters-should-be-able-to-be-ai-trained-on-human-made-scripts-to-have-more-natural-conversations.1358080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a recent appearance <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/11/17/gaming-is-americas-pastime-and-the-entertainment-business-of-the-future-says-take-two-ceo-zelnick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on CNBC's morning business news program Squawk Box</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that in the future, game characters will likely be AI-trained on human-made scripts to have more natural conversations with players, instead of being limited to the scripted interactions that the developers had foreseen when they envisioned the game. </p>



<p><em>Historically, we had to script every single action that a character engaged in, and because it is interactive, think about how much scripting that is. Now, we're always going to need great writers, and we always will have plenty of scripting, but characters should be able to be trained on that very scripting that has been created by great writers and then interact in a way that feels more natural. I do see that happening.</em></p>



<p>Could that be one of the major new features that Rockstar Games has prepared for Grand Theft Auto VI, now officially one year away from its launch (provided there are no further delays)? Just two days ago, a new rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-is-likely-to-be-unmatched-for-almost-two-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surfaced</a> about the game featuring extremely ambitious features that may remain unmatched for 'decades'.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether a similar feature makes it in GTA VI or not, the technology is absolutely here now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA ACE</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-and-nvidia-demonstrate-on-device-ai-character-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inworld AI</a> already offer something like that, where game characters can respond to natural conversations depending on what they should be aware of. </p>



<p>Zelnick's comment, however, comes at a time when there's a lot of tension on the usage of AI in the industry. Black Ops 7 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized for its 'AI slop' assets</a>, while ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came under fire for using generative AI to voice NPCs</a>. On that subject, the developers behind the highly successful episodic adventure game Dispatch <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told GamesIndustry</a>:</p>



<p><em>You're not going to be surprised because it's built on something you've heard before if you go the AI route. So, yeah, honestly, AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one. Maybe it's a creative one if you aren't creative.</em></p>



<p>Of course, when discussing AI, there's much more beyond just empowering game characters or voicing them. As part of his reply on CNBC, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick also highlighted that the company is using the technology to create 'efficiencies', which, however, won't reduce the headcount but will instead let them focus on creative tasks.</p>



<p><em>Table stakes are creating more efficiency in development and marketing, and every enterprise is trying to do that. We're trying to do that and we're seeing some good early results in creating efficiencies. By the way, efficiencies is not code for reducing employment, it's code for taking away mundane tasks so people can focus on more interesting, creative tasks. </em></p>



<p>That is, after all, the sentiment behind many other AI statements we covered recently, from <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> to <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ricard Pillosu</a>. Perhaps, though, it was Dean Hall who, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dayz-creator-says-ai-fears-remind-him-people-worrying-about-google-wikipedia-ai-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to Wccftech</a>, really got to the heart of the issue:</p>



<p><em>I think that regardless of what we do, AI is here. So really, then, it's about a matter of how do we deal with what the impact of that is.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Whatever your feelings about <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935">Bungie, the state of<em> Destiny 2</em>, or the promise of <em>Marathon</em></a>, the cinematic short created to reveal the studio’s upcoming extraction shooter earlier this year was one of the coolest introductions to a video game world I’ve ever seen. It also looked like the complete antithesis of cheaply and amorphously generated slop, so I didn’t expect to see its director, Alberto Mielgo, recently try to defend it against accusations of being made with AI.</p> <p>“I can’t believe we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI,” the <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> art director <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKzO0XDsow/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D&amp;img_index=11">wrote</a> on Instagram on November 17. “HELLO. Everything you see in this film: paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders done with huge team — 155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months…Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940">The cinematic short</a> combines CGI, live-action footage, and <em>Marathon</em>‘s broader design language to convey a sci-fi short story about mercenary runners pillaging an alien planet who slowly lose themselves, their memories, and their humanity as they are cloned over and over again to serve their megacorp sponsors. It prompted some fans to dream of a version of <em>Marathon</em> that married that worldbuilding to a completely single-player, story-driven campaign.</p>   <p>“I truly love this little film,” Mielgo wrote on Instagram. “Many of you ask me what my opinion on AI is… Honestly, I have no idea. But one thing is certain: AI will never take away my (your) urge or joy for making art and painting. That part will never be replaced. (This text was kindly edited with ChatGPT).”</p>

 <p>It’s not entirely clear where the allegations of the short being made with AI first sprang from. Were they serious critiques or simply online passersby assuming that it could only look so good and otherworldly with the help of AI, because increasingly that’s what the rest of the internet’s algorithms are teaching them?</p>

 <p>Mielgo also weighed in on <em>Marathon</em>‘s brief plagiarism controversy earlier this year in which <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">graphics lifted from another artist</a> online made it into marketing footage and playable builds of the game. Bungie apologized and promised a thorough review of what went wrong in its pipeline, but it left some wondering where the theft ended and <em>Marathon</em>‘s exciting aesthetic began, though it was also clear at the time that part of the backlash was coming from bad-faith critics looking for something else to pile on Bungie about.</p>

 <h2>The <em>Marathon</em> plagiarism controversy was ‘blown out of proportion’</h2> <p>“But you know what I hate the most?” Mielgo wrote in what now appear to be deleted comments, according <a href="https://thegamepost.com/alberto-mielgo-marathon-cinematic-ai-bungie-plagiarized-material/">to<em> The Game Post</em></a>. “Working our asses off for years to create something cool, only for it to get eclipsed by sphincter smelly press and headline readers.”</p>

 <p>He continued, hitting back at people who didn’t believe him in the comments, “It&nbsp;was genuinely a mistake, blown out of proportion by people like you and hungry sphincter press. Regardless, to your pseudowistle, none of the text/fonts ever reached our team. The Bungie team is fantastic, and the work they did before us was f****ng outstanding. I loved working with them.”</p> <p><em>Marathon</em> was supposed to already be out but got delayed following negative feedback during an alpha test earlier this year. The team’s been making lots of changes to the game in the interim, including the highly requested addition of proximity chat. Sony says the game will release before April 2026. Hopefully, people take whatever gets released on its own terms rather than letting it be overshadowed by all of the other baggage swirling around its development.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch has given you all the time to breathe. By now, you’ve probably finished Ghost of Yotei and need a fresh challenge, which is where New Game Plus comes in handy.</p>



<p>New Game Plus is a great way to extend the shelf life of any game. Moreover, it offers new challenges and usually adds extra options and features into the mix for good measure. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a>‘s sun isn’t setting anytime soon, and the November inclusion of New Game Plus will be a game-changer.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Aim true, you’ll need to. Screenshot from PlayStation</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ghost of Yotei is getting New-Game-Plus capabilities from November 24, and this isn’t all.</p>



<p>An official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/19/new-game-plus-comes-to-ghost-of-yotei-november-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Blog</a> revealed more bits, from New Game Plus to new gear and extra PlayStation Trophies. The original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-trophy-and-achievement-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei trophy list</a> was generous, but now you have an additional two trophies to fight for.</p>



<p>On top of this, New Game Plus behaves as it does in every game: Once you’ve finished the story, you can begin the adventure again from scratch, but your progress rolls over, and there’s a new, harder difficulty setting for the sadistic samurai in all of you.</p>







<p>Here are some other features that will feature in the New Game Plus update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New currency: Ghost Flowers (Used on a new vendor packing many cosmetics).</li>



<li>A new tier of upgrades for armor sets and weapons.</li>



<li>You can replay content from the main game.</li>



<li>New accessibility features, such as button remapping and fresh Photo Mode tweaks.</li>
</ul>

Although the town clairvoyant has predicted that the volcano central to the celebration will erupt that same day, the festivities push forward with the help of the heroes, who investigate the cause behind the clairvoyant’s prediction.</p><div id="carousel_1007717"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>The Wetlock footage opens with an elderly bard arriving in town, playing an enchanting melody that lures the townsfolk into a portal connected to Highendreigh Tower, intending to protect them from a foretold flood. And so the heroes set out to uncover the source of the disaster.</p><p>This segment also highlights the new Moonlighting system, which allows each character to “<a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a>light” as a second vocation alongside their main class, unlocking the potential for various skill combinations. For example, your hero can be both a Sailor and a Thief, Maribel can be a Priestess and Mage, or Ruff can be both a Martial Artist and Warrior. Unlike the original <em><a title="Series > Dragon Quest [119 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Path</em>, which required players to visit a specific location to change vocations, you can now switch at any time simply by pressing down on the d-pad.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The footage also features a brief look at the game’s new tab-based menus, a first for the <em>Dragon Quest</em> series. While previous <em>Dragon Quest</em> games have featured the more classic window-based menus, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> adopts a more modern interface for more comfortable navigation.</p><p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,865 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,294 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [680 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,989 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,812 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2499860/DRAGON_QUEST_VII_Reimagined/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/9nkm0ckchdqx" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> on February 5, 2026 worldwide.

                <p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest is one of the most recognizable names in classic RPGs, and also one that has recently leaned heavily on the past to attract new fans. Square Enix has remastered the first three classic DQ games, dubbed the Erdrick Trilogy, and is now skipping ahead to the seventh installment with Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined. It's an unexpected move, but partially explained by DQ7 having such a notorious reputation among fans. Namely, it was a slog. Even its own key developers acknowledge that much, which made it ripe for a remake that trims the fat. I played a little over an hour of Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined and talked with producer Takeshi Ichikawa. My limited time was not enough to get a feel for the full scope of the cuts, but I was impressed by the other ways it's being modernized.</p><p dir="ltr">It starts with the art style, which is immediately striking. Square Enix noted during a presentation that to establish the revised look, it constructed physical dolls for each of the major party members, giving them the ability to focus on small details like the texture of their clothing. Those dolls were then scanned in to act as digital puppets, and the rest of the game was developed to match their style. That gives it a handcrafted look that is, I dare say, cozy. The perspective is still primarily following your characters from above, as you'd expect in a classic RPG, but the character detail is readily apparent even there, and you get a closer look at them in cutscenes and battles.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="610984910" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

also created the visual style for all of the Dragon Quest games before his passing in 2024. When Toriyama designed the characters for DQ7, they were given a more "cutesy, adorable aesthetic" compared to other Dragon Quest games, with more squat designs that differed from his usual art. The company researched ways to maintain and update that visual style and found inspiration in other media, like movies and TV shows, that have used a doll motif. That inspired the creation of physical dolls to define the look, which he says helped create realistic fabrics and textures that influenced the overall style.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the cozy appearance, though, the story in Dragon Quest VII is remarkably dark for the series. As Ichikawa said, that contrast was one major motivation in remaking the game for modern audiences.</p><p dir="ltr">"The overall goal, or what inspired the creation of this remake, was we really wanted to tap into the unique and dark world in storytelling of Dragon Quest 7 and these adorable characters," Ichikawa said via translator. "We really wanted to bring it back to the modern audiences again."</p><p dir="ltr">I played just one story mission, and it was as dark as I had been led to expect. The party began in the small seaside town of Wetlock, where the people are enamored of an old traveling busker. After being prompted to sleep at an inn, you're awoken to find the town has been emptied, lured into a portal by the busker for some unknown purpose. Something sinister seems afoot, so you follow them into the portal and confront him--only to discover the old man was actually attempting to save the townspeople from disaster. An evil creature named Gracos was planning to flood the continent and consign everyone to a watery death. Some people were even feared to have been left behind and presumably drowned. The busker, Old Man Riffer, was actually a hero trying to atone for his own past mistakes by saving the town. You then venture into the sunken lair to confront the monster.</p><p dir="ltr">The dark subject matter is somewhat softened by the cute art style and voice performances, so it never felt too scary or intense for kids to enjoy. The voices, especially, are played with the melodrama of living cartoons, so it all works thematically with the art style.</p><p dir="ltr">Inside the dungeon, I was able to battle through hordes of monsters, familiar from other Dragon Quest titles, but given a new figurine-like look. The monsters didn't get dolls of their own, but the studio was able to follow the art style established by the character models to make them consistent, and the result is beautiful. The maze-like dungeon was a delightful way to engage with the monsters, too, as I could see them roaming around and carefully sneak around them or look for safe paths if needed. Within the battle interface, you have a similar behind-the-back perspective to traditional Dragon Quest titles, but pulled in close enough and with some cinematic movements to really let you soak in the lovely art style.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I remember thinking, 'When am I ever going to get to the monsters?'"</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Battles are traditional and turn-based, but they've been given a slight twist with revisions to the vocation system. Instead of your primary vocation defining your skills, Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined introduces a "Moonlighting" system that lets you set a secondary vocation. I was able to experiment with the secondary jobs by either augmenting my party's natural talents or filling in gaps, and while my brief demo didn't allow me to see the full breadth of experimentation, it was enough to see how this will have a major impact on strategizing your party composition.</p><p dir="ltr">"It is going to be a bit easier to start for the players, but we also reworked the entire balance of the battles too," Ichikawa said. "The battles are reworked based on the assumption that the Moonlighting system is going to be implemented. So it's not going to be too easy for our players. It is going to be a challenging experience for them. The team does feel that the battle and the vocation system overall has balanced up very appropriately."</p><p dir="ltr">The ultimate confrontation, against the fiendish monster Gracos, was an appropriate challenge to end the dungeon, forcing me to balance my healing, skills, and special abilities, and search for opportunities for synergies. It was a satisfying culmination to the fights, even thrown in with a party I hadn't developed myself. The old man Riffer chimed in to help as well, and the crisis was averted.</p><p dir="ltr">So why follow up the first three Dragon Quest games with a remake of the seventh? For Ichikawa, it's personal. He said his first Dragon Quest game was Dragon Quest Monsters. When he tried to play Dragon Quest 7 in its original incarnation, the task was just too daunting. It took an average of three hours to even reach the first battle, which tested the patience of Ichikawa and many other young RPG fans.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was very young back then. I was still in elementary school, but it is kind of a painful experience because I had to give up," he said. "I remember thinking, 'When am I ever going to get to the monsters?' I couldn't even carry on before even getting to that part."</p><p dir="ltr">He didn't know at the time he would go on to work on the Dragon Quest series, joining Square Enix and developing Dragon Quest Builders 2. Times have changed since Dragon Quest VII was first released in 2000. Ichikawa said he and Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii discussed the changing landscape of RPGs, and how players now have expectations that games will better respect their time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605909-dq7r_2_07.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4605909" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605909-dq7r_2_07.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4605909"></a><figcaption>Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605909-dq7r_2_07.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605910-dq7r_2_06.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605911-dq7r_2_01.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605912-dq7r_2_02.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605913-dq7r_2_03.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605914-dq7r_2_04.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605915-dq7r_2_08.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605916-dq7r_2_05.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605917-dq7r_2_09.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605918-dq7r_2_07.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4605910,1300-4605911,1300-4605912,1300-4605913,1300-4605914,1300-4605915,1300-4605916,1300-4605917,1300-4605918" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605910-dq7r_2_06.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605911-dq7r_2_01.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605912-dq7r_2_02.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605913-dq7r_2_03.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605914-dq7r_2_04.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605915-dq7r_2_08.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605916-dq7r_2_05.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605917-dq7r_2_09.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4605918-dq7r_2_07.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605910-dq7r_2_06.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605911-dq7r_2_01.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605912-dq7r_2_02.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605913-dq7r_2_03.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605914-dq7r_2_04.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605915-dq7r_2_08.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605916-dq7r_2_05.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605917-dq7r_2_09.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4605918-dq7r_2_07.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Back then, it was more acceptable to have a longer form of entertainment, especially in video games where you get to sink in so many hours. It was just more acceptable and standard back then," Ichikawa said. "But fast forward 25 years later; that's not really the case anymore. There's a lot of video games out there, there's a lot of forms of media and entertainment out there. So naturally people just have an upper limit about how [much] time they can put into one single form of media or entertainment. So that was in the initial discussions that I had with Horii-san, so that was why we wanted to streamline some of the elements and the game to ensure that we are able to grow a smoother gaming experience for Dragon Quest 7."</p><p>Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined appears to be a different kind of remake than Square Enix's other recent output. It isn't an HD-2D makeover like the other Dragon Quest remasters, which have been mostly careful to keep the original mechanics intact, or a full reboot like the Final Fantasy 7 trilogy. Instead this appears to bereimagined, in a true sense, by borrowing the core concepts and philosophies that drove that original game and modernizing them for today. It's being reverent but not overly precious, which just might be the right approach for a lauded, but divisive, part of Dragon Quest history.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>With three weeks to go until the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> DLC drops, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has unveiled its next brand new Mega Evolution, and this time it's a Mythical Pokémon getting an upgrade.</p>
<p>Zeraora was first introduced in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_ultra_sun_and_ultra_moon">Pokémon Ultra Sun &amp; Ultra Moon</a>, way back in Gen VII, and its Mega form makes a few subtle changes to its original design.</p>
<p>Its mostly-yellow fur has turned black, and there's now a lot more blue on its knees, head, and chest. its blue tuft on its head has turned to something resembling a horn, and it has a few blue spikes across its body in general. And, lastly, it now has two ponytail-like features instead of one.</p>
<p>It's definitely one of the lighter Mega Evolutions we've seen so far, especially compared to Mega Chimecho, but hey! The Thunderclap Pokémon has its fans.</p>

<p>According to the Pokédex, "The electric energy it stores in its body is equivalent to ten bolts of lightning. Protrusions on its forehead, chest, back, and the backs of its hands are where the electric energy is particularly concentrated."</p>
<p>We'll be getting one more Mega Dimension update in two more weeks (2nd December), which will likely be another Mega Evolution. Stay tuned until then!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At least one of Bungie's ongoing legal troubles has been put to rest, as the company settles a copyright lawsuit it was facing against author Matthew Kelsey Martineau, who alleged Bungie had pulled storylines for its Red War campaign in Destiny 2 and the Red Legion from his work published on WordPress between 2013 and 2014.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/author-sues-bungie-for-copyright-infringement-over-destiny-2s-story">Martineau sued Bungie last year</a> for the alleged copyright infringement, and you'd be forgiven if you thought this would have been a simple case for Bungie to dismiss. In its motion to dismiss, Bungie refuted Martineau's claim, saying he "<em>failed to plausibly allege that Bungie copied constituent elements of Plaintiff's work that are original, and, specifically, that the Complaint fails to plausibly allege factual copying by Bungie and that the works incorporated by reference into the Complaint are not substantially similar as a matter of law</em>."</p>



<p>However, to Bungie's chagrin, Judge Susie Morgan did not dismiss the case. Bungie was unable to demonstrate direct examples from the Destiny 2 Red War campaign to prove its argument, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-content-removed-vault-beyond-light-november/">because that content has since been vaulted</a>. Not only is it no longer available to the public, but it's no longer compatible with the current foundation of Destiny 2.</p>



<p>To make that content available would be a mountain of an engineering effort, so when Bungie tried instead to resort to YouTube videos of old Destiny 2 gameplay footage and Destiny 2 wiki content, Judge Morgan disallowed it as evidence. "<em>While Plaintiff does reference Destiny 2 in his complaint, he does not reference the YouTube videos containing Destiny 2 game footage, the Destinypedia pages, or the Tyson declaration</em>," Judge Morgan wrote at the time.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/bugnie-attempt-at-dismissing-copyright-lawsuit-denied-by-court-due-bungies-inability-to-provide-vaulted-destiny-2-content-as-evidence/">So Bungie's dismissal attempt failed</a>, and the case entered an extended discovery process, which allowed Martineau to further expand his arguments and, eventually, as reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/">The Game Post</a>, reach a settlement.</p>



<p>"<em>A settlement conference was conducted on this date before the undersigned Magistrate Judge</em>," the new filing reads. "<em>Negotiations were successful and resulted in the settlement of all claims. The Court thanks counsel and the parties for their efforts in bringing this matter to an amicable resolution</em>."</p>



<p>The public settlement filing doesn't include details on what the conditions of the agreement were, if Martineau was awarded a monetary sum or if a deal was reached another way, but as far as the court is concerned, this is a closed case so long as the settlement terms are met by both parties and agreed upon for the next 60 days, which is the period of time given in case either side wants to open the case back up.</p>



<p>At least this is one less thing for Bungie to worry about now, as it continues trying to pick itself up amidst Destiny 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-selling-worse-than-expected-sony-records-impairment-loss/">reportedly selling very poorly</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic and Unity have announced a collaboration that will allow developers working in the latter engine to release their games within the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>ecosystem, and it'll have benefits for Unreal Engine developers too, apparently.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/news/unity-and-epic-games-together-advance-the-open-interoperable-future-for-video-gaming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Unity says the ability for Unity games to be brought into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will create "more opportunity and value for players and developers", pointing to&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s status as "one of the world's largest gaming ecosystems".</p>

<p>As part of the collaboration, Unreal Engine support will also be added to Unity's cross-platform commerce management system, which will in turn give Unreal Engine devs "more choice for managing everything from their digital catalogs and payment&nbsp;providers to web shops across PC, mobile, and web".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-epic-unity-partnership.jpg?itok=Ewpth9Vp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-epic-unity-partnership.jpg?itok=9TopDIhr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Unity is teaming up with Epic to contribute to an "open, interoperable future".</figcaption></figure><p>Unity CEO Matt Bromberg, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-new-ceo-ea" rel="nofollow">joined the company last year</a> following the departure of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy" rel="nofollow">former boss John Riccitello</a>, says the partnership aims to emphasise "choice and open systems" in the gaming industry, which he says "create growth for everyone".</p>

<p>Epic boss Tim Sweeney, meanwhile, says that companies should work alongside one another "in order to build the open metaverse in a way that's interoperable and fair", and that this partnership allows Epic and Unity to "help developers build fun games, reach bigger audiences, and find success".</p>

<p>News of this collaboration comes after Unity reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-unity-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of employees</a> back in February, including the engine's Behavior team, which worked on the "visual tool" of the same name.</p>

<p>Those purported layoffs came after the engine <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-runtime-fee-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceled its controversial runtime fee</a> for developers and publishers in September last year, the revision of which caused a firestorm of controversy among industry figures when it was introduced in late 2023.</p>

<p>Earlier in November, the <i>Fortnite&nbsp;</i>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-fortnite-joint-proposal" rel="nofollow">announced a new proposal</a>, devised alongside current legal opponent Google, which aims to end the lawsuit between the two companies and open up the Play Store more for third-party stores and payment systems.</p>

<p>More information about this Unity-Epic partnership will be announced next year, the two companies say. Stay tuned for more on that.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/capture-lifes-precious-moments-with-this-dedicated-vlogging-camera-from-dji-down-to-its-lowest-price-yet-2000645281</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-osmo-pocket-3-just-hit-all-time-low-after-multiple-drops-as-amazon-quietly-offloads-the-top-vlogging-camera.1358020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="504">If you’re into vlogging, having the right gear can really clean up your content and make your workflow smoother in one go. Allow me to introduce the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. It’s a dedicated vlogging camera that lets you leave your phone in your pocket and focus on capturing great footage. Whether you’re into YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram Reels, this camera is designed with you in mind.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/"> And right now, you can grab it for 34% off on Amazon. Normally priced at $799, it’s now going for just $524 — saving you a solid $276.</a> This deal is coming in over a week before Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, so you can even get some holiday shopping wrapped up ahead of schedule.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="506" data-end="1025">So, why go for the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 instead of using your phone? Sure, phones like the iPhone 16 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S25 have impressive cameras, but there’s one thing they can’t offer — unlimited storage. While the Osmo Pocket 3 doesn’t have endless storage either, it uses a MicroSD card, so you can expand your storage as much as you need. Plus, you can keep your vlogs and personal stuff separate. It’s a lifesaver for people like me who are always scrambling to delete old videos just to take a quick selfie with my iPhone.</p>

<h2 data-start="506" data-end="1025">Impressive Videography</h2>
<p data-start="1027" data-end="1453">Now, let’s talk about the footage. This little camera packs a punch with 4K resolution at up to 120 fps, which means you can create smooth, cinematic slow-motion shots in your edits. The lens also swivels and auto-focuses to track your subject, so you’ll get steady, dynamic shots as you move around. Thanks to its three-axis mechanical stabilization, the camera removes a lot of annoying shaky cam that can ruin your videos.</p>


<p data-start="1455" data-end="1804">You can use the Osmo Pocket 3 in two ways — either facing forward to film whatever’s going on in front of you, or flipped around to capture yourself. The built-in mini display is one inch across, touch-sensitive, and rotates both vertically and horizontally, so you can switch things up depending on how you want to frame your shots or where you plan on posting the finished product to later.</p>
<p data-start="1806" data-end="2041">The camera has advanced color-grading tech that shoots in 10-bit color depth, meaning you’re capturing up to one billion colors for richer, more vibrant visuals. It’s also capturing professional-grade audio in stereo sound right on the camera itself. For even better audio, connect it directly and easily to up to two DJI Mic 2 or Mic Mini transmitters, sold separately.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-rolls-out-major-black-friday-deal-on-fenix-8-now-priced-like-a-used-previous-gen-model-2000645396</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/garmin-rolls-out-major-black-friday-deal-on-fenix-8-now-priced-like-a-used-previous-gen-model.1358017/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Serious athletes need watches that can survive extreme conditions and track every metric that matters for performance optimization. Budget fitness trackers cannot keep up with ultramarathons, technical climbs or dive expeditions. The <strong>Garmin Fenix 8 is the brand’s first push beyond the $1,000 threshold</strong> in their flagship multisport line, and packs features that justify its position as the ultimate tool for dedicated athletes.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon has just dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5696/">the 51mm Solar Sapphire model to $849 for Black Friday, down from its regular $1,199 price</a>. That makes it <strong>an all-time low</strong> that brings the grail of sports watches within the grasp of those committed athletes who previously shy away from four-figure pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5696/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Survives Toughest Challenges</h2>
<p>The scratch-resistant sapphire lens on this <strong>1.4-inch display</strong> holds up to impacts from rock scrambles, trail running branches, and the many accidental door frame collisions that destroy cheaper watches. <strong>Solar charging extends battery life to 48 days</strong> in smartwatch mode if you spend three hours daily in 50,000 lux sunlight-representative for outdoor athletes training regularly.<strong> GPS mode is functional for 149 continuous hours</strong> with solar assistance, accommodating multi-day ultra races or extended backcountry expeditions with no external chargers needed. The<strong> always-on display</strong> is readable in direct sunlight and automatically adjusts brightness based on ambient light to save battery while keeping it visible during activities.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon gray DLC titanium construction</strong> balances strength with wearability, keeping weight manageable for all-day comfort while maintaining structural integrity during hard use. DLC coating resists scratches better than standard titanium finishes and preserves the watch’s appearance through years of abuse. The 51mm case size accommodates larger wrists comfortably and houses the sensors and battery capacity that smaller models sacrifice for compactness.</p>



<p><strong>Multi-band GPS with SatIQ technology</strong> simultaneously accesses signals from multiple satellite constellations and calculates your position with a degree of precision unreachable for single-band receivers under the most difficult conditions. The system will automatically switch between single and multi-band modes depending on environment difficulty, saving battery during open-sky running while engaging full accuracy under tree cover or canyon walls. Various<strong> inbuilt sensors like a three-axis compass, gyroscope, and barometric altimeter</strong> independently generate navigation data from GPS which becomes vital when satellite signals are blocked or you need to economize on battery life over longer trips.</p>



<p>Training readiness scoring analyzes sleep quality, recovery metrics, training load, and heart rate variability to calculate whether you should push hard or scale back intensity. The<strong> watch tracks HRV overnight through wrist-based sensors</strong> that detect autonomic nervous system balance, which indicates recovery status. Real-time stamina tracking during activities shows how much energy remains before exhaustion so you can pace your efforts appropriately during long races or intense training blocks.</p>
<p>The<strong> 40-meter dive rating with leakproof metal buttons</strong> allows for scuba and apnea diving activities, monitoring depth, time, and decompression requirements during underwater exploration. Metal buttons maintain seal integrity far better than capacitive surfaces that leak under pressure, ensuring the operation of the watch under the most adverse conditions.</p>
<p>The built-in speaker and microphone <strong>enable phone calls directly from your wrist</strong> when it is paired with your smartphone. This makes calls possible during runs or rides, with no need to stop and dig through pockets. Voice assistant integration lets you respond to messages hands-free and stay focused on the activity. Also, ECG monitoring records heart rhythm while screening for signs of atrial fibrillation and enables health insights beyond standard fitness tracking.</p>
<p>You’re paying what used Fenix models sell for on secondary markets at $849 for titanium construction, sapphire crystal protection, solar charging, and dive-rated durability with professional-grade training analytics. This $350 discount transforms Garmin’s flagship from an aspirational purchase to an achievable upgrade for serious athletes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-dreamlight-valley-wishblossom-ranch-review.1358014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot off of dozens of hours reviewing the sweatiest kind of game imaginable in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review"><u>ARC Raiders</u></a>, wading into the cozy waters of Disney Dreamlight Valley once again was like stepping into a warm bath at the end of a hard day’s work. I’ve managed to mostly keep up with this charming, Disney-infused life simulator for the past three years, which has been content with adding a handful of new areas and characters here and there rather than innovating in that time. But with its latest expansion, Wishblossom Ranch, developer Gameloft Montreal promised a massive new region to explore atop the back of various recognizable steeds that seemed like a perfect reason to return for an extended stay. It’s without question the most ambitious update yet, with some interesting mechanical tweaks, like the focus on riding and building bonds with horses to unlock new abilities – but that ambition comes at the cost of this being the most buggy version of Disney Dreamlight Valley so far. Similarly, the new map has some of the most creative and unique regions I’ve seen in any cozy game, but that’s offset by new characters that I had a hard time connecting with and the usual, completely unnecessary grind to get through its main quests. All-in-all, I’m still glad to be back in the comforting embrace of this incredibly zen game, but the admirable risks Wishblossom Ranch takes only pay off some of the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve yet to visit Dreamlight Valley’s colorful, cartoonish world, this is a life simulator that’s centered around reconnecting with Disney characters from your childhood and the hopeful, optimistic sense of wonder you presumably had beaten out of you in the years since. You’ll run around performing low stress activities like gardening, cooking, and fishing while hanging out with the likes of Simba from the Lion King, Elsa from Frozen, and Goofy from… well, y’know, it’s Goofy. Wishblossom Ranch is the latest made up compound word followed by a location noun to be added to the mix, and it asks you to solve a mystery surrounding a place where one’s wishes are granted that seems to have run out of magic. While hot on the case, you’ll meet a handful of new Disney characters to befriend, explore and settle the biggest regions Dreamlight Valley has seen so far, and, most importantly, unlock a roster of iconic mounts to ride around on. When all of that is working, it’s some of the best-spent hours this chill adventure has offered me yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the name Wishblossom Ranch implies, the main attraction this time around are the four-legged creatures you’ll tame, each with their own special ability to help you navigate the world and solve simple puzzles. The brave and bold Maximus from Tangled will let you leap across large gaps, while the mighty and battle-tested Khan from Mulan can kick apart physical barriers, and the goofy looking Pegasus from Hercules lets you fly to the highest heights of the mountainous area. You’ll also get to customize and name your own horse (mine was called Neighthan), which has the ability to push around heavy objects with its head like a big ol’ dummy. The puzzles you’ll solve using this suite of ponies are extremely basic, mostly serving as reminders that you can and should switch between mounts instantaneously and use their unique skills to push heavy blocks onto weighted pressure plates or kick obstructions to pieces, but they do a good job at giving you a reason to toggle between each of the loyal stallions and a good reason to level up your bonds with them.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is definitely the most unstable version of Dreamlight Valley so far.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The best part of these new companions, though, is the fact that they solve one of my least favorite things about Disney Dreamlight Valley since the very beginning: how insanely slow you move. I’ve had a bone to pick with this game for many years now on how painfully sluggish it feels to move around, even when aided by fast travel from zone-to-zone, but hopping atop a mount makes travel times so much faster it’s completely resolved that issue. And since you can also train your mount to help with things like stomping on ore deposits to mine for gems or dig holes in the ground for gardening, you can do lots of activities without ever having to dismount, which is a great touch. Really the only issue is that now the old areas feel so claustrophobic and small because you can sprint across them so quickly, and they could already be fairly tough to navigate on foot. Thankfully, the new areas have been designed with mounted travel in mind and are properly expansive, and getting caught in small environments in the old regions is still a lot less annoying than spending minutes on end slowly crawling through them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the process for actually improving your relationships with each of these guys can be a bit of a slog, and represents the biggest timegate you’ll find in Wishblossom Ranch, which otherwise does a pretty good job of getting rid of annoying grinds like the one found in A Rift in Time. Every time you unlock a new mount, you’ll have to spend an increasingly long amount of time leveling up your relationship with them until you unlock their unique ability that’s needed to get through the next step in the main story, and the primary way to do that is by waiting for real-life days to go by so that you can feed, pet, and brush them for large XP boosts… or do what I did and spend hours riding around aimlessly, jumping over random objects in the world to brute-force your way through it. I’m sure it would’ve been far less annoying if I would have just played more casually over the course of a few days or weeks as is likely recommended, but I’m really not a fan of arbitrary obstacles to progression that have no point beyond padding out how long  it takes to finish the story, and this one is particularly silly. I’m okay with having to earn my social links with each of these quadrupedal friends, but it shouldn’t prevent me from unlocking the next area until I do, especially if the only way to speed it up is by doing meaningless busywork.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that once I did get through the grind and proceeded to the next region, I was rewarded with some of the most interesting places that Dreamlight Valley has featured to date. For example, the Pixie Acres is a magically-infused garden area with golden honey waterfalls in the distance and waterballoon fish swimming in the rivers, while my personal favorite area, Glamour Gulch, is entirely fashion-themed, and has pincushion fruit growing on trees, flowers that are made out of needles and thread, and mushrooms on the ground that are actually little buttons. The flavor and themes of these places are easily the most clever and compelling yet, and would probably even top the list of some of my favorite locales in any cozy game. It’s especially cool when you start gardening with seeds found in these areas to grow things like a vegetable made out of silk thread or cooking recipes out of those ingredients to whip up an entree called button stew. This is exactly the type of over-the-top goofiness Dreamlight Valley really needed, as opposed to the quite grounded options in the first area where you were harvesting regular ol’ tomatoes to cook tomato soup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, I personally was less enthused about the new characters than the environments themselves. Snow White, Cruella de Vil from 101 Dalmatians, Tigger from Winnie the Pooh, and Tinker Bell are the four new besties to befriend, only one of which didn’t completely annoy me over the course of the story. Snow White’s creepy cheeriness and impossibly high-pitched voice gave me the willies, Cruella de Vil was just straight up mean to me for several hours while I was forced run errands for her when I would have rather just told her to take a hike, and Tigger’s stretch of the story is so untethered from reality that I was just confused about what the heck I was doing the whole time, like one part where I had to reunite a family of balloons with faces drawn on them for some reason. Tinker Bell was genuinely the only one who was consistently helpful while also not boring into me with unnerving, wild eyes. I think this is probably the cast of added characters I connected with the least so far, even though Cruella de Vil did make me laugh by being such an irredeemable monster (as she should be). Don’t get me wrong: I’m sure lots of folks will enjoy adding these icons to Dreamlight Valley’s already impressive roster, and you can always just bring along an existing character you prefer, but man, Snow White is just not for me.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The main thing holding Wishblossom Ranch back, however, is the fact that it’s definitely the most unstable version of Dreamlight Valley so far, and that’s coming from someone who started playing during a preview period slightly <em>before</em> its Early Access debut back in 2022. I encountered all sorts of issues: I phased through an elevator that broke my ability to progress until I quit to the dashboard, my horses regularly hopped inside objects in the world in a super awkward and noticeable way, menus would randomly stop responding to me until I closed them and tried again, and quite a few other bizarre problems. And of particular annoyance, the absolutely atrocious camera problems Dreamlight Valley has always suffered from are amplified by the existence of bulky horses you spend a lot of time trotting upon, whose unwieldy nature cause the camera to clip through all sorts of pieces of the environment and cause a ton of issues. I appreciate that Wishblossom Ranch takes some really neat risks to make these maps bigger and add cool horse mechanics, but that seems to have come at the cost of everything feeling really janky at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At one point I even found myself locked out of a critical quest line that would have resulted in me not being able to see the ending were it not for a developer-provided debug option that let me skip past the blockage. Were it not for the fact that I was working on this review, my journey would have come to a disappointing end right there. There were a few moments during the course of my adventure where it felt like I was walking on eggshells around the expansion’s bugs, and if I did a part of a quest too early or too late, I’d hold my breath hoping it wouldn’t result in a catastrophic error like the one I ultimately fell prey to. The devs at least know about this particular bug now, so hopefully they can fix it at some point, but I would recommend waiting for a round of polish or two before diving in yourself.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Disney Dreamlight Valley’s Wishblossom Ranch expansion is an intriguing new chapter in a cozy game I’ve enjoyed for several years, but it also suffers from some growing pains. The new areas are filled with some of the most creative stuff I’ve seen in a life simulator in quite some time, and the four-legged companions you can ride offer fun ways to engage with familiar cozy activities, not to mention make getting around so much faster. I would have liked some more exciting new characters to befriend, and the grind to level up your relationship with each of the mounts has unnecessary timegates that I could have done without, but these missteps didn’t drag down the good times too much. Instead, the real issue is that, at the time of this review, Wishblossom Ranch has just been way too buggy to comfortably enjoy (or in my case even finish without a workaround). Hopefully its biggest issues will get patched up, but for now it’s made an otherwise enjoyable expansion significantly less so.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-wishblossom-ranch-review]]></content:encoded>
