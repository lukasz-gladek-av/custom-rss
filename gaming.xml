            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has seemingly announced a dating sim spinoff by the name of&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals</em>, but there's reason to believe it might not be a serious prospect.</p>

<p>The game was revealed via <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906687045130653704" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X earlier today, in which Pocketpair calls the game "a <i>Palworld&nbsp;</i>school romance VN (visual novel)" and invites players to wishlist it via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">brand new Steam page</a>.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>has appeared, though. The first announcement for the game came <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2024-gaming-roundup" rel="nofollow">on April Fools' Day last year</a>, at which point Pocketpair said it would launch on the same day the following year (i.e. tomorrow).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-dating-sim-lovander.jpg?itok=a_-BkLAL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-dating-sim-lovander.jpg?itok=pVaYh1Zt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't think I want to do that, Lovander.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the fact that the game was already announced as part of Pocketpair's April Fools' japery last year doesn't necessarily mean it isn't real this time around, but I think it's fair to take the project with a very large pinch of salt, at any rate.</p>

<p>Then again, back then, I wrote that Pocketpair had willed the project into genuine existence by virtue of creating it as a joke, and that may well be what's happened. If it is, well, we might be beyond help this time around.</p>

<p>Assuming&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>is real, you'll be attending the Palagos Private Academy, where you'll meet a number of romanceable Pals. You can "stay friends with the Pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them".</p>

<p>It rather looks like&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>is taking a more&nbsp;<em>Hatoful Boyfriend</em>-style approach to dating sims rather than the conventional path; this feels rather like a parody effort to me.</p>




<p>Pocketpair also says it's giving away a Lovander body pillow to celebrate the new announcement of&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals</em>. If you want to enter the competition (again, assuming it's real), <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906688298925633793" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can do so on X</a>.</p>

Will you remain friends or fall in love? Or dismantle and eat them...🍴 Your dream school romance starts here in this <em>Palworld </em>dating sim!”</p><p>Say hello to Splatterina (“I’m good with crafts and medicines”), Nurse Saya (“Huh? No drinking at school...? Don’t be so uptight”), and Katress (“You won’t be able to take your eyes off me”). There’s no release date yet but the Steam page lists a whopping requirement of  4 MB available space. </p><p>The dating sim was first mentioned last April Fools’ day, just a couple months after <em>Palworld</em> had blown up on Steam and Xbox Game Pass. It leaned into the base game’s mix of cuteness—adorable Pokémon knock-off creatures—and depravity—forced labor camps—to suggest a romantic spin-off that would turn taboos into memes. Some players claimed to be disappointed that <em>Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~</em> wasn’t actually real. The Pal’s paw might have just curled to grant their  wish. <br></p><p>“Not again this  april joke feels sad,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906687045130653704&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906687045130653704" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one person on X. “April joke? What?  Wishlist now on Steam :)” replied the official<em> Palworld </em>account.</p><p>The latest <em>Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~</em> stunt arrives after the survival crafting sim’s one-year anniversary, and in the midst of a legal battle with Nintendo over patents for certain game mechanics that may have been infringed upon, like aiming and throwing a ball to collect a Pal inside it. </p><p> “Pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan, so it was a very depressing day, everyone heads down and walking in the rain,” community manager John Buckley <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-gdc-2025-1851770719?_gl=1*1ktuif2*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQyNTU2MC41OS4xLjE3NDM0MjczMzguNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-gdc-2025-1851770719?_gl=1*1ktuif2*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQyNTU2MC41OS4xLjE3NDM0MjczMzguNjAuMC4w">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> in an interview earlier this month. “It changed a lot of things for us.

<p>Call of duty has released a brand-new trailer for Warzone, showing off the return of the original map ‘Verdansk’.</p>



<p>The near three-minute trailer shows off the return of the original map, weapons, vehicles and more in spectacular Call of Duty fashion, with the re-confirmation that the map will return with 150 players.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? 🥹

No escape from the fight now — Drop into the map that started it all in Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VerdanskReturns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#VerdanskReturns</a><span> 🪂 </span></p></article></div>



<p>According to sources, Verdansk comes at a crucial point for Call of Duty Warzone, with Activision hoping that the map will see a resurgence in players similar to how the original Fortnite map worked for Epic Games.</p>



<p>One source said that Verdansk could be “do or die” for the free-to-play Battle Royale, whereas another said it likely means Warzone support will dwindle down if its play numbers don’t increase.</p>



<p>Verdansk is set to return to Warzone not as “original” as some might have expected though. This time, the Battle Royale map will return with some movement adjustments, including keeping in omnimovement. The developers did outline that player movement speed has bee reduced though, to try and stay somewhat in line with how the game originally felt. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the return of Verdansk in Call of Duty Warzone? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Death provides no escape, as his jailors will keep reviving him until he serves every last second. But one way out does exist: win on Cable Galactica’s hottest game show, “The Last Ticket.”</p><p>Starting off with just melee attacks, brutalize waves of foes with kicks and punches, eventually earning ranged weapons like simple pistols up to assault rifles and futuristic firearms that can pack a punch from a distance. Roll to dodge attacks, or use carefully-timed blocks to deflect enemy attacks, just don’t run out of energy.</p><p>The Last Ticket’s grotesque host Volkov may be a monster, but he likes entertainment, so Morgan has access to cybernetic implants that increase the strength of his melee attacks, enable literally bone-crushing combos, and enable the usage of giant sledgehammers. What’s a cybernetic upgrade without the ability to unleash special powers like rocket-propelled dash punches and electric shockwaves?</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Reviving Morgan after each run will prove to be Volkov’s gravest mistake, as the currency earned each run can go toward permanent unlocks, giving Morgan more and more advantages as he seeks freedom, no matter what it may cost him along the way.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="KIBORG - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yk-nwn4YLYA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

enhancement stuff that is coming in," Dumont said. "I can't just make a list. There's quite a bit of it. So the team is always working to improve the game, and hopefully, people will be able to see the difference when they're playing Shadows in the upcoming months."</p><p>Currently, Assassin's Creed Shadows offers the standard selection of easy, medium, and hard difficulty options, as well as several gameplay modifiers to further fine-tune the experience to be more forgiving or more punishing.</p><p>Interestingly, the game that Shadows is often compared to, Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima, put a spin on an extreme difficulty mode not long after that game was released in 2020. Lethal Mode made Ghost of Tsushima feel more dangerous overall, as both players and enemies could deliver lethal damage with a single attack.</p><p>Alongside smaller parry windows and enemy aggression being dramatically increased, that made the open-world samurai game more interesting than simply turning enemies into sponges that could absorb an absurd amount of damage; perhaps Ubisoft could adopt a similar approach with Shadows if it chooses to introduce a new difficulty mode.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-recruits-2-million-players-to-the-brotherhood-in-its-first-weekend/1100-6530301/">Assassin's Creed Shadows has been off to a strong start so far</a>--although not quite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-isnt-doing-as-well-as-valhalla-but-thats-okay/1100-6530333/">as strong as Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> for a variety of reasons. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/">Ubisoft also announced a major change to its organization</a> last week, as it revealed that it had created a new "dedicated subsidiary" focused on Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Tencent has invested $1.25 billion USD in a minority stake of this subsidiary.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest unanswered questions in all of gaming for 2025 is when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA VI</a> will be released. Take-Two and developer Rockstar Games have yet to announce a date, and that could be part of the plan.</p><p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick told Bloomberg TV's Wall St. Week that while some of its competitors may announce release dates or windows years into the future, that's not what Take-Two will usually do. When asked directly why Take-Two is being so secretive about GTA 6's release date, Zelnick said the publisher likes to hold back marketing materials until "relatively" close to launch.</p><p>"The anticipation for [GTA 6] may be the greatest anticipation I've ever seen for an entertainment property, and I've been around the block a few times. And I've been in every entertainment business there is," he said. "We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. We have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance. We've found the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement, and balance the excitement with unmet expectation. We don't always get it right. But that's what we're trying to do."</p><p>In terms of marketing materials, so far, Rockstar Games has released just one trailer for GTA 6--and it arrived all the way back in December 2023. Rockstar Games has not released any additional trailers or screenshots, or discussed the game at all since then.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0M53-LKlECk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Zelnick also discussed why it's taken more than a decade for Rockstar Games to release GTA 6 following GTA 5's launch in 2013. Zelnick said whereas some of its competitors launch new entries in major franchises on a semi-regular basis, Take-Two's teams "set an intention" of letting certain franchises rest, in part to create hype. While it's true Rockstar has not released a numbered GTA sequel since 2013, the franchise has hardly rested, as Rockstar launched the game on new platforms and continued to expand the series with ongoing updates to GTA Online.</p><p>Take-Two's sports games are annualized, but for non-sports games, Zelnick said, "We think you need to create enormous anticipation." Also, Zelnick said it simply "takes a long time" to make a big game like GTA 6. "Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do. Perfection is a pretty high bar. It takes a long time," he said.</p><p>Also during the interview, Zelnick said part of the reason why Take-Two's franchises have been successful over the years, including the GTA series, is because Take-Two is able to recruit and retain top talent. Zelnick said he has no creative talent himself but has "some ability to figure out who's really talented" and then hire them. He said Take-Two's management teams largely let individual developers work on their projects with autonomy. "We're not bugging them any more than necessary," he said.</p><p>Zelnick went on to say that Take-Two's teams are granted "essentially unlimited financial resources to create perfection." What's more, Take-Two has a revenue-sharing plan, so when a game succeeds, some of the proceeds are passed on to developers in the form of bonuses. All of these factors contribute to helping Take-Two retain top talent, Zelnick said.</p><p>GTA 6 is officially set for release sometime in Fall 2025 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/" data-ref-id="1100-6529346">PC release potentially to follow later on</a>. Take-Two and Rockstar Games not assigning the game a release date is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-not-being-revealed-yet-could-be-disastrous-for-some-analyst-says/1100-6530312/" data-ref-id="1100-6530312">causing turmoil for developers who are seeking to schedule their own games to avoid it.</a></p><p>Another major Take-Two game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> from developer Gearbox, is launching on September 23. Given the expectation that Take-Two would likely want to give that game some room to breathe, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-might-be-coming-into-focus/1100-6529480/" data-ref-id="1100-6529480">some are expecting GTA 6 to potentially follow in October or November.</a></p>

If you handed me a deck of revolting Tarot cards and told me to heal a bunch of sickly, deranged medieval peasants, I would probably attempt to sew the cards together into bandages. Perhaps I would offer the nicer ones to children instead of lollipops, to distract them while I apply the leeches (lollipops <em>did</em> exist in the Middle Ages, I'm shocked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollipop#History">discover</a>, but mostly in noble circles). Bloodletter has grander ambitions. 
</p>
<p>
In this whispery, crazy-eyed deckbuilder, you'll play Tarot-style cards to purge foul spirits who are seeking to possess and kill your neighbours. "Evil entities have crept into the hearts of the common folk, who teeter upon the brink of madness and death," the developers explain. "Only thy bathhouse stands as a bastion against the creeping corruption." It sounds like a mixture of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-book">Black Book</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>. Here be'est the trailer.

In Bloodletter you play a "barber-surgeon". As stipulated, you operate out of a bathhouse, making you a barber-surgeon...pool attendant? A barber-surgeon-masseuse? And that's before we get to "bloodletter", which very much sounds like it should be a distinct vocation. I write all this in almost total ignorance of how medieval society defined and distinguished caring roles. 
</p>
<p>
In any case, everything you do is handled via the medium of cards. There are over 80, with gloriously manky art, plus six especially powerful blessing and curse cards. You will use them to safeguard ten villagers "with their own talents, oddities, and eerie animations" from four "dreadful entities". One of the demons lives in a statue and invades people's dreams. I'm trying to work out which Tarot cards I'd prescribe for that. Perhaps the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_of_Swords">Nine of Swords</a> followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_(tarot_card)">Strength</a>?
</p>
<p>
I think this could be either a miasmatic delight, or an exercise in gradual disappointment as you realise that there are more familiar card game mechanics and synergies lurking beneath the grotty woodcut illustrations. It'll be a while before we know for sure - the game launches in 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3493400/BLOODLETTER/">Read more on Steam.</a> If you need to get your ghastly cardgame fix sooner, maybe try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roots-devours-demo-harbours-the-seeds-of-a-brilliant-horror-card-rpga">the demo for Roots Devour</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-receiving-new-starcraft-game-pitches-from-well-known-korean-developers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's what they allegedly have in mind.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard is reportedly receiving a number of pitches for new StarCraft video games from Korean studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an article brought to the internet’s attention by X / Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/KoreaXboxnews/status/1905666402482356533" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@KoreaXboxnews</a>, <a href="https://www.asiatoday.co.kr/kn/view.php?key=20250328001954391" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asia Today</a> listed four Korean companies who are reportedly competing with each other to develop new games based on the StarCraft IP and secure publishing rights: NCSoft, Nexon, Netmarble, and Krafton. Apparently some of these companies have traveled to Blizzard’s headquarters in Irvine, California, to make their pitches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NCSoft, which is behind the Lineage and Guild Wars MMOs, is said to have pitched a StarCraft RPG of some kind (an MMORPG?). Nexon, maker of The First Descendant, has pitched a “unique” use of the StarCraft IP. Netmarble (Solo Leveling: Arise, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad) is hoping to make a StarCraft mobile game. And Krafton, the company behind battle royale PUBG and The Sims competitor inZOI, wants to make a StarCraft game “based on its own development capabilities.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, video game companies pitch other video game companies all the time when it comes to securing publishing rights and development contracts. And it may be the case that nothing mentioned here goes anywhere. But StarCraft fans will certainly take note of Blizzard’s reported interest in doing… something to expand the much-loved sci-fi universe, given how long it’s been since the last game in the franchise came out. Activision Blizzard declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that in September, it emerged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm"><u>Blizzard was making a third attempt at developing a StarCraft shooter</u></a>, with former Far Cry executive producer Dan Hay, who joined Blizzard in 2022, leading the charge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news came from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier while speaking to IGN’s Podcast Unlocked, below, about his recent book, Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment. Hay’s StarCraft shooter is mentioned in the book, and IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey asked Schreier if it’s likely to actually come out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“If it’s not canceled!” Schreier replied. “This is Blizzard after all. Their history with StarCraft shooters is not good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes, that is a project that as far as I know is in development, or at least as of the time that I wrote this book was in development. They are working on a StarCraft shooter, StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The goal of the book isn’t to get a bunch of scoops about upcoming things. That wasn’t the purpose of this book at all, it was very much to tell a story and focus on stuff that had happened. But this felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit StarCraft shooters.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was a reference to Blizzard’s infamous attempt to release a StarCraft shooter in the past as part of a bid to expand the StarCraft franchise beyond its real-time strategy origins. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-ghost"><u>StarCraft Ghost</u></a>, announced in 2002, was going to be a tactical-action console game in which you played as a deadly Ghost operative in the employ of the Dominion, but it was canceled in 2006 after a series of delays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A second attempt to make a StarCraft shooter, codenamed Ares, was canceled in 2019 so Blizzard could focus on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv"><u>Diablo 4</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a>. Ares was reportedly “like Battlefield in the StarCraft universe,” but, like Ghost, fell by the wayside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, in November, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-job-ad-confirms-upcoming-open-world-shooter-is-in-the-works-and-all-signs-point-to-starcraft">Blizzard was spotted hiring for an “upcoming open-world shooter game,”</a> with all signs pointing to it being a StarCraft FPS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things are slowly ramping up for StarCraft. Blizzard recently released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starcraft-remastered-and-starcraft-2-campaign-collection-confirmed-for-game-pass"><u>StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection on Game Pass</u></a>, and announced a StarCraft crossover with Warcraft card game Hearthstone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It's been three months. Has the team been happy with the response?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I was honestly not expecting that we would beat a PoE 1 launch in terms of concurrency, because obviously this was early access. It was paid instead of being free at this point. So the fact that we exceeded and went even much higher than the largest PoE 1 launch we've ever done was obviously incredible. The scary thing, of course though, isn't you've got that many players. There's lots of considerations you have to make about supporting them and we've obviously done this before, but it's still a lot of work obviously when you've got that many players and having to make sure that you're dealing with all the various problems that they have.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And after sprinting to the finish line for a number of years to get to the early access state you guys are at, how has the team been holding up as you support what's essentially a live-service game where the sprint is not likely to end anytime soon? Have you guys been able to catch your breath at all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Yeah, a hundred percent. For a start, we had Christmas break. We gave everyone an extra week for that as well beyond what they would normally have. We made sure that everything was okay there. We also were really trying to make sure that there was no more overtime, making sure that everything goes back to 40 hours a week, that everything's sort of normal again. And so, that's really meant that we're kind of, I think, the studio is sort of back in a sustainable pace again, which is really good. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing that I would say that our company is good at doing is coming up with new content very efficiently and creating new things very well. So even though it's not the crazy crunch that we were having before, I still think we're able to create content really fast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I mean, PoE 2 has a lot of stuff going on in it and that's even including this [expansion] and it's been three months, and that's even including the fact we had Christmas in the middle. So honestly, the main thing is just getting back on that thing that we actually do well as a company, which is the live-support, like having a game being live. I think that's our specialty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so it's actually nice to be back in a position where we're doing that again rather than having this kind of endless project that continues on forever, which honestly makes me more uncomfortable, because people can get out of the practice of shipping, which I think sometimes can be a problem.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Path of Exile 2: Dawn of the Hunt Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It seems like Dawn of the Hunt is going to focus a lot on revising the end game experience. Can you share what the top takeaways were that your team received in terms of community feedback based on the initial release and how you guys are addressing them with this update?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Yeah, so I guess the main things that we had were, for a start: you've got content. The content wasn't lasting. It wasn't lasting to the hundreds of hours the players wanted to be able to last. And the reason for that, really, is that we didn't have enough what we would call “overlapping axis of randomness." And what I mean by that is that you've got mechanics that need to be able to spawn in regular maps, they need to be able to interact together ideally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So in this expansion we're adding over 40 encounters, if you will, in terms of strong boxes and different types of wisps and bosses running around — stuff like that. But the idea is to get more than 40 interesting combat situations out of that by allowing more of that content to be able to be introduced to each other. So you still see situations that are new even as you play hundreds and hundreds of hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for example, you'll get a type of wisp, that certain type of boss, and then it's like, 'okay, well now this boss has got some ability.' It changes how the fight plays out. What if you had a corrupted essence at the same time, and what if you had this and what if you had that? All of these things overlap together to produce a combinatorial explosion of possible outcomes that make the game much more interesting. And on PoE 1, we definitely had that in its end game with all the stuff we've added, but PoE 2 didn't quite have enough of that stuff. Everything was somewhat compartmentalized for the most part. So it's like, well, once you've played it all one time, it's like, well, then now you've done that thing and it's not as interesting to play it the second time and over and over again. So basically we just need more of that type of stuff. And so that's where the focus has been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But another thing as well has just been for the existing mechanics, there's been a lot of tweaks. And the thing we have to be careful of when we're doing that stuff is players will say, for example, they'll say, 'oh, you need to drop more maps because I'm not sustaining maps.' And then we're like, 'okay, well I'm not having any trouble sustaining maps. What's going on here?' And then you find out, well, okay, the reason why this is happening is because they're dying too much and much more than we expected. When you actually look at that stuff and then when they die, they obviously don't get the drops for the rest of the map. So we're like, okay, well how can we alleviate that problem? Maybe that's the issue. And then we started thinking about what should the death penalty be. And that's how we get into changing the rez mechanics of maps. And so it's things like that, where you hear one thing, you have to try and come up with a different solution to try and improve things a lot.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The players need to get good, that's what I'm hearing.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Well, no, I mean, we are just making it so that if the players aren't good, they're not nearly as screwed as they were if they were. And this is the thing: it's actually, a lot of the time, it is an exercise in minimizing the differences between the best players and the worst players as far as making sure that they both have good experiences, and it's like you still need to make it so that there are big differences, but you don't want it to be that a player who's not good is just getting completely screwed in their ability to continue to keep playing the end game. And so that's why we have to, we've made special rules, we've changed the drop mechanics for maps very significantly as well. There's just lots of things like that that kind of go on that are not worth mentioning as far as content goes in a livestream, but certainly will matter a lot to the play experience for players who are actually playing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One thing I run into a lot, because my beat at IGN is a lot of online games and live-service games, is not just the division between highly skilled and low skilled players, but players who have a ton of time and want to live in this game and players who are time-taxed. And often there's a FOMO gap of like, 'well, I could make my game have a ton of content, but then this group is going to be feeling like they're just going to miss out and maybe fall off of the game because now there's too much content for them to ever possibly keep up with.' How does the team think about that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Well, I mean, ultimately, I think that more content is better than less when it comes to this kind of stuff. Even though you may run into that situation, the people who are going to be the people who play the most are also going to be the people who are most on your side and talking about your game and generating the buzz. So I think it is very important to make sure we're appealing to those people and other people who have less time. I mean, they're still going to come along for the ride and they're still going to have a great time, and so long as we're still adding enough content, they're going to enjoy it even if they don't get to experience literally everything. I think that's okay. And there's also this sort of funny thing where on some level you need aspirational content to exist in the game content that is hard for most people to get to in order for there to be something to strive for next time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you didn't make it to the Pinnacles this time, well, then maybe you'll play next time when we've added more stuff throughout the rest of the game that improves your experience. But then the second time you play, you'll have a better time and Path of Exile is actually a game that kind of almost has a meta experience grind of each time you play the game you get better as a player, which means you get further into it and further towards the goal. So that, I think, is part of the reason why Path of Exile has such appeal. PoE 1 still is growing. I mean, maybe I can't unequivocally say that now, but at least until Path Of Exile 2 came out PoE 1 was still setting concurrency records so many years after it came out. And I think that is really a lot of the reason for that.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/30/layeredkeyart-highres2-1743294683567.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Huntress, holding her favored weapon.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speaking of aspirational content, you mentioned during yesterday's briefing that you were disappointed by how easily players were able to knock down the big end game boss at launch. Can you talk about how Dawn of the Hunt plans to scale back the pace at which players can creep up their power, assuming that's something you guys are shooting for?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> So I wouldn't say that we are shooting for that in the sense that we want, overall, for that to happen. What I will say is that there were certain combinations of mechanics that we didn't expect to be as crazy as they were and those were found faster than people found the content, if you know what I mean. So it sort of meant that all of that — the secrets of build creation had already kind of been unlocked by the time people did that. So yeah, I mean, look, we are doing a huge balance pass. Everything will change. Your expectations of what is good and what is not good will just be readjusted very significantly by this. And the hope is that, as we continue to iterate, that we'll just keep on improving. We will saw off anything that jumps up too far, we'll push up anything that's too far at the bottom, and we'll get to the point of having that be a lot better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the reason for that, really, is because if something is easy to get to a broken state, which is... what I mean by that is like, 'oh, you just combine these support gems and then suddenly you've got an amazing build and items don't even matter.' If you have a situation like that, then people will all just do that. Whereas if it's like, 'okay, sure you can kill the Pinnacle Boss in 14 seconds, but first of all, you need a unique from this and you need a unique from that.' And it's like a whole thing, right? If it's economically expensive in-game to be able to do something to become really powerful, then that's fine because you want people to get to the point of killing the Pinnacle Boss in 14 seconds. You just don't want that to be the case the first time you fight the Pinnacle Boss. So that's effectively, ideally, what we're doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so as I said: I don't look at that as slowing the game down exactly. It's just sawing off the things that are causing players to all flock to one particular broken thing and ultimately making the game not have that feeling of progression of power that you want to have. You want to really have that exponential growth all the way from beginning to end and not have any sort of like, 'oh, suddenly I'm just broken now,' that happens at some point.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ultimately, I think that more content is better than less.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Let's talk about the Huntress. What are the main ways that the Huntress differs from the other character classes that are already available in Path of Exile 2, and how does this character justify me going through another play or two of the campaign?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> When we are looking at new characters one of the main questions is what weapon type does it use and how is that weapon type going to make the game feel different? So in this case we've got spears. Obviously you don't have to use spears with the Huntress, you can use it on any class, but assuming you're using the stereotype weapon of the Huntress that’s spears, and the thing is, 'well, what makes this weapon type different than others?' And the answer to that is spears are the only weapon that you can use both at melee distance and also throw them at ranged distance. So that's kind of the thing that we're thinking, 'okay, what can we do to make the gameplay be constantly that: you’re at melee range, you're at projectile range — what's the type of gameplay we can do to cause that to happen?' That will be what will make the class feel different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No other weapon does that. So effectively what it meant was we're like, okay, for every melee combo, we want there to be a ranged skill you have to do before that to unlock it. And for every ranged combo, we want there to be a melee thing you have to do before to unlock that combo. And then we also need to add a lot of tools for getting from one state to the other. And then, what that sort of led to was a class that's incredibly agile, which is very good because it is the primary dex melee character, and it just feels like you're moving around the battlefield a ton, you're jumping in and out. It's just a very kinetic feeling that you get moving forwards and backwards like that, which I think feels very different than the other classes. So to me, that's the reason that you would want to try it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing as well that I thought was quite interesting is that we managed to really get the parry of countering gameplay. We finally found a formula for that to work well in PoE, which was incredibly challenging. And honestly, I was very skeptical we would even be able to achieve it just due to the pace of the monsters attacking you. But we have actually got something that does work in our game context really well. And so that's a fun one for me as well.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/30/lich-1743294683568.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Witch's latest Ascendancy class: the Lich.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tell me about beast taming. How does that mechanic work? Or is the idea that we're killing them and then summoning them from the afterlife necromancer style, or...</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> When you get the Tame Beast skill, you effectively use it on a monster and you get some number of seconds, I think it might be five seconds or something like that, to kill the monster while it's got that tame thing on it. And then if you do that, then effectively it gets trapped. Its spirit gets trapped and then sucked into your character, and then you can summon it as a companion. And the big thing with beast taming is that you get all the mods on the rare that you found. And that means it's not necessarily just about finding the best type of beast, it's also finding a beast that has the best mods that you can use with as well, since all of those monster mods can do that. So that should be quite a fun hunt to find the best beast for your build. So I'm hoping players will have fun with that one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>That's awesome. How long do they remain by your side?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Once you've got them, it's like a Poké Ball, right? That's your beast now. If it dies, it'll resummon. That's your beast. You can only have one at a time though for companions. So basically, you'll find a better beast and then presumably you'll want to be using that one instead later on. But yeah, that's just your beast forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>That's awesome. And are there limitations on what counts as a beast? I assume it has to be an animal.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Basically yes, someone at some point has decided this is a beast and this is not. I'm sure there'll be some arguments from players about whether something counts as a beast or not, but ultimately it just comes down to that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You are recommending that players start a new league with this update. Is this something that we can expect from all of the updates where the best experience is starting from scratch?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Absolutely. And, I mean, that's just our formula really, because our way of looking at things is that we're not a game that you just play forever and ever. We are a game where you come for a season, you play the game for a month or maybe two months, and you get through the content, you get to the point where you feel like your character is finished in some sense, and then you stop and you go play something else. But we'll always be back for another season later on. And as I said, it's a big part of why I believe that our game has so much longevity, is the repeated playthroughs and so on. So it's definitely a different model than what a lot of games in the past have had, but also a model that we've seen a lot of other developers realizing that is actually more sustainable for the industry overall. So something that I like to see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And is that something you think players would also be expected to do once the game reaches its 1.0 full release?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. 100%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned yesterday one of the changes in the end game is the new primary objective in the Atlas end game map of trying to stop corruption, which unlocks the ability to choose between doing corrupted or cleansed versions of maps while exploring the overworld. Can you explain what the pros and cons are of why you might want to do corrupted versus cleansed? Is it flavor or enemies? Are the rewards different?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Effectively the main two things are, the enemies are different: there are different bosses and then those different bosses have different rewards. And there's also things like, so for example, the cleansed maps are the only place that you're going to get the fracturing orbs, which is a new crafting mechanic that we've got. Effectively just making sure that each type of content has different rewards, and then we do like it so that when you have different strategies and what you're doing on your Atlas, depending on what type of content that you need, it's like, if you need this, then you're going to do that. If you need this, you're going to do that. So it's giving the players that sort of idea of them choosing what they're doing, but then ideally also being at a different point in a character's lifetime, they may need to do one versus the other, and so they're going to change their strategy at some point as well. But yeah, it's ultimately like, 'well, what rewards am I getting out of it at the end?' is a different element you have to be worrying about though, whenever we're designing new content.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/30/allclasses-1743295015044.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Path of Exile 2's updated roster of playable characters.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You're also adding over a hundred unique items. Can you tell me about the one you are most excited about personally, and bonus points if it's something that you fear might need to nerf?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> So one of the ones that might be broken is there's a shield that allows you to parry projectiles. We did show it in the video. It effectively means if you've got that unique that you no longer have to be close to monsters anymore. So it kind of deactivates the melee requirement of the Huntress a little bit. You can now parry and do all the combos from range. So we'll see how it goes because the empowered versions of all the spear throws are pretty good. And so we'll see how that goes. And also just in terms of defensiveness, that might be a little bit too off the hook, but we'll see. I'm hoping it'll be okay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I guess it kind of has its own nerf because you have to be able to get the timing right to do the parries.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> This is actually not the case, because in most games you do have to get the timing right to do that. But in our game it's actually kind of the opposite of that. While you're holding down the parry button, you're parrying everything and then it's what you do after the parry. Because what it does is when you parry something, it puts a counter on the enemy that you can then take advantage of with another skill. So it's kind of backwards from how most games do it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've tried parrying mechanics before, actually. It's been one of those things that we struggled to get right. And the reason why it was so hard is because our game moves so quickly and because there's lots of monsters around you all the time, you didn't really have a chance to follow up attacks very easily.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But with the way we've done parries here, it means that you can much more easily and reasonably do that. Now, the reason why it still incentivizes good timing is because it does interrupt. Parry will immediately interrupt anything instantly. And anytime you're waiting for a monster to hit you is wasted time you could be DPSing, so there’s still incentive to get the timing right. Doing the timing before was just so hard with the combat pace we had that it just wasn't working. So yeah, I'm really proud of how that worked out. But honestly, it wasn't even my idea. I actually was not a believer. I didn't think it could work and Mark [Roberts] was the one who actually managed to solve that problem. So once we did that, it really improved the class. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Whenever someone says something like that, it's usually because they're not enjoying going through the campaign, right? Well, okay, let's make you enjoy the campaign more. That should be the solution.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>During the Q&amp;A yesterday, you pushed back on certain ideas, like the ability to skip replaying the campaign and a new character. How does the team think about that extremely difficult balancing act of responding to what players want while also having your own point of view and your creative team sort of holding their ground on decisions that they really believe in?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> It's very hard, but the thing that I always try to do is make sure that whenever I'm hearing community feedback that I'm not just thinking, 'okay, oh they're wrong' or something like that. It's very easy to get into a mindset where you've developed this 'us versus them' mentality like that. And then when that happens, you start to get into this sort of negative cycle of, 'oh, I guess we'll just do it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the thing that I think is really important is you always have the spirit of discovery about, 'well why are they saying this? I know that they think that it's because of this, but why is it actually?' And if you reinterpret things in that lens, if you, first of all, you believe that if someone's saying they've got a problem, they really do have a problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then the second thing being that, 'well, why is that problem actually happening? Can we solve it? What would it look like to solve it?' Then you will eventually find some solution. Now the thing is that sometimes you can't think of one. Sometimes it is really hard. In those cases you just have to say, 'okay, well we are just not going to change this until we can come with something.' I will never make a change I don't believe in because I think that's ultimately going to make the game worse overall. And that's super important that you never do that. But at the same time, sometimes you just won't be able to come up with something. But I am a believer that there always is something, there will be a way to solve the community's problem eventually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, for example, with the particular campaign thing there: whenever someone says something like that, it's usually because they're not enjoying going through the campaign, right? Well, okay, let's make you enjoy the campaign more. That should be the solution. If you are not enjoying something, I'll make you enjoy it by adding content to it, by improving it. That's the way I would view that. But when you're in a community, it's very easy to say, 'okay, well X is bothering me, therefore remove thing X.' You know what I mean? It's just very easy to look at it that way, because they don't have to be worried about the downsides. It's not their job to be worried about that. Their job is just to complain about the thing they don't like, and my job is to be the one worrying about the downside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt launches April 4, 2025.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Travis Northup is a writer for IGN.

<p>This latest figure is for players across all available platforms, and includes those who have taken Death Stranding for a whirl as part of a subscription service such as PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p>As noted by industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX">Daniel Ahmad</a>, Death Stranding had sold less than 5m copies prior to its release on the likes of PC, PS+, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Mac.</p>
<p>"Making the game more accessible has led to 20m+ players experiencing the IP prior to the launch of its sequel that will require players to own a PS5 to play at launch," Ahmad wrote on X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-20m-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima has announced that his most recent game&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed another big player milestone ahead of the release of the hotly-anticipated sequel later this year.</p>

<p>Speaking on social media platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2jd64ychnmuu4x6eghptdvco/post/3llo4343bk222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Kojima Productions revealed that&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed 20 million players around the world, thanking "everyone who built bridges, paved roads, and delivered cargo" for the "incredible milestone".</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Kojima Productions is referring not just to sales of the game, but to the player count as a whole. That figure therefore likely includes players who have experienced the game on PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass; it's currently available on the former on both PS4 and PS5.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-20m-players-box.jpg?itok=PtkmihIz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-20m-players-box.jpg?itok=zi3L6yvs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed 20 million players worldwide.</figcaption></figure><p>The new player milestone for <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>comes as Kojima and his studio prepare to release the game's sequel,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for a June launch on PlayStation 5</a>.</p>

<p>It looks like the game will be exclusive to Sony's console for the foreseeable future, but given that Kojima <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">now owns the IP rights</a> to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, I really wouldn't be surprised to see the game get a multiplatform release at some point.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>movie, which will be a co-production between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">Kojima's studio and movie house A24</a>, to look forward to. We still don't know who will be starring in that or when we can expect to see it, however.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, it's Hideo Kojima's first major project after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-hideo-kojima-leaves-konami-forms-new-studio" rel="nofollow">leaving Konami back in 2015</a>. He's best known for the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series, although he's also worked on other games like&nbsp;<em>Policenauts&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zone of the Enders</em>.</p>




<p><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>tells the post-apocalyptic story of Sam Porter Bridges, a courier who must deliver packages in a world devastated by a mysterious cataclysm. Of course, if you know Kojima's work, you'll know that's hardly doing the game justice.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/death-stranding-directors-cut/9nqgn8tgnt8p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The sequel, <i>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</i>, is <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launching for PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/638535/physical-digital-video-games-nintendo-xbox-ps5-disc-cart<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of Sony’s best-ever PlayStation ads is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA">a 21-second video</a> titled, “Official PlayStation Used Game Instructional Video.” It’s a “step-by-step” guide about how to lend your PS4 games to your friends. It has one step: one person hands another person a game box.</p><p>The ad succinctly clowns on Microsoft’s original and convoluted game sharing policy for the Xbox One, which let users ditch discs in exchange for daily DRM checks. The idea was so hated that Microsoft <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/19/xbox-one-drm-second-hand-restrictions-abandoned">walked it back</a> just over a week after the release of Sony’s ad and months before the console came out. The lesson was simple — don’t mess with people’s discs.</p><p>But more than a decade later, it’s not hard to imagine a future where Sony’s own ad doesn’t apply anymore. </p><p>Physical game sales in 2024 were less than half what they were as recently as 2021, and the market has been in decline since 2008, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella tells <em>The Verge</em>. “There has been a long trend of declining sales in physical games,” Piscatella says. “And now there’s declining distribution with retailers pulling back space, with companies making fewer physical games overall, and with the entire shift towards digital distribution.”</p><p>The writing has been on the wall since 2020, when Microsoft and Sony introduced their (at the time) next-generation Xbox and PlayStation consoles with versions that didn’t have a place to put your discs. Ultimately, they were responding to the emerging trend of people buying fewer physical games for consoles. Can you even remember the last time you bought a physical game for PC?</p><p>The primary reason for the shift to digital is because of connectivity: about 99 percent of consoles are connected to the internet, Piscatella says. (Players weren’t quite as online <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2015/game-consoles-in-2015-one-stop-shop-for-games-and-entertainment/">a decade ago</a>.) And once people got used to digital, “more and more often people would choose convenience over the practical positives of physical.”</p><p>Just look at this graph from Piscatella showing plummeting physical sales. The outlook is grim.</p><p>Microsoft hasn’t been particularly secretive about its interest in a heavily digital future. The latest Xbox generation launched with the all-digital Series S, and it added an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174793/microsoft-xbox-series-x-white-digital-edition">all-digital Series X option</a> last year. Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">“This is an Xbox” campaign</a> positions basically every device with a screen as a potential console. The company’s Xbox Game Pass subscription is essentially a rental service for digital titles. And physical editions of <em>Avowed</em>, one of Microsoft’s biggest Xbox games of the year, only have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-avowed-xbox-pc-premium-edition">a code for the game</a> in the box.</p><p>Of course, Microsoft is best known as a software company, so perhaps it’s not too surprising that it might want to bank its video game future entirely on digital games. And while I still think it will be a shame if the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264129/halo-unreal-engine-5-halo-studios-announcement">next <em>Halo</em></a> isn’t available on a disc, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to expect that Xbox could drop discs entirely by the end of the decade.</p><p>Sony will probably take a little bit longer to make the all-digital jump. The company is certainly signaling it wants to move in that direction, perhaps most strongly by shipping the premium $699 PS5 Pro <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241265/sony-ps5-pro-game-console-disc-drive-end">without a disc drive</a>. But it continues to sell drives separately for the Pro and for the slim PS5. And the company would simply face pushback on a different scale than Microsoft: there are far more PS4s and PS5s out there than Xboxes, and that means a lot more people who have bought a lot more physical games who may want ways to play them for the foreseeable future. </p><p>Piscatella also points out that some major mass-market games like <em>EA Sports College Football</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em> have a “pretty big physical presence” that console makers may not want to jeopardize.</p><p>Nintendo is where we see the argument for physical games — though maybe not <em>discs</em> — sticking around. The just-announced Switch 2 has a cartridge slot and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">backward-compatible with Switch 1 games</a>. The console’s first generation lasted from 2017 until sometime this year, so if the Switch 2’s lifecycle also lasts eight years, physical media will be relevant for Nintendo well into the 2030s.</p><p>The company may have reason to stick with cartridges for even longer. Piscatella says that Nintendo platforms are still “heavier physical” than other platforms because its audience, especially families, expects the format; it’s a lot easier for kids in a family to share a game when they can just pass the cart to each other, as Sony adeptly showed in its ad. That advantage won’t last forever, though. Just last week, Nintendo announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system">a “virtual game card” lending system</a> that lets family members share digital games.</p><div><p>“Consumers on PlayStation and Xbox are speaking with their dollars”</p></div><p>It’s yet another sign that physical media is waning, even in its strongholds. “At this point, the consumers on PlayStation and Xbox are speaking with their dollars that digital-first is a fine way to go,” Piscatella says.</p><p>Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox did not respond to requests for comment on their future plans for physical media.</p><p>While physical media sales are on the decline, New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen points out that the sales of physical video game accessories have been “skyrocketing.” The PC <em>games </em>market may be mostly digital on Steam, but sales of things like custom controllers, screens, chairs, and headphones are a “huge category,” he says.</p><p>He believes that accessories and what he calls “the personalization of the physical experience of games and interactivity” will grow, which we can see manifested all the way to theme parks. (van Dreunen points out that Nintendo is particularly good at this: think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/16/8050027/nintendo-amiibo-sales-charts">Amiibo</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">Alarmo clock</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">theme parks</a> filled with Nintendo goodies.)</p><p>Both van Dreunen and Piscatella ultimately made the comparison of video games to vinyl records, which is “kind of like on the extreme niche, but doing ok,” Piscatella says. There’s a key difference between vinyl and video games, of course — with a vinyl record, you can play it on a turntable, but a physical cart of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> can only slot into a Nintendo Switch. It’s more about the enthusiast crowd focusing on physical media.</p><p>Maybe that will be enough to keep physical formats around into the future. But the next time Sony makes a guide on how to share PlayStation games, I doubt it will be a crisp 21 seconds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An alleged cryptocurrency scam that models itself on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will be launching on Steam this week, despite Valve's promises that they do not allow NFT or blockchain games to exist on the platform. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paradise-xrpl">Paradise</a> has been advertised as an action game set in a sunny city which will allow players to drive cars, shoot enemies, and earn money. But its in-game currency is based on blockchain technology, and some reports allege it is a scam based in Russia which does not allow its crypto investors to withdraw funds. When asked why the game is allowed on the platform, Valve have repeatedly neglected to comment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Paradise will be releasing into early access on April 2, say developers Ultra Games. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_c9D63YNm4">recent trailer</a> shows a player inspecting guns, walking through a garage full of cars, and navigating a world split up with loading screens made with AI-generated art designed to look like the loading screens of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> series. Previous trailers boast that you can speak to any NPC using AI technology. </p>
<p>"Play with your friends, engage in shootouts, race cars, complete daily missions, and reach the apex of life," reads a blurb. "Earn money and buy what you want, from real estate to fancy clothes." The creators have boasted that the game is in Steam's top 200 most wishlisted games. It's possible many of those Steam users aren't aware of the game's grubby features and history of misleading marketing.</p>
<p>Paradise uses a currency called the $PAR token which is based on blockchain technology, and can be invested in via a third-party app. Some investors in this cryptocoin claim they became unable to withdraw funds, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-copycat-paradise-is-an-alleged-crypto-scam-yet-continues-to-gain-steam-wishlists">we reported in January</a>. The developers have also falsely claimed to be working with streamers such as Ninja and Pokimane, and included unlicensed use of a Lamborghini and other cars in previous trailers. </p>

<p>Together with a lot of AI slop and very heavy use of Unreal Marketplace assets, the game had enough red flags that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9CQBMzLjCA">multiple YouTubers investigated the company</a> behind it, with one discovering that the Hong Kong address listed by the company was fake and eventually discovering that it is actually based somewhere in Tbilisi, Georgia - a city with <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/project/scam-empire/diamonds-dior-and-dubai-vacations-the-luxurious-lives-of-georgias-call-center-scammers">a troubled history when it comes to blockchain scammers</a>. </p>
<p>"Versions of the game for Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation Store will not include cryptocurrency, ensuring there are no restrictions for users on these platforms," say the developers in a <a href="https://paradisevs.com/company_statement2">defensive rebuttal</a> on their website. Unfortunately, no one can verify the developer's claims until the game is released. But even if a means to buy the currency is not present in the final release, it wouldn't restrict the game from redirecting players to the third-party cryptocurrency app necessary for players to earn and spend the game's $PAR token in-game. An act which, in itself, could be harmful to users, even if Valve’s terms of service don’t specifically forbid this. Since the game can still serve as a Trojan horse for hooking people into an alleged crypto scam.</p>
<p>On top of this, the document which insists cryptocurrency will not be in the game is full of other misleading statements, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CA4RvTrS-nE">pointed out by video creator Jetro</a>, one of the YouTubers who previously investigated the game. The developers claim their use of a minimap from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> is allowed, for example, because "The GTA 5 map is based on the real layout of Los Angeles, which is not intellectual property". To avoid doubt: the GTA 5 map is not a 1:1 reproduction of Los Angeles, and Rockstar own the rights to that map. </p>
<p>Steam <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-is-banning-games-with-nfts-and-cryptocurrency">banned all games that feature NFT and cryptocurrency</a> in 2021. The Paradise developers have edited the game's Steam page a number of times since it first appeared, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3281420/history/?changeid=U:56561021">removing trailers that mention cryptocurrency</a>, for example. It's unclear if Valve have been in contact with the developers or not. I have asked Valve for comment on this game multiple times and have not received a response. </p>
<p>The game is also launching <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/paradise-xrpl-9e47b6">on the Epic Store</a>, but only after it was removed once and reuploaded as "Paradise XRPL" , with a store page that clearly states it is an NFT game, along with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/paradise-xrpl-faq-9f3b93">an FAQ on its crypto gubbins</a> which insists that it is good for the game. "The introduction of a crypto token in PARADISE XRPL enhances the product by enabling streamlined transactions for in-game purchases, facilitating trade between players, and granting access to exclusive content." I have also asked Epic Games for comment and will let you know if we learn more. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Adam Sandler is easily one of the biggest comedy stars ever in Hollywood. Though he’s run afoul of critics for years, Sandler has enjoyed a loyal following due to his everyman persona that thumbs the nose of well-dressed muckity mucks. His recent cameo at the 2025 Oscars says it all: He’s a superstar who revels in the comfort of zip-up hoodies and basketball shorts over designer tuxes. And we wouldn’t have him any other way.</p><p>This July, the unexpected sequel <em>Happy Gilmore 2</em> will hit the links on Netflix, where Sandler has called home for the better part of the last decade. In commemoration of Sandler’s return to the world that boosted him to the upper echelons of movie stardom, we’ll be running down through all of Adam Sandler’s major movies to rank the worst to best. Get your Scuba Steve goggles on and dive in. </p></div></div><div><p>Just because a movie calls itself “ridiculous” doesn’t excuse it from being abominable. One of Adam Sandler’s first major forays into streaming-release movies was the Western spoof <em>The Ridiculous 6</em>, a movie mired in controversy – a disputed number of Native actors walked off the set over its offensive humor – only to have the dubious recognition of earning 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. Are critics being uptight? Just once, maybe trust them on this.</p></div><div><p>Adam Sandler could have sunk after his film debut in 1989, the seafaring dud <em>Going Overboard</em>. Predating his run on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, Sandler’s first movie is his first as a leading man, and sees him play a cocktail waiter on a cruise ship who harbors lofty dreams of becoming the ship’s resident comedian. Budget production value doesn’t weigh down <em>Going Overboard</em> so much as Sandler’s painfully obvious inexperience sinks it. </p></div><div><p>Behold an Adam Sandler comedy that hasn’t just spoiled like milk, but is straight up radioactive. Sandler stars in <em>You Don’t Mess with the Zohan</em> as a top-rate soldier for the Israel Defense Force who abandons his post to pursue his dreams of becoming a hair stylist in America, where he falls for a Palestinian salon owner (played by Emmanuelle Chirqui). There’s no point in getting worked up over an almost 20-year-old comedy that’s dumber than rocks where the most memorable gag has Sandler smack a guy with a fake foot. But truly, what the hell was anyone thinking? </p></div><div><p>An empty calorie sequel to a comedy few liked in the first place, <em>Grown Ups 2 </em>lives to serve anyone who finds middle aged men in low-stakes crises to be the peak of modern entertainment. David Spade, Chris Rock, and Kevin James reunite with Adam Sandler for a rudderless second round that sees the grown men square off with a neighboring college fraternity. Why bother with Sandler waddling around in oversized basketball shorts when the infinitely better <em>Neighbors </em>with Seth Rogen and Zac Efron exists?</p></div><div><p>Somehow, Al Pacino saw fit to put in effort in <em>Jack and Jill</em> while Adam Sandler floats around on autopilot. Sandler does double duty playing both an ad executive and his intrusive twin sister who overstays her welcome during the holidays. There’s no other way to say it:<em> Jack and Jill</em> is bad. Really bad. But Pacino proves he’s one of the greatest actors of our time by making a meal out of his supporting role, where he plays himself caught up doing a lame Dunkin Donuts campaign. Sandler must have made him an offer he couldn’t refuse. </p></div><div><p>A star-studded religious satire that makes a convincing argument for atheism,<em> Little Nicky</em> stars Adam Sandler as the “kindest” son of Satan (Harvey Keitel) who is sent to Earth to keep his brothers from wreaking havoc on a biblical scale. Nothing in <em>Little Nicky</em>, not even a giggling Reese Witherspoon in angel wings, can redeem the movie’s damned soul. A lethally annoying performance by Sandler is arguably the movie’s deadliest sin.</p></div><div><p>A movie adaptation of a divorced man’s Funko Pop collection, <em>Pixels </em>is a headache-inducing tentpole that doesn’t mine Generation X nostalgia so much as weaponizes it in a test of human endurance. Adam Sandler plays one of several grown-up arcade champions from Reagan’s America who are called by the President of the United States (Kevin James) to save the world from an alien invasion who’ve taken the form of classic video game monsters. Sandler in a “real-life” version of <em>Space Invaders</em> <strong>should</strong> be fun. But <em>Pixels </em>is so bad in its unfunny excess you might feel compelled to firebomb your local retro bar arcade in an act of vengeance.</p></div><div><p><em>That’s My Boy </em>begins with statutory rape and ends in incest. Even for Adam Sandler, <em>That’s My Boy</em> is far too filthy and unfunny to put up with. It’s also maddening, given how it squanders a dynamite pairing of Sandler and Andy Samberg. <em>That’s My Boy</em> sees Adam Sandler play the deadbeat dad to his estranged son (Samberg) – born of a highly-publicized teacher-student affair – who crashes his son’s wedding to stage a lucrative TV reunion. It might look like another run-of-the-mill Sandler joint, but its over-extended reach for shock humor make it a distasteful wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p></div><div><p>You have to give The Sandman credit: He’s treated his lucrative Netflix deal for the blank check it is, taking the tech giant’s money to kick it in Puerto Rico. Sandler co-stars in <em>The Do-Over </em>with David Spade, who plays a hapless man in a loveless marriage who gets the chance to start life anew after running into his old classmate (Sandler) at a high school reunion. The bullets start flying when they find out the dead men whose identities they’ve stolen were caught up in shady stuff. A deflating action-comedy, <em>The Do-Over</em> is ironically-titled; Do-over? Don’t even bother.</p></div><div><p><em>Grown Ups</em> is a better movie than its sequel, but that’s like saying a colonoscopy is better than rectal cleaning. In the first of the two films, Sandler and his other seasoned Hollywood comics spend 90 minutes making poo jokes in a pathetic comedy that deals with the difficulties of aging with dignity. Sandler unites with Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, and Rob Schneider as childhood buddies who meet up years later with their families in an attempt to recapture their youthful vigor. <em>Grown Ups</em> is like watching a 40-something year old at the bar telling obnoxious jokes – and it’s just as unfun as it sounds.</p></div><div><p>After years of churning out lewd and crude product, Adam Sandler took a surprising turn with 2014's<em> The Cobbler</em>, a little piece of magical realism. Sandler is in a whole different gear, playing a humble shoe repairman with the power to become his own customers. Despite welcome sincerity and Sandler demonstrating more dramatic heft than normal – though Sandler gets assist from <em>other</em> actors playing his metamorphing shoemaker – <em>The Cobbler</em> is too riddled with scuffmarks in spite of its own good intentions.</p></div><div><p>Because a questionable amount of people watched <em>Murder Mystery </em>in 2019, Netflix punished its own customers with a direct sequel, <em>Murder Mystery 2 </em>in 2023. Following up on its predecessor, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston return as the Spitzes, who are now struggling to keep their private detective agency afloat. Their latest case: finding the Maharajah, who has just been kidnapped at his own wedding. Anniston and Sandler are clearly having fun, it’s just a bummer how no one else is.</p></div><div><p>It’s strange to realize how Adam Sandler came to prominence in the waning years of the buddy action movie boom, yet never made any meaningful strides in the genre. Among the only few buddy movies Sandler ever made was 1996's <em>Bulletproof</em>, where Sandler stars as a two-bit criminal who reunites with an estranged friend (Damon Wayans) who is actually an undercover cop. Few people remember Bulletproof and for good reason: It’s boring. Uninspired and plodding, Sandler and Wayans’ lethargic chemistry – or lack thereof – leaves <em>Bulletproof </em>anything but.</p></div><div><p>Overstimulating to the point of inducing anaphylactic shock, <em>Hotel Transylvania 3</em> slightly flips the script from the 2012 original. This time, Adam Sandler’s Dracula takes his monstrous family and friends on a crusie liner vacation, where he falls for Kathryn Hahn’s Ericka, later to be revealed as the great granddaughter of his nemesis Abraham Van Helsing. Even the movie’s target audience of kids might find <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> <em>3</em> extra, and even harmless fun can leave them winded.</p></div><div><p>A whodunnit as plain as its title, <em>Murder Mystery</em> lacks the swagger and sex appeal inherent to the genre – and that’s kind of the point. Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston reunite from <em>Just Go With It</em> to play an ordinary married couple who, after being invited to come aboard a billionaire’s yacht party, must now prove their innocence after their affluent host (Terence Stamp) is murdered. Though Anniston and Sandler get moderate mileage out of their fish-out-of-water roles, <em>Murder Mystery </em>is glossy plastic, yet another streaming thing to be watched passively on your phone. </p></div><div><p><em>Sandy Wexler</em> flirts with brilliance in how it drops Adam Sandler in ‘90s Hollywood to play a talent agent remembered for his eccentricities. But what could have been a self-reflective meditation on Sandler’s own unlikely success as a movie star is instead an unambitious, overly-sentimental rom-com where Sandler falls in love with Jennifer Hudson, a singer whom Sandler’s Sandy discovers at an amusement park. About the only memorable thing about <em>Sandy Wexler</em> is Sandler’s execution of the role. And even then, his oversized glasses, seal-like applauses, and pastel jackets are hardly a new shade. </p></div><div><p>After committing the artistic violation that was <em>Grown Ups 2</em>, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler tried to make amends in 2018 with the more sober Netflix comedy <em>The Week Of</em>. The two play the fathers of an engaged couple who work to put aside their differences during the most important and increasingly calamitous week of their childrens’ lives. <em>The Week Of</em> is light on Sandler’s signature gross-outs, but it’s not enough to keep it afloat either. </p></div><div><p>Back when gay marriage was a hot-button issue, Adam Sandler and Kevin James starred in the abundantly offensive, yet surprisingly sincere <em>I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry</em>. Sandler and James co-star as best friends and New York City firefighters who get legally married to receive benefits; when the government starts getting suspicious, the buds begin masquerading as lovebirds. Originating from a script by Alexander Payne before Sandler got involved, <em>I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry</em> comes across as an unexpected call for social equality, albeit a careless one, from a most unexpected place: the heart. </p></div><div><p>If every major comedy star in Hollywood has to have a cartoon franchise, then Adam Sandler’s money maker is the Hotel Transylvania series. The first of them, released in 2012 and directed by animation auteur Genndy Tartakovsky, introduces Sandler as Count Dracula, who in addition to being the famous vampire also runs a hotel getaway for monsters. Sandler doesn’t seem to really <em>try</em> to be Dracula. Instead, he’s content to come off like he’s in a Halloween costume than actually portraying an eldritch creature of the night. But this, and all the other Hotel Transylania movies, are innocent fluff that ultimately serve to distract rugrats for the afternoon.</p></div><div><p>Adam Sandler returns as Dracula in <em>Hotel Transylvania 2</em>, with the comic star afforded marginally more room to play around as a doting grandfather than the more conventional protective father he was in the predecessor. Still, <em>Hotel Transylvania 2</em> simply keeps the ball rolling, existing as little more than a paycheck for everyone involved. But Sandler has done far worse than voice a funny Dracula, and <em>Hotel Transylvania 2</em> is as sweet as a handful of Halloween candy.</p></div><div><p>In 2014, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore nearly matched Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan to deliver a third in a trio of perfect romantic comedies. Sadly, their efforts fell way short with the flavorless <em>Blended</em>. Sandler and Barrymore co-star as single parents whose disastrous blind date is followed up by a coincidental shared family vacation in South Africa. There’s some sweetness in all its schmaltz, but <em>Blended </em>is nowhere near to the level of what Sandler/Barrymore have delivered before. </p></div><div><p>Adam Sandler in a squeaky-clean Disney movie sounds like magic on paper, but<em> Bedtime Stories </em>is nothing revelatory for the normally crude superstar. Sandler stars as a hotel maintenance man whose bedtime stories to his niece and nephew impausibly become true in reality. But while Sandler starts weaving tall tales of heroism and riches, the oblivious kids offer up some wacky twists of their own. By virtue of its Disney overlords, <em>Bedtime Stories</em> is sanitized Sandler romp the whole family can enjoy, but it’s not anyone’s idea of a dream come true.</p></div><div><p>It’s something of a master stroke on Adam Sandler’s part that he convinces everyone that Jennifer Anniston is the “other” woman in his 2011 rom-com <em>Just Go With It</em>. The Sandman stars as a womanizing plastic surgeon who compels his office manager (Anniston) to parade around as his divorcing wife after he meets someone he believes is his true love (Brooklyn Decker). But naturally, what Sandler is looking for may have been in front of him all this time. <em>Just Go With It </em>doesn’t tread new ground, and you can guess every turn it takes, but it’s a carefree ride.</p></div><div><p>A lesser remake to an already middling 1936 Frank Capra movie, <em>Mr. Deeds</em> sees Adam Sandler as a small-town pizzeria owner who inherits a massive $40 billion fortune, only to find priceless love from a tabloid TV journalist (played by Winona Ryder). Tamer than most Sandler fare but not as memorable either,<em> Mr. Deeds</em> gets most of its worth from Sandler inhabiting a uniquely wholesome, gee-shucks energy that’s in stark contrast to his other screaming buffoons.</p></div><div><p>If you were the right age to catch <em>The Waterboy</em> on cable, chances are bits like “Water sucks, Gatorade is better” are ingrained somewhere in your memory. Otherwise, <em>The Waterboy</em> is typical Adam Sandler slop, a raunchy underdog comedy that obscures its good nature in juvenile idiocy. Sandler stars as a bullied 32-year-old manchild whose new job providing water for a losing Louisiana college football team unlocks the violent superstar within him. Endlessly quotable but not much else,<em> The Waterboy</em> quenches anyone’s thirst for something stupid. </p></div><div><p>As Adam Sandler once sang himself: Christmas is one day, but Hanukkah is eight crazy nights. In this unusual R-rated animated musical, Adam Sandler lends his voice and likeness to become Davey Stone, a 30-something alcoholic who is given one last shot to turn his life around or else spend ten years in prison. Despite clever apperancess and catchy tunes, <em>Eight Crazy Nights </em>doesn’t totally seize on its potential to be a true holiday classic. But if claymation Santas and reindeer feel played out, you can light a candle with a mischievous 2D Sandler. </p></div><div><p>Adam Sandler is known for playing out-of-shape schlubs and <em>very </em>average joes, but for once, he was an all-star MVP in <em>The Longest Yard</em>. A remake of the hard-hitting Burt Reynolds movie from 1974, <em>The Longest Yard</em> follows Sandler as Paul Crewe, a disgraced NFL star who forms a team of inmates to play against their abusive guards. (Burt Reynolds also co-stars in the remake, this time playing the team’s coach.) While this ‘05 remake goes for more laughs than its grittier predecessor, it’s still a down-and-dirty football flick teeming with testosterone.</p></div><div><p>When Adam Sandler failed to get an Oscar for his work in the acclaimed <em>Uncut Gems</em>, he threatened to make a movie that was quote, “so bad on purpose” as an act of revenge. When Sandler went home with no trophies, that’s when <em>Hubie Halloween</em> hit Netflix. But as a surprise, this pumpkin spiced romp is anything but tricks. Sandler plays innocent, Halloween-obsessed deli worker Hubie Dubois who takes it upon himself to save his hometown of Salem, Massachusetts when a kidnapper threatens to ruin the spookiest night of the year. It’s a bizarre follow-up to <em>Uncut Gems</em>, sure, but this sugary sweet Halloween flick is a good time for everyone, even those too young to remember when Sandler wasn’t a Netflix fixture.</p></div><div><p>Before the Bill Lawrence show <em>Shrinking</em> saw Jason Segel play a therapist who invites a patient to live with him, there was the comparatively more reckless <em>Anger Management</em>. A timid businessman (Adam Sandler) has one bad experience on an airplane that leads to court-mandated therapy with a specialist (Jack Nicholson), whose unorthodox treatments escalate to extreme degrees. Though Nicholson pushes Sandler’s buttons, it just might be the thing he needs to finally stand up for himself. <em>Anger Management</em> is no comedy classic, but Nicholson proves he’s a hall of fame-worthy meme machine, eclipsing a surprisingly subdued Sandler. </p></div><div><p>Chad Kultgen’s novel about suburban families wallowing in self-made prisons of sex, boredom, and technology is also a sedated, if sleepy dramedy by <em>Juno</em> and <em>Up in the Air</em> director Jason Reitman. Adam Sandler is one of several familiar faces in the movie; he plays Don Truby, the dissatisfied husband to Helen (Rosemarie DeWitt) and de facto main character of Kultgen’s book. While <em>Men, Women &amp; Children</em> underwhelms like an extramarital fling at a Marriott, its defiance of what a “sex movie starring Adam Sandler” should be might pique interest. </p></div><div><p>During a brief spell when Adam Sandler and pal Rob Schneider were the default stars of lowbrow, high-concept comedies, Sandler took folks by surprise with his emotionally affecting <em>Click</em>. Sandler takes charge as a workaholic family man who is given a magical remote that gives him control over time. But as he fast forwards through the “boring” parts of life, he comes to realize what he’s missing out. Though the movie’s premise is built on a corny Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond gag, <em>Click</em> is disarmingly powerful in its overly familiar but no less resonant message of taking time to pause and bask in the wonderful life you already lead. </p></div><div><p>With stone cold classics like <em>Terms of Endearment</em>, <em>Broadcast News</em>, and <em>As Good as It Gets</em> under his belt, director James L. Brooks disappointed many with his 2004 romantic dramedy <em>Spanglish</em>. But in hindsight, it’s now one of the better turnouts for star Adam Sandler, playing a Los Angeles chef who hires a Spanish-speaking Mexican immigrant (Paz Vega) as a live-in housekeeper. As cultural differences and language barriers create tension, their crowded house becomes a home through shared understanding. <em>Spanglish</em> was not the first mature film to star Sandler – Paul Thomas Anderson’s <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em> was released just two years prior – but its appeal to actual grownups proved Sandler had, and has, more to offer. </p></div><div><p>Clunky inclusion of 9/11 aside, Adam Sandler is in exceptionally rare form as troubled Charlie, a lonely man mourning the loss of his family. After running into an old college roommate (Don Cheadle), who is split between his family and his career, the two rekindle their friendship, finding in each other what they need to carry on and move ahead. With a mop of frumpled hair and oversized earphones as a security blanket, Sandler impresses in one of his most vulnerable roles to date. You should also see him play the heck out of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/feature-the-colossus-and-the-comedian-246286&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/feature-the-colossus-and-the-comedian-246286"><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em></a></span>. </p></div><div><p>In a different time, <em>Spaceman</em> would be a different movie. If it were twenty years ago, Adam Sandler floating around in a spacesuit and befriending a talking spider who gives him advice about his marriage would be a recipe for something nonsensical. (As if it isn’t already.) But in the streaming era, <em>Spaceman</em> is played straight, maintaining its dignity as an existential sci-fi drama that interrogates the pangs of loneliness. Not all of <em>Spaceman</em> feels like it has footing on solid ground, but its somber tone compliments a committed Sandler who appears in uncharacteristically tortured hues. </p></div><div><p>Vomiting walruses and ethically troubling behavior by everyone are not enough to sink the buoyant <em>50 First Dates</em>. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore reunite from <em>The Wedding Singer</em> to play a romantic match made in Hawaiian paradise whose only problem is Barrymore’s condition of short-term memory loss. Though Sandler relishes in the comfort of his usually bawdy humor, <em>50 First Dates</em> has a heart of gold that is easy to fall for. If you’re the sentimental type, the ending will sweep you off your feet. </p></div><div><p>Not long after <em>Happy Gilmore</em> made him a household name, Adam Sandler offered a glimpse at his coming maturity with a movie explicitly about his unwillingness to grow up and take responsibility. In <em>Big Daddy</em>, Sandler’s leading loaf Sonny illegally adopts his roommate’s kid (Cole and Dylan Sprouse in their first major role) in a desperate play to win back his ex-girlfriend. But raising a child is both rewarding and far more than Sonny bargained for, his fight to maintain custody culminating in a disarmingly sweet climax at a courthouse. Poke holes at the plot all you want – it can’t stop <em>Big Daddy</em> from being one of Sandler’s better movies, equally crass and charming in all the best ways.</p></div><div><p>Audiences went into <em>Funny People</em> expecting one thing, only to come out the other end with something totally different. Helmed by Judd Apatow during his hot streak, Adam Sandler plays a terminally ill comedian and movie star who befriends an up-and-comer (Rogen) and hires him as an assistant. Despite its title and marquee stars, <em>Funny People</em> isn’t a laugh-a-minute riot (which certainly many thought it would be). Instead, it’s an anxious dramedy about mortality and artistic expression. Sandler is a particular standout, practically playing himself but in a way that opens him like a bleeding wound.</p></div><div><p>When <em>Billy Madison</em> hit theaters, critics dismissed it as low-rent comedy for the MTV-pilled. But audiences rallied around it, cementing it as a classic that created a star out of Adam Sandler, who plays the dimwitted, spoiled son of a CEO who must repeat his entire schooling to win control of his father’s company. This has effectively been the story of Sandler’s whole career: His is the face of critically unpopular comedies that earn repeat viewings and loyalty from “normal” people. Whether or not <em>Billy Madison</em> is actually good – it’s pretty good, really!– its true importance lies in setting up Sandler’s ball before he spiked it one year later. </p></div><div><p>Only The Sandman in a Bruins jersey could turn the ninth hole into a house party. Adam Sandler’s star-making <em>Happy Gilmore</em> sees the actor as a would-be hockey phenom whose vicious slap shot makes him a natural for golf, but his presence in the sport draws the ire of buttoned-up pros. <em>Happy Gilmore</em> is an instance of material and talent synthesising in a way that feels like fate as Sandler’s abrasive dude persona make him the perfect underdog antihero over manicured turf. Between Carl Weathers as his mentor and Bob Barker as his sworn enemy, Sandler’s undisputed classic brought new meaning to fore-play. </p></div><div><p>If Adam Sandler has one perfect romantic comedy, it’s easily <em>The Wedding Singer</em>. With microphone gripped in his fist, Sandler flip-flops between charismatic cat and pathetic crooner in this delightful ‘80s nostalgia period piece, in which Sandler’s mulleted romantic lead is a heartbroken wedding (and later, bar mitzvah) singer who is left at the altar. That’s when Drew Barrymore shows up as a client, inspiring Sandler to steal her away from her unfaithful fiance before her big day. A Mousse’d up Sandler is a pure charmer, even when he’s ruining some other poor bride’s festivities with his depressing soliloquies. </p></div><div><p>It’s a family affair for the Sandlers in <em>You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah</em>, a late-stage Sandler joint that is implausibly one of his best-ever In this electric coming-of-age comedy for Netflix, Adam Sandler plays a supporting role as Danny Friedman, patriarch of the Friedmans whose youngest daughter Stacy (Sunny Sandler) is gearing up for her monumental day. Naturally, the movie’s main focus is on the comically petty drama between its youthful characters. But Papa Sandler is just being a good dad in letting his kids relish the spotlight.</p></div><div><p>Though he plays a fast food-gorging NBA scout, Adam Sandler is locked in as Stanley Sugerman, whose future in professional basketball rests on an unproven dark horse from the streets of Spain, Bo Cruz (Juancho Hernangómez, who in real life played for teams like the Denver Nuggets, Boston Celtics, and Toronto Raptors). Tapping into the same well of risk-it-all agents of chaos that made his role in <em>Uncut Gems</em> acclaimed, Sandler puts on a measured performance that reveals how much you can still win even from the bench.</p></div><div><p>Noah Baumbach’s smart, punchy family drama <em>The Meyerowitz Stories </em>chronicles the lives of adult siblings who suffer under the shadow of their moderately successful artist father (Dustin Hoffman). Adam Sandler is the eldest and the resident loose cannon, Danny Meyerowitz, whose labored gait and nervous energy puts him in contrast with his waifish hippie sister (Emma Thompson) and self-made financier Matthew (Ben Stiller). Sandler is in fine shape in Baumbach’s picture, his workwear wardrobe emphasizing his rough edges. </p></div><div><p>When it seemed like Adam Sandler was a one-note performer, director Paul Thomas Anderson proved otherwise with his acclaimed surrealist picture <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>. Sandler takes charge as socially inept, often shy business owner Barry Egan, who is eternally drowned out by the overbearing presence of his many sisters. Barry’s life changes when he falls for one of his sister’s coworkers (Emily Watson) and becomes the victim to an extorting phone sex operator. For the first time in his career, Sandler drops the loud voices and manbaby screaming and reveals an infinitely more thoughtful and careful side to his artistry, anchoring a film that revels in the expanse of one’s loneliness.</p></div><div><p>The term “white-knuckle thriller” was made for movies like <em>Uncut Gems</em>. After years of flailing around in mediocre studio comedies, Adam Sandler went to the dark side in his role as Howard Ratner, a Diamond District player whose toxic gambling addiction escalates into violence. The Safdie Brothers give Sandler carte blanche to run wild as a bespectacled agent of chaos, whose ring-studded fingers and obnoxious gold Rolexes can’t shield him from others’ aggressions. Whether or not <em>Uncut Gems</em> is actually Adam Sandler’s best movie, it’s without question one of his best performances, forcing us to acknowledge that Hollywood’s biggest clown is in his own ways a king.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Actor Jack Black believes his latest film, A Minecraft Move, is just the tonic the world is in need of right now.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jason-momoa-jack-black-minecraft-movie-jennifer-coolidge-1236175713/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> during the film's premiere, Black channelled his inner Burt Bacharach stating: "What the world needs now is love, sweet love."</p>

<p>"We've got to work together, my God," Black - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movies-second-trailer-brings-deep-steve-lore-tree-punching-square-bee">who plays Steve in the Minecraft adaptation</a> - continued.</p>
<p>The actor said there is quite simply "so much violence and war and hatred" right now, so what he loves about A Minecraft Movie is that there is "a lot of love in it and there's a lot of creativity". He added there is "some anger and violence" peppered throughout the film as well, but "in the end it's about friendship and working together to make [the world] a better place".</p>
<p>Black's sentiment was echoed by Game of Thrones and Aquaman actor Jason Momoa, who stars as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison in A Minecraft Movie.</p>
<p>"I think everyone needs to escape a little bit right now," Momoa said. "It's nice to sit back and have a really fun adventure and giggle and laugh."</p>
<p>As for the rest of the cast, Black was full of praise for his co-stars, calling Momoa "worth the price of admission" alone. Then there's "Danielle Brooks, who is fantastic; Emma Myers, she's fantastic. You've got this new kid [Hansen], who is a genius. But then wild card! You didn't know you're gonna get Jennifer Coolidge?" Black enthused.</p>
<p>Oh, and in case you were already wondering, Momoa is up for making another Minecraft film down the line. "We won't let you down. We worked our ass off for you, and I think we brought the world to life. I think everybody's gonna love it," the actor said. "There's so much more to tell; I just hope the fans will be delighted and let us make more."</p>

<p>A Minecraft Movie is set to release on 4th April, and while Black plays Steve in the film this wasn't always going to be the case. Believe it or not, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-jack-black-was-initially-going-to-play-a-talking-pig">originally going to portray a talking pig</a> in the upcoming film.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you fancy some themed-food ahead of any trips to the cinema, McDonald's is offering its customers the chance to purchase a £8.19 Minecraft Movie Meal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mcdonalds-limited-edition-8-minecraft-movie-menu-includes-amazing-collectibles-for-adults">complete with "amazing collectibles" crafted for adults</a>.</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-pc-improvements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-adds-new-challenges-and-more-on-april-4/">Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1</a> will introduce some PC-specific improvements, including a reduction of VRAM usage that should lead to better stability.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Director Yuya Tokuda shared a new message on the game's <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> providing additional information on Title Update 1 launching later this week, as well as on future additions, which include the introduction in late May of Tempered Monsters (★8) Gore Magala and the apex predators Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad as well as some balance tweaks that will make them more resilient, like increased health and resistance to wounding, balance adjustments to weapons and mantles, more quality of life improvements and more.</p>
<p>The biggest news for PC players, however, is the confirmation that this week's update will introduce improvements such as a reduction in VRAM usage and an upgrade to DirectStorage's latest version, which should result in an overall improvement in stability. In addition, the team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements where possible, so the PC version should see more improvements in the future.</p>
<p>At the end of today's message, the Monster Hunter Wilds director also teased some more changes coming in the future, such as changes to the gameplay flow and the introduction of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-highly-requested-feature/">Layered Weapons</a>. This will be quite welcome, as the powerful Artian weapons don't look all that good&nbsp;compared to the vast majority of other regular weapons.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game and why it has sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/">10 million copies</a> already by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-reach-10-million-breaking-another-record.1149633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales have hit yet another milestone, cementing the game's legacy as the studio's fastest-selling game and breaking another company record in the process.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250331.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> issued earlier today,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has passed 10 million sales, a milestone that also sets a first-month sales record for Capcom. The game already broke franchise and company records earlier this month, hitting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">eight million sales in just three days</a>.</p>

<p>As for how&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>achieved this goal, Capcom puts its performance down to the introduction of crossplay for the first time in series history, as well as "the fusion of numerous new elements with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>'s appeal" creating "significant excitement".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m-charge.jpg?itok=1XN3KhWT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m-charge.jpg?itok=cwpzN1Cp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>continues to sell very, very well indeed for Capcom.</figcaption></figure><p>By way of comparison, it took previous mainline entry&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sales-hit-8-million-units-worldwide" rel="nofollow">around ten months</a> to achieve the same sales figure, although that might be a slightly unfair comparison since&nbsp;<em>Rise&nbsp;</em>was a Switch exclusive until January 2022.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter World</em>, meanwhile, took over two months to achieve eight million sales, although again, the game was initially only released for PS4 and Xbox One, with a PC version subsequently launching in August 2018.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>still clearly stands as the series' most successful entry to date, although it's still currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a Mixed rating</a> on Steam, thanks in large part to what appear to be ongoing performance issues for many players' PCs.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Capcom will address those performance issues in future updates.&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date" rel="nofollow">first Title Update</a> is due to land later this week, and it's bringing a big new monster to fight, plus lots of other goodies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/638542/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-relevance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">official unveiling of the Switch 2</a> was an incredibly confident moment for Nintendo. It was brief and lacking almost entirely in details. There was no price, no release date, and no confirmed games outside of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">a <em>Mario Kart</em> tease</a>. The 2 in the name implied a bigger and better Switch, but when it came to the how — the chips that will power the device, the screen that will make Zelda and Mario look great — Nintendo deemed it wasn’t important enough to share right away.</p><p>And it’s right: unlike the rest of the industry, Nintendo has carved out a path where specs no longer matter.</p><p>It wasn’t always this way. Previous Nintendo consoles were sold, as their contemporaries were, on horsepower. The Super Nintendo was a more-powerful NES, while the N64’s processor was deemed so important that the system was named after it. But things started to change around the time of the GameCube. Nintendo had experienced a steady decline in console sales over subsequent generations; while the NES and Famicom sold more than 60 million units, that was down to just over 20 million for the GameCube. At the same time, Nintendo’s direct competition had changed significantly. After getting a taste of going up against Sony during the N64 era, Nintendo was now up against a second tech behemoth in Microsoft. Competing on technological prowess no longer made much sense.</p><p>Something had to change — and that change came in the form of the Wii.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Britta Pedersen / picture alliance via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>Once infamously described as “<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gdc-the-wii-is-a-piece-of-sht-says-hecker">two GameCubes and some duct tape</a>,” the Wii wasn’t a major advancement over its predecessor in terms of how games looked or ran. While the Xbox 360 touted blockbusters like <em>Halo 3</em>, and the PS3 was showing off next-gen visuals through <em>Resistance</em> and <em>MotorStorm</em>, the Wii was defined by <em>Wii Sports</em>, in which characters looked like eggs and didn’t even have arms. And yet, the game, which was bundled with the console everywhere but Japan, went on to become one of the best-selling games of all time because of how it played, rather than how it looked.</p><p>This shift came because of what Nintendo called its “blue ocean” strategy. The idea was that the increasing technological complexity of games was actually making them <em>less</em> appealing to many consumers. We’d come a long way from the simplicity of making Mario run and jump in the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. Just looking at a GameCube controller could be overwhelming for many. As former Nintendo of America president Reggile Fils-Aime <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090806203242/http://news.cnet.com/Nintendo-on-the-latest-technical-divide/2010-1041_3-6180215.html">wrote in 2007</a>, “While ardent players reliably responded to ever-advancing technology and complexity, those same attributes consistently chipped off potential new players from the total market, narrowing the consumers into a smaller niche.”</p><p>This meant the best path forward for Nintendo was to get out of the technological arms race and find a way to broaden the market. For the Wii, that was a console with specs that were mostly good enough to run modern 3D games, but where the focus was on its motion-sensitive controller that made games more intuitive to play, like with <em>Wii Sports</em>. This was followed by the Nintendo DS, a handheld that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">introduced touchscreen controls before smartphones were ubiquitous</a>. Both were massive hits: the Wii sold more than 100 million units, while the DS topped 150 million. And both proved that specs are a minor concern — if they’re a concern at all — to most consumers, as they surpassed more powerful competitors in terms of sales. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24121232/sony-playstation-vita-steam-deck-switch">Sorry, Vita</a>.)</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Kiyoshi Ota / Bloomberg via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>Finding the right direction for a console isn’t always easy, as evidenced by the Wii U, which was a failed early attempt to merge the worlds of home consoles and portable gaming. But by shifting away from specs and graphics to focus on player experience, Nintendo has not only carved out a space for itself, but it is arguably as successful as it has ever been at a time when the video game industry is struggling on many fronts.</p><p>The Switch is a pure expression of this philosophy. It’s an underpowered tablet that doubles as a home console, and despite going up against beefy PlayStations, Xboxes, and a burgeoning field of portable PCs, it’s on track to become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">Nintendo’s best-selling piece of hardware ever</a> (and it might even surpass the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307463/a-big-milestone">record set by the PS2</a>). Its modest technical chops are overshadowed by a straightforward premise — you can take games with you anywhere — while also allowing Nintendo to develop lots of games in a more sustainable way than its competitors, who are struggling with the massive increasing costs of live service and blockbuster games.</p><p>That’s why Nintendo didn’t utter a single spec when revealing the Switch 2 — because they’re not the point. Whatever powers the company’s next device has will be mostly good enough <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">for the next open-world <em>Zelda</em></a>, but the specs don’t need to be detailed in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">lengthy video that uses words like upscaling and teraflops</a>. Those details are coming, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">of course</a>, but they’re secondary to the core idea: this will be just like your old Switch, only better. You don’t need specs to get that across.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>'s dev team are "actively looking at" adding options for a more challenging jaunt through the throaty-poke 'em up's incarnation of feudal Japan. "We're looking at these things and monitoring what people say about the game," creative director Jonathon Dumont told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-devs-actively-looking-at-an-even-harder-difficulty-mode-for-the-rpg-how-challenging-do-you-want-it/">GamesRadar+</a> at this year's GDC.</p>
<p>Shadows currently features four difficulty options for both stealth and combat, ranging from 'story' to 'expert', as well as the 'guaranteed assassination' toggle from recent previous entries, which ensures that when you stab a man in the neck with a large sharp piece of metal, he does not react with a blasé "ow! Nevertheless…".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Being a modern Assassin's Creed game, however, the difficulty can vary wildly depending on whether you like mopping up optional content for shiny trousers, or just want to play the story or explore the world in peace, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review">like our Brendy</a>. I finished the game last week, and ended up whacking the difficulty down about half way though. Not because I wasn't enjoying combat - but because there was too much of it, and it was getting in the way of me riding around on horseback enjoying some of the best bad weather in gaming.</p>
<p>If you're someone who craves even more gruelling tests of swordsmanship, however, it sounds like the team are listening. "Obviously, we can't do everything, but there are things that we're going to be actioning on, and just for the next updates, there are quite a bit of bug fixes and little feature enhancement stuff that is coming in," Dumont said.

<p>PlayStation recently revealed that it provided extensive support during development to Game Science, a developer of Black Myth Wukong, among others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/black-myth-wukong-received-tons-of-support-from-sonys-content-ventures-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingBolt</a>, a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/leadership-spotlight-a-conversation-with-phil-rosenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new interview</a> with Phil Rosenberg, SVP of Global Partner Development and Relations at Sony Interactive Entertainment, revealed details about third-party games receiving support from PlayStation. Rosenberg first stated that the Content Ventures team at Sony is excellent at identifying new franchises and bringing them on. They have discovered games like Stray, Genshin Impact, Black Myth Wukong, Stellar Blade, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rosenberg added that there’s “nobody better in the world” than Christian Svensson and Shawne Benson at finding these hidden gems and “nurturing up-and-coming companies” that are usually very difficult to find. Moreover, the third-party account management team and the partner development team at Sony provide “tons of support” to games like Black Myth Wukong, Stray, and more, as they are often the first points of contact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were rumours earlier last year that Black Myth Wukong had not been released on Xbox due to an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-has-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusivity deal</a> with Sony. Also, a Microsoft representative later added that the delay was not due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-isnt-delayed-due-to-xbox-platform-limitations-microsoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platform limitations</a>. However, early this year, the CEO and founder of Game Science confirmed that the Xbox port for Black Myth Wukong didn’t arrive due to<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-xbox-delay-caused-by-series-s-issues-ceo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> optimisation issues on the Series S</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Black Myth Wukong knockoff has appeared on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-knock-off-appears-on-nintendo-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s Store</a>. Also, check out the CEO’s views on Wukong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-science-ceo-reveals-his-views-on-black-myth-wukong-not-winning-goty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not winning GOTY</a>.

            <p>The Last of Us has an ending that leaves many questions regarding Joel's actions. Was he right to do what he did? Well, The Last of Us' creator Neil Druckmann believes he was.</p>

<p>At the end of The Last of Us, Joel executes multiple members of the Fireflies when he discovers that for them to work on a cure for the cordyceps virus, Ellie would need to have an operation that would kill her.</p>
<p>By this point in The Last of Us' narrative, Joel has come to consider Ellie to be like his own child, and having already lost one daughter, he can not bring himself to lose another one. But, whether or not Joel was right to do this has been an ongoing debate since the first game released back in 2013.</p>
<p>Now, ahead of The Last of Us season two, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-hbo-creators-answer-whether-or-not-joel-was-right-to-save-ellie">IGN</a> asked the show's cast and creators the same question, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s own Neil Druckmann is firmly on the side of Joel simply doing what he had to do.</p>
<p>"I believe Joel was right," Druckmann said. "If I were in Joel's position, I hope I would be able to do what he did to save my daughter."</p>
<p>Fellow showrunner Craig Mazin added he would probably do the same thing if he was put into Joel's position. "But I'd like to think that I wouldn't," Mazin said, adding: "That's the interesting push and pull of the morality of it. And that's why the ending of the first game is so provocative and so wonderful. It just doesn't let you off the hook as a player.”</p>
<p>Mazin continued: "People get to the end of The Last of Us [the game] and there is that question, what would you do? What should you do if faced with the opportunity to save the world, if you sacrifice your child. That goes back to Abraham and Isaac. It's so profound. The notion of sacrifice to save the world."</p>
<p>"It's a difference between, OK, if I had to kill a random person to save who knows how many lives, in the abstract, you would say, well, yeah, that makes sense, of course,” Druckmann furthered. "But now, remove it from being a random person and it's your kid. Now the answer is very different."</p>
<p>Other cast members such as Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie in the show, said that Joel did save the world, it is just that the world he saved was his own. Jesse actor Young Mazino mused: "It's like death begets death begets death and I think that's just a perfect example. And yeah, it's his world. Who cares about the world if your world isn't there?"</p>
<p>These comments echo what Troy Baker - who plays Joel in the games (and James in the show's first season) has previously stated. Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-the-last-of-us-episode-nine">Baker said he believes Joel's actions at the end of The Last of Us to be "the most selfish act ever"</a>. However, he doesn't feel the ending could have played out any other way, as, in Joel's eyes, Ellie was "his world" and as such saving her was more important than saving humanity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/31/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Before nerd culture went mainstream, and everyone was into or aware of anime in all its forms, there was what anime die-hards called The Big Three. It was the three iconic and long-running shonen action manga &amp; anime series that were mainstream titans compared to any other series – Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach. The first two have had a healthy variety of video game adaptations over the years, but Bleach&nbsp;has never truly had its moment in the sun. A number of middling arena fighters have come and gone for the stylish and edgy series, but Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;aims to be a breakout hit by combining a reverence for the origins of the series with the sleek underground futurism of it’s recent anime revival seasons, all bundled together in what is easily the most inventive anime arena fighter I’ve played in years.</p>
<p><iframe title="BLEACH Rebirth of Souls – Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hiyFl_UPGpk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bleach&nbsp;has a huge amount of major story arcs, not unlike Naruto&nbsp;or&nbsp;One Piece, and its final story arc from the original manga was only just adapted into anime form with a stylish new set of finale episodes. You might expect a new game to tie in with that arc for the sake of recency and relevance, but Bleach: Rebirth of Souls goes back to the beginning. Literally all the way back to the very first scene of the very first episode. In a world where most video game adaptations of lengthy anime tend to skip over the fluff and dive right into the major moments, the story mode in this game is a refreshingly slow and detailed journey through the finer and often brushed-over moments of the franchise.</p>


<p>Is it so successful that you could play this as a substitute for reading the manga or watching the anime? Maybe not entirely. You do get a great dive into the world of Ichigo Kurosaki, a Japanese teen who encounters a mysterious woman calling herself a Soul Reaper and a giant monster attacking his family, leading him down a long and complicated road of becoming a Soul Reaper himself. While the details are there, and the character models are gorgeously detailed and incredibly accurate to the style of the source material, the animation in these story scenes can be really stiff at times, and some iffy dialogue pacing ruins the flow of otherwise impactful and emotional moments. I think it’s an incredible story mode for a die-hard fan of the series, but a newcomer might be left wondering what all the hype was about.</p>


<p>Thankfully,&nbsp;Bleach: Rebirth of Souls delivers plenty of it’s own hype that more than makes up for some minor story mode issues. The game is packed full of music from the composer of The World Ends With You,&nbsp;and I got goosebumps from almost every needle drop moment in the game. Each character’s theme plays when they awaken in combat and every impactful moment in the story mode is paired with a wild song, each track blending the style and mood of Bleach’s original soundtrack with vocals and in-your-face beats that made me feel like I was right back in front of Shibuya 108 fighting Noise with Neku. On top of that, every menu, transition, and piece of UI in the game is sleek and stylish in the coolest way possible – it’s an element of the presentation from the newest seasons of the anime that I’m really happy they adapted for this game.</p>
<p>Of course, the heart of Bleach: Rebirth of Souls, like any arena fighter, is in the combat, and this is where the game shines brightest. Battles are focused around a dual-health system slightly reminiscent of Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy.&nbsp;You have a minor Reishi health bar that is drained normally when attacks land on you, and if that bar goes into the red, you’re susceptible to suffer a Soul Break when another attack hits you, letting your opponent trigger a special attack that depletes a certain number of lives from your major Konpaku health gauge. Different characters deal a different number of damage in these attacks, but are also balanced in different ways beyond how strong those special attacks are.</p>

<p>I was blown away by how faithfully the game managed to take the silly, ridiculous, and often unfair abilities of its cast and adapt them into actual gameplay mechanics. Iconic villain Aizen can trigger his Kyoka Suigetsu ability in the middle of an opponent’s super attack animation, cancelling it completely and rewinding the clock back to before it ever happened. Shunsui, meanwhile, can trigger a mode that randomly activates one of several mini-games that you’re forced to play at the same time as your battle. It’s often hilarious how some of these characters operate, but what’s consistently impressive is how gorgeous every attack, ability, and Awakening animation is.</p>
<p>Those Awakenings are a core part of combat. Each character, after taking enough damage, has an Awakening they can trigger that will let them transform into whatever their respective power-ups from the original series entail, changing their attacks, abilities, and more. It’s a comeback mechanic built into the flow of battle, but rather than acting as a quick reversal of circumstances like a Tekken 8 Heat move, it instead adds a new layer to combat mid-battle that complicates the situation for both players. It’s a really fun way to emulate the tug-of-war patterns so many battles in the original series fall into, but it does so in a way that’s actually rewarding and exciting.</p>

<p>There’s more style, soul, and spark put into Bleach: Rebirth of Souls than I’ve seen from any other anime spin-off game since some of the earlier <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/10/18/review-naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-2/">Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm</a>&nbsp;releases. This is a game clearly made by fans and for fans where the aura and energy of the original series has been perfectly adapted into a fresh gameplay experience. It’s the game that Bleach fans have deserved for a long, long time.</p>

<p>In a new press release by Capcom, it has been announced that Monster Hunter Wilds has passed 10 million units sold in its first month of release.</p>



<p>The press release also reconfirmed that the first free title update will be released later this week and that the second update for the game will be released in the summer. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds impressive sales numbers puts it on pace to easier match Monster Hunter World, which went on to sell 22 million units since its release.</p>



<p>But it’s success wasn’t without its issues. On release, Monster Hunter Wilds surpassed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.3 million concurrent players</a>, but was criticised for its lack of PC optimisation. </p>



<p>“This game is absolutely amazing – but has the worst optimisation I’ve ever seen,” said one Steam user.</p>



<p>That being said, Monster Hunter Wilds continues to be a success for Capcom and the games multiple updates since release has addressed a lot of issues pertaining to PC optimisation.</p>



<p>As for where the success will end remains to be seen, but Wilds’ next target will likely to be to try and overtake Monster Hunter Wilds place to become the best-selling Monster Hunter game in the series.</p>



<p>Do you think Monster Hunter Wilds has enough lets to hit 22 million units sold? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

However, many times we just have to face the fact that some external initiatives require more effort from us than we currently have to spare. We are a small studio, and currently almost everyone on the team is heads-down working on our upcoming game. This has unfortunately forced us to decline certain opportunities in order not to spread ourselves too thin, even though they've sounded fun and promising.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> YouTuber Jacksepticeye has revealed he spent a year working on a Soma animated show only for it to fall apart, leaving him “quite upset.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://youtu.be/ac2NAW4AHfc?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video</a> titled 'A Bad Month,' Jacksepticeye, real name Seán William McLoughlin, not only revealed the existence of the Soma animated show, but that it had been canceled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soma, a survival horror science fiction video game from Amnesia developer Frictional Games, launched back in 2015 and was met with critical acclaim. Jacksepticeye streamed the game extensively at the time it came out, and often mentions it as one of his favorites.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/31/jack-1743416008894.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jacksepticeye was working on a Soma animated show.

Lamenting his lack of content creation lately, Jacksepticeye then revealed the Soma animated show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had a very large creative project that I was very excited to do, and — I don’t actually know if I’m allowed to say what it is — I’m just going to say what it is, and then if I’m not allowed to say it then this next part won’t be in it,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was planning to do a Soma animated show. Because I love Soma — Soma is top five, top 10 at least video games of all time for me. I absolutely love that game. It has one of the best stories ever in a video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I was so excited to do that. We’ve been talking to the developers for like a year, talking about that, and we were ready to go into full production on that. And I was so excited, and I really wanted to announce that to people, and to talk about it and get really stuck in and share it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because I wanted to play the game all in one video. And I was like, okay, I’ll hold off on that then till we can announce that we’re doing it. So that’s why I haven’t done it yet.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jacksepticeye went on to say the Soma animated show fell apart abruptly after an unnamed party suggested they wanted to do “in a different direction,” but he deliberately left out specifics because he was left so upset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We were making really great progress on that, and then it all just fell apart out of nowhere,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m not going to go into too many of the specifics of what happened, because I’m quite upset about what actually went down. But, it’s more of a, ‘we’re going in a different direction,’ kinda vibe. And that really upset me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jacksepticeye did not name the other parties involved. IGN has asked Frictional for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upset is the cancelation of Jacksepticeye’s Soma animated show “flipped” the YouTuber’s plans for 2025 “upside down.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had planned a lot of my year around it. I was like, you know what? I won’t be able to upload as much because I’ll be focusing everything I have into that. But at least I’ll have a really cool creative thing to show off. And I’ll have something for you and we can talk about it and share it and be part of this thing together and have fun with it. And then it all fell apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So all of my plans for the year are flipped upside down. Now what is the priority? What am I doing? I don’t know. I’ve had so many calls over the last couple of weeks. It’s been a lot. It’s been a tough month. I took time off and did all that and I have nothing at the end of it. It’s so frustrating. I hate that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of Soma, Frictional released two more Amnesia games: 2020’s Amnesia: Rebirth and 2023’s Amnesia: The Bunker. In July 2023, in the wake of the release of Amnesia: The Bunker, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amnesia-developer-frictional-games-cutting-back-on-horror">Frictional creative director Thomas Grip said the company was looking to cut back on horror games</a> "to give greater focus on other emotional qualities.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While all of our games have been horror in some way, what we really try to do is to get a kind of playable immersion," Grip said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want to give the player some sort of immersive fantasy, be that being a [World War 1] soldier trapped in a bunker or a robot stuck at the bottom of the ocean.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Horror games naturally are where emotions are front and centre. Games really excel at this. However, we are also exploring themes outside of making things spooky."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
