            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="a6f9a599310d5"><a title="Mario Tennis Fever" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a6f9a599310d5/mario-tennis-fever.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are rapidly approaching launch day for Nintendo's next first-party release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, and, following a series of hands-on sessions, the final previews are starting to roll in.</p>
<p>While we here at Nintendo Life don't have a full written preview for Mario's latest sporting shenanigans, the wonderful Ollie Reynolds sat down with equally wonderful Alex Olney to talk through his time with the game. "It's more Mario Tennis," Ollie said, "and if you like that sort of thing, you're going to be absolutely thrilled".</p>
<p>While Ollie's time was mainly limited to brief multiplayer matches, he did sing the praises of the new Fever rackets and Wonder Flower-filled challenge courts. You'll find his full conversation with Alex about all things Mario Tennis Fever (and NSO Virtual Boy, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Mario Wonder - Switch 2 Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>) in the video below.</p>

<p>But we're not the only ones who have stepped onto the Fever court today! Several other outlets have also shared their early opinions, and we've rounded up a bunch of them so you can get an idea of what everyone makes of it so far.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/features/mario-tennis-fever-hands-on-preview-534201-20260203">GamingBible</a>'s preview, which seemed very positive about the whole experience, particularly the promise of varied gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the sheer number of Fever Rackets on offer though paired with an impressive teaser of what special matches add into the mix, I’m hopeful that this game has all of the right ingredients to deliver</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2026/02/03/mario-tennis-fever-super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-virtual-boy-previews-26673543/">Metro</a> seemed similarly optimistic, praising the potential for chaos that the new mechanics and gimmicks bring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s frantic, it’s daft, and it’s sure to be a fun family party game, even if it’s not a serious tennis sim</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mario-tennis-fever-preview-switch-2/">Polygon</a> felt that Fever might just be the best Mario sports title in years, and a worthy start to the Switch 2 generation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the full scope of its content suite is still a question mark, long-time developer Camelot is poised to deliver a strong serve for its Switch 2 debut. The fundamental play of a Mario sports game hasn’t felt this good in over a decade</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-leans-way-harder-on-the-mario-than-the-tennis">IGN</a>'s preview sung many of the same praises outlined above, but it also gave a shoutout to the "fantastic" visuals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s nice to see developer Camelot’s Switch 2 debut looking so clean, especially after 2021’s Mario Golf: Super Rush was downright ugly at times</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baby Waluigi's presence made a headline appearance in <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-preview/">The Gamer</a>'s coverage, which appreciated how you can bring the tennis back to basics, if you so choose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, some of these abilities do take the actual skill out of tennis and can boil matches down to simply spamming fever shots and hoping the RNG of tornadoes and splashes will be enough to win the day. Thankfully, there is an option to turn off these gimmicks and play the old-fashioned way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-mario-tennis-fever-sets-itself-apart-from-other-recent-mario-sports-games/1100-6537844/">GameSpot</a> left the preview equally intrigued, hoping that the full game can keep up the variety and depth found in the hands-on section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can't say whether it has course-corrected on the single-player, but the multiplayer is so chockablock with options and game-changing effects that I'm intrigued</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Well, there you have it! It sounds like Mario Tennis Fever is shaping up to be a rather interesting one when it launches on Switch 2 on <strong>12th February</strong>.</p>
<p>If Ollie and Alex's chat that we mentioned back at the start of this post has whetted your appetite for previews of the written variety, then you'll find our hands-on thoughts of Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, Pragmata and the Virtual Boy NSO library below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Xbox</strong> has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/03/xbox-game-pass-february-2026-wave-1/">announced the first batch</a> of <strong>Xbox Game Pass </strong>games joining the service for <strong>February 2026,</strong> headlined by a couple of major past releases and one new day-one launch for the subscription service. <a href="https://wccftech.com/high-on-life-2-release-date-gameplay-gamescom-2025/">That new release is <strong>Squanch Games'</strong> upcoming <strong>High on Life 2</strong></a>, while the other headlining titles include <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></strong>.</p>



<p>This new batch of games also includes a couple of titles already included in the service for players subscribed to the <strong>Game Pass Ultimate </strong>tier that are now available for <strong>Premium</strong> tier members. Once again, unfortunately for <strong>Essential</strong> tier players, there's nothing in this batch of games that increases the library of titles available to players on the bottom-tier subscription.</p>



<p>Outside of High on Life 2, the other two new releases entering the service this month are <strong>Roadside Research</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/anime-inspired-life-sim-starsand-island-debuts-next-week-early-access/">Starsand Island</a></strong>. The former is a gas station management game where you play as aliens gathering information on humans while they fuel up their cars. The latter is a new life/farming sim, and both are arriving in the service as 'Game Preview' titles.</p>



<p>Other notable titles include <strong>Madden NFL 26</strong>, which replaces <strong>Madden NFL 24</strong>, as the 2024 entry is the only game leaving the service in this update, and <strong>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong>. It's also worth noting that, while <strong>Warhorse Studios</strong> has yet to confirm a major current-gen update for Kingdom Come: Deliverance, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ps5-version/">after a <strong>PlayStation Store</strong> listing let the cat out of the bag</a>, it seems like its arrival date in Game Pass, February 13, 2026, will likely be the day the new version is released.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining Game Pass in this initial February 2026 batch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Final Fantasy II - February 3 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - February 3 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Madden NFL 26 - February 5 - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Paw Patrol Rescue Wheels: Championship - February 5 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Relooted - February 10 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X - February 12 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Roadside Research - February 12 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Starsand Island - February 12 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>High on Life 2 - February 13 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance - February 13 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - February 17 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Avowed - February 17 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Now available for Game Pass Premium subscribers</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>and <em>Avowed </em>underperformed for developer Obsidian, but the studio isn't letting that discourage it from making more games in the <em>Avowed </em>universe, according to a new report.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, Obsidian head Feargus Urquhart says that both action RPGs didn't sell as well as the studio's owner Microsoft hoped, although he says neither game was a "disaster" for Obsidian.</p><p>Instead, Urquhart says the feeling within Obsidian was more geared towards what lessons the studio could take from the two games' relative failure in sales terms. According to Urquhart, <em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>and <em>Avowed</em>'s bad performance led his studio to "think a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them, how long they take".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Avowed </em>and <em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>didn't do too well for Obsidian, apparently.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Part of that goal is to cut down Obsidian's production pipeline to just three or four years per game; according to Schreier's report, both <em>Avowed </em>and <em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>took around six years to make, and that's partly why Microsoft had such high expectations for them.</p><p><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>'s disappointing sales status doesn't seem to have been impacted by the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4d0309c7-1558-4342-aada-7ec9f96f2b0d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">being sold for $70 rather than $80</a>, although sales could well have been negatively affected by the fact the game was released on Game Pass on day one, like all new Xbox Studios releases are.</p><p>Despite these two games' relative failure, Obsidian's cloud did have a silver lining in 2025 in the form of <em>Grounded 2</em>, which proved a hit. Perhaps relatedly, the game also took a lot less time to make, according to Obsidian and Schreier.</p>
<p>Obsidian says it's not planning to make any more <em>Outer Worlds </em>games in future, but that more games in the <em>Avowed </em>universe are coming (which also means more games in the <em>Pillars of Eternity </em>universe, technically).</p><p>If you'd like to remind yourself of what we thought of <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d44108b-4675-49c2-9b33-fb5caaa62a59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">check out our review here</a>, and our review of <em>Avowed </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/avowed-review-pillars-of-excellence" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d0b012fd-ac8c-4c48-838f-7a7425b16777" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">can be found right here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>
Other opinions about the storefront aside, the Epic Games Store launcher, on an experiential level, sucks. I'm not just being needlessly mean here, because this is the exact word Epic Games Store vice president and general manager Steven Allison used in a recent interview about the launcher, where he also detailed what you can expect from it over the course of the rest of the year.
</p>
<p>
"We have a lot of things we need to fix," Allison told sibling site <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-launcher-sucks-lets-call-it-what-it-is-epic-game-store-boss-says-promising-a-year-of-big-improvements-to-speed-new-forum-type-social-features-more">Eurogamer</a>, going on to say that the company has "needed to fix them for years. We've been really focused on developer tooling and all the things we do there. But last year, we finally started to point more of our resources towards player experience stuff, all the things that our players have needed, wanted, and all critics rightfully take us to task on. We got a lot of stuff out the door last year, and this year is going to be probably the best year for that stuff on the 'big rocks'. And the big rocks are: the launcher sucks. Let's call it what it is. It's really slow."
</p>
<p>
Apparently work on the architecture of the launcher started in November 2025, with speed improvements set to arrive for users around May or June this year. "It should start to feel good, be faster and people be like, 'Holy shit. It doesn't suck so much.' And that will be a win for us," Allison said.
</p>
<p>
It's not just a speedy store that Epic are working on. Right now, it has zero real social features, a stark contrast to Steam's framework where each game comes with its own community hub and discussion pages. According to Allison, Epic are planning to add what they call "community spaces" to the store with things like avatars, player profiles, private messaging to cross-platform text chat, and voice chat, all of which should also be coming around May.
</p><p>
At some point in 2026, Epic will also be testing "a kind of forum-type experience," though details beyond that are scant. Probably a safe bet to say it'll just be a version of Steam's discussion pages, but I suppose we'll find out later this year!

            <p>Despite any PR babble you might have heard about 2025 being the "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/its-the-year-of-obsidian-the-outer-wilds-2-game-director-says-the-studio-isnt-worried-about-releasing-another-rpg-in-the-same-year-as-avowed/">Year of Obsidian</a>", the studio have admitted that putting out three games in the course of 12 months isn't something they're keen to do again. Sadly, two of those games - mushroom-encusted RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> and space capitalism-encusted RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> - haven't managed to hit the sales targets corporate overlords Microsoft assigned them. As it stands, Obsidian say they're keen to do more in the fantasy world of Eora, but aren't working on an Outer Worlds 3.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path">Bloomberg</a> blogger Jason Schreier, Obsidian boss Feargus Urquhart said the two RPGs landing below those marks have left the studio to "think a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them, how long they take". The latter already looks to have been decided, with Obsidian hoping development timescales can be sliced down from the six years both Avowed and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> took to a leaner three or four.</p>
<p>Not having them all of the games come out in close proximity's also a goal. "Spacing those releases helps the company manage its resources and not burn everybody out,” studio design director Josh Sawyer admitted. "It’s not good to release three games in the same year. It’s the result of things going wrong."</p>
<p>As for where Obsidian have landed following a year of putting out big RPGs with Grounded 2 sandwiched between them, the answer is a next few years in which they plan to focus on unspecified new games, plus additions for both The Outer Worlds 2 and Grounded 2.</p><p>As of writing, Bloomberg report that the studio explicitly plan to keep making games in the Awowed/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe of Eora going forwards. Things seem more murky when it comes to the future of The Outer Worlds series, with the report simply saying Obsidian aren't working on a third Outer Worlds. I've reached out to Obsidian to double check whether that's confirmation the studio aren't planning on ever making a third Outer Worlds, or just that they aren't in the process of doing so right this second.</p>
<p>Personally, I'll be a tad disappointed if this does turn out to be the end of the road for The Outer Worlds series, at least for now. As much as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-facial-mushrooms-hide-a-fantasy-romp-thats-well-worth-your-time-disagree-and-my-arquebus-awaits">I liked</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">Avowed</a> more than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, I do still think there's potential for Obsidian's advertising jingle-filled interpretation of the cosmos to deliver something special if it were to get another entry, regardless of whether that something ends up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2s-faction-writing-falls-short-of-fallout-new-vegas-and-how-it-handles-the-powerful-is-key">being New Vegasy</a> or excellent in its own way.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-earnings-switch-2-sales-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-2000665326</link>
            <guid>1424203</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The first half of the Switch 2’s first year is in the books. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-review-metroid-prime-4-pokemon-2000656188">Here’s how we graded it back in December</a>. But now Nintendo’s latest earnings report is here to offer some hard numbers on how the Mario maker’s current next-gen platform shift is going. TL;DR: Incredibly strongly, though it’s still searching for that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352">runaway hit no one can shut up about</a>.</p> <p>This week <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_3e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sk="tooltip_parent">the company announced</a> it had sold 7 million Switch 2 consoles during the 2025 holiday period, bringing the lifetime sales up to 17 million for the first six months. Meanwhile the original Switch sold an additional 1.36 million units, with another 750,000 expected to sell through the end of the current fiscal year on March 31, 2026.</p>

 <p>The original Switch has now cleared the lifetime total of 154 million set by the DS, officially making it the company’s most popular console ever. At the same time, it now seems unlikely to actually eclipse the PlayStation 2 as the most popular console ever. At 155 current lifetime sales, the OG Switch would need to find another 5 million sales in the couch cushions somewhere <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733">to beat the PS2’s 160 million</a>.&nbsp;Here are the other interesting takeaways from Nintendo’s latest earnings:</p> <h2>&nbsp;Digital is king on Switch 2</h2> <p>While digital sales remain increasingly dominant, physical game sales usually tick up during the holiday as people gift each other games. Well, for the Switch 2’s first holiday, digital sales did way better than expected. Nintendo reported a 14.7 percent increase year-over-year. It attributed that “mainly due to an increase in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software and add-on content.” And this excludes people buying the digital version of <em>Mario Kart World</em> via the Switch 2 bundle. The proportion of packaged software that was sold in downloadable versions in holiday 2024 was 56 percent. In 2025 it was 58.7 percent.</p>

 <h2>Switch 2 is still wildly outperforming the Switch</h2> <p>While Nintendo reports a slower holiday than expected for the console in the U.S., demand in Japan has been exceeding Nintendo’s expectations and the Switch 2 continues to outpace its predecessor by a healthy margin. It’s outsold the original Switch during the six-month launch window by nearly two to one. Of course, the Switch 2 has the benefit of the holiday season being in that launch period, while the original Switch launched in the spring as opposed to the summer. Still, it shows people are hungry for the upgrade.</p>

 <h2>Annual playing users are actually down though</h2> <p>Weirdly, despite launching a long-awaited, highly anticipated new console in 2025, Nintendo actually ended the year with fewer annual players than it had in 2024. That number, which includes anyone with an account who played a game at some point in the past 12 months, peaked at 130 million in 2024 and ticked back down to 129 million in December. That suggests that while Switch 2 is converting existing players to the new hardware, the push hasn’t necessarily helped expand the platform’s overall footprint.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000665377" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665377"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665377">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> didn’t chart</h2> <p>Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400"><em>Metroid Prime 4 </em></a>launching in December, Nintendo didn’t release any sales data for the game, a very bad sign. That suggests the game hasn’t yet cracked 1 million sales on either Switch 1 or Switch 2, even if it may have cumulative sales across both platforms may have passed that benchmark. On the one hand, that’s not shocking. <em>Metroid</em> has never been a big seller for Nintendo. On the other hand, it suggests that we might not get a new <em>Metroid Prime</em> anytime soon, and that players weren’t rushing to make it their big Switch 2 blockbuster for the holiday. Total software sold is up compared to the Switch 1, but the overall attach rate is lower, likely because Switch 2 owners already have a huge backwards-compatible Switch 1 library to pull from.</p>

 <h2>The Switch 2 is missing a big new hit</h2> <p>Nintendo has sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html">14 million copies</a> of <em>Mario Kart World</em> but that includes the Switch 2 console bundles. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is doing great for a Switch 2 exclusive at 4.25 million sales but hasn’t yet proven if it can do<em> Super Mario Odyssey</em> numbers.<em> Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> has sold over 11 million copies, including nearly 4 million on Switch 2. And even <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> broke 1 million sales. That’s about where the Switch 1’s launch lineup was at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmiiboCanada/comments/79o6oa/summary_of_switch_sales_from_nintendo_q22017/">after its first six months</a>, but that didn’t include Christmas or <em>Mario Odyssey</em>. The Switch 1 finished its first year with multiple first-party games breaking the 5 million sales mark, and so far the Switch 2 doesn’t seem likely to match that without a big surprise announcement or two in the next six months.</p>

<p>Apex Legends is still rolling out new Seasonal content, with Season 28 celebrating the game’s seventh anniversary. It’s launching on February 10, 2026, and it marks a serious shift in the game’s meta.</p>



<p>Major Legend updates, new destructible environments, and huge changes to Ranked are just the tip of the iceberg for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-ending-support-for-nintendo-switch-1-in-august/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-ending-support-for-nintendo-switch-1-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a> Season. It’s building up to be a game-changing update for the battle royale, and the Early Patch Notes have all the details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Take cover! Image by Respawn Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Plenty of changes are coming to Apex Legends in Season 28, but the headlines are bound to follow the new Hardlight Mesh, as well as Fuze’s reworks.</strong></p>



<p>Hardlight Mesh is a new, destructible window that will be present across existing structures. It provides renewed cover, but it can be destroyed, taking increased damage from certain weapon classes and weapon abilities. Controller class Legends can even rebuild them, adding another tactical layer to navigating the shrinking zone.</p>



<p>Fuze is the legend that takes center stage in Breach, as he’s seen a complete rework to his kit. However, Bloodhound and Catalyst have also seen some buffs, with further details coming on February 6. </p>



<p>For Ranked players out there, you’ll be glad to hear that the Dropship is returning. Respawn wanted to bring the mode into closer parity with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/algs-year-6-roadmap-revealed-by-electronic-arts/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/algs-year-6-roadmap-revealed-by-electronic-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ALGS</a>, but after some experimentation in prior Seasons, felt it was best to bring it back. </p>



<p>Additionally, Bot Royale lobbies are being reworked, some new advanced audio options are becoming available, and Apex will celebrate its seven-year anniversary with a free anniversary rewards track. </p>

            <p>When 2025 wrapped up, Obsidian's open-world fantasy RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Avowed</a> had been overlooked on many end-of-year lists. Despite garnering <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/avowed/">favourable reviews</a> overall and delivering a type of Elder Scrolls-inspired experience that stands on its own, it wasn't a massive hit. Later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outer-worlds-2-review">The Outer Worlds 2</a> landed with similar results. Meanwhile, the mostly continuist survival crafting adventure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-wobbles-while-walking-a-line-between-frustration-and-brilliance">Grounded 2</a> was enjoying lots of success.</p>
<p>According to Feargus Urquhart, head of Obsidian Entertainment, a lot can be learned from the studio's busy 2025 and the end results. Jason Schreier's latest for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path">Bloomberg</a> reveals what him and other prominent figures at the company have to say. About last year's RPG behemoths, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, the veteran openly explained: "They're not disasters... I'm not going to say this was a kick in the teeth. It was more like: 'That sucks. What are we learning?'"</p>
<p>Of course, there's an immediate read to be made after two triple-A giants failed to meet their targets and a scrappy, still-in-early-access survival crafting game landed Obsidian a big win. Urquhart says this situation has pushed the studio to "think a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them, how long they take." In the case of Avowed, the game ended up taking "nearly seven years" to put together, with a reboot to pivot away from making a mix of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny">Destiny</a> (multiplayer included) happening two years into the creative process. "I don't think there’s a team on the planet that could execute on this," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> director Josh Sawyer stated.</p>
<p>While the press and gamers alike have been saying for a while the Western games industry should course-correct back into a more sustainable model, that kind of huge change doesn't happen overnight, especially if those at the top want bigger returns. "I don't think anybody really likes five-, six-, seven-year dev cycles," added Brandon Adler, director of The Outer Worlds 2. I'm now thinking about Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> for no reason.</p>

<p>In spite of everything, Obsidian, has managed (so far) to succeed where many have failed under the scrutiny of Microsoft's Xbox division... which is also under pressure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-push-for-high-xbox-profit-margins-behind-job-cuts-publishing-on-playstation-and-cancellation-of-projects-like-perfect-dark-claims-report">as the tech giant demands better profit margins</a>. The trick might be a good cadence of releases since the acquisition happened back in late 2018. With easy wins on a budget like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pentiment-review-a-sixteenth-century-mystery-that-blossoms-with-intrigue-and-human-warmth">Pentiment</a> or the two Grounded games, it's easy to offset the bigger disappointments. "You need to keep having at-bats, because at some point, if you can consistently make good stuff, you'll get those breakout hits," said Marcus Morgan, VP of Operations at Obsidian.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path">full piece</a> is well worth a read and shines some light on Obsidian's past, present, and future. It's hard to predict what might be next for its veteran teams, but personally, I'd say news about a more realistic vision for the RPG maker are encouraging.</p>

            <p>Funcom has released Chapter 3 for Dune Awakening today, bringing with it a host of new experiences and gameplay overhauls for players to enjoy. But can this update, described as the "biggest" the game has ever seen, reignite the excitement seen around it's launch?</p>
<p>Let's dive into what's been added to the game with Chapter 3. There's an increase on faction levels, allowing those who complete missions with their chosen faction to gain additional levels. The Landsraad endgame has been revamped too, allowing players to choose a Great House to complete missions for, which should invigorate the system somewhat.</p>
<p>There's also a specialisation system added to the game. Earning XP progresses you through a chosen specialisation, allowing players to pick a playstyle and dedicate themselves to it. Explorers can choose a path and be rewarded with unlocks that better serve that playstyle, such as traits and technologies.</p>

<p>These technologies include augmentations, which can be added to tier 6 armour to increase their power further. Schematics for these can be found in new Testing Stations added to the game, and augmented gear can be freely traded among players to encourage more interaction between players pursuing different progression paths, though some work on the crafting specialisation is needed to make these.</p><p>There are also new missions to complete, new locations on the Overland map, a removal of water and fuel requirements when traveling across the Overland map, and five new challenge locations for players to test their mettle and progress through Landsraad challenges. There are also five new Testing Stations to explore, and a new major story chapter for narrative-focused players to dive into.</p>
<p>As for combat, two new weapons have been added: the Pyrorocket and dual-wielded knives. The rapier, an original weapon type, has also been totally reworked with new attacks and defensive abilities.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who lapsed from the game and found their base taxed to ruins, these base taxes have been totally removed. Power requirements for bases are still required to maintain your digital home-away-from-home, but the money drain is no longer an issue. A new suite of cosmetics rewards have been added, as well as a returning player package to help people get back into the swing of things.</p>
<p>Finally, the deep desert has been changed once again. The shield wall has been moved further up to make those initial segments safer to explore, and ramps have been added to make ground vehicle travel more tenable.</p>
<p>Is this enough to tempt you back into Dune Awakening? Let us know!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo rounded out 2025 with another barn-storming quarter of sales for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, cementing its status as the fastest-selling new console in history to sweep past 17 million sales by the end of the year. But its predecessor, the original Nintendo Switch, is still hanging on in there and managed to hit another milestone, surpassing the Nintendo DS lifetime sales with over 155 million console sold, and clinching second place in the all-time best selling consoles list behind the PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>Starting with the Switch 2, the final quarter of 2025 was naturally buoyed by the Christmas shopping season, with 7.01 million Switch 2 consoles sold. That brings the lifetime sales to 17.37 million after seven months, which is simply huge. To put that in perspective, it took the PS5, the PS4 and the original Switch roughly one year to reach the same point. Of course, both PlayStations launched in mid-November and the Switch in March, so it’s not a direct comparison in terms of the peaks and troughs of the market, but this shows the power of having an appealing new product and lots and lots of stock.</p>


<p>It’s no surprise that, as a cut-price bundled game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has been the best-selling title for Switch 2 with 14.03 million copies sold, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has also done very well for itself with 4.25 million copies. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> Switch 2 Edition has 3.89 million copies sold, but that’s not including the Switch 1 version and upgrades. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has also been a nice little game with 1.7 million copies sold. Alas, there’s no milestone for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> revealed at this point, but we hope it’s done well.</p>
<p>And so we come to the original Switch, and potentially its last major milestone. With 1.38 million more consoles sold last quarter, it’s clearly playing second fiddle to the Switch 2, but that was enough to bring it 155.37 million and pass the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold. That puts it in second place for the all-time best-selling console list, behind the PlayStation 2 with Sony’s rather nebulous <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/our-company/business-data-sales/">“more than 160 million” sales figure</a>. If the Switch continues to sell around 1 million a quarter through 2026, it could get pretty darned close to the PS2, but I imagine Sony would be tempted to hold a firesale on some museum pieces to juice their own figures once more.</p>

			<p>Since moving on from the Gamebryo engine, which powered <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/"><strong>faithful remake</strong></a> (which <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/around-half-of-oblivion-remastered-players-on-ps5-played-for-less-than-15-hours-nostalgia-is-powerful-but-only-so-much/">proved successful even without having great player retention</a></strong>) and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3</em>, Bethesda used its <strong>Creation Engine</strong> for all its games, including <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skyrim-special-edition-review-when-some-polish-is-not-enough/"><strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong></a></em> and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-4-review-a-welcoming-wasteland/"><strong>Fallout 4</strong></a></em>. </p>



<p>Despite powering what is widely considered <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">one of the best role-playing games of all time</strong>, the engine caught some flak from gamers for how it manages the sprawling worlds of the games it powers, forcing <strong>dated, immersion-breaking loading screens</strong>, as seen in <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"><strong>Starfield</strong></a></em>.</p>



<p>For this reason, many wish Bethesda would <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">leave this engine behind</strong> in favor of a more modern solution for future games like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls 6</strong></a></em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 5</strong></a></em>, but it's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unlikely this will ever happen</strong>, as it would create quite a few <strong>critical issues</strong> for the studio.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Press Box PR</strong></a>, Skyrim's design lead, Bruce Nesmith, discussed the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">biggest misconceptions fans have about the Creation Engine</strong> and its limitations, as well as what an engine change would entail.</p>



<p><em>"What you have to realize is that if you were to switch engines, and I'll say this for any game anywhere, is that it is a massive effort. You are talking about dozens of people spent doing nothing but making an engine work,"</em> the developer said.</p>



<p><em>"You are talking about putting your developers into a situation where they can't play the game. They may not even be able to work on making the game for long stretches because the engine is not there or up to snuff yet," </em>Nesmith added, highlighting how <strong>this was an issue the studio had with </strong><em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wearisome-wasteland-wandering/">Fallout 76</a></strong></em>, where the Creation Engine had to be changed <em>"dramatically"</em> to do multiplayer.</p>



<p>An engine change would also <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">not be beneficial</strong> due to the fact that the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Creation Engine has been worked on for so long</strong> that it has been <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tweaked</strong> to serve Bethesda's purposes. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"At this point, it's probably a wiser bet to keep working with it. The benefits that you get from switching to Unreal Engine are probably not going to materialize until two titles down the road,"</em> the Skyrim design lead said, highlighting how a game like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls 6</em> wouldn't suddenly become <strong>a different game</strong> than its predecessors with a sudden engine switch.</p>



<p>While the Creation Engine has been used since <em>Skyrim</em>, <strong>that doesn't mean it hasn't changed since</strong>. "<em>Every Bethesda game that has ever released has had major improvements made to the creation engine. Significant improvements are always being made to it. There's an entire team that's devoted to nothing but doing that,"</em> Bruce Nesmith said. <em>"But the advantage you have there is that you can still run the game during the whole time because you have an existing engine. You're not having to figure out how to put this new thing in place."</em></p>



<p>Ultimately, for these reasons, the Skyrim design lead <em>"would fall on the side of keeping the Creation Engine."</em> As the engine has been tweaked and iterated upon already, and even significantly, as the studio did for Fallout 76, Nesmith believes that <strong>anything that can be done in Unreal Engine and not in the Creation Engine can be easily put into Bethesda's engine</strong>, delivering new features without causing the additional issues a full engine switch would bring.</p>



<p>Looking at how <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Starfield</em>'s vision clashed with its engine limitations, there's no denying that the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Creation Engine definitely needs to be improved</strong> to handle big open worlds seamlessly. As <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> has been in development for a very long time, it wouldn't be surprising to see the sixth entry in the series be the first game from Bethesda to handle a massive open-world properly without loading screens. Would it be enough to make it win the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-would-be-talked-about-like-the-second-coming-if-a-new-studio-had-put-it-out-how-bethesda-lost-the-game-of-expectations/"><strong><em>"game of expectations"</em> that <em>Starfield</em> lost</strong></a>? By itself, probably not, but it would definitely help the game and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/how-do-you-beat-that-why-the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-no-win-situation/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">its perception</strong></a> a lot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">Avowed</a> </em>and <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> were some of the best games released in 2025. We over here at <em>Kotaku</em> liked<em> Avowed</em> so much that we called it one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161">12 best games released last year</a>. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<em>The</em> <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> was my personal game of the year. A lot of other critics liked both of these Obsidian Entertainment-developed RPGs, too. But according to Obsidian, all that acclaim didn’t translate to big sales.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path">In a new feature from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> about Obsidian’s big year–the studio launched three games in 2025–there’s some bad news about two of those releases. According to Obsidian boss Feargus Urquhart, <em>Avowed</em> and <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> didn’t meet expectations.</p>

 <p>“They’re not disasters,” Urquhart told the outlet. “I’m not going to say this was a kick in the teeth. It was more like: ‘That sucks. What are we learning?’” The disappointing sales for these two semi-open-world RPGs have Urquhart thinking “a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them, how long they take.” Both games took over six years to develop. Moving forward, Urquhart wants to cut down dev time to three to four years.</p> <p>Meanwhile <em>Grounded 2,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/grounded-2-obsidian-eidos-xbox-unreal-engine-halo-2000617443">a game developed primarily by Eidos</a>, took around three years to develop and has ended up being a massive success for Obsidian. Yet another example of how it isn’t necessary to spend most of a decade making a game for it to sell millions of copies.&nbsp; It is also likely that the ongoing, <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175">large-scale BDS-connected No Games For Genocide boycott of Xbox</a> over its connections to Israel and the country’s horrific attacks on Palestinians caused all of Obsidian’s games to sell fewer copies.</p>

 <p>As for the future, Obsidian has no plans to develop <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 3</em> after the sequel failed to sell as well as expected. The RPG studio did confirm with <em>Bloomberg</em> that it is working on new content for <em>The Outer Worlds 2,</em> and future games will be made that take place in the same universe as <em>Avowed </em>(which shares a setting with the <em>Pillars of Eternity </em>games).</p>

 <p>“Our job, all of us here, is to go make games that people want to play and buy,” said Urquhart, “and if we continue to do that, then we have a solid business.”</p>

<ul id="block-d0bea02d-4b9f-4991-b9db-3b35778ff3bf">
<li>Green letters are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li>Yellow letters are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Cyberpunk 2’s creative director has revealed why he feels the first-person perspective works well with 2077’s story, genre, and world. </p>



<p>The sequel to Cyberpunk 2077 is going to take a long time to release, considering the studio’s next mainline title, The Witcher 4, is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not going to release in 2026</a>. What we do know is that the game is in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-has-entered-pre-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">production</a>, but the release is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequels-release-is-at-least-four-to-five-years-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least four to five</a>” years away. As we wait for the next game, check out why the dev didn’t include third-person in the original game.</p>







<h2 id="h-third-person-is-better-for-games-like-god-of-war-the-witcher-and-more-first-person-is-better-suited-to-cyberpunk-2077">Third Person is Better for Games Like God of War, The Witcher, and More; First Person is Better Suited to Cyberpunk 2077</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/cyberpunk/cyberpunk-2-lead-says-first-person-pov-was-better-for-cyberpunk-2077-as-third-person-is-for-more-defined-characters-like-the-witcher-3s-geralt-and-god-of-wars-kratos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, through a recent thread on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mdsstho36c22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, Igor Sarzynski, the creative director of Cyberpunk 2077, explains why the first-person perspective was the right choice for the game. He highlights that the first-person view “works well” for the story, genre, and world from a narrative design standpoint. In this perspective, the player embodies a character who is trapped in a deteriorating body, with the only way to escape being through “technological consciousness processing.”</p>



<p>On top of that, the player has to interact with a digital ghost in their head, which only they can see and exists only in their subjective perception. Sarzynski adds that he feels the third-person perspective is better for games with more defined characters like Geralt, Kratos, Ellie, and more, where players are playing and replaying someone else’s story.  </p>



<p>Sarzynski also confirms that this conversation is not indicative of anything in Cyberpunk 2, and only about the specific narrative setup in 2077. He also poked fun at the community, stating, the Cyberpunk sequel “might be a Play-Doh stop-motion RTS for all we know.”</p>







<p>In other news, the original creator of the Cyberpunk universe has stated that the sequel will feature another city that feels like ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-city-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Gone Wrong</a>’. Additionally, the original game’s writer has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-writer-confirms-long-held-fan-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed a long-held fan theory</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Avowed also missed targets, but its universe will continue.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Veteran role-playing game maker Obsidian Entertainment has no plans to continue The Outer Worlds with a third game, the studio has confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> interview, Obsidian revealed that last year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> had underperformed, and a sequel is not in development. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, the company's other blockbuster RPG released last year, also missed its targets — but Obsidian reportedly still has plans for more from its world of Eora, the same setting as Pillars of Eternity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a more positive note, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a> — yet another 2025 launch — was a hit. But of the three, it had the shortest (and almost certainly the cheapest) development period by far. Grounded 2 took just over two years to meet its early access launch, compared to the more than six years required for both Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2025, Xbox trumpeted the fact that Obsidian was about to launch three games in just eight months, with Avowed hitting in February, Grounded 2 launching in early access in July, and The Outer Worlds 2 arriving in October. But the effort was "the result of things going wrong," studio design director Josh Sawyer has now said — and something that is unlikely to be repeated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Spacing those releases helps the company manage its resources and not burn everybody out," Sawyer told Bloomberg. "It's not good to release three games in the same year. It's the result of things going wrong."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Famously, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-was-originally-going-to-be-a-multiplayer-game">Avowed began life as a multiplayer game with ambitions to be a cross between The Elder Scrolls and Destiny</a>, before its online co-op was stripped out and the project was rebooted. It then took a while to steady the ship, though the arrival of Carrie Patel as its director saw the game on a smoother path — albeit some three years into the project.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best Xbox Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for The Outer Worlds 2's prolonged development, Bloomberg's report simply states that the project was made more difficult by the pandemic and technical challenges. Now, Obsidian's focus is reportedly fixed on ensuring games can be made on shorter development timelines, with releases more spaced out, and with as generous a profit margin from Microsoft as they can get away withmuster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think anybody really likes five-, six-, seven-year dev cycles," noted Brandon Adler, who served as director on The Outer Worlds 2. "We've kind of grown into that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Referencing Microsoft's eye-opening 30% profit-margin target for some Xbox studios, Obsidian boss Feargus Urquhart said he hoped the company still continued to fund riskier projects and accepted that "maybe where we are going to be from a profitability standpoint isn't going to be 30%."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian is yet to announce its next project, following 2025's exhaustive release schedule. Work on Grounded 2 continues, of course, and it sounds like Eora will be returned to. (Avowed will also launch for PlayStation 5 later this month.)

            <p>Amazon really seems to be knocking it out of the park with the casting for its live-action God of War series.</p>
<p>It was recently announced that Alastair Duncan has been cast as the wise Mimir, whose head Kratos often wears around his waist. If you think Duncan's name sounds familiar, that's because he also voiced Mimir in 2018's God of War and its sequel, Ragnarök.</p>

</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As well as Duncan, actors Danny Woodburn and Jeff Gulka have been cast as God of War's talented blacksmith brothers, Brok and Sindri.</p>
<p>Woodburn is a veteran actor with a track record of appearing in numerous fantasy series, such as Conan the Adventurer, The Witcher, Charmed and Willow. If you're a Seinfeld fan, however, you likely know him best as the recurring character Mickey Abbott. Gulka, meanwhile, starred as Gibson Praise on The X-Files and as Charlie in Stargate-SG1, to name just two.</p>
<p>You can read the character descriptions for Mimir, Sindri and Brok (thanks, <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-series-alastair-duncan-mimir-brok-sindri-1236645903/">Variety</a>) below:</p>
<p><strong>Mimir:</strong> Mimir is a cheery fellow from Celtic lands with an expansive intellect, a quick wit and a good head on his shoulders. Never at a loss for words, Mimir is the self-described "Smartest Man in the World". He served as an advisor to Odin the All-Father, who ultimately banished Mimir to confinement in the trunk of a tree, forever cut off from the people he loves and anything that could nourish his mind. In the wake of his banishment, Mimir seeks atonement for the terrible deeds he committed in the All-Father's name.</p><p><strong>Brok:</strong> Brok is a legendary dwarven blacksmith who was alienated from his community when he helped build a super-weapon. He is brash, irreverent, and gruff – the complete opposite of his uptight brother and fellow blacksmith, Sindri, with whom he has a contentious relationship. Gamers will know Brok as the beloved weapons dealer with an unrivaled artistry for creative, foul-mouthed curses.</p>
<p><strong>Sindri:</strong> Sindri is a renowned dwarven blacksmith whose incredible weaponry is sought after across the realms. Neurotic, helpful, and extremely germophobic, Sindri is the complete opposite of his cranky, foul-mouthed brother and business partner, Brok.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>As good as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' first 2026 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shares-early-2026-roadmap-escalation-content-updates">roadmap</a> looks, one of the latest crazes in the online extraction shooter has nothing to do with hunting down other players or banding together against the oppressive robotic threat. People are collecting rubber ducks, <em>lots of them</em>.</p>
<p>Why focus on meaningless rubber loot over everything else? Let me preface this by saying everyone loves to find an excellent gun or blueprint, but upgraded stashes have a fun side effect which is that you can show off your favourite loot <a href="https://deltiasgaming.com/arc-raiders-how-to-customise-your-raider-den/">in the raider's room</a>. Embark Studios has also added <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Duck_Locations:_Bird_City_Guide">collectible rubber ducks that you can find all over</a>, making them the perfect collectibles. It reminds me of the short period when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/xbaqik/people_really_like_the_moai_head_huh/">everyone was putting moais inside their lockers in Splatoon 3</a>. Hilarious stuff.</p>
<p>You know an online game has <em>the juice</em> when players start wholesome trends like these and don't spend all their time optimizing the fun out of it. Embark appears to aware of this saga, so <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2018656701893738739?s=20">Arc Raiders' latest update</a>, pushed on 3rd February, makes the Bird City map condition for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Buried_City">Buried City</a> more common.</p>
<p>What does this mean exactly and how does it connect to the coveted rubber birds? Well, the new map condition dropped after the Cold Snap event which covered Speranza in snow. As part of the return to normalcy, birds are flocking back to the Buried City, and you can often queue into the Bird City version of it, which has more feathered animals and boosted loot rates; look for nests on top of chimneys too.</p><p>Birds (the real ones) aren't your friends though. Like in other open-world games with strong stealth elements, they'll fly away in large groups when approached and in response to loud noises. You can imagine why this is a problem in a game where everyone and everything on the surface can kill you in an instant.</p>
<p>Rubber ducks are part of the boosted loot during this map condition, however, so the new "for funsies" meta is raiding the Buried City over and over again to snatch all the different toys as if they were Arc Raiders' version of limited-edition Funko Pops... or Tubbz.</p>
<p>In any case, it's heartwarming to see players chasing anything other than endgame loot and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-you-a-little-too-good-at-arc-raiders-the-new-solo-vs-squad-mode-might-be-for-you">more high risk, high reward experiences</a> inside a game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">as tense as Arc Raiders</a>. Maybe we can take Scrappy the Rooster topside soon, too. Let's start pitching that.</p>

      <p>I’ve finally gotten some time to sit down with recently-released climbing game <em>Cairn</em>, after really liking the <a href="https://aftermath.site/cairn-demo/"><u>demo</u></a> back in 2024. I’m finding the full game a fair bit more challenging, but one aspect I continue to love is protagonist Aava’s tent and all the things you can do in it.</p><p>In <em>Cairn</em>, climber Aava is attempting to reach the summit of the imposing Mount Kami on her own, with only the help of a robot that can repair and retrieve pitons. It’s tough going: you need to carefully find your route up various walls, choosing the right handholds and thinking about your limb and body placement to prevent Aava from growing exhausted and plummeting to her doom. I’m struggling a little with the way the game automatically selects which limb Aava moves, though you can also control this manually; I feel like she doesn’t always do what I intend, and I sometimes wish the simulated climbing were a little <a href="https://aftermath.site/new-heights-climbing-impressions/"><u>more detailed</u></a> so I could employ certain techniques that, as ever, I recognize are probably way <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-jusant-gets-rock-climbing-right/"><u>too complicated</u></a> to portray in a video game. My Aava will sometimes ragdoll, or bend her limbs differently than a real-life climber, and sometimes this means I feel like I’m making a “good” move, only for the reality to not quite live up to my vision.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zkWA6ASFoj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Cairn - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games"></iframe></figure><p>I’ve found it helpful to turn on the indicator of whether a hold is good or not, even though it feels a little against the spirit of the game, which wants you to figure things out based on Aava’s reactions. But it’s been a compromise I’ve made against the way I’m finding myself playing the game surprisingly impatiently. I’m a climber in real life, though I have been woefully short on time to actually go climbing (also, all the gyms near me changed ownership and now I can’t decide which, if either, to join). When I climbed, I loved the feeling of carefully <a href="https://kotaku.com/mobile-game-crux-lets-you-rock-climb-without-going-to-t-1845024500?ref=aftermath.site"><u>puzzling</u></a> out a route in a sport that’s both physical and mental, but I’m having trouble tapping into that while playing <em>Cairn</em>. I get annoyed when Aava doesn’t move in the way I imagine in my head, when the game’s auto limb system keeps insisting on hands when I want to move feet, when Aava begins to shudder on a hold I swear is fine even though the game is telling me different. I’m trying to brute force things way more than I should, and when that obviously doesn’t work out I default to trying to brute force things <em>more</em>, even though I know the game is much more enjoyable (and full of less deaths) when I take a moment to think through my moves, or zoom out to consider a route instead of just leaping on the wall and thinking I’ll figure it out as I go (one of my biggest flaws in real-life climbing too, for what it’s worth). I’ve been disappointed to see this tendency in myself; it’s not how the game wants to be played, and it’s certainly not how I want to live my life. When I play the game patiently and thoughtfully, it’s wonderfully challenging and peaceful, but I inevitably blow it and struggle to keep my head.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Game Bakers/Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure><p>So my experience of <em>Cairn</em> has been a bit antagonistic and exhausting, largely through my own doing, and I’ve relished the moments of respite between climbs. You can save your game only at certain points, which also give you the option to set up your tent. All of your gear is piled around you inside, and you can repair pitons, cook, recycle trash to turn into climbing chalk, reorganize your gear by shaking your bag (something I loved in the demo, and still love), check the weather, or sleep, read, or do pushups until it’s time to start climbing again.</p><p>I love games that have little survival chores, so I love futzing around inside the tent and getting things organized for the next day. I repair the pitons I destroyed by placing them in a panic; I combine the ingredients I gathered into food that has the added benefit of freeing up space in my bag for more stuff; I retape my fingers and refill my chalk. Recently, low on food, I found a pond full of fish to catch, and after a hard climb to a save point, it was lovely to spend an in-game evening turning all of it into rations for the journey to come. I love the way the game will show me shots of the tent from the outside, a little glowing oasis against the wilderness, and how I can see the light changing as time passes through the open tent flap. It reminds me of all the camping I used to do and how much I miss it, the way settling into my tent for the night could feel like a reward for a hard day’s travel or a chance to reset and make the next day go better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Game Bakers/ Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure><p>With its slow pace and many moving pieces, <em>Cairn</em> really feels like a big journey, and the attention paid to Aava’s tent enhances that feeling. I really feel like I’m on my own out in the wilderness, the way I felt on my <a href="https://aftermath.site/failing-on-a-bike-trip-taught-me-too-much-about-myself/"><u>bike trips</u></a> back in DC, and even though my approach is making me frustrated with the game, there’s something peaceful about the feeling of having everything I need around me. On my own trips, I loved how manageable and self-contained life could feel, the freedom of only being responsible for myself; I see the same tendency in Aava with the way she ignores messages from her friends and family. (On my own trips, I was very careful to check in with people who knew where I was, both for my own safety and not to worry people.) Maybe some of my frustration with the game is that it’s reminding me of a kind of person I used to be that I miss; moments spent in Aava’s tent are moments when I get to sit with that feeling without the pressures of climbing, and preparing for the next day is a way to remind myself that I could be that person tomorrow if I just choose to, instead of being upset with myself for my flailing and short-tempered approaches on the wall.</p><p>So far my experience with <em>Cairn</em> feels way more about <em>me</em> than it does about the game, which I really wasn’t expecting. It’s led me to gaze longingly at my disused climbing shoes and all the bikepacking gear piled up in my closet, trying to imagine a middle ground between “no time to do the hobbies I used to love” and “abandon my whole life and just bike off into the woods.” I’m curious to see if Aava can find a middle ground as the game’s story continues, and we’ll see if I can find one as well. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>If you can believe it, it has been almost a year since the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sid_meiers_civilization_vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a>. To mark the occasion, Firaxis Games Creative Director Ed Beach has shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYry-kvC8u4">special anniversary message</a>, outlining what's next for the game and teeing up today's brand-new update.</p>
<p>The ver. 1.3.2 patch is rolling out today, adding a new peppering of 'nestled tooltips' to help get your head around complex in-game terms on the fly, a lens to make locating high-Happiness tiles a bit easier, and a handful of balancing tweaks for the French Empire and Dai Viet. It also reintroduces fan-favourite ally Gilgamesh back into the leader roster, complete with a free anniversary profile badge, banner, and title.</p>
<p>Beach also shared some details on the upcoming massive 'Test of Time' update, which the team plans to launch this Spring. This update — described as "similar in scope to an expansion in terms of gameplay systems and functionality" — will introduce the option to play as one civ through all ages, reworks how Victories are achieved, and introduces a new 'Triumph' system to replace Legacy Paths. We're sure we'll hear more about this one in the coming months, but you can read a detailed rundown of everything we know so far about the Test of Time update on the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/anniversary/">Civ VII website</a>.</p>
<p>But anyway, back to <em>today's</em> update. The full patch notes were shared in a recent <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">Civ VII blog post</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below. Be warned, it's quite a long one!</p>
<h2>Sid Meier's Civilization VII Ver. 1.3.2 (3rd Feb 2026)</h2>
<h3><strong>Gilgamesh Returns</strong></h3>
<p>Your best friend and King of Uruk, Gilgamesh, makes his comeback to <em>Civilization</em>! This leader is free for all <em>Civ VII</em> players with the 1.3.2 Update as a thank you for all the support we’ve seen from players over the last year, along with a free anniversary profile badge, banner, and title.</p>
<p>Whether he was your favorite ally in <em>Civ VI</em> or if you've never met the legendary demigod of Uruk face-to-face, Gilgamesh is best known for his prowess in battle. In <em>Civ VII</em>, his emphasis on Endeavors helps him maximize their value with Allies. If you're playing as Gilgamesh, make sure you form those alliances quickly, and if you're not, becoming his Ally first may benefit you greatly.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh is most effective when he invests in befriending one primary Ally. Not only does entering a war while having exactly one Ally garner him additional War Support, but his Mementos reward this one-Ally approach as well. Check out his kit below!</p>
<dl><dt>Attributes</dt><dd>Diplomatic, Militaristic</dd><dt>Unique Ability - Once Mortal, Twice Divine</dt><dd>Gain War Support when you have exactly one Ally. When you defeat an enemy Unit, gain Influence equal to a set percentage of its Combat Strength. All basic Endeavors are unlocked; Endeavors with Allies don’t count against the limit of having one Endeavor of a given type active at a time. Allies can support your Endeavors for free.</dd><dt>Agenda - Ally of Enkidu</dt><dd>Increase Relationship by a Medium Amount with leaders who have started or supported the most Endeavors. Decrease Relationship by a Small Amount with leaders in Alliances with others.</dd></dl>
<h3><strong>Nested Tooltips</strong></h3>
<p>With Update 1.3.2, we’re adding the first pass of a new feature we’re very excited about: nested tooltips. Nested tooltips are an upgrade to our current tooltips, allowing them to turn game terms into links that provide further information when inspected.</p>
<p><em>Civ VII</em> is a deep game with lots of concepts that are new to the series, like Warehouse bonuses, and concepts that have been around a long time which we often take for granted, like Wonders. With this update, we’re upgrading our tooltips so that concepts like Warehouses or Wonders can be inspected to get a new tooltip with a brief explanation of that concept. There’s still more detailed information to be found in the Civilopedia, but these brief explainers are easier to access in the moment when you need a quick introduction or refresher on what exactly something does. Being able to nest information helps us make our tooltips more concise, and we’ve taken advantage of this opportunity to graphically refresh the affected tooltips. These two changes together should make the tooltips more readable, and thus the game more understandable. We know that the game is more fun when it helps you understand things better, as we saw with the Production List changes in 1.2.5, and we’re committed to continue improving the UI to better support that.</p>
<p>This feature is something we’re still actively working on, but we want to get the first iteration of it into your hands right away so you can let us know how it feels. Unsurprisingly, <em>Civ</em> games have a lot of text, so we’re doing this in phases. For 1.3.2, we’ve focused on populating the Tech and Civic choosers as well as the Production List tooltips first, because those are places where having more information as you make those big decisions is the most helpful.</p>
<p>We’re aiming to strike the right balance between providing useful information while not inundating the player to the point where it detracts from understanding. Do you think we struck the right balance? Let us know! Also, please let us know which areas of the game you’d find it most useful for us to focus on next. For example, we’re experimenting with automatically locking a tooltip if it’s been open for a few seconds, and letting players configure that timing.</p>
<h3><strong>New Appeal Lens</strong></h3>
<p>As we continue to evaluate Happiness and set the foundation for bigger upcoming changes, we’re working to ensure players always have the information they need to read the game. With this update, we’re presenting a new Appeal Lens. This new strategic tool is designed to help you quickly identify which tiles are Breathtaking or Charming, and even help you spot Natural Wonders.</p>
<p>Along with this new tool in <em>your</em> toolbelt, we’ve added a new one to ours. Previously, tiles could either be Appealing or not. Appealing tiles provided Happiness, and the Yield for Happiness scaled by Age. Now, Appealing tiles come in two types: <strong>Charming</strong> and <strong>Breathtaking</strong>. Charming tiles provide base Happiness, while Breathtaking tiles provide increased Happiness, and this value no longer scales by Age.</p>
<p>We hope you use the Appeal Lens to help answer these questions throughout your empire-building:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will I get the Happiness I need to support the Specialists and Buildings in my growing Cities?</li>
<li>Do I want to prioritize expansion towards high-value Natural Wonders?</li>
<li>Do I want to earn extra Happiness to trigger more Celebrations quickly?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Gameplay</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Coastal Raid</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Coastal Raid action for Naval Units has been updated to behave more like the Pillage action.
<ul>
<li>Naval Units can still Coastal Raid the tile they are on, as well as adjacent tiles, but they no longer have the option to Pillage. Coastal Raid can still be used to activate discoveries at range and capture Districts.</li>
<li>Coastal Raiding now provides Yields based on the tile being raided, matching Yields gained when Pillaging that tile. (<em>Previously: Coastal Raid defaulted to granting Gold and Health.)</em></li>
<li>Coastal Raid now also benefits from abilities that increase Pillage Yields. Effects that are intended to only trigger on Pillaging on land will specify Land Units in their description.</li>
<li><strong>Dev Note:</strong> We made this change to reduce the redundancy and confusion when Naval Units had access to both Coastal Raid and Pillage. We also took this opportunity to refine how the two actions really worked!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To support this change, the following content was updated:
<ul>
<li>Iceland’s Dróttkvætt Tradition and Vikingr were updated.
<dl><dt>Dróttkvætt</dt><dd>Naval Units grant Culture equal to 50% of Pillage Yields and Healing. <em>(Previously: Coastal Raiding grants Culture equal to 50% the Gold gained.)</em></dd><dt>Vikingr</dt><dd>Iceland Unique Heavy Naval Unit. Grants Science equal to 25% of Pillage Yields and Healing. Has 3 Sight. <em>(Previously: Iceland Unique Heavy Naval Unit. Coastal Raiding grants Science equal to 25% the Gold gained. Has 3 Sight.)</em></dd></dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Descriptions of Wonders, Social Policies, Commander Promotions, and Civ Abilities were updated to clarify whether they apply to Naval or Land Units.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Appeal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new Appeal Lens.</li>
<li>Appeal’s effect on Happiness has been updated. The way a tile’s Appeal is calculated is unchanged.
<ul>
<li>Appeal is no longer binary, and now has levels. Tiles can be Average, Charming, or Breathtaking. Appeal level determines how much Happiness a tile provides, and Happiness from Appealing tiles no longer scales by Age.
<ul>
<li><strong>Average</strong> tiles continue to not provide Happiness.</li>
<li><strong>Charming</strong> tiles provide +1 Happiness when improved.</li>
<li><strong>Breathtaking</strong> tiles provide +2 Happiness when improved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Abilities that previously referred to tiles with a Happiness Yield or a Natural Happiness Yield have been updated to reference Appeal instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI behavior around Diplomacy gameplay has been updated.
<ul>
<li>Diplomatic leaders will more properly use the Military Sabotage Action unlocked in the Diplomatic Attribute tree.</li>
<li>Militaristic leaders will more properly use the Open the Gates Espionage during War, and put more Influence towards War Support.</li>
<li>All leaders befriend Independents slightly more often.</li>
<li>Individual leaders have had specific biases adjusted to better support their gameplay. (Leaders affected include Ben Franklin, Edward Teach, Harriet Tubman, Himiko Queen of Wa, Ibn Battuta, Jose Rizal, Lafayette, Machiavelli, Napoleon Emperor, Sayyida al Hurra, Trung Trac.)</li>
<li>Leaders with City-State centered gameplay more properly Suzerain and Incorporate City-States. (Leaders affected include Lakshmibai, Tecumseh.)</li>
<li>Leaders with Personas have had their personalities slightly differentiated to vary gameplay. (Leaders affected include Ashoka, Friedrich, Himiko, Xerxes.)</li>
<li>Civs have had specific biases adjusted to better support their gameplay. (Civs affected include Greece, Shawnee, Siam, Tonga, Prussia, America, Great Britain, Spain.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Diplomacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Players will now correctly lose the +1 Gold Effect from Pirate Haven when losing a Trade Route by declaring a War.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Economy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed “Rural District" to just “Rural” on various tooltips, effects, descriptions, and Civilopedia articles for better consistency with gameplay logic. These tiles are now simply referred to as “Rural” to avoid confusion with "Districts” or Urban tiles.
<ul>
<li>As part of this change, the effects of both Qajar’s <em>Qullarāqāsi</em> Tradition and Sayyida al Hurra’s leader ability, <em>Hakima Tatwan</em>, now match their descriptions and only apply to Urban Districts.</li>
<li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: We wanted effects like these to be impactful and easily understood, while also not creating odd incentives. As we ramp up to bigger changes, expect us to unify language, make things clearer, and occasionally change abilities such as these to better fit. As always, we will be monitoring balance for Qajar and Sayyida al Hurra and make adjustments when necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players no longer fail to receive +2 Culture from ongoing Diplomatic projects when the Ekklesia Mastery has been completed and a Diplomatic project has been started.</li>
<li>Added Production Adjacency from Wonders for Factories in Modern.</li>
<li><em>Riches of the Duat</em> will no longer provide a +20% production bonus when constructing a Wonder in a city not located in desert terrain.</li>
<li>The bonuses from the "Freyfaxahamar" Storylet are no longer given as a Global Yield when selected. The bonus now correctly applies only towards Settlements that are following the player’s Religion.</li>
<li>The Anjuvannam Unique Building no longer fails to receive Adjacency Bonuses from Coastal tiles when slotting the "Shusei Kokubo" tradition.</li>
<li>Ageless Fortified Districts no longer lose Health and Wall Defense bonus when transitioning to the following Age.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Military</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Communism no longer spawns Naval Ranged Units instead of Land Ranged Units when completed in the Civic Tree.</li>
<li>Naval Units with the Pirate ability are no longer able to be attacked through Fortified districts when targeted by neutral units.</li>
<li>Military Naval Units can now properly capture a Fortified tile when the tile has had all Buildings pillaged.</li>
<li>The Donjon Unique Quarter no longer gives an extra Chevalier Unit when the Normans reconquer a Settlement with a completed Donjon Unique Quarter.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported storylet issue causing Army Commanders to disappear after gaining the reward.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved transition VFX for Naval Units.</li>
<li>Addressed a visual issue affecting Shawnee's Unique Unit "Hoceepkileni" model.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Leaders &amp; Civs</strong></h3>
<h4>Leaders</h4>
<ul>
<li>(★ - Community Influence Item) Added new leader Gilgamesh.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Civs</h4>
<p><strong>Mughal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unique Ability:
<ul>
<li>Paradise of Nations: +100% to all Gold Yields, -25% to all other Yields. (<em>Previously: Paradise of Nations: +75% to all Gold Yields, -25% to all other Yields.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Dev Note:</strong> We’ve been wanting to lean into the asymmetrical nature of the Mughal ability harder and make this a clean 100% bonus for a while, but waited to tweak the whole kit to support this change, as well as get a better sense of how the Modern Age was played by the community. While some abilities technically got debuffed a bit, overall we’ve found this to be a decent boost to making the Mughals feel special.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unique Improvement:
<ul>
<li>Stepwell: +2 Food. +2 Food from adjacent Farms. Must be built on a Flat tile. Cannot be built adjacent to another Stepwell. <em>(Previously: +2 Gold. +2 Food from adjacent Farms. Must be built on a Flat tile. Cannot be built adjacent to another Stepwell.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Dev Note:</strong> Since we buffed the Unique Ability to carry the majority of the Gold Bonus, we took the opportunity to focus other parts of their kit on the Food and Rural aspects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Traditions:
<ul>
<li>Mayūrāsana: +10% Gold towards purchasing anything. <em>(Previously: +25% Gold towards purchasing anything.)</em></li>
<li>Jins-i Kamil: +1 Food on Farms for each adjacent Plantation, and on Plantations for each adjacent Farm. (<em>Previously: +1 Food and Gold on Farms for each adjacent Plantation, and on Plantations for each adjacent Farm.)</em>
<dl><dt>Dev Note</dt><dd>This is another example of letting this part of the kit guide players to Mughal’s other strengths around Food.</dd></dl>
</li>
<li>Qilachas: +2 Gold on Quarters with Walls. <em>(Previously this ability wasn't working as intended and counted any District with 2 Buildings, instead of Quarters. Quarters are Districts with 2 Ageless or Current-Age Buildings)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Civic Tree:
<ul>
<li>Zabt Tier 1: Unlock the Stepwell. +1 Gold on Farms in Towns. Jins-i Kamil Tradition. (<em>Previously: Unlock the Stepwell. +1 Gold on Farms. Jins-i Kamil Tradition.)</em></li>
<li>Gardens of Paradise Tier 1: You can purchase Wonders with Gold, but they are more expensive. (150%) Mayūrāsana Tradition. (<em>Previously: You can purchase Wonders with Gold. Mayūrāsana Tradition).</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dai Viet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unique Ability
<ul>
<li>Hịch Tướng Sĩ: When you create a Fortification Constructible receive 25 Culture for every Urban Population in that Settlement. (Scales By Game Speed) (<em>Previously: When you create a Fortification Constructible receive 5 Culture for every Urban Population in that Settlement. (Scales By Game Speed)).</em></li>
<li><strong>Dev Note:</strong> Sometimes, we like to just buff stuff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unique Settler
<ul>
<li>Quận Vương: Unique Settler. When this Unit Settles receive 25 Culture for every Tropical tile within 3 of the City Center (Scales by Game Speed). (<em>Previously: When this Unit Settles receive 5 Culture for every Tropical tile within 3 of the City Center (Scales by Game Speed)).</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>French Empire</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced Militaristic Attribute for Cultural.
<dl><dt>Dev Note</dt><dd>The French Empire’s focus on Happiness and Government made the Diplomatic Attribute clear, but the rest of their bonuses split pretty evenly between combat and cultural focuses. With the other changes to their kit with this update, we felt it was appropriate to adjust their Attribute accordingly. As we ramp up towards releasing some bigger changes and making Attributes matter more in some contexts, we might adjust a few more civs in future updates. We plan to be very judicious about these shifts!</dd></dl>
</li>
<li>Changed the Grand Armee combat strength effect from Per Adjacent Unit to Traditions slotted in the Government.</li>
<li>Added a Tradition Slot to the French Empire’s final Civic.</li>

			<p><strong>Obsidian Entertainment</strong> was one of the busiest studios in 2025, releasing not just one, but <strong>three major titles</strong> last year. It began the year with <strong>Avowed</strong> in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">February 2025</a>, followed by <strong>Grounded 2</strong> releasing in <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/">early access in July 2025</a>, and capped off the year with <strong>The Outer Worlds 2</strong> in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/">October 2025</a>. Two of those three games were misfires in terms of sales (though they were fairly well received by critics, especially here on Wccftech), and a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy">Bloomberg</a> digs into how the studio is looking to bounce back and "<em>reinvent itself</em>."</p>



<p>If you can't guess which of the two games missed the mark on their sales, it was The Outer Worlds 2 and Avowed, though Obsidian Entertainment studio head <strong>Feargus Urquhart</strong> is quick to note that they weren't complete bombs. "<em>They're not disasters. I'm not going to say this was a kick in the teeth</em>," Urquhart said. "<em>It was more like: <strong>'That sucks. What are we learning?</strong>'"</em></p>



<p>One of those takeaways is how long the studio takes on its projects. Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2 both took over half a decade to make, and Urquhart (and the rest of the studio, seemingly) wants to cut that time down by half, within reason. When Avowed was initially pitched to Microsoft, it was initially envisioned as a massive, ambitious cross between <strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong> and <strong>Destiny 2</strong>. As the studio's design director, <strong>Josh Sawyer</strong> put it: "<em>I don't think there's a team on the planet that could execute on this</em>." </p>



<p>Obviously, that's not what Avowed ended up becoming, but by the time the decision was made to do away with the multiplayer portion and assign a new director to the game, it had been in development for <strong>three years</strong>. It took a total of <strong>seven years</strong> to actually get what we know Avowed to be out the door.</p>



<p>Regarding the time spent developing The Outer Worlds 2, which took <strong>six years</strong> between the release of the first game to the release of its sequel, game director <strong>Brandon Adler</strong> said, "<em>I don't think anybody really likes five, six, seven-year dev cycles. We've kind of grown into that</em>."</p>



<p>As for why Grounded 2 was able to come together faster than Outer Worlds 2 and Avowed, that came partially from <strong>Eidos Montreal</strong> pitching itself as a support studio for Obsidian. With the help of Eidos, and the distance afforded by not developing the entire thing internally, Obsidian co-founder and one of the game's managing directors, <strong>Chris Parker</strong>, noted that it gave them the grace to make faster decisions.</p>



<p>"<em>I was like, 'If this was one of our internal teams, we would work on this for another two or three months</em>,'" when discussing the decision to abandon making the rideable bugs in Grounded 2 shared by two or more players at once. "<em>We made this call because we could tell them what to do. It feels like we still run around with our kid gloves on internally</em>."</p>



<p>Probably the most damning quote in the report, in terms of how the studio needed to take a hard look at its processes and work towards change, comes from Sawyer. Regarding the fact that Obsidian released three games last year, he said, "<em>Spacing those releases helps the company manage its resources and not burn everybody out. It's not good to release three games in the same year. <strong>It's a result of things going wrong</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>Leaning on support studios seems to be one tactic the studio may use to make faster decisions, but a more reliable tactic will be reusing technology and systems where possible, instead of having to start from scratch all the time. "<em>We don't need to change everything every time</em>," Urquhart said. "<em>We've had this debate internally: Do people really care that we spent an extra hundred person-months on the inventory screen?</em>"</p>



<p>At the same time, Urquhart also noted that when doing a post-mortem on Outer Worlds 2 and Avowed, it can be minor differences that make a huge impact on a game's success. The trouble is figuring out which way those minor details are meant to go. "<em>Our job, all of us here, is to make games that people want to play and buy, and if we continue to do that, then we have a solid business</em>."</p>



<p>Cutting down development times with <strong>more outsourcing</strong> and <strong>reusing technology</strong> where possible are two of the key elements in Obsidian Entertainment's plan for the future. Also included in those plans are the growth of up-and-coming developers, with Urquhart mentoring <strong>Justin Birtch</strong> and <strong>Marcus Morgan</strong> to take his place one day at the studio's helm, and having <strong>multiple, smaller-scale projects on the go at once</strong>, instead of one big project that consumes the entire workforce. </p>



<p>"<em>You need to keep having at-bats, because at some point, if you can consistently make good stuff, you'll get those breakout hits</em>," said Morgan. </p>



<p>As for Obsidian Entertainment's next "<em>at-bats</em>," the report corroborates what we've previously heard, that the studio is not working on<strong> </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-2-but-not-the-outer-worlds-3-reportedly-in-the-making-at-obsidian/"><strong>The Outer Worlds 3</strong>, but is instead focused on new games in the <strong>Avowed universe</strong> as its next major project</a>. Alongside that, it'll be working on new content for Grounded 2 and The Outer Worlds 2, and whatever it is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-creator-returns-work-full-time-at-obsidian-entertainment/"><strong>Fallout</strong> creator <strong>Tim Cain</strong> recently returned to Obsidian full-time to work on</a>. </p>
