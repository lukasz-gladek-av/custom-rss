            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that "GPS based action RPG"&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, although the long-absent&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV&nbsp;</em>remains in development, according to the studio.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/KHMLink_NA/status/1922540374167364055" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X, Square Enix says that it "worked hard on developing and adjusting"&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</em>, but that the studio would be unable to "offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time".</p>

<p>Square Enix closes by saying that "the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series will continue", and that the development team is&nbsp;"hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>", imploring fans to "keep an eye out for further updates", although no timeframe for those updates is revealed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled-combat.jpg?itok=cg-Dox8d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled-combat.jpg?itok=9YTxRbHd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link&nbsp;</em>will forever remain...well...missing.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-4-announced" rel="nofollow">first revealed back in 2022</a>, alongside flagship series entry&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>. A number of closed beta tests were held in the period between then and now, but it seems that they didn't help Square Enix refine the game enough for release.</p>

<p>The game was to take place between the events of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Union&nbsp;</em><i>χ&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Dark Road</em>, both smartphone spinoffs (although what constitutes a "spinoff" in the murky world of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>can be fluid at the best of times).</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, it was to adapt the action-RPG gameplay for which&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>has become known, with players battling Heartless and other enemies in and around the land of Scala ad Caelum. Disney characters like Aladdin,&nbsp;<em>Toy Story</em>'s Woody, and&nbsp;<em>Tangled</em>'s Rapunzel were set to appear.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>, very little has been revealed about the game since that debut trailer back in 2022. We know it'll once again star series protagonist Sora, and that it'll take place in the modern city of Quadratum, but other than that, it's shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>Somewhat alarmingly, series creator Tetsuya Nomura has also declared that it's possible he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tetsuya-nomura-kingdom-hearts-retirement" rel="nofollow">won't finish the series before he retires</a>, so if you were hoping for closure from&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>(for some reason), you might be disappointed.</p>

        <p>They're selling your Horace hat as we speak</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Details from 89 million Steam accounts have reportedly gone up for sale on the dark web. Since RPS's dedicated tech team have just informed me that the dark web is not the thing you get when you click 'incognito tab' and is actually potentially much scarier than that, you might want to consider changing your password. Or maybe not. As I say, it's all alleged at this point.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The news comes from a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/underdark-ai_cybersecurity-databreach-steam-activity-7327022917370703872-JqN3/">LinkedIn post</a> by user Underdark.AI, listed as a "Computer and Network Security" page, as reported on by our network chums <a href="https://www.vg247.com/steam-vendor-data-breach-passwords-89-million-users-dark-web">at VG247</a>. From the post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, a threat actor going by Machine1337 posted on a well-known dark web forum claiming to have breached Steam, offering a dataset of over 89 million user records for $5,000. The post includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Telegram contact for purchase</li>
<li>A link to sample data hosted on Gofile</li>
<li>Mentions of internal vendor data, indicating deeper access</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>They later updated the post with the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following our initial post on the claimed Steam data breach (89M+ users), new evidence confirms that a leaked sample contains real-time 2FA SMS logs routed via Twilio.</p>
<p>The data includes message contents, delivery status, metadata, and routing costs — suggesting backend access to a vendor dashboard or API, not Steam directly.</p>
<p>This reinforces a supply chain compromise, putting user security at risk via phishing or session hijacking.</p></blockquote>
<p>X user Mellow_Online, who shared the news on that platform, says that <a href="https://x.com/MellowOnline1/status/1922458722485317664">they were contacted by a Valve representative</a> who "stated that they do not use Trillio", the data protection company mentioned in the LinkedIn post.</p>
<p>Data security is very far out of my wheelhouse - I still think it's funny to say "I'm in" in a hacker voice whenever a website loads after being slow for a bit - so I'm not to going to add additional comment (though I have asked Valve for one). Do with this information what you will!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> director Guillaume Broche has said a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version of the game "could be interesting", though it seems there are no firm plans as of yet.</p>
<p>The game released last month across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but with Nintendo's next console arriving next month, speculation has arisen as to whether a port could be possible.</p>
<p>Speaking to French YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14dRaYeAHM">mistermv</a>, Broche discussed how the success of the game "changes everything" and the studio is considering its next steps.</p>

<p>"Well, at this point, considering the success of the game, it kind of changes everything," said Broche (machine translation, via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-switch-2-version-could-be-interesting-says-sandfall">MP1st</a>). "So clearly, it's too early to say, but we're kind of in a situation where... let's say there are a lot of opportunities showing up - way too many at once - and we're figuring out what we'll go for and what we won't. But yeah, it's definitely something that could be interesting."</p>
<p>By popular demand, the team is also looking into <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lp4swutbys2p">plushies of the game's cuddly character Esquie</a>.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur was created by a core team of around 30 people (with extra outsourced support) and it seems its sudden success has been overwhelming. It sold<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day"> a million copies in three days</a> and, despite releasing the same week as Bethesda's Elder Scrolls: Oblivion remake, the game's publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-oblivion-surprise-release-didnt-seem-to-harm-clair-obscur-expedition-33-success-publisher-says">Kepler said this didn't seem to harm sales</a>.</p>
<p>Still, its high-end graphics make great use of Unreal Engine 5. "Overall, I think Expedition 33 is a very good-looking Unreal Engine 5 title, and it's one of the most graphically pleasing current-gen RPGs," wrote Digital Foundry in its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-clair-obscur-expedition-33-tech-review-ps5-pro-series-x-s">Clair Obscur tech review</a>. "Despite a few minor quibbles, it's delivering a top-notch aesthetic experience that looks consistently high quality when exploring or engaging in fights."</p>
<p>But would the game even be technically possible on Switch 2? Digital Foundry's Rich Leadbetter told me a port would be compromised, "but it is too early to say how compromised as we've seen so little of UE5 on Switch 2".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-french-inspired-setting-was-originally-steampunk-london">in-development trailer for the game was unearthed on reddit</a>. It was originally called We Lost and featured a steampunk town and sci-fi elements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-3-crimson-impressive-overhaul/">Devil May Cry 3 Crimson mod</a> is now available for download, introducing so many improvements and new features that wouldn't look amiss in a real remake.</p>
<p>The mod, which is only compatible with the HD Collection version and can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycryhdcollection/mods/272?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and <a href="https://github.com/berthrage/Devil-May-Cry-3-Crimson/releases/tag/V0.3">GitHub</a>, allows players to enjoy the third entry in the series with plenty of new features and enhancements, including a new HUB based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/">Devil May Cry 5</a> interface, updated lock-on and camera options that provide a much better view of the action, local co-op with plenty of options for an optimal experience, on-the-fly style switching, which is only available officially in the Nintendo Switch release of the HD remaster and more.</p>
<p>It's gameplay options, other than on-the-fly style switching, however, that make Devil May Cry 3 Crimson feel the most like a proper remake. Features like third-person camera, inertia and guardfly in the vein of Devil May Cry 4, a fully functional weapon wheel for improved weapon switching, reduced input lag and new gameplay modes like the Legendary Dark Knight and Must-Style modes are incredible additions that make the game feel and play more like the most recent entries in the series, turning the already excellent original into an even better game. You can check out some of these features in action in the launch trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Devil May Cry 3 Crimson - BETA Launch Trailer - OUT NOW" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CZdUZtvhui8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Devil May Cry 3 Crimson mod will have to make do for the time being for fans of the series eagerly anticipating to learn what's next for the series. Though long-time series director Hideaki Itsuno <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/">left CAPCOM last year</a>, the future of the franchise could still be bright, as series creator Hideki Kamiya is working with the Japanese publisher again, and has recently expressed the desire to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-is-once-again-letting-capcom-and-everyone-else-know-that-he-would-love-to-remake-devil-may-cry/">remake the first entry in the series.</a></p>

            <p>The founder of gaming accessibility charity AbleGamers has been accused of abuse and financial mismanagement. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-employees-community-members-allege-ablegamers-founder-fostered-abuse-behind-closed-doors">Speaking to IGN</a>, former employees who worked at AbleGamers alleged multiple instances of sexist and emotionally abusive behavior, financial mismanagement, as well as aggressive, racist, and inappropriate remarks by founder Mark Barlet. Barlet denies the allegations.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>After allegedly being told by Barlet that she was effectively the company's HR because she was the only woman that worked there, one source was sent to work on an HR case. This "was really illegal of me because I didn’t have those credentials," she told IGN. Barlet reportedly made light of this situation for several weeks afterward, "causing numerous employees to feel uncomfortable". Following childbirth, the same woman was told by Barlet in a meeting that her "jugs had gotten so big that he wouldn’t know how to handle them".</p>
<p>The source also described hearing Barlet make racist remarks about other employees. In one instance, Barlet reportedly said that "we need to get the most fucked up disabled person to be on our marketing, the one with real multiple disabilities," while making mocking gestures. The source told IGN that Barlet's "behaviors with her grew increasingly hostile every time she spoke out against him". Barlet also was reportedly dismissive or aggressive towards other accessibility advocates, telling one individual over a call that they were "a drop in the pond of accessibility. And I own the pond".</p>
<p>According to another anonymous source, Barlet also mismanaged funds from the millions in donations the charity recieved over the years. "Funds were allocated for first-class tickets for certain leadership, hotel rooms before or after the dates of designated events, and even expensive meals for office staff that primarily consisted of remote employees," write IGN. The same source alleges that Barlet also used the nonprofit's budget to pay for a Tesla charger for AbleGamers's headquarters, despite being the only one there who drove a Tesla. Salaries were also a point of contention with the nonprofit, with alleged favouritism dictating pay, and "some employees earning far more for doing far less within the company".</p>
<p>This all came to a head in April last year, when a former employee ordered an investigation by payroll and HR service ADP, who allegedly advised AbleGamer's independent board to terminate Barlet "immediately due to the severe nature of the allegations," write IGN. The independent board allegedly ignored ADP's findings. Barlet eventually left the nonprofit following another external investigation.</p>
<p>When reached out to by IGN for comment, Barlet said that "after thoroughly being investigated by an independent third-party, it was determined that none of that was true," telling IGN that the allegations and subsequent investigation occured after he was allegedly advised to cut back on AbleGamers' workforce. He also responded to the claims of financial mismanagement, denying the Tesla charger purchase and several other allegations. IGN note that Barlet provided "no evidence to refute the allegations, only his word", and refused to show documentation unless correspondence was off the record.</p>
<p>A source who spoke to IGN alleges that those who spoke out against Barlet were retaliated against by the board. "The people that were fired were all ones that filed reports or talked to lawyers." AbleGamers officials did not respond to IGN's request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a recent interview, Master Chief voice actor Steve Downes spoke on the issue of AI voice acting that has fueled the ongoing strike, appealing to fans to support the actors' fight.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://x.com/mr_rebs_/status/1921929444660261364?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rebs Gaming</a> in a clip posted to X, Downes explained that the "single issue" of the strike is now the use of AI, and ensuring that voice actors have a say over how--or if--their voices are used for AI replicas.</p><p>"We haven't been able to make any progress with that at all so far," Downes says of the strike that started last July. "So we're really asking the people who consume this game, who made Halo what it is, to voice their opinion about this and show support."</p><p>"We're not against the use of AI; we're just against the misuse of it," Downes added, a statement that was backed up by Cortana voice actor Jen Taylor.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/mr_rebs_/status/1921929444660261364?s=46" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Here’s an interview clip from the event of Steve Downes and Jen Taylor explaining they joined SAG AFTRA to help establish voice actors rights over AI and are asking Halo fans to help support them.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckfest-2-adds-new-cars-and-muddy-tracks-with-more-planned-next-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Speedy fender-bender 'em up <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> has added two new cars to its roster of smashmobiles alongside two new tracks, including one track from the first game that's been given a "makeover". The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game</a> is still in earliest of access, so this only brings the total number of vehicles up to six, and the selection of tracks is still limited too. But it's the start of what developers Bugbear see as steady progress, with more cars and courses set to come next month.</p>

<p>The new cars include a European sports sedan called the Bravion and a familiar American longbrute called Rammer, which featured in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a> as a reliable early career car. I certainly drove it into the ground anyway. The tracks, meanwhile, offer the fresh dirt of central European rallycross, and the return of Finncross, a track from the previous game which has been spruced up. </p>
<p>"It has been given a complete makeover so it's okay if you don't even recognize it," say the developers in the above trailer. "It’s a track packed with tight turns, perfect for corner bombing
so we except to see some epic battles this time too."</p>
<p>Along with these headliners, there's also a bunch of smaller updates and changes. The gamepad now rumbles, the user interface has been improved, and you can now properly invite buds to join a server from your Steam friends list. There's a small mound of performance tweaks and bug fixes too, all of which are mentioned in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203190/view/501698646945826538">an update post</a> on Steam. That's also where the developers promise more bangers and raceplaces soon, with a roadmap showing that another update of similar size is planned for next month. </p>
<p>That's encouraging. Wreckfest 2 feels nice and weighty in the hands yet is quite light on actual toys to play with so far. You can read my impressions in more detail in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckfest-2-early-access-review">early access review</a> but basically it's gearing up to be a solid and exciting sequel to a respected game of windshield-cracking antics. More stuff is good stuff.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-development-3-year-reboot-plan/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the silence surrounding Kingdom Hearts IV, Square Enix has confirmed it is still hard at work on it, but this is the end of the good news for fans of the series today.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.kingdomhearts.com/missinglink/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new message</a> shared by the publisher today, it has been confirmed that the mobile game Kingdom Hearts Missing Link has been officially canceled. The publisher canceled the game as it was determined that it would be difficult to <em>"offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time."</em> At the end of the message, Square Enix confirmed that they are still hard at work on Kingdom Hearts IV, so hopefully it won't take long to see more of the next entry in the series, of which we have seen very little since its announcement.</p>
<p>The cancellation of Kingdom Hearts Missing Link seems to be part of a big 3-year reboot plan from Square Enix, which is being implemented to achieve consistent releases of major titles and more cooperation between the creative studios. The plan was outlined today in new <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20250514_01_en.pdf">documents</a> shared after the unveiling of the company's fiscal year report, and it includes the creation of an R&amp;D division for AI development tools, a multi-platform focus to improve profitability of games, placing all its games under the management of the same studio, reducing outsourcing, the cancellation of several titles and more. As it will take time to implement the plan, the publisher expects a large drop in net sales, but stable operating income for the current fiscal year ending in March 2026, so no major release should be expected.</p>
<p>Though it's likely at this point that <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-improved-visuals-will-limit-the-number-of-disney-worlds-tetsuya-nomura-reveals/">Kingdom Hearts IV</a> is not going to launch before March 31st, 2026, Square Enix still has a few titles in the pipeline. The Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remakes are still scheduled for release this year, as is the Final Fantasy VII Remake Nintendo Switch 2 port, which will unlikely offer <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-nintendo-switch-2-no-60-fps-mode-unreal-engine-5/">a 60 FPS mode</a> on the system, despite some recent hints. The publisher is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-partners-with-tbs-tv-to-create-an-original-ip-game/">working with TBS TV</a> to create a game based on an original intellectual property.</p>

            <p>All creative work goes through several iterations before arriving in its final form. This very post, for example, began as a little notice of the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a>, before I realised Edwin had already done that. Now it's instead about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, an RPG which Nic definitely described in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">his review</a> as "operatically, hauntingly, and slightly unhingedly French".
</p>
<p>Turns out it wasn't always so, as early in development Clair Obscur was set in "a steampunk Victorian England", and there's some early footage of it in action.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Five years ago, Sandfall Interactive CEO Guillaume Broche <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">posted on Reddit</a> in search of voice actors for the project, described at the time as "a 3d modern take on the JRPG genra with western style characters". The project was called "We Lost" and Broche shared early video footage of the game, the original links to which no longer work, though it's available via reuploads.

</p>
<p>One of the people who applied to be a voice actor on the game, Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, went on to instead be its lead writer. In a recent interview, she told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-writer-reveals-game-almost-had-zombies/">The Gamer</a> about how the project changed. "The gameplay would have been similar, but the story was completely different. It was set in a steampunk Victorian England with zombies, aliens, and various things."
</p>
<p>Apparently it was a call with investors that caused the project the change course. 
</p>
<blockquote>"Guillaume called me, and he's just like, ‘Alright, reboot. We're starting from scratch,’” she said, following a call in which potential investors told them, "You know, you can think bigger, don't hold yourself back just because you're worried about funding. If you could do what you wanted to do, what would you write?"</blockquote>
<p>There are some memorable games set in London already - a city which Nate memorably referred to as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-dogs-legion-how-to-talk-like-a-fackin-future-fackin-cockney">"hard mode Paris"</a> - so I'm glad Clair Obscur reached for a more distinct flavour, one that Nic named in his review as "French French FRENCH IT'S FRENCH FRANCE French French French French!". Love that guy's writing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Predictably, sales and profits of the company's MMOs have increased, notably due to the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> expansion Dawntrail last summer. Further, sales and profits of mobile games have dropped "sharply" as the company has closed many of its games.</p>
<p>Indeed, it announced today the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-cancelled-but-kingdom-hearts-4-still-on-the-way">cancellation of mobile game Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the digital entertainment sector has seen an 18 percent drop in sales, but 28 percent increase in operating income.</p>
<p>However, Square Enix is in the midst of a "three-year reboot for long-term growth", which began last year when CEO Takashi Kiryu announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">company was "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a>, including "Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs".</p>
<p>So far, year-on-year sales of PC games have doubled - in the past year, previously console exclusives like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-final-fantasy-7-rebirths-pc-port-has-promise-but-too-many-problems">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-16-is-highly-demanding-on-pc-and-these-are-the-best-settings">Final Fantasy 16</a> have been released on PC.</p>
<p>It seems Switch 2 will also be important for the company. Final Fantasy 7 Remake will be out this year (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-heading-to-switch-2-director-suggests">seemingly the full remake series</a>), while Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster will be out at launch. Could other games be ported over too?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-gets-first-look-at-gameplay">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD Remake</a> will be the biggest new release of the year, set for release across Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Windows, Steam). This will be followed in the next couple of years with "plans to release major titles" and "plans to release multiple titles on multiple platforms". By the third quarter of 2028, the company plans to "release major titles on a consistent basis".</p>
<p>The company also plans to release a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-officially-revealed">mobile version of Final Fantasy 14</a>, though curiously it's listed as "for China" in this report.</p>
<p>What other "major titles" are in the pipeline? There's the expected third part of the Final Fantasy 7 remake series, but outside of that could the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-ignites-remake-hopes-once-again">rumoured Final Fantasy 9 remake</a> be a reality? A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">remake of Chrono Trigger</a>? And when will whatever Final Fantasy 17 turns out to be see the light of day?</p>
<p>Square Enix's diversifying strategy extends outside of games too. There's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-and-magic-the-gathering-crossovers-sephiroth-design-hints-at-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-three">soon-to-be-released Magic: the Gathering card collection</a>, alongside various pop-up stores, concert events, and anime shows like NieR: Automata.</p>
<p>The company is also collaborating with Japanese TV network TBS on a "new IP based on transmedia expansion" - no further details have been provided.</p>
<p>As a result of all this, Square Enix is forecasting a further drop in sales for the next fiscal year, but an increase in profits. Without a major Final Fantasy release or Final Fantasy 14 expansion, it's certainly looking like a quieter year for the company.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Final Fantasy series producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">story for the third part of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy is complete</a>. It remains without a release window.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Warner Bros. has released a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> gameplay comparison trailer, as well as confirming that an upgrade path from Switch to Switch 2 will be available.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hogwarts Legacy - Nintendo Switch 2 Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x4s9sxNxT44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hogwarts Legacy for Nintendo Switch 2 will bring some huge improvements over the original Switch release. Newly ported to the platform, instead of reusing the heavily modified Switch version as its base, Hogwarts Legacy will have graphics much closer to the PlayStation and Xbox versions of the game. This includes improved lighting, shadows, animation quality, anti-aliasing and the use of DLSS upscaling. There will be up to 1440p in docked and up to 1080p in handheld mode.</p>
<p>Further to this, travelling through the open world and into Hogsmeade will no longer have loading screens, while flying around the Hogwarts grounds on broomstick will have better frame rates, faster loading and increased flight speed.</p>
<p>Oh, and there’s Joy-Con 2 mouse mode support.</p>

<p>While this is a ground-up port of the game, Warner Bros. is offering a discount on the Switch 2 version of the game for those who own the game on original Nintendo Switch – these isn’t a “Switch 2 Edition”, but is still a premium upgrade path. This will sell the digital edition of Hogwarts Legacy for Nintendo Switch 2 for $10 (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hogwarts-legacy-on-switch-2-appears-to-have-a-10-upgrade-for-owners-of-the-digital-switch-version/">per early reports</a>) to owners of either the digital or physical version of the game on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>For details on how this works, <a href="https://portkeygamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/40777819412115-Hogwarts-Legacy-Nintendo-Switch-Owner-s-Discount-for-Nintendo-Switch-2">please visit the FAQ.</a> You will also be able to transfer your save game between generations.</p>
<p>Regardless of how Switch 2 owners buy Hogwarts Legacy, the game will require installation to the console’s storage. The physical release of Hogwarts Legacy for Nintendo Switch 2 will use a Game Key Card, which has no game data included on the cartridge and requires that the full game is downloaded. <a href="https://portkeygamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/9296355411475-Hogwarts-Legacy-Storage-Requirements-on-Nintendo-Switch-and-Nintendo-Switch-2">Warner Bros. say just how much storage will be required</a>:</p>
<p>“Customers using a game-key card or digital download from the Nintendo eShop should plan for an installation of 24 GB. If you decide to get an extra language pack, you should plan for an additional 1.5 GB download per language.”</p>
<p>Thankfully the Switch 2 comes with 256GB of storage built in, so you won’t have to immediately grab one of the new MicroSD Express cards to install all your games to.</p>
<p>We awarded <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/06/hogwarts-legacy-review/">Hogwarts Legacy 7/10</a> when it first released in 2023, saying “The sights and sounds alone make Hogwarts Legacy the dream Harry Potter game fans have been longing for. There’s an intriguing mystery to unravel, though you’re bound to spend most of your time exploring a wealth of side content, visiting virtual landmarks and roleplaying as a Hogwarts student. That said, it’s more successful in being a sandbox teeming with nostalgia rather than a stand-out action RPG in its own right, let down by gameplay foibles and spellcasting combat that quickly slides into repetition.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-new-project-tf/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-is-working-on-a-new-project-codenamed-%E2%80%9Ctf%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-rumor.1188765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/valve-new-project-tf/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Valve is working on a new project codenamed "Tf" according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by known Valve leaker Tyler McVicker, a new "Tf" codename was discovered in the latest Deadlock update, similar to how the HLX, rumored to be Half-Life 3, was discovered. This codenamed project isn't a leftover from Deadlock or any other project, as its inclusion in the Source 2 engine, which powers every game from Valve, means that there is a preset inside the engine with development tools that can be used by a team to make content for it. This is, according to the leaker, a standard procedure for every game developed in the Source 2 engine, as a differentiation of sorts is needed to indicate different projects and development tools.</p>
<p>As for what this new Valve project could be, no one can say. Though the codename seems to suggest some relation with Team Fortress, Tyler McVickers believes it is not a port of Team Fortress 2 to the Source 2 engine. Going by the timeline and the fact that the project is more recent than Deadlock and Counter-Strike 2, it's very possible that the project is currently in the same state as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghG8kZdtWoE">earliest Deadlock footage</a> available online, so it will take some time to learn more about it.</p>
<p><iframe title="VALVE NEWS &amp; DOOM THE DARK AGES DISCUSSION/GAMEPLAY" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDs0MSChMvc?start=1415&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the project codenamed "Tf" is likely not getting revealed anytime soon, there's a good chance that the Valve project codenamed HLX will be revealed and released this year. According to Tyler McVicker, this project, rumored to be<a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/"> Half-Life 3</a>, is being widely playtested ahead of a possible summer reveal and winter release. The game is reportedly also playable from beginning to end, so chances are high that, even if the game is not really Half-Life 3, the series will return after the successful VR game Half-Life Alyx.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has cancelled development of mobile game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> Missing-Link.</p>
<p>In a statement on social media, the company stated it would be "difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time". However, it confirmed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> - the long-awaited next mainline entry in the series - is still in development.</p>
<p>Missing-Link would have been a GPS-based action-RPG similar to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> but with Disney characters and combat against Heartless similar to the mainline console games. Gameplay was shown at the series' 20th anniversary celebration.</p>

<p>"We wish to convey our heartfelt apologies to everyone who has been looking forward to the start of service," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"Although we worked hard on developing and adjusting the game in the hope that it would be enjoyed by lots of players, we determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development."</p>
<p>The company thanked those who took part in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-kingdom-hearts-game-begins-closed-betas-next-month">multiple closed beta tests</a>, before concluding: "The Kingdom Hearts series will continue. We are hard at work on Kingdom Hearts 4, and hope you'll continue to support the series as you keep an eye out for further updates."</p> <div>

<p>The series has received multiple spin-offs outside of its three main entries across mobile and handheld consoles, with each extending the overarching plot a little further.</p>
<p>However, it's been six years since the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a> on PS4 and Xbox One, the most recent series entry.</p>
<p>Square Enix officially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">announced Kingdom Hearts 4 back in 2022</a> for the series' 20th anniversary celebration, but little has been heard about it since.</p>
<p>Last year, series director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-will-lead-towards-a-series-conclusion-so-nomura-can-retire">Tetsuya Nomura stated the fourth game will be a reset of the story</a> but will lead towards a series conclusion as he looks to retire.</p>
<p>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link is the latest mobile game to be cancelled by Square Enix.</p>
<p>Back in February this year, the iOS version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-shuts-down-another-final-fantasy-mobile-game">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles was shut down</a> due to an ongoing bug.

		<p>Square Enix has cancelled Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, its GPS-based action RPG that was in development for iOS and Android mobile devices, but recommitted to the ongoing development of Kingdom Heart IV.</p>
<p>Announced back in 2022, Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link was looking to latch onto that Pokémon Go market with a planned launch in 2024. However, it was delayed at pretty much the last minute in November last year, and has now been cancelled entirely.</p>


<p>While I’m sure fans of this genre of mobile game were looking forward to a fresh take on it, separate to Niantic’s numerous entries, Square Enix determined that they just weren’t making a good game for the long haul. “We determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time,” they admit.</p>
<p data-characters="350" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">The much more important point for Kingdom Hearts fans is that Square Enix are still full steam ahead on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4.</a> This was also announced back in 2022, a good few years after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-hearts-3">Kingdom Hearts 3’s</a> release, and will kick off the new Lost Master Arc narrative. The lingering question will be how Missing-Link’s narrative will be folded into the next main game. Given how convoluted the Kingdom Hearts story is, how it’s been spread across so many different games and platforms (before its collated remasters), and how deeply invested the fanbase is in dredging up every morsel of story, it’s kind of appropriate that some of this will be lost or repurposed from a game called Missing-Link.</p>
<p>Here’s the full announcement from Square Enix:</p>

<p><em>We have made the decision to cancel the development of Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link.</em></p>
<p><em>We wish to convey our heartfelt apologies to everyone who has been looking forward to the start of service.</em></p>
<p><em>Although we worked hard on developing and adjusting the game in the hope that it would be enjoyed by lots of players, we determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development.</em></p>
<p><em>We would like to take this opportunity to express our thanks to everyone who gave us their support and assistance with the multiple closed beta tests. We are truly sorry to have to make this announcement.</em></p>
<p><em>The <a title="Series > Kingdom Hearts [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> series will continue. We are hard at work on Kingdom Hearts IV, and hope you’ll continue to support the series as you keep an eye out for further updates.</em></p>

			<p>This morning, Japanese game developer and publisher Square Enix <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/ja/news/files/077cbfa987cc7f8ee0eac7391eedb651.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a partnership with TBS TV to create a game based on an original intellectual property. TBS is one of five private broadcasters and is mostly known as the home of Ninja Warrior (known as Sasuke in Japan), a sports/reality show where a hundred participants compete in a four-stage obstacle course.</p>
<p>Here's the translated press release, which does not provide any details on the game itself (likely still in the concept phase):</p>
<p><em>Square Enix Co., Ltd. aims to continue to provide new experiences and value that will remain in the hearts and minds of customers around the world through its content and services, based on corporate philosophy of "Creating new worlds with limitless imagination. Under the new medium-term management plan, the Square Enix Group is working to deliver to customers a rich variety of content with solid appeal through the creation of new IP, the development of new business models, and the multifaceted development of IP.</em></p>
<p><em>TBS Television Inc. aims to be the starting point that moves society by delivering heart-stirring moments in a variety of fields. TBS' brand promise is to "create the world of tomorrow with the best of time. With this brand promise, we are taking on the challenge of pioneering digital content and growing into the global content brand "TBS". As part of these efforts, in July, we will launch our own game business brand "TBS GAMES" and focus on the creation of original IP originating from games. </em></p>
<p><em>Square Enix and TBS have decided to collaborate on the development of a completely new original IP game for both domestic and international markets, combining the experience and strengths they have cultivated in their respective fields. We hope you will look forward to the new original IP will be created by combining the knowledge of both companies in the entertainment field.</em></p>
<p>Considering the history of Square Enix, this could be a roleplaying game of some kind, but it's really too early to tell. However, we'll keep an eye on any news in the coming months.</p>

            <p>Co-op shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> added its third enemy faction, the Illuminate, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-update-adds-the-dreaded-illuminate-faction-plus-city-maps-and-bouncy-jeeps">back in December</a>. Now the alien squids are headed towards Super Earth itself, and to counteract this latest threat to democracy developers Arrowhead are giving soldiers new ways to customise their weaponry.

<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/">explained on the PlayStation blog</a>, the new update adds weapon customisation for all primary weapons, letting you complete missions and pay in-game currency to unlock attachments and skins. "Whether it’s tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting under-barrel attachments for the handling you want, you’re in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield," says the post.
</p>
<p>These newly tweakable weapons are proposed as a response to Illuminate heading towards Super Earth, and doing so with newly added enemy types. That includes "the Stingray", a flying enemy that can perform strafing runs on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>; "the Crescent Overseer", which can drop explosives on Helldivers behind cover; and the Fleshmob, a "Frankenstein’s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy."
</p>
<p>"Voteless parts" is good. Good marketing, marketer.
</p>
<p>The in-game store has also been amended to offer items permanently, rather than only a rotating time-limited selection, meaning that you can now go pickup that fascist dandy cape you missed first time around. I like when developers decide to stop preying upon FOMO.
