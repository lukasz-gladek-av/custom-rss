<p>Nintendo Switch Online is the premium subscription service available for Switch and Switch 2 users to try. Unlike PlayStation’s PS Plus and Xbox’s Game Pass, which provide access to a library of current-gen and previous-gen games, NSO gives players access to a range of classic games from previous Nintendo platforms.</p>



<p>If you combine Nintendo Switch Online with the Expansion Pack, then players can get access to a library of games from almost all classic Nintendo consoles, including NES, SNES, Game Boy, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, SEGA Genesis, and Nintendo GameCube games. </p>



<p>In 2025, NSO members had access to some top-tier classic games through Nintendo Switch Online, including hits from popular franchises like Zelda, Mario, and more. Check out Insider Gaming’s top 10 picks of Nintendo Switch Online games that you need to try out in 2025:</p>



<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a Nintendo Switch Online user in 2025 and haven’t played The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, then you are missing out. What’s more, it is the highest-rated game of all time on Metacritic. Do you need any more convincing after that? It was the first 3D Legend of Zelda game, making Hyrule more alive than ever before thanks to environmental storytelling, a good mix of exploration, puzzles, and combat, and memorable characters. </p>



<h2 id="h-super-metroid">Super Metroid</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Super Metroid is a 1994 SNES game that was the third installment in the series. It saw Samus Aran face off against Space Pirates in her quest to recover the last Metroid. Super Metroid is a fantastic 2D side-scrolling action adventure, where you explore large areas while being able to run, jump, crouch, and fire in different directions. The game also features other types of power-ups that can enhance Samus’ arsenal or grant special abilities. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-windwaker">The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion members received the original GameCube version of The Legend of Windwaker for the Switch 2 in 2025. Wind Waker was released in 2002 and brought a significant change to the series, with the developers exploring a brand-new art style. Additionally, the game also had Link visiting clusters of islands across the Great Sea, where he used a sailboat called King of Red Lions to navigate through</p>



<h2 id="h-super-mario-world">Super Mario World</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Super Mario World is another classic hit that Nintendo Switch Online players shouldn’t miss out on in 2025. The title was released in 1991 for the SNES and quickly became a fan favorite. Though most of it was similar to the series, the game came with a new gameplay feature that would become iconic to the series. The feature in question is Yoshi, the rideable dinosaur who could walk faster, eat enemies, and spit them like projectiles. Super Mario World is also the best-selling SNES game. </p>



<h2 id="h-f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>F-Zero is a classic racing game set in a futuristic world. The game is similar to previous titles in the F-Zero series; however, what makes it unique is the introduction of a story mode where players can complete 9 chapters as Captain Falcon. The game features a variety of tracks with tubes, jumps, and roller coaster-like paths. There are also a variety of machines in the game, each behaving differently. </p>



<h2 id="h-fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is an installment that is separate from the continuity of other games. It is set in the fictional continent of Magvel, where two royal siblings fight to keep hostile sources from invading their kingdom. The title is a tactical RPG featuring turn-based combat, with players battling allied, player-controlled, and enemy units. Each unit has the ability to evolve through experience points; however, it also features a perma-death system, where if a unit dies, it can’t return for the rest of the campaign unless the player restarts the game. </p>



<h2 id="h-goldeneye-007">GoldenEye 007</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have ever been a fan of the James Bond series and wish to try a classic FPS title, then you can’t go wrong with GoldenEye 007. It is based on the 1995 film, in which you play the iconic MI6 agent James Bond, facing a criminal syndicate that plans to deploy a satellite weapon. The game was originally going to be a side-scroller for the SNES, but ended up becoming a first-person shooter inspired by games like Doom, released for the Nintendo 64, and became the third-best-selling game on the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-rayman-2-the-great-escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rayman 2: The Great Escape was a special installment in the series, as it marked the move from 2D to 3D. Just like others, it is a platformer released for the Nintendo 64 in 1999, where players run through linear sequences, battle robotic pirates, collect lums, and solve puzzles. The primary weapon in the game is Rayman’s fists, and as you progress, the game gives you more abilities with charged attacks, ranged attacks, and more traversal methods being added to the player’s arsenal.</p>



<h2 id="h-golden-sun">Golden Sun</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Golden Sun is a fantasy RPG that was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001, and it eventually received two more installments over the years. The game has you playing four characters as you embark on a quest to protect the world from a destructive force called Alchemy. The title features several interesting characters to interact with, monsters to fight, and new abilities and equipment to acquire. </p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-64">Mario Kart 64</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mario Kart 64 is a cart-racing game and the second installment in the series. It was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 and eventually became the second-best-selling game on the platform. The gameplay is broadly similar to other games in the series, where you choose one of 8 Mario franchise characters to race across the game’s 20 courses inspired by areas in Super Mario games. Players also get special abilities and power-ups that are unique to the Super Mario series. </p>

The Power Glove was ambitious, impressive, even important — one of the very first mainstream devices that let you control a game using your body instead of just your thumbs — but it was not good. In some ways, its not-good-ness is a key part of the story.</p><p>The Power Glove showed up in the late 1980s, at a complicated time for the gaming industry, when Nintendo was a hugely powerful force for the future of fun. But the Power Glove wasn’t really even a Nintendo product. It started as a research lark, became a toy, and only wound up with Nintendo’s name on it after a particularly fateful pitch meeting. Thanks to a remarkable marketing campaign, and the feeling that VR often gives of simply being <em>the future</em>, the Power Glove wound up a reasonable (if brief) business success. And you can draw a line from the Glove to some other hugely successful Nintendo products — and maybe even to the whole VR industry as we know it.</p><p>On <a href="https://pod.link/1840983742">this episode of <em>Version History</em></a>, our chat show about old technology, we dig into the story of the Power Glove. It is, somehow, both very brief and very long. David Pierce, <em><a href="http://www.fandom.com/">Fandom’</a></em>s Chris Grant, and <em><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File</a></em>’s Stephen Totilo explore the projects that led to the Power Glove, the many (<em>many) </em>reasons it wasn’t a very good product, and the ways in which it changed the future anyway. They also attempt to set up a decades-old Glove and play games with it, which goes… poorly.</p><p>If you want to subscribe to <em>Version History, </em>there are two ways to get every episode as soon as it drops:</p><p>And if you want to know more about the Power Glove, whether you got to try it or not, here are some links to get you started:</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mjc0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>David Pierce</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/podcast/850556/nintendo-power-glove-version-history]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="67052f9093ea2"><a title="The Hundred Line 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67052f9093ea2/the-hundred-line-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Aniplex / XSEED Games</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Over the holiday season, we're republishing some of the best articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors from</em> <em><a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025">2025</a></em><em>. This article was originally published in May. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This article delves into spoiler territory for The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy. If you've yet to play the game and want to go in blind, we recommend you come back at another time...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not a fan of tactical RPGs… is what I would have told you before I played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. Heck, I’m still not sure I would call myself a 'fan' of the genre, necessarily; one game perhaps isn’t enough to sway me <em>that</em> much. The Hundred Line, though..? Yeah, I’m a fan of The Hundred Line.</p>
<p>In fact, it's easily my Game of the Year so far, and even with the Switch 2 on the horizon, it’s going to take something truly special to usurp its throne. Mitch gave it an 'Excellent' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">9/10 in our review</a>, but what he didn’t cover – what he <em>couldn’t</em> cover without spoiling anything – is just how ridiculously ambitious Too Kyo Games’ visual novel / tactical RPG hybrid really is.</p>
<p>So, if you’re sensitive about spoilers and want to go into this one completely fresh, consider this your last warning. We’re going in, folks.</p>

<p>Before I waltz headfirst into what is undoubtedly The Big Twist™, I want to first look at the wonderful cast of characters. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danganronpa_decadence">Danganronpa</a> before it, the entire premise of The Hundred Line — survive and protect your school against invaders over the course of one hundred days — would have crashed and burned were it not for the likes of Takumi Sumino, Darumi Amemiya, Shouma Ginzaki, Nozomi Kirifuji, and the rest of those loveable goofballs.</p>
<p>Character work is truly where directors Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi shine brightest. They managed to make every member of the 'Special Defense Unit' completely unique and special in their own way.</p>
<p>Take Tsubasa Kawana, for instance. Whenever she’s placed in a stressful situation, she immediately feels nauseous, and it makes for some wonderful comedic relief. I lost count of the number of times I giggled whenever the story took a dark turn, and the camera switched over to Tsubasa loudly dry heaving.</p>
<p>In addition to the comic relief, however, we also learn a lot about Tsubasa’s background, including her passion for machinery fostered by fixing cars with her grandfather as a child. We get similar deep dives into every character, to the point where we begin to understand the potential causes behind their various quirks. Even total prats like Ima Tsukumo, whose obsessive devotion to his ‘Dear Sister’ Kako proves deeply concerning, gets his own moment of redemption through both his backstory and the way the plot progresses.</p>
<p>By the time I reached the credits, I really didn’t want the game to end. I’d grown to love these characters, and a couple of significant losses actually brought a tear to my eye during the final stages; something that no game before it has accomplished. Couldn’t I just keep going? Just for a bit..?</p>
<p>Well, here’s the thing: it didn’t end.</p>
<p>When you reach the last couple of days in the basic hundred-day timeline, you learn that through powers gained via absorption of your enemies, protagonist Takumi can actually go back in time to day one and re-do the whole thing again. Only this time, you’re free to make significant changes to the story and work your way toward one of a potential hundred different endings. <em>Whoa</em> – hold my beer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier Automata</a>!</p>
<figure data-uuid="c8e60d5045326"><a title="The Hundred Line 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8e60d5045326/the-hundred-line-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Aniplex / XSEED Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know what you’re probably thinking, and no, you don’t have to play through the <em>entire</em> game a hundred times. Effectively, the story can branch off into several different paths, each of which has a number of potential endings, and the game even gives you the ability to jump back to specific days in order to change your decisions and alter the story’s path.</p>
<p>Some endings may be exceedingly short, others a bit lengthier… some good, and some <em>very</em> bad. One might see you become the villain of the story, while another may conclude with the adorably loyal samurai Kyoshika Magadori being devoured by your zombified friends. The variety of avenues is simply absurd, and discovering each one is a joy.</p>
<p>These are just a couple of the more, shall we say, ‘insignificant’ possible endings. I won’t go into those which might actually spoil the overarching plot; even if you’re still with me at this point, I’d like you to enjoy The Hundred Line’s story on your own terms. It’s safe to say, however, that the run through those initial one hundred days could definitely be considered a ‘prologue’, even though it comfortably stands as a compelling story in its own right with a beginning, middle, and end.</p>

<p>So you can definitely stop there and have a grand ol’ time, but if you’re looking for something a bit more ambitious — something that throws the rulebook out of the window — I’d encourage you to keep going and see exactly what The Hundred Line has up its sleeve. It’s simply magnificent.</p>
<p>There are so many reasons why I love this game. I love figuring out what to do during ‘free time’ sessions in which you can either chat to your fellow students, venture out into the world in a board-game-inspired minigame of sorts, or dive straight into a few battle simulations to potentially upgrade your abilities.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise for me, however, was how much I loved the battle system itself. As I mentioned at the start, I’m normally not one for tactical RPGs, but The Hundred Line’s turn-based structure just works so well. I often get overwhelmed when it comes to deciding how to approach tactical gameplay: how do these characters function? Why can’t I move more than two spaces? Just what the heck do I <em>do</em>?</p>
<p>The Hundred Line made it easy, though, and it’s once again thanks to the remarkably unique and diverse cast. Their artistic design makes it easy to distinguish one from another, and it only took a couple of battles until I memorised their strengths and weaknesses, along with how their attacks play out on the field of battle. It got to the point where, after a handful of quiet days full of ‘free time’, the warbling alarm to signify an incoming battle filled me with excitement.</p>

<p>Most of the battles felt doable and I never felt completely helpless against the hordes of invaders, but there were still a few that I managed to botch straight away and lose within just a few minutes. In those instances, the game gives you the option to redo the battle with significant boosts to your manpower, instantly giving you 300% 'voltage' (which essentially gives you three uses of your extra-powerful special attacks) and refilling your squad's health. Is it cheating? Sure, I <em>guess</em>... But it also makes the game significantly more approachable for tactical newcomers like myself.</p>
<p>I adore the Danganronpa series. I think they’re wonderful games that remain just as compelling now as they were back when they first launched, and if it weren’t for Danganronpa, I don’t think The Hundred Line would even exist. I have to be honest with myself, though… The Hundred Line is better. It’s a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Co-director Kazutaka Kodaka has <a href="https://x.com/kazkodaka/status/1921370017678946504">recently confirmed</a> that the game is "selling well", but I still feel like not enough people are talking about it. I suspect, however, that as the years go by and more people play it through word of mouth, it’ll go down as one of the greatest visual novels of all time. There’s simply nothing else quite like it.</p>

            <guid>1393381</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The upcoming live-action adaptation of Sleeping Dogs has found its director. As of now, the film is set to star Shang-Chi actor Simu Liu as Wei Shen with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-film-script-simu-liu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a script complete</a>.</p>



<p>Released in 2012, Sleeping Dogs has become quite the cult classic. Following an undercover Hong Kong police officer, players explore an open world with parkour abilities and martial arts. Despite earning positive reviews, low sales led to the series being dead in the water. </p>



<p>However, Hollywood has gotten its hands on it, now reinvigorated by MCU’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-adaptation-and-sequel-mentioned-by-simu-liu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shang-Chi actor Simu Liu</a>, who’ll star as protagonist Wei Shen. A script was revealed to be complete for the project earlier in the year, but it was unknown where it would lead. Now, an up-and-coming action film director is about to take on the long-awaited adaptation.</p>







<h2 id="h-timo-tjahjanto-to-direct-sleeping-dogs-starring-mcu-s-simu-liu">Timo Tjahjanto&nbsp;to Direct Sleeping Dogs, Starring MCU’s Simu Liu</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/2005248803172135343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simu Liu</a> on Twitter, it has been confirmed that Timo Tjahjanto&nbsp;will direct Sleeping Dogs. The Indonesian director has&nbsp;done a few films but is just starting to get onto bigger projects. His latest movie, Nobody 2, was a worthy follow-up to the 2021 Bob Odenkirk action flick. He is also attached to direct the sequel to the Jason Statham-led project, The Beekeeper, and a possible Hollywood sequel to <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/new-lines-train-to-busan-timo-tjahjanto-1234696403/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Train to Busan</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Timo Tjahjanto has been an advocate for Sleeping Dogs to hit the big screens for a while. In response to Simu Liu’s post on the game’s lack of movement anywhere, the director <a href="https://x.com/Timobros/status/1885391495785832519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explains its biggest problem</a> was a lack of understanding from executives. When asked about directing the film adaptation, he sent a smiling gif, which has aged incredibly well given today’s news.</p>



<p>The film has yet to acquire a studio or a release date. Still, with a director, writer, script, and Marvel actor at the forefront, it may not be long before one is revealed. Sleeping Dogs has been a work-in-progress in Hollywood, as previous attempts didn’t pan out. Legendary action star Donnie Yen (Rogue One, John Wick: Chapter 4), was attached to play Wei Shen, but it never came around. Hopefully, the film will see the light of day and Sleeping Dogs can get the love it deserves.</p>







<p>What do you think of the director of Sleeping Dogs? Think Timo Tjahjanto is a good pick? Seen any of his films? Do you think Sleeping Dogs will make for a good Hollywood film?

<figure data-uuid="91f8c5b23e954"><a title="A giant Bob-omb" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91f8c5b23e954/a-giant-bob-omb.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Over the holiday season, we're republishing some of the best articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors from</em> <em><a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025">2025</a></em><em>. This article was originally published in May.</em></p>
<p><em>We should note that the Giant Bomb story had a happy ending, with the staff buying GB from Fandom and going independent. Yes! Nevertheless, in another turbulent year for the games industry and the media covering it, it's more important than ever to support the work you love...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Well, we've come to the end of a week that's seen the end of two gaming institutions as we've known them for many years.</p>
<p>The departure of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danryckert.com">Dan Ryckert</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf">Jeff Grubb</a> from Giant Bomb <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-fandom-dan-ryckert-jeff-grubb-gerstmann-1851778728">on Thursday</a> was swiftly followed by <a href="https://kotaku.com/polygon-sold-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-digital-gaming-1851778655">news of layoffs</a> at Polygon following the site's sale to Valnet (owner of Screen Rant). Seeing these top-tier creators and games journalists unceremoniously cast aside has been a shock for anybody who's followed and enjoyed their work over the years.</p>
<p>Except it hasn't really, has it? The layoffs in games and games media have become so commonplace that it doesn't come as a surprise anymore to see gaming institutions crumble around us - it's just another week in the industry.</p>
<p>We're a month away from a new Nintendo console launch — something we've been waiting for for so long — and yet many of the critic voices fans are most keen to hear have been de-platformed this week in circumstances that leave us, if not surprised, then thoroughly depressed and dumbfounded by the decisions taken by management at Fandom and Valnet.</p>

<p>Whether you've been an avid Giant Bomb fan since the original Gerstmann/Davis days, jumped on board in the mid-2010s, or are a more recent convert, the Giant Bombcast (and Beastcast for a good spell there) has been a fixture of many a gamer's week since starting in 2008, even if you never watched a single GB video. The podcast's radio-style warmth and informed-but-informal tone set the template for many a gaming podcast in the following years, and epic, multi-hour Game of the Year episodes became yearly traditions for listeners to look forward to and savour.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vinnycaravella.bsky.social">Vinny</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bradshoemaker.bsky.social">Brad</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alexnavarro.bsky.social">Alex</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffgerstmann.com">Jeff</a>'s respective departures across 2021/22 might have felt like the last straws, but Fandom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/giantbomb/comments/1kaziyh/giant_bombcast_888_thrive_from_neglect/?rdt=42262">pulling down episode #888</a> feels like the definitive end of an era.</p>
<p>Then there's Valnet's acquisition of Polygon and the subsequent layoffs. It feels like a tentpole of modern games media falling. For over 12 years, the site's writers have consistently put out some of the best articles in the space, so the talent being thrown away with this round of layoffs is confounding. Firing your most experienced staffers mere weeks before an important console launch suggests something about the standard of coverage these companies are interested in providing their audience, you might think.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of those voices (from Giant Bomb or Polygon, or any of the writers and creators who've suffered layoffs in recent times), remember that the vast majority are online, searchable, and — crucially — supportable. They may not be on the platform you've previously found them on for years, but they're almost certainly out there doing great work.</p>
<p>If you love that work and you're in a position to subscribe to their Patreon, fling them a few quid over Ko-Fi, or sign up as a supporter, please do so. Assuming that these sites and streams will just survive and their creators can simply jump ship to a similar gig when the iceberg looms is wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Willing but not in the financial position to send your hard-earned cash to a bunch of writers and podcasters and streamers? Hey, as anyone working in games media will tell you, it's tough out there - and there's no shortage of good causes in need of support these days. Remember, though, that just downloading and listening to podcasts on the free feeds, watching streams, and turning off adblockers on sites (like this one, for instance!) makes a big difference.</p>

<p>Our hearts go out to everyone at GB and Polygon affected this week. If you've ever enjoyed their work — or if you've never heard of them and you're wondering what all the fuss is about — seek them out and, if you're able, support them in their other endeavours, old and new.</p>
<p>And remember to be liberal with praise and support of the sites you love, and their creators.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-insider-gaming-community-2025-indie-game-of-the-year/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Indie games don’t all fit into the same box anymore. Some are made by small teams taking big creative swings, while others come from well-funded studios operating outside the traditional AAA system. What ties them together isn’t budget, but identity—games built around a clear vision, willing to do things differently, and often unafraid to take risks.</p>



<p>That range was on full display in the Insider Gaming community’s Indie Game of the Year poll, which featured everything from long-awaited sequels to experimental standouts. And when the votes were counted, one title ultimately rose to the top as Hollow Knight: Silksong was voted as the 2025 Indie Game of the Year.</p>







<p>The long-awaited sequel finished first with 21.7% of the vote, just beating out Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s and Dispatch’s 18.9%. Other games in the running were Ball x Pit (8.5%), Peak (7.5%), Hades 2 (7.5%), Absolum (6.6%), Blue Prince (5.7%), and Schedule I (4.7%). </p>



<p>What makes Silksong’s win stand out is the anticipation for it seemingly paid off upon release, with the game receiving acclaim from players far and wide. But in the end, the results reflect what makes the indie scene so compelling. There’s no single formula for success, only games that connect with players in different ways. This year, the Insider Gaming community made it clear that Hollow Knight: Silksong stood just a bit taller than the rest.</p>

<figure data-uuid="53414771838c6"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53414771838c6/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I must have some kind of record for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ring_fit_adventure">Ring Fit</a>, if not internationally (see: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/players-are-pushing-their-bodies-to-the-limit-speedrunning-nintendos-fitness-game/">here</a>), then at least for the West Midlands. I played 10 hours over the weekend, which probably sounds like a lot. I can confirm it was.</p>
<p>You know those charity fundraisers of dancing for 24 hours or whatever? It wasn't that. All I raised was my knees (a lot), the Ring (nearly as much), and my cat towards the ring to try and get it to jump through (once, he didn't).</p>
<p>But I fancied an excuse to finally dust off my file and finish it before 2025 was up, and so pitched this article and then realised last week just how <em>much</em> adventure there was still left to be had.</p>
<p>It’s been genuinely brilliant, a great game and a gorgeous vibe to engage with and inhabit for a bit. Here's some notes, only <em>some</em> of which can be attributed to the Stockholm Syndrome of largely running on the spot for six hours:</p>
<h2><strong>1) Ring Fit is one of Nintendo's most beautiful games ever</strong></h2>

<p>I am not just dehydrated and delirious, and yes, I <em>have</em> played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Yoshi’s Island</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> (I love Mario Kart World).</p>
<p>But Ring Fit’s colour is something else, verdant fields of wind-rippled grass with peach-pink pom pom trees, azure rivers, and dandelion showers with every ring squeeze. Sometimes a level is gilded in sunset gold, sometimes thick with mist. And all this with a sort of robust, pastel creaminess - like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_skyward_sword_hd">Skyward Sword</a> set to Vivid.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if it’s just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">bokeh</a> or also the field of view or something that gives it such an open-air sense of stretching scope, but I know that just loading it up feels like adventure.</p>
<h2><strong>2) Its linearity is brilliant and the jump is brilliant-er</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="d87b2ea902df5"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d87b2ea902df5/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>No one wants to go to the gym with that blank-page vagueness of what to work out today, pootling around the machines and then just deciding to do another ‘whole body’ session that starts with press-ups again. Clear direction is movement is progress. And in Ring Fit there’s always a direction, and that direction is forward.</p>
<p>Sure, there is a bit of back-tracking for items and some branching world routes, but nothing to bend the vector of <em>onward</em>. And each level is gloriously on-rails, the landscape expansive but the path laid out, with enough analogue interactivity in the moving and jumping to add swing in the tempo.</p>
<p>But it’s also a bit Sonic with its upper/lower level tiers, and suddenly seeing a gap in the bridge and hastily puffing the Ring-Con just so to get enough thruster-boost to casually flip across is so gratifying, I’d add it to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/jump-man-a-celebration-of-the-greatest-jumps-in-gaming">best video game jumps</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>3) The writing is classic understated Nintendo</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="8bc7e9a0c1416"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8bc7e9a0c1416/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For an RPG it’s quite Ring Thrifty, focusing mainly on modelling enemies and boss-baddies and the charming couple who work in the shop (big fan of the wife’s criss-cross tights being made of tape measure).</p>
<p>The rest of the interactions are via low-stakes text window drama with NPCs drawn in that unique angular way. But within this you get a Robot World in which people speak in Binary (‘WANWANOH’), a sub-plot about a cyborg girl with literally Steel-y Buns and all sorts of other exchanges that don’t really add any real drama, but accent the whole game in lovely upbeat charm.</p>
<h2><strong>4)</strong> <strong><em>My sweat is so shiny and beautiful!</em></strong></h2>

<p>I know this because my (female-voiced, actually kind of endearing) Ring would say it at the end of some levels, which was quite uncanny. I am well known for my shiny sweat, after all.</p>
<p>But if you go straight downstairs without slapping on the roll-on before a marathon session you <em>may</em> start to get that acrid tang of old sweat, occasionally inducing a bin-juice wince. It was at about four hours in that I dreaded my own arm lifts.</p>
<h2><strong>5) Losing calories is gaining something else</strong></h2>

<p>People play games for different things, but I am particularly partial to movement. There is so much joy to be had in the compression of motion to fingers and thumbs, detaching it from actual body work to use it like a colour in a designer's palette.</p>
<p>And yet even when burning calories by playing Ring Fit, there was something wholesome in the exertion, something evolutionary endorphinous (this is not a word) and replenishing. It certainly offsets that slight feeling of ennui that can follow a 2am game binge finish. Call it evolutionary wiring, call it Protestant work ethic, but an arduous boss fight against Dragaux combined with actual physical ardour has a lovely back-patting richness.</p>
<p>As did my sugary chai midway through the day.</p>
<h2><strong>6) The boss level music is epic and might not even be the best</strong></h2>

<p>I actually bought the game at release because I heard the main menu <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2k_WlpG7zw">music</a> linked to on a forum. I’d thought the game looked a bit silly and on-the-nose, with its literal <em>abs-as-shield</em> and floating spirit feet for leg exercises and so on. But the reviews had intrigued me, then hearing that bright, poppy, electro-optimism sealed the deal.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:92778 @ 1766953623 -->
<p>I’m also partial to the cooldown music, and the calm voice of the lady who guides it, which is basically part of the texture. And the brass-blare when you do the victory pose sounds like <strong>Walking On Sunshine</strong>. And the winter level theme is great.</p>
<p><em>But!</em> The chord sequence in the Drageux boss levels is epic and rousing and I can feel that slight lift in the legs and straightening of the back, living up to the showdown music, slightly revived by the drama.</p>
<h2><strong>7) Cats truly give no Ring Fits</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="abce21262bc58"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/abce21262bc58/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both were pretty good at not getting kicked by my flailing legs or whatever. But like I said my idea of Cat-Crufts instincts kicking in and them jumping through the Ring with nonchalant grace did not come true.</p>
<h2><strong>8) The UI is a treat to navigate</strong></h2>
<p>At Hour Five on Day Two I really appreciated this, splayed on the sofa and treating myself to a bit of RPG house-keeping: clicking across skill-point menus and flitting between worlds with pleasing speed; hearing the different harmonized tones as you <em>boop</em> across the main menu creating an impromptu remix; growing to like the the weirdly literal use of the actual box as the icon for the main adventure because everything has such a pleasant, player-forward vibe.</p>
<p>This is UI design as encouraging as a personal trainer, and then the California summer pastel and bossa-nova lilt of the smoothie-squeezing is a menu vibe you could book a holiday in.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b6f9f8f430758"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6f9f8f430758/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But! This is all emboldened by:</p>
<h2><strong>9) The</strong> <strong><em>happiest</em></strong> <strong>of haptics</strong></h2>
<p>Seriously, the HD rumble deserves its own review, especially finding sweet spots of position and feeling that tremble of confirmation through the joy-cons, like Will finding areas of thickened air for his Subtle Knife.</p>
<p>I might be overstating this, but it really is one of the most pleasing uses of tactile affirmation in games.<br>
Anyway.</p>
<h2><strong>10) Every time I run or go to the gym, I vaguely intend to do some mobility but never do</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="2d75d3ac19e49"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2d75d3ac19e49/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All the podcasts go on about it. My brother can squat like a 3-year-old making a sandcastle. But years go by and I still have the flexibility of a parking bollard.</p>
<p>But Ring Fit forces me to stand like a tree to bamboozle dangerous flying insect enemies (this is presumably not a transferable skill) and doesn’t give my girl that super-saiyan magnesium-burn hair of feedback unless I squat to the limits of my groin, now done so much that I’m converted or at least recalibrated.</p>
<h2><strong>11) Minigames Max fun</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="512b628b1ba1b"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/512b628b1ba1b/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seriously, these are the best minigames since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_monkey_ball">Super Monkey Ball</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/super_mario_64_ds">Super Mario 64 DS</a> (shoutout to Astrolander in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_2">Timesplitters 2</a>, the best of all time).</p>
<p>Robo-Wrecker is a brilliant circular Whack-A-Mole, and Squattery Wheel sounds like the best kind of pun-first fun. In general there’s an old-school sense of kitchen-sink generosity from an era before the crutch of updates and patches, and with a one-chance exhaustive imagination of there never again being a chance to use this Ring Fit controller.</p>
<h2><strong>12) (Like this article) It is</strong> <strong><em>shockingly</em></strong> <strong>long</strong></h2>

<p>So I had to strategise.</p>
<p>I had done about 14 worlds after my first, ambling, intermittent half-decade with the game. 40-odd hours according to the Switch timer (which included a good amount of messing about with minigames and that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/splatoon">Splatoon</a> banger in the rhythm game). When I looked it up and found out there were 23 (!) worlds, I was impressed and a bit <em>uh-oh</em>..</p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that my previous random machismo choice to do everything at level 30 was not going to fly. Even at level 24, the amount of reps-per-battle was formidable.</p>
<p>So I put it down to level 1, which reduced the reps per exercise in battles and the time for long-holds. But there’s still a world to be traversed, a certain amount of paths to be jogged, sprinted, mud-trudged, high-kneed, canoe-rowed and flown across.</p>
<p>This gave things a meta-layer of strategy. Choosing to re-run levels with those rare persimmons (what a word!) to make a smoothie that would Double EXP to deploy only in a boss battle or prolonged battle arena. Or forcing me to sell precious gems like phosphophyllite (what a word!) to make enough money to unlock three-star skills in the skill tree like my beloved Russian Twist (level 3!).</p>
<p>The point is, sometimes you need an excuse to engage, and speed-rushing Ring Fit was a blast that made me lean into the game systems more than I had before.</p>
<h2><strong>13) It's been a lovely send-off for Switch 1 and for the year</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="92cd7845ebbcf"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/92cd7845ebbcf/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Will there ever be a Ring Fit 2? I hope so, but am not confident. I had to bring out the OG Switch again to charge its rail track Joy-Con for the controller, surprised at the suddenly slightly hazy 1080p of the homescreen on my TV.</p>
<p>Will I ever use my Switch 1 for anything else? Again, I’m not sure - my Switch 2 can do most things better. But it can’t do Ring Fit without those old Joy-Con, and now I’m chuffed to have actually finished it. What else can I do with the right excuse?</p>
<p>Let’s go, 2026.</p>

<p>Sports games in 2025 were a mixed bag for some fans. But standing out in a crowd of less-than-impressive titles were games that provided both the enjoyable gameplay and depth that fans look for from their sports titles. Insider Gaming has a team that has played as many sports games as possible throughout the year, and it’s been narrowed down to find the best sports game of 2025.</p>



<p>From a multiplayer soccer game to a remaster of a classic, these are games the games that keep you immersed in one way or another to the point you don’t want to put them down.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.net/visit/rematch-pc-loaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rematch</a> offers one of the freshest takes on soccer in years by embracing fast, chaotic, arcade-style action instead of pure realism. With no fouls, no offsides, and constant play, matches are all about momentum and creativity, perfect for players who want quick, high-energy sessions rather than slow build-up play.</p>

Rematch earns its spot as the best sports game for 2025 because it brings something genuinely different to the genre: a fun, accessible football experience that emphasizes excitement over simulation.</p>

<section><p>Donkey Kong Bananza makes Nintendo’s platforming formula louder and more chaotic.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Drop into the lagoon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/" data-ref-id="1900-6418382">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Sure, you need to chase Void Kong to the Earth's center to save the day, but maybe you just want to soak in some water-adjacent locales as you explore this new world beneath the surface. There are plenty of secrets tucked away in each level's hidden crevices. When you first hop in there is really only one thing to do: pick a direction and start smashing.</p><p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza takes Nintendo's hallmark sandbox exploration and pushes it somewhere the studio rarely goes--pure chaos. Bananza is not interested in the kind of precision platforming that defines Mario's visits to Peach's Castle, <a href="https://egmnow.com/super-mario-sunshine-is-nintendo-at-its-most-nintendo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Delfino Plaza</a>, or outer space. It captures that same cheerful vibe, but lets players rip through it.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a long-running design idea at Nintendo that movement should feel good on its own. Shigeru Miyamoto once said he wanted players to enjoy moving Mario around an empty room. The reason Mario is so fun to control in Super Mario 64 is that Miyamoto and the small team behind the N64 classic spent months making sure he felt great to play, even if the only action possible was running around an empty space.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625299-3744521-605064-super-mario-sunshine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625299" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625299-3744521-605064-super-mario-sunshine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625299"></a><figcaption>Delfino Plaza from Super Mario Sunshine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625299-3744521-605064-super-mario-sunshine.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Combine that movement philosophy with tightly designed playgrounds and you get moments players never forget. There is nothing quite like triple hopping across the center square of Delfino Plaza, bouncing off an umbrella, and sliding into a chimney chute to grab a blue coin. It was fun just to jump around, which naturally encouraged exploration, which created a quick dopamine hit when a secret Shine Sprite appeared and the day literally got brighter.</p><p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza taps into that same feeling, but in an entirely different way. I am not guiding Donkey Kong across rooftops with three perfect hops. I am plowing through debris, carving my own path, and uncovering collectible-packed caverns. It becomes easy to wander off the main objective and start exploring every crack and crevice of the planet's inner layers.</p><p dir="ltr">Platforming has always been a pillar of Nintendo design. Mario, Kirby, and Donkey Kong, along with other Nintendo icons, all focus on exploration through running, jumping, and a bit of flair. Donkey Kong Bananza keeps the flair, but adds a hefty serving of smash. It feels authentic because chaos is exactly what you expect from a rambunctious gorilla.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625302-img_7926.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625302" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625302-img_7926.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625302"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong is naturally destructive, according to Nintendo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625302-img_7926.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has said before that playing as Donkey Kong should feel like an adventure through untamed spaces. Bananza producer Kenta Motokura echoed that idea in an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/?srsltid=AfmBOor5sKztcvT26_YMzI7y4OoXPoVNOSixNBQsaF6Qp3yvfzbIz4py">interview</a>, saying that with the goal of defining what 3D Donkey Kong should be and highlighting his strengths and new actions, the team felt the concept of destruction was the right fit.</p><p dir="ltr">In the end, Bananza succeeds because it embraces exactly what makes Donkey Kong special. It is loud, messy, and endlessly fun. The thrill is not just in reaching the core. It is in everything you smash, discover, and carve through along the way.</p>

            <guid>1393273</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In this new era of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/column/781303/microsoft-sony-playstation-xbox-future-of-gaming-console">console… inclusivity</a>? driven by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox">Sony</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/809053/halo-playstation-xbox-multiplatform-strategy">mostly Microsoft</a> bringing their exclusives to other platforms, it’s getting harder to highlight games that make a singular console shine. Indeed, the top-performing games year after year on both PlayStation and Xbox are multiplatform releases, and often the best games of the year, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/843340/clair-obscur-expedition-33-wins-game-of-the-year">2025 GOTY winner</a> <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837245/expedition-33-was-the-most-popular-third-party-game-on-game-pass-this-year-rightly-so">similarly launch on most everything</a>. (Once again, like in all things, Nintendo is the exception.)</p><p>But while lists like this will probably disappear as we get deeper into the era of everything being an Xbox, Sony still seems committed to high-quality exclusives. Here are its best of 2025.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="playstation-portal"><h2>PlayStation Portal</h2></p></div><p>As software exclusivity goes the way of Sega’s console business, console makers have other ways to attract consumers to their part of the video game ecosystem. For Microsoft, it’s Game Pass; for Sony in 2025, it’s the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">PlayStation Portal</a>. This year, Sony launched an update for the Portal that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814078/playstation-portal-ps5-cloud-streaming">enables cloud streaming</a> and making the device a must-have for PlayStation households. For $200, roughly half the price of a PS5, you essentially get a second one, able to play select games without the need to stream them from the console. The list of streamable games isn’t comprehensive, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/?emcid=pa-co-520646&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23305322396&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADc1uAa13odx4s8g3Bv1DboYIZ4Jc&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAo4TKBhDRARIsAGW29bf29vmveeci1sumQ-msyBQVI9oAT46bbjbhcjL5CHQlLVoyrOEre4caAuMnEALw_wcB">but there are over 2,000 of them</a>, and the ability to play them on the go is a literal game changer.</p><p>Get into a discussion with true <em>Final Fantasy</em> sickos about the top 10 games in the franchise, and you better have a lot of time and earplugs on your hands as everyone debates entries two through 10 — because No. 1, invariably, is <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. Having finally played the game for the first time, taking advantage of the remaster Square Enix released this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/783944/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-review-square-enix-playstation">I get it</a>. The best video games are often timeless while also able to speak to a specific moment, and <em>Tactics</em>’ story is and does exactly that.</p><p>But more than narrative, <em>Tactics</em>’ brilliance is also in its expansive job system that grants players a facsimile of godhood that’s so much fun to wield. The arithmetician class has the ability to cast any learned spell in the game instantly and without requiring mana. To offset the class’s ruinously slow speed, pair it with white mage to create the most diabolical unit in the history of strategy RPGs. Ramza Beoulve is just a guy trying to save the world, and <em>FFT</em> made me believe he can because I made his ragtag band of misfits into walking nuclear weapons.</p><div><p id="ghost-of-yotei"><h2><strong><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></strong></h2></p></div><p>Sucker Punch’s sequel to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> plays things relatively safe. It doesn’t change things up dramatically but instead polishes the experience. Which means the experience isn’t all that different from its predecessor — that means lush landscapes to explore, lots of combat techniques to learn, and, uh, plenty of hot springs to bathe in — but everything feels more finely tuned this time around. That’s especially true of the game’s tale of revenge, which is both more gripping than the original and also gives the open-world experience some much-needed structure.</p><p>The original <em>Death Stranding</em> was so weird that half of the fun was just wrapping your head around the experience. I’m not sure I really understood it until I was almost done (if at all). The sequel is still plenty weird, but because it builds off of the previous game, it’s also much easier to understand from the get-go. It’s still a delivery simulator where you trek across a postapocalyptic landscape to get goods and people where they’re needed. But now the setting has shifted to Australia, which means there are new environmental elements to deal with — hello, sandstorms — along with a whole new cast of weirdo characters to meet, played by everyone from Elle Fanning to George Miller.</p><p>But don’t worry; the story is still as inscrutable as ever.</p><p>Bennett Foddy sure made you feel the “walking” part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/638179/baby-steps-preview-ps5-steam">this elaborate walking simulator</a>. In <em>Baby Steps</em>, your job is to walk, and you do that by controlling every move involved in taking a step, down to the fine motor details. What results is a hilarious examination of human psychology, emotional maturity, and a newfound appreciation for just how hard it is to ambulate a body with nothing more than DualSense trigger buttons.</p><p>When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/817997/lumines-arise-review-ps5-steam"><em>Lumines Arise</em></a> was first announced, I made the mistake of asking, “Oh, is it a series or something?”, unfamiliar with <em>Lumines</em>’ days as a PSP powerhouse. My elders have never let me live that down, so I thought I’d see for myself what the game is.</p><p><em>Lumines Arise</em> is<em> Evil Dr. Tetris Effect Mean Bean Machine</em>. <em>Mean Bean Machine</em> in that the game is played by globbing together matching blocks in two-by-two configurations. It’s part <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/18/18099272/tetris-effect-perfect-game-red-dead-redemption-2-modern-games-overwhelming"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a> because the game has an incredible synth / pop-house soundtrack that’s synced to the action, creating a full-body puzzle-playing experience. And evil in that the game is hard as shit. My skills as a <em>Tetris </em>player, limited though they are, just do not transfer to <em>Lumines Arise</em>. But! There is a flow state I can reach. Throughout playing, the shapes of the blocks will change from blocks, to eggs, to clocks, whatever, and I’ve found some patterns are easier to group than others. It’s interesting and fun to figure out what shapes make the game easier for me and which ones are impossible to configure.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/846828/ps5-best-games-2025]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Over the holiday season, we're republishing some of the best articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors from</em> <em><a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025">2025</a></em><em>. This article was originally published in April. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>True love lasts forever – and so do some games. <strong>Tokimeki Memorial: Forever with You</strong>, the legendary dating sim from 1995, is hooking up with Switch next month to celebrate 30 years on the scene.</p>
<p>Immaculately presented but bewilderingly complex, TokiMemo is a foundational piece of video game history that defined a whole genre, along with the increasingly universal mechanics of video game love. But for most players outside Japan, it fires nostalgia for <em>someone else</em>’s youth – and with no English release, it remains tantalisingly out of reach.</p>
<p>Its arrival is part of a bigger story. Switch has been Nintendo’s ultimate comeback kid, climbing from the Wii U stumble to contender for best-ever-selling console in eight short years. Its life has also coincided with a swell of gamers hitting mid-life nostalgia and an industry finding that bets on “new” have longer and longer odds.</p>
<p>The result? More comebacks. We’ve seen re-release after remaster after remake: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/live_a_live">Live A Live</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_shadow_of_the_templars_reforged">Broken Sword</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link’s Awakening</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration">Atari 50</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/famicom_detective_club_the_missing_heir_and_famicom_detective_club_the_girl_who_stands_behind">Famicom Detective Club</a>…. The list goes on, from niche to mega-mainstream. And now, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tokimeki_memorial_forever_with_you_emotional">Tokimeki Memorial: Forever with You – Emotional</a> is here to beam people back to CD-ROM '90s Japan.</p>

<p>Tokimeki Memorial has long been a prize of legend, at the same time unmissable and unobtainable. Revered for its groundbreaking social mechanics, emotional storytelling, intricate simulation, and (let’s face it) fascination with high school romance, it’s a seminal dating sim that remains tucked away behind a Japanese language barrier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>eBay had it at the ready and, what’s more, I had learnt a bit of Japanese. Finally, it would be mine.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Featuring writing by no less than Koji Igarashi (whose next project was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/castlevania_symphony_of_the_night">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a> – the trailblazing entry in the series he went on to produce), it’s probably as widely experienced by word of mouth and hidden-gem lists as it is firsthand. And now, with a 30th-anniversary, Japan-only Switch port, the myth gets a new lease of life for another hundred million or so to wish they could play it.</p>
<p>Even if you haven’t played Tokimemo, you’ve likely felt its notoriously far-reaching influence. If you’ve ever arranged a study date in <strong>Persona</strong>, fretted over gift-giving in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/fire_emblem_awakening">Fire Emblem</a>, or sweated a romance option in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, a short queue of commentators will tell you that Tokimeki Memorial is to thank for it.</p>
<p>And that’s why its reappearance on Switch is such a milestone: a wise old mentor is back. But does it have any more to say?</p>
<h2><strong>Down Memorial Lane</strong></h2>

<p>Like many of the luckier people during the COVID-19 lockdown, I found myself scouring eBay for retro games. Buying relics was an attempt to get my hands on something out of reach – the futile chase of nostalgia was a parallel to everyone and everything being physically inaccessible, no matter how nearby they seemed. Perhaps games in particular appealed because everything felt newly gamified by technology, from work to social interactions.</p>
<p>Whatever was behind it all, for me, the bug that bit was the original PlayStation. Specifically, I discovered that about half of the PlayStation’s 4,000-strong games catalogue was released exclusively in Japan.</p>
<p>I wanted to know what was out there.</p>
<p>One Japan-only title was Tokimeki Memorial: Forever with You, the 1995 PlayStation version of the previous year’s <strong><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/05/anniversary-dating-sim-tokimeki-memorial-turns-30">Tokimeki Memorial</a></strong> on PC Engine. I think I half-remembered it from magazines as a kid, import reviews, or forum threads. That faint recollection of it sent my heart racing with wistful frustration, as Konami would surely never bring it to English-language audiences. But now, eBay had it at the ready and, what’s more, I had learnt a bit of Japanese. Finally, it would be mine.</p>
<p>However, when I navigated Tokimeki Memorial’s menus and carefully picked through its layers of dialogue, moving my lips as I read, I quickly discovered that while I was over the language barrier, the gameplay itself was a labyrinth of hidden rules and secret look-up tables that left me feeling impressed, overwhelmed, and really quite stupid. With bungling date etiquette, forgetting homework, and panicking through stingily one-and-done sports day events, I couldn’t really object when the humiliating 'loser' ending rolled after my first three-year stint at Kirameki High.</p>

<p>Even once I had got the hang of things and a girl confessed her love for me beneath the school’s tree of legend, where true love is destined to last forever, things were far from over. Beaming through the fog of digital teenagerhood is Shiori Fujisaki, the elusive, red-haired cover-girl-slash-final-boss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She’s inhumanly perfect, the Terminator of high school crushes</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Shiori demands perfection. Achieving the intricate mathematical balance of smarts, fitness, and popularity, wisely selecting your character’s blood type, avoiding rumour bombs from the other girls, and winning the three-legged race — all in one attempt — is like threading a needle on a bucking bronco.</p>
<p>Shiori smiles and blushes, then just stares matter-of-factly at you with these astronomical expectations, like a fairground automaton waiting for you to insert a coin. She’s inhumanly perfect, the Terminator of high school crushes – teasingly close to being won over, only for rejection’s charred endoskeleton to crawl out of the tanker explosion of your teenage affections.</p>
<p>As chance would have it, just as my fascination with the game took off, gaming celebrity Tim Rogers released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb-DtICmPTY">a six-hour Action Button video review of Tokimeki Memorial</a>, including two complete, translated playthroughs. His bottom line: <em>“Tokimeki Memorial objectifies love.”</em> He declared it a true cyberpunk artefact and deftly squelched any question of the propriety of high school dating simulation through comparison with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mortal_kombat_11">Mortal Kombat</a> fatalities. Quickly racking up a million views, hype for the OG dating sim hit a new peak.</p>

<p>This buzz no doubt spurred on the completion of a fan translation of the (non-voice-acted) Super Famicom version. Brilliant as this was, Rogers dismissed it in an email to <a href="https://kotaku.com/tokimeki-memorial-english-translation-konami-snes-plays-1848525789">Kotaku</a> as “like watching a movie for the first time with the TV muted and two lines of subtitles displaying both the movie’s dialogue and the director’s commentary […] while waiting for your laundry to finish.”</p>
<p>Playing without voice acting probably does deaden the heart-thumping impact of a confession of love, or the humiliation of a post-date brush-off condescendingly delivered. But you can’t help but feel that even a full localisation with English voices would be somehow inadequate for this ultimate connoisseur, locking the game permanently into “you had to be there” territory.</p>
<p>You had to be there and you weren’t: this is a must-play game that you can’t play.</p>
<h2><strong>Modern Love</strong></h2>
<p>So what now, with the Switch hosting this revival? It’s on the Japanese eShop and importable, but will that actually bring it any closer to the average player?</p>
<p>Well, one of Nintendo’s specialisms is to give you something to hold in your hands — from hanafuda cards to toys like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_live_home_circuit">Mario Kart Live</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_01_variety_kit">Labo</a> — not just platform-agnostic software distributed digitally. Its dominance in handheld gaming is a big part of that, and placing TokiMemo in your hands on a nice big screen is not to be underestimated.</p>

<p>If there is one hint of international accessibility, it’s that you will be able to choose updated text, giving you higher-resolution kanji over the occasionally inscrutable clumps of pixels in earlier versions. Thankfully, this can be applied separately from the updated artwork, which at first glance makes the game look like one of its many modern descendants. The girls will say your name now, too, so that’s one word you can definitely understand.</p>
<p>Tokimeki Memorial: Forever With You – Emotional is more than a dating sim – it’s a time capsule from an era where gamified social interactions were new ground. Now, games are full of socialising, and socialising is equally full of games, from lockdown hang-outs in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">New Horizons</a> to social media numbers going up, to just swiping right. Forever With You’s debut on Switch feels like a love letter still undeliverable after 30 years, an emblem of the persistent allure of unreachable classics, and yet now, maybe, a blip on the radar of an enormous global player base.</p>
<p>Some things will always be just out of reach, but nostalgia is the true love that lasts forever. If you’ve ever felt the pull of retro collecting or the urge to relive youth — even someone else’s — this release is a call to reminisce, rediscover things, and perhaps even to try decoding one of gaming’s most mythologised puzzles for yourself.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[7 Biggest ARC Raiders Features We Want in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/7-biggest-arc-raiders-features-we-want-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1393246</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is one of the biggest games of 2025 by far, boasting a massive player base, a stunning delivery, and the promise of plenty more content to come. It’s an electrifying extraction adventure that millions of people have bought into, and it’s challenging the likes of Escape from Tarkov with<strong> ease</strong>.</p>



<p>However, regardless of how good ARC Raiders is, there are still plenty of features players want to see added in 2026. What follows below are the <strong>7 </strong>features that we want to see added to ARC Raiders in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-7-arc-raiders-changes-we-want-to-see">7 ARC Raiders Changes We Want to See</h2>



<h3 id="h-pve-servers-or-modes">PvE Servers or Modes</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fighting other players in ARC Raiders is a core part of the central gameplay experience, but it would be nice if there were also a PvE-exclusive mode or server selection that users could jump into to have an ‘easier ride’. For some, PvP is too punishing and stressful, and it would be great if Embark Studios could accommodate those players with their own ‘ecosystem’.</p>



<p>If Escape from Tarkov can muster up a PvE mode, then ARC Raiders should be able to do it too.</p>



<h3 id="h-better-outfit-customization">Better Outfit Customization</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders has a stunning array of outfits, but they’re just that, <strong>outfits</strong>. It would be brilliant if players could cherry-pick parts of outfits to equip on their character, rather than throwing on something whole and mostly static. What if I love the helmet on one outfit but think it would go better with a jacket on another outfit?</p>



<p>It would likely be hard to implement as the outfits are intricately designed one by one, but some kind of transmog feature in ARC Raiders would be great.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-maps">New Maps</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is an obvious one, but we want to see more maps in ARC Raiders in 2026. The game has a neat assortment of maps already, but there’s a world of potential out there. It’s a known fact that Embark Studios plans to add plenty more, but it’s not just about getting new maps; it’s about getting <strong>quality maps </strong>that are a wonder to explore.</p>



<p>The first new map, released in November 2025, was Stella Montis, and it proved to be a die-hard PvP map with tight quarters and narrow sightlines.</p>



<h3 id="h-item-insurance">Item Insurance</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In some extraction games, <strong>item insurance </strong>is a core mechanic that allows you to recoup some losses when you’re killed in action. In ARC Raiders, that’s not a feature. If you die in the field, your equipment will be lost forever. The only difference to that rule is when you’re killed by a cheater, Embark Studios will refund your equipment.</p>



<p>If they can do it for cheaters, then surely they can implement a mechanic that allows users to insure their items, so if they die in a raid, they get their loadout back after a few hours.</p>



<h3 id="h-less-punishing-stamina-mechanics">Less Punishing Stamina Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The stamina mechanics in ARC Raiders are a bane for many players. They’re too strict in many ways, and when your stamina bar empties while you’re running away from an engagement, you’ll find that you almost stop dead on the spot, unable to move. In a desperate situation, it’s far too unrealistic, and it leaves players feeling frustrated quite often.</p>



<p>Even when you’ve maximized your stamina-focused skill points, it still feels as though your stamina bar empties too quickly. Better stamina mechanics would make for a new feature in ARC Raiders in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-expedition-adjustments">Expedition Adjustments</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Expedition Project is the optional wipe mechanic in ARC Raiders, and it allows players to donate stacks of resources to escape Speranza into the great beyond. Once they’ve done that, they’ll be left with a new and fresh character, ready to go again. However, the requirements for completing an Expedition Project are pretty insane.</p>



<p>To get the maximum rewards possible from completing an Extraction Project, you need to have a stash value (coins included) of <strong>five million</strong>. It feels inaccessible for the more casual gamers who will be left out in the cold when they realize they won’t gain much from their Expedition Project.</p>



<h3 id="h-more-achievements">More Achievements</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders has a fine assortment of achievements and trophies, but they’re far too easy to unlock just by exploring the game and ticking a few boxes. As the game is a live-service title that’s set to evolve over a number of years, it would be good to see more achievements surface with the successive updates that hit the game.</p>



<p>This keeps completionists occupied and able to enjoy the game more. If you play ARC Raiders for around 50 hours and see all there is to see, it’s a fair chance you’ll have almost unlocked all the achievements.</p>







<p>What would you like to see added to ARC Raiders in the next year or so? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

That remains true over three years later with the Gen 2 model, which offers 40% better battery life--over 50 hours compared to 38 hours--and adds support for the Arctis Companion App.</p><p>The free iOS and Android app lets you adjust audio settings and switch between over 200 custom sound profiles designed for specific games. Along with these 2.4GHz Wireless profiles, there are a handful of Bluetooth profiles, including Bass Boost and Focus, that come in handy when using the Nova 7 to listen to music.</p><p>The original Nova 7 worked with the SteelSeries GG desktop app for PC and Mac, but the mobile app is easier to use and allows you to adjust audio settings on the go. The Arctis Companion App was introduced in 2024 alongside the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0DFRX1Z35?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">entry-level Nova 5 Wireless Headset</a>, and it only works with select SteelSeries audio gear.</p><p>If you own the first-generation Nova 7, upgrading probably might make sense if you take your headset with you during your daily commute or use it frequently for handheld gaming. But if Arctis Companion App integration isn't of interest to you, you'll want to stick with the original. But for everyone else, the Nova 7 Gen 2 is a terrific all-around gaming headset that remains my favorite in the $200 and under category.</p><p>SteelSeries designs the most comfortable gaming headsets on the market, and the Nova 7 is no exception. The adjustable elastic headband and lightweight, memory foam ear cushions are superb, and the sturdy steel frame holds up well. The custom 40mm neodymium audio drivers offer rich, high-fidelity sound; the audio is even more impressive and dynamic when using the custom presets created by SteelSeries. It has a retractable boom mic with AI noise reduction to block out ambient noise like keyboard and controller clicks.</p><p>Along with 2.4GHz Wireless with the included USB-C dongle, the Nova 7 supports Bluetooth and wired via a detachable 3.5mm audio cord. It also has simultaneous 2.4GHz and Bluetooth audio streams, so you can stay connected and hear sound from two devices at once.</p></div>                      </div><h2>Nova 7 vs. 7P vs. 7X</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png" data-ref-id="1300-4628035" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png" data-ref-id="1300-4628035"></a><figcaption>SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 (Gen 2)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png"></figure><p>As mentioned, there are three versions of the Nova 7 Gen 2. In the past, SteelSeries has included green or blue accents on the headset to differentiate between the Xbox and PlayStation editions, but the Gen 2 looks the same across the board. The only tangible difference between the three is the dial on the right earcup. The Nova 7X and 7 have a game chatmix dial, but since the PS5 doesn't have this feature, the Nova 7P has a Sidetone dial for mic monitoring.</p><p>We typically recommend the Xbox version of SteelSeries headsets since it is the only truly universal option, but if you primarily game on PS5 and regularly chat with friends, the Nova 7P would be the better choice. All three versions support 360-degree spatial audio and Sony's Tempest 3D Audio with compatible devices.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FRPH94LH,B0FRP6CMZ5,B0FRPVTQBB&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 (Universal)</a></strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRPH94LH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRP6CMZ5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRPVTQBB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Magenta</a></li></ul></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FRNHBVFY,B0FRPF7BPK,B0FRP537FV&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7P Gen 2 (PlayStation / PC)</a></strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRNHBVFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRPF7BPK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRP537FV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Magenta</a></li></ul></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FRNR8Y11,B0FRNNXWNK,B0FRNPW7HS&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7 Gen 2 (PC / PlayStation)</a></strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRNR8Y11?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRNNXWNK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRNPW7HS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Magenta</a></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2>SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Deals</h2><p>The Nova 7 Gen 2 is the best SteelSeries gaming headset for <em>most </em>players, but it's not the highest-end model in the manufacturer's catalog. The next step up is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro. This premium wireless gaming headset has an improved build, leatherette earcups, better audio with parametric EQ, and ANC. It also has a base station with an OLED screen that can be used to customize settings. The base station replaces the 2.4GHz dongle and can be connected to two devices. The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B09ZWKD9TF,B0D1S99TD7,B0CCXWH6WG,B0D1S7D9YX,B09ZWCYQTX,B0D1SCV5WR&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro is on sale for $300 (was $380)</a></strong> in white or black at Amazon. Once again, you can choose between Xbox (Universal), PlayStation, and PC models.</p><p>SteelSeries also makes a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B09ZW52XSQ,B09ZWF9BCJ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wired version of the Arctis Nova Pro with a GameDAC</a> and higher-fidelity audio (96kHz/24-bit). Normally $280, the wired Xbox edition is discounted to $150, while the PlayStation edition is $210. The wired Xbox edition works with PS5 and PS4.</p><hr><h2>SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628037-novaeliteimage.png" data-ref-id="1300-4628037" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628037-novaeliteimage.png" data-ref-id="1300-4628037"></a><figcaption>SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628037-novaeliteimage.png"></figure><p>It's worth noting that high-resolution 96kHz/24-bit audio is also offered in the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Nova-Elite-Multi-Source-PlayStation/dp/B0FQXB7JHT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Nova Elite Wireless Headset</a></strong>. Launched in late September for $600, the Arctis Nova Elite is far pricier than the other headsets in SteelSeries' lineup. Available in Obsidian and Sage/Gold, the Nova Elite is probably best described as a "luxury" gaming headset.</p><p>From a technical perspective, the Nova Elite is the most impressive wireless gaming headset I've tried. It supports 96kHz/24-bit high-resolution audio over 2.4GHz Wireless and Bluetooth. The new carbon fiber drivers produce a noticeably fuller, cleaner sound, and the active noise cancellation is a step above the Nova Pro. The ANC isn't on the same level as similarly priced headphones designed for music, but it is the better at blocking out noise than any other gaming headset I've tried.</p><hr><p>The GameHub--the new name for the base station--can connect to three devices, and simultaneous audio is available for all three as well as Bluetooth. In addition to a retractable microphone, the Nova Elite has a second, stealth mic. Unlike the Nova Pro, the Elite is also compatible with the Arctis Companion App.</p><p>The Nova Elite is built almost entirely from steel and die-cast aluminum. The headband is wrapped in the same leatherette found on the improved memory foam earcups. The Elite also comes with a leatherette travel pouch with a magnetic enclosure and a zippered compartment for accessories and cables.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-mario-kart-world-bundle-holiday-deal/1100-6536599/">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle Reportedly Discontinued - Save $50 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-holiday-amazon-deal/1100-6536577/">ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld Is On Sale For Only $489 For A Limited Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-se-arcade-machines-pac-man-ms-pac-man-mortal-kombat-amazon-deals/1100-6534472/">Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Mortal Kombat Cabinet Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-transformers-building-sets-optimus-prime-bumblebee-soundwave-best-deals/1100-6509331/">Lego Transformers Optimus Prime And Bumblebee Get Limited-Time Price Cuts</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<figure data-uuid="d10822e8c4072"><a title="&quot;If Mario Starts To Show Up On PlayStation, That's The Apocalypse, Right?&quot; - Ex-PlayStation Boss Thinks Console Exclusives Are Still Important 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d10822e8c4072/if-mario-starts-to-show-up-on-playstation-thats-the-apocalypse-right-ex-playstation-boss-thinks-console-exclusives-are-still-important-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We find ourselves in an unusual position when it comes to console exclusives these days.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, titles like <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/halo">Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_horizon_6">Forza</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a><span><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">,</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/god_of_war">God of War</a> would have been playable only on hardware produced by their respective owners. However, today, Microsoft is releasing its games on PS5,</span> while Sony is happy for its leading lights to hit PC.</p>
<p>Nintendo remains steadfast in its dedication to true exclusives, however, and ex-PlayStation boss Shawn Layden thinks that's the right approach, despite the market seemingly heading in the other direction.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_-9FAcLYBRB3misjrt2jBw">Pause for Thought</a> podcast, Layden addressed the topic of platform exclusives and says he feels they're still important (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/2005065889755083113?s=46&amp;t=_ZthC0M-yfLcPVPyf_xLfQ">Genki</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don’t think every game has to be console exclusive. I don’t think every game should be console exclusive, but I do accept the fact that if you’re going to have platform companies like Sony and Nintendo largely. Microsoft is more of the Xbox everywhere, anywhere. There is a huge value to the brand of having strong exclusives.</p>
<p>If Mario starts to show up on PlayStation, that’s the apocalypse, right? Cats and dogs living together. And the same goes for Nathan Drake and Uncharted. I think they make the platform sing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Layden makes another good point in relation to exclusives – they push the host platform to its limit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And of course the other thing with multiplatform, that I’m sure most people realize, is that when you do code across multiple platforms you do have to code to the lowest common denominator. But if you do exclusives you can push every lever to 11 in that platform."</p>

This classic role-playing series will hit its 40th birthday, and in the same end-of-year wrap with 4Gamer.net (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/japanese-game-creators-discuss-2026-ambitions">via Gematsu</a>), Square Enix producer Yosuke Saito mentions how the company is looking forward to everyone joining in on the grand celebration of the series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Next year marks the 40th anniversary of <em>Dragon Quest</em>! I’d be extremely happy if everyone could join in on a grand celebration.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a> will also celebrate its ninth anniversary! And the team is apparently preparing a “little something”, but temper your expectations.</p><div><figure data-videoid="O4v-ia_qhCE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4v-ia_qhCE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytO4v-ia_qhCE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O4v-ia_qhCE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4v-ia_qhCE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405204gtvurz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>And for <em>NieR: Automata</em>‘s ninth anniversary, we’re also preparing ‘just a little something…’ so please don’t get too excited with anticipation! With that, I wish you all a happy New Year.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Director Kazutoyo Maehiro (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_tactics_the_ivalice_chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>) also provided a brief teaser about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>, mentioning how the next “something” the team is preparing will be “content with a different approach”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In 2025, we released <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> on September 30 and <em>LOGOS: The World of Final Fantasy XVI</em> on December 16. While the game and book took different approaches, we put our all into both so that anyone who picks them up might feel, even just a little, ‘Games are fun, huh?’ The next ‘something’ we’re preparing will also be content with a different approach. We’re working hard to bring you a new gaming experience, so please wait a little longer until the day we can debut it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some other Square Enix news, the company is currently running a survey about the Final Fantasy series, where fans can share how they feel about the series.</p>
<p>And if you are looking for some more fun on the Switch 2, the demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Intergrade Remake</a> is now live on the eShop. NieR has also recently got a backwards compatibility update.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade's Switch 2 release arrives next month, and Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined will follow in February 2026.</p>
