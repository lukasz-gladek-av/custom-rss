            <p>Capcom will soon release another update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which will fix an issue where the game's celebrated food scenes are occasionally not being shown.</p>
<p>A release date for version 1.000.05.00 is yet to be announced, but Capcom has already released the <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060">patch notes</a> detailing what will be included.</p>
<p>Top of the list of fixes is an issue where the "Meal Invitation event at Azuz and Sild does not occur on some occasions". These are the scenes where characters chomp on those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">delectable-looking cheese naans that's caused a surge in sales in Japanese restaurants</a>.</p>

<p>Other incoming fixes include an issue where when cutting off monster parts, they change into those of a different monster - particularly frustrating when you're grinding for specific materials.</p>
<p>The full list of issues to be addressed in the next patch are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Meal Invitation event at Azuz and Sild does not occur on some occasions.</li>
<li>An issue occurring when using Equipment Loadout, causing decorations to be removed from equipment, Bowgun Customization being reverted back to default, and Kinsects reverting to the initial rarity.</li>
<li>When cutting off monster parts, the parts change into a monster part from a different monster.</li>
<li>Gravios does not gain resistance to flinches after breaking its parts.</li>
<li>An issue which may cause crashes or some monsters to act strangely under certain situations.</li>
<li>Some skills are unintentionally activated under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Some items/rewards can be obtained repeatedly under certain conditions.</li>
<li>When trying to catch a fish with a capture net, the fishes nearby do not swim away from the fishing spot.</li>
<li>Some environmental features such as floating rubbles can be activated multiple times.</li>
<li>An issue wherein Main Mission: Chapter 5-1 "Omens" cannot be progressed.</li>
<li>Palico's support move "Attract Vigorwasps" may cause the hunter to become unresponsive to some controls.</li>
<li>When scrolling through the quest list, only the first 20 quests are shown correctly.</li>
<li>An issue which may cause the game to forcefully shut down when starting a game with saved data that encountered a force quit.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the patch notes, Capcom reiterated some currently known issues, including a problem where a network error can occur after firing an SOS flare at the start of a quest that's yet to be fixed.</p>
<p>Another known issue means player Hunter Profiles cannot be edited on some occasions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-warn-of-network-error-when-firing-sos-flares">previous patch was released earlier this week</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday Japanese magazine Famitsu released sales figures for the past week, showing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-biggest-physical-launch-of-any-ps5-game-in-japan">Monster Hunter Wilds had the biggest physical launch ever for a PS5 game</a> in the country.</p></div>

            <p>Mechy and messy extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a> sees a big update today that addresses the biggest player complaint the game had on launch - the precious water that drained away in real-time, even while you weren't playing the game. The patch to the early access shooter reworks water so it becomes a currency that you use to infiltrate the game's brutal maps at different entry points, instead of dripping away and threatening to leave you thirsty and destitute. And this isn't the only promising news - enemy spawning changes, reworked gunplay, and a new map also appear. </p>

<p>If you missed the water fury the first time around, let me explain. The Forever Winter's brutal warzones would often hide barrels of water you could strap to your back. Escape the map and you would add these litres to a big water tank in your home base (a hub of bullet merchants where you stash all the good gear you've scavenged). But that water supply would slowly drain - the cost of keeping your hub running. If it hit zero, your hub would "die" and all your stashed goodies would vanish. This water supply would deplete even while offline, the idea being that this adds more stress to the process of surviving in an apocalyptic hellscape. </p>
<p>Now the game's creators are ditching that idea entirely. "Water is no longer a resource that drains [in] real-time," say developers Fun Dog Studios in the update's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/496063443495814171">patch notes on Steam</a>. "It is now a currency that is used to access region entry points. Region entry points have specific water costs that are in an RNG range."</p>
<p>This basically means the game's maps now have a default entry point, and you'll need to use water as payment to enter the hellish battleyards from other starting points (you may also need to have a good reputation with certain factions for this). Water can now also be traded from player to player, and the frequency of scavengable water barrels appearing in maps has been rebalanced, say the devs. </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/the-forever-winter-water-update-1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Fun Dog Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many players disliked the original water premise. It became one of the biggest gripes in an early access launch marred by performance issues and unpredictable enemy behaviour. The developers promised changes, but didn't want to remove water as a stressy driving force completely. </p>
<p>One early patch saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winter-devs-answer-complaints-about-water-scarcity-by-adding-thieves-who-invade-your-hq-and-steal-your-water">thieves creep into your subterranean home to steal your last drops</a>. Defeating these scoundrels offered a last chance to save your stash from a water shortage. Later, the developers added a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/547848028756640978">"thief-proof vault"</a> - a limited space for goodies that would never be lost, even in a critical water crisis. They also introduced water bots that would let players collect water automatically. (The meme-faced water thieves will still appear following this latest update, we're told. Although the consequences for not dealing with them won't be so high anymore.) </p>
<p>The water system, for all the ire it attracted, was the least significant of my complaints when I played The Forever Winter for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winter-struggles-into-early-access-with-poor-performance-and-a-deadly-thirst-for-your-time">our early access review</a>. Enemy spawning was wacky, their combat behaviour was difficult to understand, levels were cluttered and visually noisy, bugs were commonplace, and even the simple act of picking up items from the ground was a chore. I loved the core idea (little scav caught in the middle of an eternal robo-war) and the art direction is precisely my weathered cloth bag. But it was hard to stomach the rough state of the launch.</p>
<p>This update addresses several of those problems too, though. Enemy spawning has been adjusted to "hopefully completely remove" the problem of "seeing enemies spawn right in front of you out of thin air" or "having enemies spawn right on top of you or out of view." Guns have seen a big rework, and a new map featuring a fiery stone staircase has been added. We're also told "rendering improvements have been made to increase FPS" and "enemy detection icons show up more reliably with the correct information", meaning that you should theoretically be able to understand when and where a foe spots you or a teammate.</p>
<p>This is all good news, and I want to return to the game to see if it plays a little smoother now. I'm in favour of the water rework too. I understand that game designers often aim to elicit strong emotions in players, and here Fun Dog's designers desired a feeling of unease and insecurity, all the better to fit their game's permawar theme. But I prefer when those feelings are confined to the time when I'm actually playing the game, rather than spreading like a nervous tendril into my real life. I imagine many others feel the same about "FOMO" designs like this. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bethesda has reassured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> fans it is still "hard at work" on what's next for its ambitious sci-fi role-playing game, almost six months on from last September's Shattered Space expansion.
</p>
<p>
Starfield arrived in a blaze of marketing back in September 2023, though updates for the game have since slowed. Much of Bethesda's messaging of late on the game's social media channels has been focused on highlighting community-made content.
</p>
<p>
Now, there's a fresh update from Bethesda, acknowledging the wait for news. "We know you're eager for an update," <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1897709518013997493">Bethesda wrote</a>, replying to a fan who contacted the company saying it needed to start communicating what was happening with the game's next update or DLC.

"We truly appreciate your passion for Starfield," Bethesda continued. "The team has been hard at work, and while we're not ready to share specific details just yet, we have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about when the time is right."
</p>
<p>
Responses from fans include excitement to see what's next, as well as messages speculating that Bethesda is busy working on the game's PlayStation 5 version before pushing forward with any other expansion.
</p>
<p>
"While Shattered Space is quite possibly one of Starfield's most enjoyable storylines to date, it once again struggles to offer any real consequences," our Katharine wrote of the game's first expansion, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-review">Eurogamer's Starfield: Shattered Space review</a>. "And its new setting feels woefully underutilised."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">Bethesda's Todd Howard previously confirmed Starfield would receive at least one more Starfield expansion after Shattered Space</a> - though there's no word on when that will turn up.

			<p>It's been a while since Bethesda Game Studios provided an updated roadmap of what's next for Starfield. Fans have been reaching out to the developer, and now the game's official X account has <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1897709518013997493" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> 'lots of exciting things' coming to the game later in 2025:</p>
<p><em>We know you're eager for an update, and we truly appreciate your passion for Starfield. The team has been hard at work, and while we're not ready to share specific details just yet, we have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about when the time is right. We’re always listening and taking your feedback to heart. Thanks for being part of this journey with us.</em></p>
<p>2024 was filled with lots of updates, such as the one that added the much-requested Rev-8 land vehicle, not to mention the Shattered Space expansion. However, the premium DLC wasn't that well-received, getting just a six out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</em></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if the game gets another full-fledged expansion this year or just some free updates. Bethesda's Todd Howard did <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say</a> the team was gearing up to release annual story expansions, but plans might have changed, especially as the studio is very busy with The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>
<p>Still, there is that Starborn trademark that Bethesda&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> in the Summer of 2024; fans have been speculating it could be the title of the next Starfield expansion. We'll probably learn a lot more about the future of Starfield during June's Xbox Games Showcase. Keep in mind that one of those exciting things could very well be the long rumored PlayStation 5 release, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> to be close now.</p>

            <p>
Cyanide and Nacon have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades Of Greed</a>, the third in a trilogy of goblin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> games known for puke-based mechanics and many a snarky note-to-self. I never completed the previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-master-of-shadows">Styx: Master Of Shadows</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-shards-of-darkness">Styx: Shards Of Darkness</a>, and if I'm honest, I fear Cyanide's impish infiltrator is doomed to forever butt his smirking, warty head against the 6/10 glass ceiling, with Thief's Garrett flashing V-signs on the other side.</p>
<p>Still, I have a certain respect for the series. There aren't many third-person sneakers like this any more, still fewer that have successfully gotten away with a protagonist who sounds like a chaddy Sam Fisher and looks like he should be cleaning toilets in Moria. So a quiet hip-hooray, then, for Blades Of Greed, which is out later in 2025. Here's a trailer.

<p>
What's the Green Plague up to in this one, then? The usual, from the looks of it: clambering up massive citadels, shivving or bamboozling their guards, cracking the bad kind of bad joke, making away with the treasure. You can still sick up a clone of yourself and turn invisible using Amber, but you also get powers derived from a new energy source, Quartz - these include mind control and time manipulation. 
</p>
<p>
The story is about stealing Quartz from the human Inquisition, and takes you via airship to three large environments - "The Wall, which marks the boundary of the human world; the lush orc village of Turquoise Dawn; and the Ruins of the elven capital, Akenash". New areas become available within those sandboxes via "Metroidvania-style" tool-gating. You'll also get to craft weapons and potions before undertaking each heist.
</p>
<p>
The setting has always been Styx's big draw for me. All that cobbled-together, piled-up masonry, buttressed by some respectable grimdark lore. I share Alec Meer's (RPS in peace) distaste for the character's internal monologue, however. "Clearly, a lot of money and skill has gone into making Shards Of Darkness, which only makes the fact that you have to battle past this woeful characterisation to get to the strong stealth meat below all the more tragic," he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/styx-shards-of-darkness-review">wrote of the most recent Styx outing</a>.</p>
<p>Re-reading that review, I'm struck by the mention of rampant fourth-wall-breaking, which I don't remember being quite so abundant in Master Of Shadows. Hopefully they've eased off on it in Blades Of Greed. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">Find out more on Steam</a>.

            <p>Chinese-speaking users accounted for 50 percent of Steam's playerbase last month.</p>
<p>Valve has released its latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/">Steam Hardware and Software Survey</a>, which revealed a 20.88 percent increase in Simplified Chinese-speaking users in February 2025, making up half of the entire userbase.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-saw-chinese-users-spike-and-exceed-50-of-worldwide-playerbase-in-february-2025/">Automaton</a> noted, February usually brings an increase of Chinese users to Steam as it coincides with Chinese New Year holidays. However, this year's increase was significantly higher than usual - 2024 saw an equivalent increase of 7.26 percent.</p>

<p>English-speaking users are the next highest, accounting for an almost 24 percent proportion of the userbase. Similarly, the Christmas season usually results in a spike in proportion.</p>
<p>The success of Game Science's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is likely a contributing factor to this increase in Chinese users. While its player numbers have dwindled since launch, it remains a huge success story and has the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">second highest all-time concurrent player count on the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Another factor could be the demo for Mecha Break, a multiplayer mech shooter from Chinese developer Amazing Seasun Games that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfestmostplayed_feb_2025">dominated Steam Next Fest</a> - it reached a <a href="https://x.com/MechaBREAK/status/1897105111476003317">peak player count of over 300,000</a>.</p>
<p>Other contributing factors could be the ongoing success of NetEase's Marvel Rivals that saw its new season launch in this period, as well as the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> at the very end of the month that saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-propels-steam-to-highest-ever-player-count">Steam reach its highest ever concurrent player count</a>.</p>
<p>What's more, this upward trend in Chinese-speaking users is likely to continue. If Mecha Break's demo is anything to go by, its full release later this year will be huge.</p>
<p>Then there's the likes of the PlayStation-published Chinese action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-soul-aside-launches-in-2025-nine-years-after-devil-may-cry-and-final-fantasy-15-inspired-action-games-reveal">Lost Soul Aside</a>, as well as another Chinese action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-fresh-look-at-chinese-fantasy-soulslike-wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> (not to be confused with Wukong), while the free-to-play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunk-console-launch-delayed-as-neteases-shooter-hits-pc-this-week">FragPunk</a> follows Marvel Rivals as NetEase's next big shooter.</p>
<p>It's clear that Chinese studios are thriving, and that's resulting in a surge of Steam users in the country.</p>
<p>Yet political relations between China and the US are causing friction in the industry. NetEase laid off a number of Marvel Rivals developers from its US team despite the game's success. Reportedly, further downsizing is yet to come, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">NetEase has denied such allegations</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, Chinese conglomerate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">Tencent was labelled a military company by the US</a> - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-threatens-legal-proceedings-if-us-doesnt-overturn-decision-to-label-it-as-a-chinese-military-company">company threatened legal proceedings in response</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At the time, I hoped this tone and tenor of trying too hard<em> </em>was just press release guff. No such luck, if the writing shown off below is any indication.</p>

<p>But let's first back up a moment, because it does <em>look</em> great. So great I'm having some difficulty believing this is what the game looks like, rather than just being concept art. It's stunning. The purple and yellow palette. The painterly style, soft but sharp with detail.</p>
<p>Then you start reading. "Let me introduce myself," says your character to a sweet old lady feeding pigeons. "I don't shit in my own drinking water - though I see that's not a deal-breaker".</p>
<p>In Disco Elysium, your character could find a leather jacket with "Fuck The World" written on the back. If you tried hard enough, you could even convince your partner Kim to wear a complimentary jacket that read "Pissf****t". Someone at Longdue evidently thought those jackets were a good baseline for character development.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I'm viewing this dialogue through eyes pre-exhausted by Longdue's description of your character as "a chaotic, self-destructive provocateur who sees humanity as inherently selfish and cruel" and "unapologetically cynical and dangerously unhinged". Disco Elysium was frequently self-satisfied, show-offish, and overly slick. But it wasn't ever, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rr56tvKSe28">Nathan Barley on the bus</a>.</p>
<p>The pigeon lady offers your character a loaf of bread. You've got three responses to that, one of which is categorised "Noblesse N'oblige". I like that name. The dialogue itself is "I'd rather lick the bin [knock the bread from her hands]" - a jejune and obliviously mean-spirited interpretation of why the chaotic cringe comedy options in Disco were so much fun.</p>
<p>Your "Gonzo" option is: "Yeah, feed the masses! So let it be done. EAT UP, SKY RATS! (Take the bread)". You ever see a sentence that reads like someone wrote the exclamation points first and worked backwards from there? The attempts at understated philosophy feel just as unconvincing: "They give the filth on the ground a fighting chance to touch the sky. That's admirable".</p>
<p>I don't expect or even especially want a carbon copy of Disco Elysium from Hopetown, but if you're going to piggyback off the imagination of people that<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report"> have allegedly had their work stolen from them</a>, apparently justified by the sole contribution of a lone systems designer from an outsourced studio (who I'm sure is excellent at their job and likely had no say in the "spiritual successor" marketing angle), I think you should probably make a more convincing attempt to better understand the spirit you're succeeding.</p>
<p>Still, bloody gorgeous art. And, look, I'm obviously cherrypicking lines out of context from a single screenshot. I'd be very happy to be eat crow for doubting pigeons here. If not, there's always two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">others</a> anyway.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has added two more Game Boy titles to its Switch Online subscription catalogue - and you can play them right now. 
</p>
<p>
1994 classic Donkey Kong is the star of the show here - the highly-regarded puzzle platformer that serves as a continuation of the classic DK arcade game, with elements of Donkey Kong Jr, and also the subsequent Mario vs Donkey Kong titles.
</p>
<p>
If you've never played it before, there's a fun surprise after the first four levels - which are the ones found in the original Donkey Kong arcade cabinet. It's safe to say the game is bigger than just those.

Also available today is Mario's Picross - which is, as you'd expect, Picross puzzles to colour in based on Mario and Mushroom Kingdom designs. Originally released for Game Boy in 1995, this was one of the earliest Picross games, and the first to the west.

			<p>It's been exactly a year since Frogwares <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-goes-to-kickstarter-soon-as-frogwares-needs-a-safety-net-from-the-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> its fans that The Sinking City 2 would get a Kickstarter funding campaign. Back then, the Ukrainian studio aimed to launch it shortly, but clearly, there were some hiccups.</p>
<p>The campaign is finally <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=discovery_category&amp;total_hits=21544&amp;category_id=35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live</a>, though, and its minimum goal of €100K has already been nearly doubled as of this writing. So far, Frogwares has not shared any info on the stretch goals, but they're sure to come with 29 days left in the campaign.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Sinking City 2 - Developer Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jN0mNkrXHJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Wael Amr, CEO of Frogwares, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>After 3 years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we've learned to adapt, though it has never been easy. In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.</em></p>
<p>Frogwares Publishing Director Sergiy Oganesyan also spoke about the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> slight genre change, moving away from adventure to a full-fledged horror title:</p>
<p><em>When we announced The Sinking City 2 back in 2024, we stated this is going to be our chance to shift our studio into creating games that are more “horror first” focused and the results we’re all seeing internally are extremely promising. We’re not ditching our investigation roots entirely, but the chance to spread and challenge our norms has really helped the team grow. We’ve placed combat and exploration first while still keeping an air of investigation that adds depth but is entirely optional.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-confirmed-to-have-been-co-developed-with-sony/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>AMD FSR 4, the latest version of the upscaling technology made by AMD, was co-developed with Sony. The news came <a href="https://x.com/amdradeon/status/1897741520200962308" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a tweet</a> pushed by AMD itself, where it was added that this is just the beginning:</p>
<p><em>Happy Radeon Day! We’re proud to collaborate with PlayStation on Project Amethyst!</em></p>
<p><em>FSR 4 is looking fantastic! Excited for the co-development with Sony Interactive Entertainment on the models used for the AMD FSR 4 upscaler. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for what’s next!</em></p>
<p>For those who may not remember, the joint machine learning project Amethyst was announced in late 2024 by Sony. In an <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Wccftech interview with Mark Cerny</a>, the PlayStation 5 Pro System Architect explained:</p>
<p><em>Pretty much when PlayStation 5 Pro was wrapping up, we began discussions and development of those various aspects of Amethyst. To get more specific, I think we were getting pretty good momentum by the end of 2023. But as you know, it takes a phenomenally long amount of time to go from discussions and concepting to actually having a piece of hardware out in the marketplace.</em></p>
<p><em>We're looking to co-develop performant new AI architectures that can be used freely in any space that anybody chooses to use them, whether that is PC, console, or cloud. For the software, if I look at it today, we have games that run on a TV and there's a certain set of developers that make them, and AMD for PC has games that run on PC monitors that have a somewhat overlapping set of developers that make games for them. There are different needs and different relationships there, so really what we're looking to do is to co-develop those network architectures and those training strategies that can then be freely used in both contexts.</em></p>
<p>The collaboration is specifically on the AI models, then. It's the big AMD FSR 4 change, after all. FSR 1 was just a spatial upscaler, whereas FSR 2 switched to a temporal upscaler. Neither could possibly perform as well as an AI model, though, which has now been proven with the launch of FSR 4, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described as a massive improvement over FSR 3</a>. Of course, the trade off is that AMD had to restrict it to the new Radeon RX 9000 Series, just like NVIDIA has been doing with DLSS and its GeForce RTX Series.</p>
<p>Still, AMD should definitely be commended for its efforts to catch up with NVIDIA. While the DLSS 4 transformer model remains the gold standard for upscaling, AMD FSR 4 has reduced that gap considerably, a far from easy feat to accomplish given NVIDIA's headstart. The increased competition in the space will no doubt spur NVIDIA to further improvements and so on, eventually benefiting all users.</p>

As in Pokemon Go Fest's previous stops, Niantic will provide a curated route that will let players take in some of Paris' landmarks while keeping an eye out for elusive Pokemon. The Parc de Sceaux will have real-life Pokemon habitats where players can meet Pokemon mascots and trainers, compete head-to-head in the PVP battle ground, and shop for exclusive merchandise.</p><p>"The charm of Paris, its walkability, and its globally recognized landmarks create the perfect playground for Pokémon GO Fest," said Pokemon Go Live Events Marketing Manager Lena Cillis in a statement. "We're eager to see Trainers explore this beautiful city and the elegant Parc de Sceaux alongside France's passionate community and visitors from around the world."</p><p>Before this event, Pokemon Go Fest will visit Osaka, Japan from May 29-June 1, and Jersey City, New Jersey from June 6-8. Following Pokemon Go Fest: Paris, Ninatic will hold a Pokemon Go Fest Global event from June 28-29.</p><p>If you're looking for something to do sooner, Niantic has already shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-march-2025-events-raids-spotlight-hours-community-days-and-more/1100-6529806/" data-ref-id="1100-6529806">the Pokemon Go events for March</a>.

                <p>In WWE 2K25's new Island mode, you'll explore an open-world PvPvE hub full of shops, events, and other players. But one thing you might lose track of is how to change your character's appearance in The Island. In our brief guide, we'll walk you through how to do just that, so your future WWE superstar can look just the way you want them to. Better yet, this same method we'll show you also lets you adjust their moveset to your liking.</p><h2>How to customize your character's appearance and moves in WWE 2K25 The Island</h2><p>There's only one way to change what your character looks like in The Island, since it's a mode split off from your library of create-a-wrestlers (CAWs) and your MyRise story mode superstar. When you create your Island character, the game might usher you right past the customization suite, leaving you to need to get back to it after some brief onboarding into the new mode. </p><p>Once you can freely explore the Island, you'll want to look for a pathway between the pink-colored barber shop and the Nike and Jordan stores. Down that way, you'll see an elaborate building decorated with Cody Rhodes' American Nightmare logo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455035" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455035"></a><figcaption>Head down the pathway you see in the image behind Larry David here...</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg"></figure><p>Head down that pathway and look to the left of Rhodes' hub. There, you'll see a kiosk called MyBooth--these 2K games love branding by removing the space between words. Interact with the circular kiosk to jump into a menu where you can change your wrestler's appearance or moves. There are other MyBooth stations around the Island, but this is the one closest to where you load into the world. Since the mode strangely lacks a map, we'll just say you can generally expect to find a MyBooth kiosk near a few of the distinct zones within the Island hub. There's another one by the Hall of Legends, for example, and another in the Temple of the Ancestors. </p><p>Everything currently available to your character will be there, and beyond the build options you chose at their creation--like their fighting style, height, and weight--nothing is untouchable, so you can continue to edit them as much as you'd like. As you see in the screenshots here, I tried making Larry David. If you see him around the Island, just leave him be. He hates a stop-and-chat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455036" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455036"></a><figcaption>...then interact with MyBooth to change your character's look and moveset.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg"></figure><p>For more on WWE 2K25, don't miss the full <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-showcase-match-list-all-bloodline-matches-and-rewards/2900-6302/" data-ref-id="2900-6302">Showcase matches list</a>, with all rewards and unlockables detailed.

Frogwares' <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">Kickstarter campaign for The Sinking City 2</a> is now live, and has smashed through its crowdfunding target in less than a day - raising over £140K at the time or writing.
</p>
<p>
As part of its crowdfunding drive, Frogwares has shared new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a> details - confirming the Lovecratian sequel to be a standalone story featuring new characters and locations. It's once again set in 1920s America, but instead of revisting Oakmont, players'll this time be exploring the flooded streets and crumbling buildings of Arkham itself.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">previously revealed</a>, The Sinking City 2 - which is Frogwares' first Unreal Engine 5 game - marks a shift away from the deduction focus of its predecessor. It's a sequel firmly in survival horror territory, with combat and exploration said to be the core mechanics this time around - which is perhaps a gamble given combat has historically been Frogawares' achilles heel.

<p>
Investigation work <em>does</em> return, but now it's described as an "optional yet highly useful tool", that'll help players uncover secrets, gameplay bonuses, and lore. The Sinking City 2 is also set to feature a smaller map - explorable both on foot and by boat - that's aiming to provide a "better flow and concentration of things to discover".
</p>
<p>
You'll find a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">few more details on The Sinking City 2's Kickstarter page</a>, and there's a look at some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtyEOb2IBZQ">pre-alpha gameplay</a> in the trailer above.
</p>
<p>
Frogwares is aiming to release The Sinking City 2 on  PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S later this year. And if you want to get involved with its crowdfunding campaign - which it says will help "essentially guarantee our team the time and resources needed to explore" new features - there's still 29 days left before things come to a close.
</p>
<p>
The Ukraine-based Frogwares successfully took a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-remaking-sherlock-holmes-and-cthulhu-crossover-the-awakened">similar crowdfunding approach with 2023's Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened,</a> as  it continued to adjust to life during Russia's ongoing invasion. "This financial safety net proved invaluable to us," the studio writes in its latest Kickstarter campaign, "so we need to do the same now with The Sinking City 2 as this game is vastly bigger and more complex."

Putting a sticker on the back while continuing to drive and pay for a Tesla is exactly the kind of empty gesture you'd expect from a liberal in 2025, the most meaningless act possible in the face of something that calls for genuine action, and it deserves as much mockery and scorn as...driving a Tesla.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fiio-ft1-review-sennheiser-hd6xx-best-midfi-headphone-canjam"><h3>I Went To A Fancy Headphone Convention And Fell In Love With The Basics</h3></a><p>The classic Sennheiser HD 6XX and the new Fiio FT1 are the budget kings of headphones, beloved by many.
