			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dustborn-a-familiar-feeling/">Dustborn</a> and <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/dreamfall-chapters-two-fates-bound/">Dreamfall Chapters</a> developer Red Thread Games is expanding beyond its usual boundaries of narrative games with Hello Sunshine, a survival RPG that the studio's creative director acknowledges isn't their usual beat, but is excited to bring its own narrative-focused spin on this desert survival game.</p>



<p>Ahead of the studio showing off Hello Sunshine during the PC Gaming Show today, I got the chance to check out a hands-off presentation given by Red Thread Games' creative director, Ragnar Tørnquist, and game director Jonathan Nielssen, showing a bit of gameplay and talking about their vision for Hello Sunshine.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hello_Sunshine_Footsteps-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Red Thread Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Hello Sunshine puts you in a dystopian desert world where, thanks to corporations like Sunshine Industries (of which you are the last remaining employee), the planet is starting to resemble Arrakis, which is to say that the part of the world you'll be exploring is entirely engulfed in sand, and the sun is a constant threat. Thankfully, it doesn't seem like there are giant sandworms about, but there are small (and sometimes quite large) robots that have you doing your best Aloy impression with a bow and arrow at your disposal and a slew of arrow types to craft to help you take down every kind of rogue metal beast, big or small.</p>



<p>That said, combat isn't the core challenge to the experience; the challenge is to survive. You'll need to constantly search for resources to keep yourself alive and manage your time in the sun so you're not collapsing from total dehydration. And you'll need to do all of this while constantly moving forward, because you have a big, giant, walking tether with you at all times. A skyscraper-sized robot that not only keeps you alive, but is your best friend in this downtrodden world.</p>

<p>And it's your giant robot friend that makes Hello Sunshine an interesting prospect as a survival game. Survival players are used to managing resources and ensuring that they are not exposed to the elements for too long. And if your year has been anything like mine, you've also sunk a good chunk of hours into <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-2025-qa-we-just-need-to-keep-working-and-solve-the-problems-we-have-one-of-the-best-survival-games/">Dune: Awakening</a>, where keeping yourself safe from the elements is key to your survival more than your ability to fight off enemies. </p>



<p>But in Dune: Awakening, I can stop under a rock and rest a while, waiting for the sun to pass. Hello Sunshine's continuous day and night cycle does mean you'll get the space to rest, but during the day, you can't stop moving because the robot won't stop moving.</p>



<p>The robot is constantly moving forward, driving the momentum of the game, and because your survival is tied to staying in the robot's shadow, your looting and exploration time is always limited. I think it's an incredibly interesting way to frame a survival game, especially one with a narrative slant, because survival in life is all about moving forward, about not being stagnant and losing track of where you're going. Hello Sunshine forces you into a constant state of motion while asking you to manage all of the other regular survival elements, which I think is an extremely interesting premise for a survival game.</p>

<p>Your robot pal does sit down and charge every evening, which gives you respite not just from the sun but from the game's forward pacing. You also don't have to stay entirely glued to the robot the whole time, and certain procedural elements can allow you to stray from the robot's path for longer than you would in a clear day, like sandstorms that block out the sun, letting you wander a little further on your own. You'll also earn upgrades deeper into the game that mitigate your reliance on staying glued to the robot, but leaving its side is always a risk. Even at night, you'll freeze to death if you're not near the robot, as it releases all the heat it collected from the day.</p>



<p>Corporations like the one you were still working for when the world ended may have been the planet's downfall, but what's left behind by them is also your salvation. You'll craft upgrades and improve your character's survival chances at resting stations set up by Sunshine Industries while your robot buddy sits down and charges for the night. A 3D printer takes all of the scraps and resources you collect during the day and turns them into whatever you need to prepare for the day ahead.</p>

<p>These rest stations are also where your relationship with the robot begins to build. During the presentation, Red Thread Games describes your relationship with your iron giant friend as that of our general relationship to ants - we don't notice them unless they make us notice them. While the robot charges for the night, the Sunshine Industries rest stations are also where you can upgrade the robot's capabilities. Slowly but surely, the robot begins to pay attention to you, and your relationship with the robot evolves.</p>



<p>Tørnquist also likened your relationship with the robot to that of a child-parent relationship. Kids grow up in their parents' shadow, and it's up to them to walk out of it into the light, and how that relationship evolves is at the core of the narrative for Hello Sunshine.</p>



<p>As for how Red Thread Games approaches telling that kind of story, the team will let players experience it for themselves once the game is in their hands. They wouldn't go deeper into the story, but described Hello Sunshine as a game where its mechanics are the muscles of the game, but its strength is at its heart, which is the story. The studio also didn't delve into the co-op gameplay, but did say that Hello Sunshine's co-op "reframes the story" and that you won't actually get "the full story" without playing both solo and in co-op.</p>



<p>As with every hands-off preview, we'll have to wait and see if Red Thread Games is able to pull everything off. It's stepping outside its comfort zone, but you'll never accomplish anything staying in your comfort zone. Hopefully, whenever Red Thread Games is ready to release Hello Sunshine (which is still without a release date), its time straying from its own giant robot comfort zone will have proven fruitful.</p>

			<p>Publisher Deep Silver and developer KING Art Games (the German studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/iron-harvest-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iron Harvest</a>) have released a new story trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-stunning-in-engine-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV</a>, the upcoming new installment in the real-time strategy series, as part of today's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025.</p>



<p>Black Library author John French is co-writing the game's 70+ mission campaign, which will be available in both solo and co-op play modes. Dawn of War IV is set on the war‑torn world of Kronus, where the Blood Ravens, the Necrons led by Chronomancer Thothmek, the Orks under Warboss Gorgutz and Guzcutta, and Technoarcheologist Potentia Delta‑9 all converge before the Dark Angels arrive to turn the tide for the Imperium.</p>



<p>The Dark Angels are a fully playable Space Marine faction across all modes, with their own commanders (Company Master Astoran and Chaplain Ezrael), missions interleaved with those of the Blood Ravens, and a distinct playstyle emphasizing large‑scale, all‑out warfare, whereas the Blood Ravens, the other Space Marine chapter playable in the game, are often engaged in smaller conflicts that require stealth and/or tactical finesse. According to the press release, Primarch Lion El’Jonson will also appear in the campaign's climax as a playable unit, giving players direct control of a Primarch for the first time in the series.</p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV will include four playable factions (the Space Marines, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus), multiple non‑linear campaigns, competitive multiplayer (1v1, 2v2, and 3v3), and returning modes like Last Stand and Skirmish. The game is slated to launch next year on PC. KING Art Games still hasn't shared the official system requirements, but we'll let you know once they are confirmed by the development team.</p>

            <p>"PRAISE NEATH", cry the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rogue-legacy">Rogue Legacy</a>. "What's Neath?", I ask politely. It's their new game, they say, a roguelike RPG with some tactical combat about an upside-down tower constantly shifting because a god can't make up his mind. It's out next year, they add, before their fingers lose grip on the ceiling and they crash down from their inverted positions.</p>

<p>"Lead a band of fragile warriors through a colossal, inverted tower, where Taboos, the everchanging edicts of a God, warp the laws of reality," reads the start of the game's cracking synopsis. The tower's pointy, but stout, with its orientation meaning that it's hanging rather precariously above a city in a crater. Think an infernal robo-stalactite. The city has a tavern, for the love of all that's roguelikey, won't someone think of the ale?</p>
<p>Anyway, my fear of things falling aside, you head into the tower with your party, where gridded battle rooms await. The order of turns is always shifting and the goal is to think one step ahead, anticipating enemies' moves. Each run aims to be like a classic dungeon-crawl, with the usual roguelike twists and turns to keep things fresh and have you uncover more clues to the dark mystery that needs solving.</p><p>Cellar Door co-founder and lead programmer Kenny Lee cites Subset Games' mech strategy-fest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/into-the-breach-ftl-sequel-review">Into the Breach</a> and board game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mansions-of-madness">Mansions of Madness</a> as Neath's inspirations. "Development has taken us far from our comfort zone, working in an unfamiliar genre with an aesthetic much darker than what we usually do," he said. "But we’ve got a lot of new ideas, from 'engagement locking' to the 'attack resolve system', and we’re excited to see if we can move this burgeoning genre in a whole new direction."</p>
<p>Neath's currently being aimed for a 2026 release on Steam. Cellar Door are planning some closed betas next year, which you'll be able to throw your name in the hat for via the studio's Discord. Here are former RPSer Ed Thorn's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-legacy-2-review-a-dense-roguelike-youll-want-to-invest-in">thoughts on Rogue Legacy 2</a> if you're in need of something to tide you over 'til then.</p>

            <p>Gregorios Kythreotis, the creative director of sci-fi hoverbike adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a>, has a new thing. He's heading up a fresh studio dubbed Eteo, who'll be aiming to release their first game in 2027. Until then, the studio plan to start putting out a newsletter called Archetypes, which'll debut in January and discuss different elements of game design.</p>

<p>Eteo will be focused on "making vibrant game worlds with a distinctly mischievous flavour", and have funding in place from Outersloth, the indie game fund run by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a> developers Innersloth, for that unnamed first game.</p>
<p>"We started [Sable studio] Shedworks about a week after I graduated from studying architecture," Kythreotis recalls in the studio announcement video above. "We've just basically been teaching ourselves on the job for a decade now. Sable was our first really big game, it changed my life completely. Eteo is sort of the next step with that. Taking everything I've learned from studying architecture, from shedworks, from Sable, and applying that to new creative explorations, projects that are really personal, but carry on with that lineage of world building, of storytelling, and games that really engage people on an emotional level."</p><p>Starting in January 2026, the studio will be putting out Archetypes, a free monthly newsletter. For the next half a year making up a first volume, it'll see three writers per month "examine unsung aspects of video game design with each article examining themes relevant to Eteo’s design philosophies". The first month's theme is "Flying Cities", with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> creator Gareth Damian Martin having been drafted in to contribute, alongside Eteo Community Manager Emma Kent and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/christian-donlan">two-time RPS contributor</a> Christian Donlan.</p>
<p>If you're interested in Archetypes, you can <a href="http://eteogames.com/">sign up</a> to receive it via Eteo's website. Then maybe spend the wait until the first issue re-reading former RPSer Alice B's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sable-review">review of Sable</a>. Come on, you know you want to.</p>

              <p><span>One thing I love about this job is learning something new about games I do not play. That includes learning that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-gta-5-roleplay-ice-raid-new-save-collective-2000646967"><i><span>Fortnite</span></i></a> <span>has historically either obscured or omitted male nipples in its various skins. Until now, that is. Homer Simpson was the first man to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-fortnite-naked-homer-skin-leak-nipples-2000645750"><span>free the nipple last month</span></a><span>, and now new character Carter Wu is getting a skin that lets him bare it all.</span></p>   <p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-really-does-seem-to-have-changed-its-nipple-policy-and-now-its-not-just-homer-simpsons-chest-thats-in-the-game"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> lays out, </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>has featured several shirtless skins of both fictional characters and real-world figures, but each of them has either covered up their chest, like putting a pelt on Kratos from </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, or just not rendering their nipples, like rapper Travis Scott or wrestler/actor John Cena.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This is odd, but not unheard of. Some anime or anime-inspired series like </span><i><span>Free! </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>do the same thing. However, after Homer and now Carter Wu have been added to </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>with nipples intact, it seems like Epic Games might have changed whatever internal rules it had about depicting male anatomy in the game.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>has thousands of skins, so I don’t think there’s a chance in Hell that Epic goes back and rectifies this for every shirtless man it’s ever rendered, but maybe this means that future skins won’t hide or remove male nipples moving forward.</span></p> <p><span>In other </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>news, the crossover battle royale is the latest game to be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-season-7-gen-ai-tim-sweeney-latata-2000649103"><span>caught in the generative AI witch hunt</span></a><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Liquid Swords, the new studio founded by Just Cause creator Christofer Sundberg, has officially unveiled its debut game at the PC Gaming Show today. The earliest teasers for this game pointed to a gritty, narrative-driven open-world title that many likened to Grand Theft Auto 4 in its aesthetic, but now we know exactly what we’re getting into.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the PC Gaming Show, Sundberg and Liquid Swords were all over social media, posting screenshots and talking extensively about ‘Game 1’ coming out of the new studio.</p>







<h2 id="h-liquid-swords-asks-gamers-to-brace-for-impact">Liquid Swords Asks Gamers to Brace for Impact</h2>



<p>Founded by Christofer Sundberg, the co-founder of Avalanche Studios and the creative force behind Just Cause, Liquid Swords has just revealed its inaugural title, Samson: A Tyndalston Story.</p>



<p>This project has been in the works since 2020, and the early teasers posted online referenced a bleak cityscape, suggesting similarities to games like Grand Theft Auto and Max Payne. All we knew previously was that the game was being built in Unreal Engine 5 and that it would be a far cry from Sundberg’s previous titles, like the over-the-top, explosive action series, Just Cause.</p>



<p>The PC Gaming Show played host to the game’s first major trailer, which you can see below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Samson: A Tyndalston Story - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NbFnkUlyZlo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the lead-up to the trailer dropping, Sundberg revealed that the team at Liquid Swords features talent from Avalanche, Rockstar Games, and other major studios, which makes for a promising road ahead, given the team’s pedigree.</p>



<p>The trailer uncovered a gritty crime thriller backed by gruff voices, muscle cars, and gorgeous visuals. It looks like a perfect contender for games like Grand Theft Auto, which is a very ambitious thing to suggest.</p>



<p>Do you think <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story </strong>looks like your kind of game? Let us know what you’re thinking about Liquid Swords’ first title on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>In 2020, Just Cause creator and Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sundberg started a new company, Liquid Swords, alongside other industry veterans. Now, the team at Liquid Swords has shared the first trailer for its debut action title, Samson: A Tyndalston Story. It may remind some fans of Grand Theft Auto, but there are differences that make it a lot harder to earn money in this game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ4z_yQE5Xo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tyndalston is the name of the city, and players will step into the role of Samson McCray, an aging criminal who is facing a crushing debt. Players can steal the money they need, but this isn't like other open-world crime games where you can keep going non-stop. Samson has physical limits as to what he can pull off in a day, which are measured by action points. Use too many on a single job and you won't be able to do much else.</p><p>As time passes in this world, your debt increases. For every crime you commit, the city remembers and your reputation grows. According to Liquid Swords, "There are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse." This is a story about debt, consequences, and survival. Samson will have to deal with all three on a daily basis.</p><p>"We built Samson to strike fast and leave a mark," said Sundberg in a statement. "It's a raw, physical story with systems that push back at every turn. This is the start of what Liquid Swords stands for, and the team has delivered something with real teeth. We've come through a heavy cycle of change and sharpened every part of how we work. The entire industry is navigating pressure right now. Samson is our answer to that reality, a focused project built with intent, not excess. This is how we move forward."</p><p>Samson: A Tyndalston Story will be released on PC in early 2026 on Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>

This includes defensive perks that will help keep you alive, and an offensive perk designed for intel and aggressive plays.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Survivor</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This was already a helpful pick in recent seasons of Warzone, but it becomes even more powerful in this new year with BO7's integration. In addition to the health regen and faster revives, it also now protects you from getting one-hit by snipers so long as you're geared up with full plates.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tracker</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Tracker is the pick for aggressive players looking to hunt their opponents. This will let you track and ping enemies just as before, but now the perk gives the added benefit of also letting your teammates see the enemy footprints after you shoot an enemy. Put some bullets in your opponent, but they are trying to flee? Now, you and your team can work together to track their steps and hunt them down.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's always helpful to have a Ghost class in Warzone, but the perk is very situational. There are some matches where your opponents just aren't calling in a lot of UAVs, and it might be better to have Tracker or Survivor as your third perk. Make at least one Ghost class, and this is something you can switch to if you find there are a lot of UAVs getting activated, or to keep you off the radar in a late-game situation.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Adaptive</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This is a brand-new perk that the developer says is designed to allow you to dynamically respond to combat situations. When your armor plates are full, it supports aggressive pushes. When plates are depleted, it grants a constant movement advantage to aid you in repositioning.</p><p dir="ltr">This perk could be really useful in various situations, but it will require some testing to see if the ADS and speed boosts are enough to make this a viable pick, but it's worth trying out to see if you find this beneficial to you.</p>

            <p>A new story trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4">Dawn of War 4</a> has just been revealed, showing off the Dark Angels as a playable sub-faction, and teasing the old and busted Lion El' Johnson who appears to actually be hanging around his kids for once.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us some more context as to why the four playable factions are back on Kronus, with Blood Ravens and Orks clashing like the good ol' days, while the Adeptus Mechanicus explore Necron tombs. We see a variety of units new to the series, including a Chaplan on bike, Necron skorpekh destroyers and an Ork Beastboss.</p>
<p>Lion El' Johnson interestingly enough has his helmet on at the tail end of the trailer, which may have prevented some from noticing his presence in the trailer. However, given we see his shield on full display, that's certainly him!</p>

<p>We also now know that the Dawn of War 4 campaign has been written by Black Library author John French. He's written plenty of Warhammer books over the years. This includes books focused on Ahriman, the first captain of the Thousand Suns legion. There's been a long-running fan theory that the Blood Ravens are successors of the Thousand Sons, so who knows? Maybe John French will drop a breadcrumb or two.</p><p>Other interesting tidbits from the trailer include the fact warboss Gorgutz is still alive and kicking. This makes sense as the Orks canonically were the victors of Dawn of War: Soulstorm, thus Orks would still be milling about the place. The Necrons have been fleshed out a bit too, ironically.</p>
<p>During the campaign, players will be able to pick between Dark Angels and Blood Ravens missions, allowing a degree of choice depending on which Space Marine faction you vibe with the most. These missions are "non-linear" according to the official press release for this story trailer.</p>
<p>Dawn of War 4 is set to release sometime in 2026, though you can wishlist it now! If you want to get an idea of what it's like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-and-it-feels-like-the-sequel-to-the-original-that-rts-fans-always-wanted">why not read our Dawn of War 4 preview</a>. In it, writer Chris Tapsell stated: "it feels like the sequel to the original that RTS fans always wanted".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the highlights of my writing this year was heading out to meet the team from 10Chambers at the European Unity headquarters, and getting to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/den-of-wolves-throws-an-inception-sized-wrench-into-the-multiplayer-heist-genre/">hands-on with Den of Wolves</a>. This futuristic heist game has a hell of a legacy – 10Chambers’ studio founder Ulf Anderson was the creator of Payday and GTFO – and even in our short time with the game, it was clear that the mix of planning, gunplay and crazy Inception-like sections was looking to be something special. While they’re continuing to work hard on the forthcoming game, 10Chambers are continuing a drip-feed of information, this time showcasing a new trailer, where they let four of the key community members for the game go hands-on. It looks like they had a pretty good time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves - Community Hands-On Trailer | PC Gaming Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCUnDA8BpIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Robin Björkell, the Communications Director at 10 Chamber said, “I’ve been begging management to give us a release window for Den of Wolves in the trailer – but no. They won’t budge. These developers really don’t want to make promises they can’t keep for the sake of marketing. It makes my job harder, but as a gamer myself, I respect it. I told them we at least need to prove that the game exists, and that was the starting point for this trailer. We invited some of our most loyal fans to come to our office and play the game. This is real footage of them playing the game – not scripted, not us playing. The game does exist – ask them,”</p>
<p>In fact, you can hear from one of them straight away, with RandomKenny, one of the invited players, saying, “Absolutely incredible experience being invited to play Den of Wolves early. Planning and executing how you’re going to tackle heists is super satisfying. I had such a blast playing, and I honestly can’t wait for the game to be released”.</p>
<p>In the trailer, the players can be seen tackling a heist in a previously unseen level inside a robot factory. Inside this gigantic factory, the players face resistance from both human and robotic enemies, all while deploying spider drills to hack vaults full of valuables.</p>

<p>Obviously, the big question remains, just when will Den of Wolves release? The team are remaining tight-lipped despite the huge groundswell of community interest, and it doesn’t look like we’re going to get a set date any time soon.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-458384">{“Source” : “NVIDIA APP”, “B64” : “eyJEUlNBcHBOYW1lIiA6ICIiLCAiRFJTUHJvZmlsZU5hbWUiIDogIiIsICJTaG9ydE5hbWUiIDogIiIsICJDbXNJZCIgOiAwfQ==”}</p>
<p>“Even though we’ve not conducted any closed or public playtests yet, Den of Wolves has over half a million wishlists. We’re so grateful for our community’s support, and we can’t wait to show more details about the game. The reason we’re shy about communicating a release window yet is that we learned our lesson with GTFO, which was delayed multiple times. We don’t think it’s fair to communicate fake dates for the sake of getting an announcement out,” says Oscar J-T Holm, co-founder of 10 Chambers.</p>
<p>Even if we don’t get a release date for Den of Wolves set in stone quite yet, here’s hoping that we learn more in early 2026, at least in terms of beta testing or a potential demo.</p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/haddonfield-heights-multiplayer-map-revealed-for-illfonics-halloween</link>
            <guid>1373605</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>IllFonic released a new trailer for its asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/halloween">Halloween</a>, during today's PC Gaming Show, and it showcases its first map, Haddonfield Heights. Of course, Haddonfield is the fictional Illinois town where killer Michael Myers attempts to kill Laurie Strode in the original 1978 <em>Halloween </em>film, so it's no surprise a map like this is in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Developer-publisher IllFonic and co-publisher Gun Interactive describe Haddonfield Heights as a map nestled beneath the iconic Haddonfield water tower that brings players deep into the heart of the town, "introducing a warm, tight-knit neighborhood that hides terror behind every picket fence and perfectly manicured lawn." It features a cluster of charming homes, plenty of front yards and winding side streets to hide in, and a neighborhood full of nooks and crannies necessary to run from (or stop) Michael.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the Haddonfield Heights trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C2iqQykoqB8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C2iqQykoqB8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As a civilian, you will have to scavenge for supplies, guide residents to safety, and locate a phone to call the police before the time runs out in Haddonfield Heights. And if you're playing as Michael, you can expect to prowl the shadows and use abilities like Shape Jump to traverse through the neighborhood unseen and strike without warning.&nbsp;</p><p>"This neighborhood allowed us to reimage the tension of Haddonfield in a way that feels both intimate and terrifying," IllFonic design director Jordan Mathewson writes in a press release. "We wanted players to feel the comfort of the neighborhood they recognize from the film right before we turn it into a panic. Every hedge, hallway, and backyard was built to heighten suspense and reward clever play, whether you're hunting or being hunted."&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A new Den of Wolves gameplay trailer has been revealed at tonight's PC Gaming Show, showcasing fans of 10 Chambers' previous titles tackling a heist within a giant robot factory in the upcoming co-operative FPS.</p>
<p>The trailer, splicing player reactions and gameplay, showcases a little bit of the pre-heist stealth gameplay, as well as live firefights and mechanical Sentinels wiping out the squad. The trailer ends with a call to wishlist the game, with no release date stated.</p>
<p>On the topic of the release date, communications director Robin Björkell and 10 Chambers co-founder Oscar J-T Holm explained why a release date is yet to be provided</p>

<p>Björkell stated: "I've been begging management to give us a release window for Den of Wolves in the trailer - but no. They won't budge. These developers really don't want to make promises they can't keep for the sake of marketing. It makes my job harder, but as a gamer myself, I respect it. I told them we at least need to prove that the game exists, and that was the starting point for this trailer. We invited some of our most loyal fans to come to our office and play the game. This is real footage of them playing the game - not scripted, not us playing. The game does exist - ask them"</p><p>Oscar J-T Holm followed up with: "Even though we've not conducted any closed or public playtests yet, Den of Wolves has over half a million wishlists. We're so grateful for our community's support, and we can't wait to show more details about the game. The reason we're shy about communicating a release window yet is that we learned our lesson with GTFO, which was delayed multiple times. We don't think it's fair to communicate fake dates for the sake of getting an announcement out"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gtfo-developer-10-chambers-has-a-co-op-heist-fps-in-pre-production">Den of Wolves was first teased in August 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/den-of-wolves">and later revealed in December that same year</a>. Even then, any hint at a release date was dispelled with a "ready when it's ready" approach. It seems those looking for a new heist game will have to wait patiently a little longer.</p>

            <guid>1373587</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Team Spirit’s rising star (if you don’t count him as arisen yet, anyway), Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets, has penned his name even deeper into the Counter-Strike history books at the Starladder Budapest Major. The young competitor threw out a stunning performance on Train against Team Liquid in the third (ongoing) stage of the Major in Hungary.</p>



<p>The Russian rifler opened up the clash with a pistol ace, setting a dominant tone and sending viewers wild. That performance persisted throughout the unravelling of the map, and by the time the dust had settled, donk had racked up his <strong>best map performance ever </strong>at a CS2 Major.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure><a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"></a></figure>







<h2 id="h-a-new-benchmark-for-donk-and-everyone-else">A New Benchmark for Donk – And Everyone Else</h2>



<p>By the end of regulation against Team Liquid, donk had amassed a whopping 30 kills and only 11 deaths, but that’s just where these stunning stats <strong>begin</strong>. His HLTV rating came out at 2.38, the highest of his Major run thus far, and he was considered a huge force of momentum for Team Spirit’s win.</p>



<p>This Train performance surpassed his previous benchmark, which he set on Mirage against Imperial at the Copenhagen Major in 2024.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Donk’s pistol ace in Budapest is an easy notch on his belt, and it’s yet another clipped onto his total run of aces at the Majors he has attended. In Shanghai in 2024, the young competitor put up a massive <strong>four aces in a single tournament</strong>, which included an awe-inspiring 1v5 slam.</p>



<p>Team Spirit closed out the map against Team Liquid with a 13:8 victory, pushing further through the third stage of the Starladder Budapest Major.</p>



<p>For donk, this was more than just another win; it was another career-defining moment that showcases his consistency and ability to deliver. Right now, it’s obvious to see why many regard him as a growing GOAT of Counter-Strike.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#908)—Clues and Answers for Friday, December 5]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-5-908/</link>
            <guid>1373584</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday, and while that means the weekend is within spitting distance, it also means that you’ve got a whole new NYT Connections puzzle to dominate today. Fortunately, I’ve arrived with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions that you need to get the puzzle resolved as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Read on to get the notes and hints you need to wrap up today’s NYT Connections puzzle without too much fuss.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #908:</p>



<ul>
<li>SORRY</li>



<li>TOUGH</li>



<li>DEAL</li>



<li>BABY</li>



<li>SWEET</li>



<li>STICKY</li>



<li>PILLOW</li>



<li>STORY</li>



<li>MASTERMIND</li>



<li>SMALL</li>



<li>DELICATE</li>



<li>OPERATION</li>



<li>COMPLEX</li>



<li>STATUS</li>



<li>MOUSE TRAP</li>



<li>SITUATION</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of situations or problems that aren’t straightforward.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>These are terms you’d use when describing “how things stand” in a given moment.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are titles you’d recognize from family game nights or childhood play.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – E<em>ach of these words pairs naturally with “talk” to form a familiar expression.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 5:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-5-908">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 5 (#908)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– COMPLEX, DELICATE, STICKY, TOUGH</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DEAL, SITUATION, STATUS, STORY</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – MASTERMIND, MOUSE TRAP, OPERATION, SORRY</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BABY, PILLOW, SMALL, SWEET</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

While players continue to develop their settlement, story-driven quests, time-sensitive expeditions, and dynamic fog surges can shift entire strategies in a moment.</p><p>The main antagonist is an enigmatic fog, which impacts citizens’ health and morale, and is modeled using custom voxel grid technology, creating dynamic and unpredictable fog shifts. A once-thriving society faced a life-threatening enemy when this mysterious mist swept across the lands, warping their minds and consuming everything. In a desperate attempt for survival, those who still stood fled upwards towards the treetops, and rebuilt their homes above the deadly haze. The game’s heavy atmosphere is paired with ambisonic audio cues that intensify the sense of dread, all woven together by the haunting compositions of legendary musician Akira Yamaoka.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

        <p><em>Neath</em> is a roguelike tactical RPG set in a decaying world shadowed by an irradiated, inverted tower. Using a fluid turn-based system where the turn order is always shifting, you dictate the actions of both friend and foe alike. As enemies engage you they will freeze your teammates in fear. Disrupt opponents by knocking them away, shove allies far from impending harm, or make the ultimate sacrifice and have someone else take the blow in their stead.</p><p>As you ascend the corrupt citadel to defy the decree of the undivine, your journey will twist and turn with encounters shown through a classic 90’s dungeon-crawler style.
