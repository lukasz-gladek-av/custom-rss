            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/have-websites-considered-simply-watching-a-tv-show-and-finding-out-what-happens.1134321/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/severance-reviews-criticism-roundups<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love all my friends and colleagues here at Aftermath, but part of loving someone is acknowledging they are not perfect. Take Nathan, for example. While he has beautiful, perfect hair, he also has a fatal flaw: he enjoys going online to read about TV shows.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/severance-theories-lumon-goats-clones-instagram-threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One of those shows is <em>Severance</em>, and as we've already seen this week, there's a lot of <em>Severance</em> talk out there right now, much of it dogshit</a>. But there's a lot of talk about all kinds of TV shows online these days,<a href="https://aftermath.site/true-crime-north-country-bad-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and like I've written previously, a lot of it ends in very angry and frustrated and unhelpful places</a>. So I come to you all today to repeat the same advice I gave during <em>True Detective's</em> run: instead of going to Reddit or Twitter or the comments section of your favourite website to read a review about a TV show that's full of mystery but is also in the middle of a season, have you considered <em>not </em>doing that?</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/severance-season-two-episode-eight-reactions-b2711036.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This </a>is a serious article on The Independent, a serious website!</figcaption></figure><p><em>Severance</em>, a show where none of us know what is going to happen, is not finished. Season two of <em>Severance </em>is a series of ten episodes (at time of publication we've had nine of them), continuing on from the first season and leading into others. Each episode in that season tells a story that is part of a wider, ongoing story. That's how stories work; they're told over time. It's unreal I'm spelling this baby shit out, yet as I look around social media and seemingly serious websites, here we are.</p><p>Week after week, the Discourse surrounding <em>Severance </em>simply cannot wait for that story to be told before leaping into the breach. We live on an internet where media and commentators routinely review each episode as though they are independent works, some even scoring them like blockbuster video game releases, a 7/10 in episode two simply not achieving the same level of visual fidelity and replayability as the 8/10 from episode five.</p><figure><figcaption>"There are few thrills throughout"</figcaption></figure><p>I'm not here to try to police your thoughts, to say<em> you can’t talk about TV</em>. From the safety of your own couch or office or private Discord, <a href="https://aftermath.site/our-thoughts-and-theories-on-severances-second-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you should always talk with friends and loved ones about a TV show, your theories about what's going to happen, whatever</a>. That's some of the fun of television, of shared fandom and community! I'm just saying: maybe keep those conversations within your closest circles. Don't bring them to the public internet, which in its current, ruinous state will poison them beyond all recognition.</p><p>The modern internet--particularly the algorithm-driven weaponization of commentary, and the<a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> accompanying decay of genuine criticism and online media</a>--has eroded humanity's ability to discuss an in-progress TV series en masse. It has turned the serialisation of story-telling into an attempt by websites and talking heads to min/max our consumption of art. It has destroyed too many people's ability to simply watch something, to think something about it then get on with their lives.</p><p>Take last week's "<a href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-ep-8-sweet-vitriol-harmony-cobel-1851768452" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divisive</a>" episode, the eighth in the series, of <em>Severance</em>. An episode where a major character has their backstory completely upended, doubles our understanding of the show's villainous corporation <em>and </em>signposts the future arc of the series' resistance, all in just 37 minutes. Yet despite all that--and I honestly believe this has been caused by the media's click-driven, growing disregard for the beating heart of various artforms--too many websites went beyond just writing some thoughts about the episode, and decided to not only review it as though it was a 37-minute feature film, but make <a href="https://thetab.com/2025/03/12/explaining-why-the-severance-cobel-episode-has-been-review-bombed-as-worst-ever-on-imdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news about what some random people on the internet thought about it</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>This isn't an Amazon listing, it's IMDB's rating breakdown for a single episode of a television show. Nobody needs to know this shit!</figcaption></figure><p>This obsession with the opinions of media illiterate viewers and per-episode reviews (as opposed to <em>recaps</em>, which are usually fine!) is so common now across all online spaces you may not even stop to survey the machine in its entirety anymore, but let's do that now for a second: do you realise how insane it is to do <em>any </em>of this?</p><p>Whether you think that episode was any good or not isn't even the point; the point is that websites and commentators performing critical services couldn't look past those 37 minutes to understand it was serving a purpose, and that trying to "review" it in isolation--or care what some random person on the internet thinks about it--is pointless. We simply won't know how effective episode eight will be until the series, or maybe even the whole show, is finished. If by the end of <em>Severance </em>this ultimately meant little, then sure, fire away. But if it turns out to be one of the most pivotal episodes of the entire show, and you called it boring at the time because it had "few thrills throughout", or thought it was important to tell your readers <em>other </em>people thought it was boring, it's not a great look.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Imagine if my review of a <em>Yakuza </em>game didn't finish the game first, to best consider the events that had unfolded over the last 100 hours</a>, but had instead stopped once a week to write a short blurb that simply said "this bit was zzzzz, 5/10", "Kiryu didn't fight anyone, 6/10", or "not enough karaoke, eh, 5.10". I'd be booed out of this industry, and rightly so, because without context those snapshots would be meaningless. Yet that's what too many websites and popular critics, all members of a species that within just a few short years has forgotten entirely how to watch a weekly television show, are doing with shows like <em>Severance</em>.</p><p>Again, to be clear, I am not telling anybody to stop talking about television. But the specific type of television that <em>Severance </em>is, a serialised story that relies on mysteries being revealed and a story unfurling itself in slow motion, should be given the basic courtesy of letting that story be told before we start handing out verdicts, or polling the masses for their kneejerk reactions. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-gamification"><h3>Why Did No One Tell Me Duolingo Is Like This</h3></a><p>I thought it was just, you know, a learning app</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms"><h3>Log Off, Tim Sweeney</h3></a><p>Again, if I had $5 billion you would never see or hear from me ever again</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-best-plain-potato-chip-the-wirecutter-wrong"><h3>The Wirecutter Is Wrong About The Best Plain Potato Chip</h3></a><p>This is not just about how a chip tastes, this is a matter of the soul.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is on the way soon, and various Japanese analysts are expecting the console’s price to be around $400 or more when it releases.</p>



<p>In a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, many expect the system to be the most expensive in Nintendo’s history—the original Switch launched at $299—but still have no problem moving units right away.</p>



<p>“They will sell boatloads of Switch 2 in the first months in particular, almost regardless of the price,” Tokyo-based analyst Serkan Toto told Bloomberg. “We can expect a great software lineup in year one, from new&nbsp;Mario Kart&nbsp;and&nbsp;3D Mario&nbsp;after eight years to&nbsp;Pokémon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;and&nbsp;Metroid Prime 4.&nbsp;There will also be third-party support from day one, most probably including blockbusters like&nbsp;Call of Duty.”</p>



<p>As far as a release date is concerned, multiple analysts expect a June launch for the console. One analyst, Robin Zhu of Sanford C. Bernstein believes there will be inventory of 6-8 million consoles available on day one. </p>



<p>“That suggests that if early sales go as planned, the new console would mark the biggest console launch ever,” Bloomberg writes.</p>

For that final the top ten The Hunt: Mega Edition competitors will be invited to Roblox HQ for their shot at the jackpot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The full list of 25 different Roblox experiences that make up The Hunt: Mega Edition Event are:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A Dusty Trip</li><li>Arsenal</li><li>Basketball Legends</li><li>Bayside High School</li><li>Blade League</li><li>Clip It</li><li>Car Crushers 2</li><li>Chained [2 Player Obby]</li><li>Drive World</li><li>Eat the World</li><li>Fisch</li><li>Hell's Kitchen</li><li>Infection Gunfight</li><li>It Girl</li><li>Metro Life</li><li>Natural Disaster Survival</li><li>Pet Simulator 99</li><li>PRESSURE</li><li>Regretevator</li><li>RIVALS</li><li>SpongeBob Tower Defense</li><li>Tower Defense Simulator</li><li>Untitled Boxing Game</li><li>Untitled Tag Game</li><li>World Zero</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">That's quite the variety, meaning to get to the big prize players will need to show their skills in games like life sim Bayside High School, cook up a storm as Gordon Ramsay's next executive chef in Hell's Kitchen and survive zombie FPS Infection Gunfight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only catch is to win the money you need to be 13 years-old or over, but even if you out of the running for the cash there are still special ultra-rare digital items created exclusively for The Hunt: Mega Edition to win.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> is getting a "cutting-edge ray tracing" overhaul courtesy of Nvidia's RTX Remix modding tools, and there's a playable demo coming on 18th March ahead of a full release.
</p>
<p>
As Nvidia explains it, RTX Remix is a way to "modernise classic games, enhancing their visuals while preserving the core gameplay that makes them special." And Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-portal-with-rtx-and-the-new-retro-ray-tracing-revolution">impressed by the tech's potential</a> when he took a look at Portal RTX back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
Now though, after a year in beta, Nvidia's RTX Remix tools have been officially launched into the wild, gaining the likes of DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and RTX Neural Rendering along the way. More pertinent to this story, however, is the news Nvidia's marking the occasion by releasing a Half-Life 2 RTX demo, showcasing the technology's capabilities, on March 18th.

<p>
Half-Life 2 RTX is being released in conjunction with Orbifold Studios, and its impending Steam demo - which is only available to owners of Valve's full Half-Life 2 - will specifically feature Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt, both given an RTX Remix makeover. A full version of Half-Life 2 RTX by Orbifold is planned to release "at a later date". And if you don't already have Half-Life 2 in your Steam library, you might like to know <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">there's currently 80 percent off</a>.
</p>
<p>
"RTX Remix requires a GeForce RTX GPU to create RTX Remix Mods," Nvidia notes, "while mods and games built using Remix are compatible with any hardware that can run Vulkan ray-traced games." Full details of today's release can be found in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-half-life-2-rtx-demo-launching-march-18/">Nvidia's announcement</a>. All of which should stand you in good stead for Half-Life 3, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-fans-desperate-for-half-life-3-news-say-they-have-evidence-its-hidden-in-steams-back-end">might just happen after all</a>.

It was also confirmed Silent Hill f was being written by Ryukisshi07, the acclaimed Japanese visual novel writer behind the Higurashi and Umineko series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After almost three years, we are finally learning a lot more about Silent Hill f, and you can read all about it below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Silent Hill f Aims to 'Find the Beauty in Terror' and Present Players With a Beautiful Yet Terrifying Choice in 1960s Japan</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami shared a brand-new trailer for Silent Hill f and a ton of new details, including that it will aim to "find the beauty in terror" and present players with a beautiful yet terrifying choice in 1960s Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team wasn't ready to spoil what the decision would be, but it did unveil a bit of the story, and we'll leave it to Konami to set the stage;</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Shimizu Hinkao was living her life as an ordinary teenager," the official description reads. "That is, until her town is suddenly shrouded in fog and begins to change in a horrific way. Now, she must explore a town she no longer recognizes while solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and doing everything she can to survive... in order to face the ultimate decision that she must make. This is a tale about a beautiful yet terrifying choice."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new game will be an original story that will be a great place for new players to jump in, but there will be certain Easter Eggs waiting for series veterans. Konami also discussed a few more details on the game, including that it will take place in the fictional Japanese town of Ebisugaoka - which is based on a real place called Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, creature &amp; character designer kera presented a message that should excite fans, as it teases what horrors await them in Silent Hill f.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I love the Silent Hill series, and it's been a big influence on me," Kera said. "In particular, I am constantly remembering Silent Hill 2, and the messages on the walls, the music, and the monster designs. So, when it came to Silent Hill f, and bringing the setting to Japan, we had to come up with something that felt just a little different, and I had to really think about how to get that feeling. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The monster designs were the hardest. I had to consider everything that's come in Silent Hill before, and figure out how to take this game in a different direction, but still be Silent Hill. It might not be the exact same blood-smeared, rusting scenery, but I sincerely hope you'll enjoy our vision and the world we've created."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Music will also be a very important part of Silent Hill f, and the team is bringing together long-time Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka and Kensuke Inage (Dynasty Warriors series and more) to create music for both the Fog World and Otherworld, respectively. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I have composed music for an unsettling yet beautiful world that uses imagery from shrines, blending ancient Japanese court music with ambient echoes," Inage said. "I wove in various techniques that will connect the player to the protragonist's agony, internal conflict, fear, and other emotions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we didn't get a release date, it was confirmed that Silent Hill f will be released on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?

                <p dir="ltr">As I take the field in Vanderbilt's iconic gold, I know the pressure is on. Scouts are watching, and this is my shot to fly up their draft boards. I take my place at third base, locked in and ready. There’s a runner on first, one away, as the pitcher deals from the mound. The batter jumps on the first-pitch fastball; the loud ping of his metal bat pierces the air. The ball rockets up the third-base line, far too fast for me to get a glove on. As the left-fielder chases the ball in the corner, the runner from first is passing second. I take my position, lined up between the left-fielder and catcher. The runner rounds third as the outfielder launches the ball. I cut it off, turn, and take aim at the catcher's glove just past the runner and fire...</p><p dir="ltr">It’s these high drama moments that stood out when GameSpot was invited to visit Sony’s San Diego studio to meet with the team behind MLB The Show 25. While there, we were treated to a deep dive and hands-on time with all the new additions coming to the latest iteration of the long-running baseball sim. With fresh gameplay wrinkles, new single- and multiplayer options for Diamond Dynasty, revamped free agency, and more, there’s a lot happening on and off the field. Let’s play ball.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458571-mlb25brysonstott_ps5_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458571" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458571-mlb25brysonstott_ps5_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458571"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458571-mlb25brysonstott_ps5_2.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458572-bulletjoerogan_storylines.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458573-calstatefullerton.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458574-coolpapa3_storylines.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458575-lsu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458576-mlb25brysonstott_ps5_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458572,1300-4458573,1300-4458574,1300-4458575,1300-4458576" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458572-bulletjoerogan_storylines.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458573-calstatefullerton.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458574-coolpapa3_storylines.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458575-lsu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458576-mlb25brysonstott_ps5_1.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458572-bulletjoerogan_storylines.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458573-calstatefullerton.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458574-coolpapa3_storylines.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458575-lsu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458576-mlb25brysonstott_ps5_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">On the diamond</h2><p dir="ltr">This year’s updates begin on the field. Ambush hitting brings yet another real-world strategic element to batting. As Chris Gill--Gameplay Director at Sony Diego and a former pro ball player in the Cincinnati Reds' system--describes, good hitters take advantage of scouting and observing tendencies, adjusting to sit on certain pitches. In game, that translates to optionally focusing on pitches inside or outside of the center of the plate. The side you focus on gets a bump to the size of both your good contact area and timing window, while the side you don’t choose is shrunk. That means a pitcher with a go-to finisher (like my favorite, a fastball up and in) may want to try another strategy against a hitter who has experienced their MO. Conversely, if a pitcher has been pounding the inside of the plate, they might be able to surprise the batter with an unexpected pitch away. It’s the sort of cat-and-mouse game that makes an at-bat feel like a contest of strategy as much as stick skill.</p><p dir="ltr">Defense is seeing its own slate of updates. According to Gill, the goal was to make defense matter more. Last year, the focus was on how outfielders react to balls in the air. This year, the focus is on infielders and their start transitions. They’ve long had a stat to determine reaction speed, but often the true difference between a mediocre and great defender is in the first step. Are they fast and smooth, going right to where they need to be? Or do they hesitate, stutter-step, and lose crucial fractions of seconds? It can be the difference between a play looking routine for one fielder and hard or impossible for another--potentially turning a would-be out into a hit. That, in turn, opens up the possibility of building a team around preventing runs, rather than just loading a lineup with power bats.</p><p dir="ltr">When playing as one specific ballplayer, like in Road to the Show, you will now find even more quick-time events to simulate key moments in the game. Impact plays like a ball in the dirt with runners on base give catchers a chance to be the hero or let the game slip through their fingers, while corner infielders now have to contend with cleanly fielding hard-hit line drives or properly cutting off throws. One new addition that could prove to be a big difference-maker is the swim move for baserunners. Close plays when you are diving for a base now trigger a small opportunity to reach out with one hand, then quickly pull it back to avoid the tag and slide in safely, Fernando Tatis Jr.-style. It looks slick in action, though it isn’t clear yet how often it will come up, or how difficult it will be to pull off at harder difficulties.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Return of the Negro Leagues</h2><p dir="ltr">One of The Show’s signature features is Storylines mode, featuring the Negro Leagues. Equal parts mini-documentary and gameplay challenge, this mode features Bob Kendrick, charismatic president of the Negro Leagues museum, regaling players with stories of legends and athletes from the past.</p><p dir="ltr">Ramon Russell is the Director in charge of Storylines, and he tells us this year the headliners are James “Cool Papa” Bell and Wilbur “Bullet Joe” Rogan. Bell is famously one of--if not <em>the--</em> fastest player to ever play pro ball. Rogan, meanwhile, was Shohei Ohtani before there was a Shohei Ohtani, mixing elite pitching with a dynamite bat. Cool Papa Bell and Bullet Joe Rogan are some of the biggest stars from the Negro Leagues, and Ramon tells us that, as in previous seasons of the Negro Leagues, the intention is to mix in the most famous players people know, with the great players that they should. The full roster this year will be eight players, with a few available at launch, more added two weeks later, and the rest added two weeks after that.</p><p dir="ltr">As before, each player will have vignettes narrated by Kendrick mixed with gameplay of key moments from their careers. What we saw looked as fascinating and exciting as the last two iterations, and the appeal of leaning more and more into the history of baseball is easy to see. More era-accurate uniforms, equipment, stadiums, and crowds continue to enhance the authenticity of the mode. According to Russell, sometimes the dev team can obtain the actual equipment to recreate it in-game. Other times, they need to do a lot of research, studying faded or colorless photographs , flyers, and even bobbleheads to get the details just right.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Franchise focus</h2><p dir="ltr">Baseball has one of the densest offseasons in sports, with sprawling farm systems, layered rules around player finances and team control, and a very, very long draft. While last year's game focused a lot on scouting and the draft, this year, Free Agency is a big emphasis. Whereas the previous iterations of The Show involved day after day of going through your list of needs, now you highlight three targets on your Big Board to pursue. The idea is to create scenarios like we see in MLB, where the Juan Soto sweepstakes dominates the early going, and teams determine whether they are in on it or pivoting straight to plan B.</p><p dir="ltr">All teams aren’t equal in MLB, and it will take more than just making offers to attract a free agent. That’s represented in Motivation, a stat that reflects how interested a player is in signing with you. Factors like competition at a player’s position can decrease their motivation, while playing for a contender can increase it. Your three targets are ranked first, second, or third in priority. They will increase in Motivation each week, with larger gains going to the higher-priority players. Once they are above 50%, you can offer them a contract. You could wait until their motivation is even higher, which gives you a better chance to win the free-agent sweepstakes at a lower cost, but that runs the risk of another team scooping them up in the meantime. You also need to be thoughtful not to come in with a lowball offer that could offend a player, and suppress their Motivation quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, your team won’t be the only one looking to load up on talent, and that’s where the rumors come into play. You’ll get some idea through the grapevine about who other teams might be looking at, and it’s up to you to decide if you trust the information and whether you'll act on it. Is a big market team in the hunt for your free agent? Maybe it's time to cut your losses and devote those resources elsewhere. Is your division rival making a push to bring in a star? It might be time to go all in and lock that player down for yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">Player value is getting a rebalance, too, which will affect both contracts and trades. A greater emphasis on defense comes with a higher value placed on great defenders. Meanwhile, true unicorns, like Shohei Ohtani, now command the record-setting deals and franchise-altering trade compensation reflected in reality. Similarly, elite players who reach free agency will reset the market for other players at their position, altering the deals that others are willing to take. The idea is to get the GM and player logic to more closely match the economics of baseball, bringing the simulation more in line with reality.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Diamond Dynasty</h2><p dir="ltr">I will freely admit that the live-service focused Diamond Dynasty is far and away where I spend most of my time in MLB The Show. The introduction of the Sets and Seasons model, in which cards are available in some Diamond Dynasty modes for a fixed amount of time before becoming unusable for ranked play in favor of newly added cards, is something I have never been a fan of. That’s why, like many DD aficionados, I was glad when it was announced that Sets and Seasons were going away, and cards no longer came with an expiration date. That doesn’t mean they are simply rolling Diamond Dynasty back to an earlier form, as popular programs to earn cards over the last few years will remain, which will hopefully mean a happy middle ground between cards expiring and good rosters taking too long to build.</p><p dir="ltr">Diamond Quest is a new single-player experience somewhat adjacent to Conquest. While Conquest functions like a mix of baseball and a strategy board game like Risk, Diamond Quest is more in the vein of a deck builder/roguelite. Each run puts you on a board with a fixed shape, and a roll of a die sends you across to tiles that can randomly contain perks that make games easier, penalties that make them harder, and gameplay challenges like three-inning games or brief sink-or-swim "Gameplay Moments." Boss battles offer a mix of risk and reward; winning can net you prizes like card packs, while losing will end your run, forcing you to restart with reshuffled tiles.</p><p dir="ltr">The ultimate goal is to get to the Stadium(s) on the board and win one final battle to have a shot at collecting one of the Exclusive Chance rewards. Playing at higher difficulties gives you a better chance at the top rewards, but you can also replay the map as much as you want in hopes of getting lucky with your drops. Over time, new maps will be added with different rewards, and some will have certain themes, requiring you to construct specific lineups. Examples given were an all-righties team or a cap on power hitters, which can lead to some interesting team builds.</p><p dir="ltr">Weekend Classic, meanwhile, is the new bite-sized competitive mode. Unlike Ranked Seasons, which unfold over multiple weeks, these contests play out over a few days. The idea is to create a faster experience anyone can jump into without necessarily being an all-in competitive player. Teams play six games, matchmade based on their rating, with better rewards for winning more games. After those six are over, you are put into a 100-team leaderboard that'ss also matched based on skill, giving you a chance to improve your standing and earn even more rewards. Ideally, that will give hardcore competitive players another event to circle on their calendars, and provide people who don’t traditionally play head-to-head an on-ramp to dip their toes in with a lower commitment. As always, it will depend a lot on how well balanced the PvP matches are, but it’s an interesting idea.</p><h2 dir="ltr">On the road again</h2><p dir="ltr">The biggest change to Road to the Show (RTTS) is the addition of amateur baseball. According to Steve Merka, the Game Director for RTTS, your career now begins in high school, where you have a chance to showcase your talents and earn a place in one of eight different college programs, including LSU, TCU, and Texas. The attention to detail is very apparent when you see it in action, from each set of faithfully recreated uniforms up to the distinct <em>PING</em> of the aluminum bat squaring up a baseball. Merka tells us there are two tracks you can follow to reach your MLB dream. You can forego college, and work your way from the bottom up in the minors, or you can focus on developing your talents in college, try to win a championship, and aim to be the first pick in the draft.</p><p dir="ltr">Player progression is seeing a bit of an overhaul, as well. Previously, attribute increases were tied directly to your performance in games or related drills. You had to hit for power to become a better power hitter, and you had to steal bases to be better on the basepaths. Now, it’s shifting toward a token system, allowing you to invest upgrades in any attribute you want. You can also unlock permanent perks for performing in clutch moments, like adding to your exit velocity on batter balls in certain counts. I do have a little concern that progression will feel less like a baseball sim and more like an RPG, but I’m optimistic it will be worth it if I can take a player who excels at hitting for contact, for example, and invest the effort into turning them into a power bat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458577-ucla.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458577" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458577-ucla.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458577"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458577-ucla.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458578-mlb25paulskenes_ps5_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458579-mlb25sonnygray_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458580-mlb25tarikskubal_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458581-mlb25yordanalvarez_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458582-southcarolina.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458578,1300-4458579,1300-4458580,1300-4458581,1300-4458582" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458578-mlb25paulskenes_ps5_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458579-mlb25sonnygray_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458580-mlb25tarikskubal_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458581-mlb25yordanalvarez_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4458582-southcarolina.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458578-mlb25paulskenes_ps5_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458579-mlb25sonnygray_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458580-mlb25tarikskubal_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458581-mlb25yordanalvarez_ps5_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4458582-southcarolina.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The one addition I’m not quite sold on is the optional first-person camera. At a touch of a button, you can switch from the standard third-person angle to a view from the eyes of your player. It’s quick and easy, which I appreciate, but any time I tried to field that way, it became much, much harder to see what was happening and get in front of the ball. More options are certainly a good thing, though it remains to be seen if this is an immersive new mechanic, or a largely superfluous gimmick.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, the latest edition of MLB The Show is bringing a lot of new things to the table. Between new gameplay features, brand-new modes, and another chapter in the excellent Negro Leagues Storylines, it’s clear that this team is looking to take big swings. As for how many of those hit? We’ll have to wait a few more days to find out.</p><p dir="ltr">MLB The Show 25 releases on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on March 18.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/konamis-japan-set-silent-hill-f-resurfaces-with-eerie-new-trailer-and-fresh-details<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been a good long while since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022. But now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its curious Japan-set follow-up. And thanks to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPKJevpvZI">latest Silent Hill Transmissions stream</a>, we've got an eerie new trailer and a few more hints at what's in store.
</p>
<p>
Back during its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">initial 2022 announcement</a>, Konami revealed Silent Hill f is being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07. And courtesy of its latest update, we now know a little more.
</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is, for instance, set in the 1960s, its events unfolding in the rural town of Ebisugaoka - based on Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture. Here, we meet our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager" who suddenly finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.

<p>
That idea of "beauty in terror" is a theme Konami repeatedly returned throughout its latest Transmissions episode, explaining that while Silent Hill f retains the elements of psychological horror long-time fans will associate with the series, its setting allows it to deal with some more classically Japanese ideas, such as the notion that "when something becomes too beautiful and perfect, it instead becomes deeply unsettling".
</p>
<p>
It also spent a bit of time addressing Silent Hill f's notable shift away from the titular town that's been the focus of the series since its debut in 1999. Sharing his own perspective, Ryukishi07 explained that while Silent Hill can be considered a physical place with a dark history, it's equally a series "about portraying characters' struggles with the evil within themselves - sin, discontent, and conflict - in a visually striking way". And this, he noted, is a concept Silent Hill f retains, adding, "It's a gateway into the psychological battles of the human mind."
</p>
<p>
Konami also confirmed the return of long-time Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka, although this time he'll only be creating music for Ebisugaoka's Fog World. Music for its Otherworld (known as the Dark Shrine in Silent Hill f) will be composed by Kensuke Inage, whose musical credits include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, Samurai Showdown, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox-guard">Star Fox Guard</a>. In a message shared during the stream, Inage explained his compositions will use "imagery from shrines, blending ancient Japanese court music with ambient echoes", all interwoven with techniques intended to connect the player to the protagonist's "agonies, internal conflict, fear, and other emotions."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Konami teased "creatures that really infiltrate players' psyches", alongside easter eggs for long-time fans to uncover, despite Silent Hill f's new setting. And that's pretty much all we're getting for now. Silent Hill f doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC - and Konami says it'll have "plenty more to share in the future". Until then, there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag157nqMV0Q">new trailer</a>, which you can watch above.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f was one of four new Silent Hill games to be revealed back in 2022. PlayStation 5 freebie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-the-short-message-review">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s Silent Hill 2 Remake launched last year, and its fourth project, Silent Hill: Townfall, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">being developed by Stories Untold and Observation developer No Code</a>. Annapurna Interactive is still set to serve as the latter game's publisher, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">a "mass exodus" of staff</a> at the end of last year.

It still deeply haunts me, and it still utterly fascinates me. It’s an honor to find myself involved with a series I have so many memories with. I’ve poured all my efforts into this story, so much so that I don’t think I would mind if it was the last thing I ever wrote. To me, the <em>Silent Hill</em> series is more than just a collection of stories, it’s a medium; an amazing, phenomenal way of exploring and experiencing a person’s heart and mind. It’s my hope that players out there will come to appreciate it in the same way. And to all of our overseas friends, I hope you’ll enjoy a look at what <em>Silent Hill</em> might be like if set somewhere a little different, like Japan.”</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Creature [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a> and Character Designer <a href="https://twitter.com/kera_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kera</a></strong> – “I love the <em>Silent Hill</em> series, and it’s been a big influence on me. In particular, I am constantly remembering <em><a title="Games > Silent Hill 2 (2024) [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/silent-hill-2-2024">Silent Hill 2</a></em>, and the messages on the walls, the music, and the monster designs. So, when it came to <em>Silent Hill f</em>, and bringing the setting to Japan, we had to come up with something that felt just a little different, and I had to really think about how to get that feeling. The monster designs were the hardest. I had to consider everything that’s come in <em>Silent Hill</em> before, and figure out how to take this game in a different direction, but still be <em>Silent Hill</em>. It might not be the exact same blood-smeared, rusting scenery, but I sincerely hope you’ll enjoy our vision and the world we’ve created.”</li><li><strong>Composer <a href="https://twitter.com/akirayamaoka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Akira Yamaoka</a></strong>&nbsp;– “Although this is set in Japan, we focused on portraying it in a way that is based solely on the conception of <em>Silent Hill</em>. While incorporating plenty of Japan’s unique identity, we sublimated it as fiction and expressed this unique culture as entertainment. By doing so, we believe we were able to blend the charm of Japan in a new way into the unique worldview of <em>Silent Hill</em>. We hope that through this game, you will enjoy the look and feel of what makes this title truly <em>Silent Hill</em>.”</li><li><strong>Composer <a href="https://twitter.com/ken_inage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kensuke Inage</a></strong> – “The first time I played <em>Silent Hill</em> was about 20 years back. I’m extremely honored to have been offered such a great opportunity for a series with a rich history. I was in charge of composing the music for the Otherworld, known in this game as the ‘Dark Shrine.’ I have composed music for an unsettling yet beautiful world that uses imagery from shrines, blending ancient Japanese court music with ambient echoes. I wove in various techniques that will connect the player to the protagonist’s agony, internal conflict, fear, and other emotions. I hope you get to experience it for yourself in the game.”</li></ul><p>*Other composers include&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/higu_dai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dai</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://twitter.com/xaki_k_sakita" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xaki</a>.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p>This game contains depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence.</p><p>This game is set in Japan in the 1960s and contains depictions based on the customs and culture of that time.

                <p>Velan Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/midnight-murder-club/" data-ref-id="5000-633798">Midnight Murder Club</a> is now in early access on PC and PS5.. And as part of the pitch to gamers, only one player has to actually has to actually own Midnight Murder Club in order to invite up to five others playing via the game's Guest Pass Edition. </p><p>Unlike some other PvP shooters, Midnight Murder Club drops 1-6 players into a large estate called Wormwood Manor without the benefit of lights. Players will have to rely on their own flashlights, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/midnight-murder-club-preview/1100-6524984/" data-ref-id="1100-6524984">proximity chat</a>, or the flash of gunfire to come out on top. That leads to a very lethal game of hide-and-seek.</p><p>Velan Studios recently unveiled Midnight Murder Club's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/midnight-murder-club-hits-early-access-in-march-includes-guest-pass/1100-6529746/" data-ref-id="1100-6529746">Wildcards mode</a>, which gives players the ability to rewrite reality thanks to some special cards. When players pick cards from their collection, they can be given special abilities like super speed or the power to self-detonate upon death. Some of those powers will extend to the other players in the match as well. At the end of each round, players are given new cards to experiment with, and they won't necessarily get the same powers again.</p><p>Players can join the early-access game for $20 starting on PS5 or PC via Steam, and the Guest Pass Edition is available for free, which will come in handy for five of your buddies.</p>

<p>Everyone has a one or a few personal favorite heroes they lock in to win in Marvel Rivals, but the win rate data says that some are just plain better than others. While a higher win rate doesn’t automatically mean they’re a better hero, it’s certainly nothing to scoff at or take likely.</p>



<p>So which heroes in Marvel Rivals win the most? Let’s take a look at the top performing heroes according to win rate.</p>



<h2 id="h-hero-win-rates-in-marvel-rivals-march-2025-season-1-5">Hero Win Rates in Marvel Rivals (March 2025, Season 1.5)</h2>



<p>Similar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-popular-marvel-rivals-heroes-highest-pick-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our highest pick rates piece</a>, we’re taking into account competitive and quick play. For competitive play , we’re using current data from tracker sites&nbsp;<a href="https://rivalstracker.com/heroes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsTracker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsMeta</a>. For quickplay, we’re using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero Hot List</a>&nbsp;from the official Marvel Rivals website. Even though the Hero Hot List was last updated February 17th, it’s a better source of quickplay rates than the incomplete data on RivalsTracker and RivalsMeta.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Hero</strong></td><td><strong>Competitive Win Rate</strong></td><td><strong>Quick Play Win Rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Storm</td><td>54.29%</td><td>58.11%</td></tr><tr><td>Rocket Raccoon</td><td>54.04%</td><td>55.23%</td></tr><tr><td>Mantis</td><td>53.99%</td><td>55.65%</td></tr><tr><td>Magik</td><td>52.60%</td><td>53.14%</td></tr><tr><td>Peni Parker</td><td>52.44%</td><td>54.82%</td></tr><tr><td>Thor</td><td>52.15%</td><td>54.71%</td></tr><tr><td>Adam Warlock</td><td>52.12%</td><td>52.42%</td></tr><tr><td>Captain America</td><td>51.92%</td><td>53.45%</td></tr><tr><td>Mister Fantastic</td><td>51.87%</td><td>53.99%</td></tr><tr><td>Loki</td><td>51.25%</td><td>52.55%</td></tr><tr><td>Hela</td><td>49.81%</td><td>50.07%</td></tr><tr><td>Star Lord</td><td>49.78%</td><td>49.15%</td></tr><tr><td>Groot</td><td>49.71%</td><td>50.32%</td></tr><tr><td>Black Panther</td><td>49.71%</td><td>49.89%</td></tr><tr><td>Hulk</td><td>49.70%</td><td>51.87%</td></tr><tr><td>Iron Fist</td><td>49.55%</td><td>49.95%</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Soldier</td><td>49.46%</td><td>50.38%</td></tr><tr><td>Spider Man</td><td>49.17%</td><td>49.45%</td></tr><tr><td>Venom</td><td>49.15%</td><td>50.08%</td></tr><tr><td>Scarlet Witch</td><td>49.10%</td><td>50.48%</td></tr><tr><td>Doctor Strange</td><td>49.01%</td><td>50.72%</td></tr><tr><td>Iron Man</td><td>48.80%</td><td>50.08%</td></tr><tr><td>Magneto</td><td>48.72%</td><td>50.43%</td></tr><tr><td>Psylocke</td><td>48.33%</td><td>50.17%</td></tr><tr><td>Invisible Woman</td><td>48.12%</td><td>50.17%</td></tr><tr><td>Wolverine</td><td>47.72%</td><td>49.41%</td></tr><tr><td>Cloak &amp; Dagger</td><td>47.39%</td><td>51.42%</td></tr><tr><td>Namor</td><td>47.33%</td><td>50.72%</td></tr><tr><td>The Punisher</td><td>47.29%</td><td>48.32%</td></tr><tr><td>Luna Snow</td><td>47.26%</td><td>48.97%</td></tr><tr><td>Squirrel Girl</td><td>46.77%</td><td>50.40%</td></tr><tr><td>Hawkeye</td><td>45.88%</td><td>44.63%</td></tr><tr><td>Moon Knight</td><td>44.83%</td><td>49.09%</td></tr><tr><td>Jeff The Land Shark</td><td>43.59%</td><td>44.61%</td></tr><tr><td>Black Widow</td><td>40.74%</td><td>42.31%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The Human Torch and The Thing have not been included because the quickplay win rates for them are not available yet.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-strategists">Best Strategists</h3>



<h4 id="h-rocket-raccoon">Rocket Raccoon</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rocket Raccoon’s sheer healing output and duelist-buffing teamup options establish him as the winningest strategist. He has a <strong>54.04% win rate in competitive, and a 55.23% win rate in quick play</strong>. His secondary fire healing can rapidly heal a group of allies stacked together, and both Punisher and Winter Soldier thrive when teamed with him. His damage amplifying ultimate also swings any teamfight in his side’s favor.</p>



<h4 id="h-mantis">Mantis</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mantis’ ability to provide healing and damage buffs, plus her individual firepower, make her on the same winning level as Rocket Raccoon. She has a <strong>53.99% win rate in competitive, and a 55.85% win rate in quick play</strong>. Mantis is especially strong at lower ranks, as her heals and buffs are easy to apply. She can also use her sleep and a personal damage boost to solo kill a squishy DPS that tries to challenge her.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-vanguards">Best Vanguards</h3>



<h4 id="h-peni-parker">Peni Parker</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Peni Parker is the winningest vanguard hero in Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>52.44% win rate in competitive, and a 54.82% win rate in quick play</strong>. Peni has arguably the best ranged damage capabilities of any vanguard, and she’s an infuriating nuisance to dig out of an objective once they get their mines down.</p>



<h4 id="h-thor">Thor</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thor has the second highest win rates of any vanguard in Marvel Rivals. He has a <strong>52.15% win rate in competitive, and a 54.71% win rate in quick play</strong>. Thor’s ability to close the distance and thrive in the chaos of a hectic teamfight translate into huge winning potential.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-duelists">Best Duelists</h3>



<h4 id="h-storm">Storm</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Storm is the winningest hero in all of Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>54.29% win rate in competitive, and a 58.11% win rate in quick play</strong>. Storm is a mobile, hard-to-hit, damage-dealing menace that can lead a teamfight with her thunderous Goddess Boost. There’s virtually no escape from her Omega Hurricane ultimate, especially when she can combo it with The Human Torch.</p>



<h4 id="h-magik">Magik</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Magik is the second most winning duelist in Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>52.60% win rate in competitive, and a 53.14% win rate in quick play</strong>. Magik is one of the few pure melee characters in the duelist class, dashing through portals and swinging her sword at anything in range.</p>

            <p>
Point-and-click fans rejoice! After a long (and, if you're me, impatient) wait, Wadjet Eye Games - the dependably brilliant studio behind the likes of Unavowed and the Blackwell series - is finally ready to share a release date for its intriguing time-travelling adventure, Old Skies. And it's close, launching for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Switch on 23th April.
</p>
<p>
Old Skies, which was originally announced all the way back in June 2022, cast players as Fia Quinn - a time agent for the ChronoZen agency who's been tasked with keeping a close eye on seven travellers as they take their own trips to the past. "Some are simply curious," explains Wadjet Eye. "Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they've all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it's vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It's only time travel, after all."
</p>
<p>
Seven travellers means seven distinct time periods spanning over 200 years of history to explore, with Old Skies taking players from speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age, and even the morning of September 11th where a murder is waiting to be solved. It's got paradoxes to escape, puzzles to overcome - some requiring a spot of temporal thinking - and even the possibility of your adventure coming to a fatal halt. Although, as Wadjet Eye notes, the whole time travel thing means death is not the end.

<p>
Away from the story stuff, Old Skies features some (by Wadjet Eye's standards) positively futuristic 1920x1080 artwork - it marks the first time the developer has eschewed the chunky, distinctly old-school pixels of its past adventures - as well as music by Unavowed composer Thomas Regin, and full voice acting from the studio's "largest cast yet". You can get a general idea of how all that comes together in the trailer above, and Wadjet Eye's also released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAQ9UMzqZUQ">new trailer focusing on one of Old Skies seven cases</a>.
</p>
<p>
So there you go! Old Skies launches on 23rd April via Switch's eShop and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1346360/Old_Skies/">Steam</a>. And speaking as big fan of Wadjet Eye's consistently excellent back catalogue (which, incidentally, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/WadjetEyeGames">currently cheap as chips thanks to the Steam Spring Sale</a>), I can't blimmin' wait.

Additionally, enemies you kill will not have death markers for their allies to see.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll need to collect 1,800 clovers to unlock Low Profile.</p><p dir="ltr">Additional rewards for Clover Craze include a leprechaun weapon charm, calling card, spray, emblem, and the final "Mastery" event reward is a St Patrick's Day-themed weapon blueprint for the Ames 85 assault rifle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kcd-2-patch-1-2-out-now-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Warhorse Studios has published patch 1.2 in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, the stellar open-world RPG that was released last month. This update is gargantuan, coming in at a whopping 62 GB on PC – and comparable sizes on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox. It adds a few nice touches to the game but, more importantly, addresses <strong>more than 1,000 bug fixes</strong>.</p>



<p>Check out the key inclusions of patch 1.2 in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kcd2-1-2-patch-notes">KCD2 1.2 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>I’m not going to list the <strong>full patch notes </strong>for the 1.2 patch for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, or we’d be here all day.</p>



<p>Instead, I’ll invite you to hop over to Warhorse Studios’ site to <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">check the full breakdown</a> of the 1,000+ bug fixes, improvements, and quality-of-life adjustments.</p>



<p>At the top of the table with patch 1.2 sits the addition of the barber mode, which players can take advantage of in Zhelejov and Kuttenberg. With this new feature, you can adjust Henry’s hair and beard, further customising him as you see fit. It’s purely a cosmetic upgrade, though – it doesn’t have any bearing on the game itself.</p>



<p>Here are some of the key bug fixes addressed in the 1.2 patch for Kingdom Come 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Players no longer die randomly after exiting a cart (very important stuff)</li>



<li>Multi-hit combos will now do more damage</li>



<li>Difficulty has been balanced across pickpocketing, lockpicking, stealth, bartering, and more</li>



<li>NPC daily schedules have been improved across the entire game (including tweaking the <strong>sweeping </strong>animation!)</li>



<li>‘Generally improved’ environment across both maps, including improving the look of Trosky Castle from further away</li>



<li>Improved road magnetism when riding a horse</li>



<li>Improved frame rate and performance in battles and built-up areas like Kuttenberg’s marketplaces</li>



<li>Shops no longer sell cobwebs (damn)</li>



<li>DLSS 4 Super Resolution can be enabled</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, even the full patch notes stress that hundreds of other fixes aren’t mentioned in the report. This is one of the single biggest updates I’ve ever seen for the sheer number of issues it addresses. I can’t possibly think what might remain in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 that would need patching in the next update!</p>



<p>Have you played Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 yet? Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Focus Entertainment has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-3">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3</a> development has begun, which is great news for fans of one of the biggest hits of 2024.</p>
<p>“Your duty is not done,” the company writes on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/focus-entmt.com/post/3lkbkal3ils2k">BlueSky</a>. “We’re pleased to announce that the development for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 has officially begun at Focus Entertainment, Saber Interactive and Games Workshop.”</p>


<p>“Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games,” they add. “We will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment.”</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note how Focus frames the game’s development as being a collaboration between the three companies. This comes a few weeks after it was announced quite specifically that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/space-marine-2-devs-saber-and-hasbro-partner-for-a-tentpole-aaa-game/">Hasbro has signed the Space Marine 2 team</a> to develop one of their tentpole franchises into a game. There’s a lot of flexibility in how studios work these days, so Saber’s St. Petersburg studio could have multiple teams and new creative leads could be stepping up to work on Space Marine 3 while the old leads look to crack this new nut.</p>
<p>Either way, it will be a while before we actually get to see Space Marine 3, and if you were worried that Space Marine 2 would be dropped like an unloved toy from yesteryear, Focus have assured players that there is still plenty of support for that game to come, continuing on with the planned post-launch support roadmap.</p>

<p>They followed up, “We’ll share updates on this new title when the time is right. For now, our focus remains on delivering the best possible experience for Space Marine 2 players.”</p>
<p>There’s already been the dangled thread&nbsp;that support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> could continue after the end of the current roadmap. Back in February, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/06/space-marine-2-february-update-brings-the-datavault-tyranid-biovore/">on the cusp of Season 3 of content, the team said</a>, “Worry not, even if this roadmap ends in 2025, that doesn’t mean the game will not receive new content after that!”</p>
<p>Of course, it’s easy to start speculating what kind of challenge you’ll have to face when Space Marine 3 arrives. After battling Orks and Chaos in the first, Relic Entertainment developed game, Saber used their Swarm engine to great effect to let you fight Tyranids… and also Chaos – which the developers admitted was something they wished they hadn’t repeated. However, there were also teasers of other alien races sprinkled through Space Marine 2, with the appearance of Necron tombs hinting that these ancient robotic beings could be opponents in future…. and hopefully not Chaos again.</p>
<p>Even with that foible, Space Marine 2 goes down a treat for fans of Warhammer 40,000 in particular. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-first-hands-on-preview-the-new-dual-front-mode-reinvigorates-the-10-year-old-fps<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was in high school, I would stay up ‘til all kinds of ungodly hours of the night playing PC games. I even stayed up five days straight once, just to get to the end of Baldur’s Gate II ‘Throne of Bhaal,’ but what fascinated me about PC games most was how inventive they could be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One that struck my imagination powerfully was Red Faction, which caught my eye because it had some of the hallmarks of DOOM (a high-tech, first-person shooter set on Mars, you say?) yet it added an essential wrinkle; terrain deformation. Red Faction is set in the mines of Mars, and I could fire explosive weapons at walls, creating holes or destroying them, and even tunneling through rock to circumvent checkpoints. It was all about charting your own course and finding your own path to accomplish your goals. It was incredible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, not a lot has been done with that idea in the intervening years, but when Rainbow Six Siege came out, the ability to freely climb and rappel up and down buildings, and shoot through or destroy walls and ceilings sent a delightful little tickle through my Red Faction-loving brain.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Siege began as a far more focused (and less exploratory) affair than the old Volition shooter, that (and quite a bit more) is about to change with the arrival of the upcoming Siege X update. Apart from gameplay, graphical, auditory, and UI enhancements, it introduces what is shaping up to be a fantastic new permanent multiplayer mode: Dual Front. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Dual Front, a predetermined seasonal Operator pool will dictate who you can play, and team sizes are bumped up to six per side. Instead of spawning directly inside (or outside) one target area, there are three large areas to choose from, each with its own objective, so your team of six will need to split up to focus on both defending and attacking different locations simultaneously. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the scope has expanded, much of the great core gameplay remains the same. When a match starts, each team will spawn in their squad HQ and one of two locations in your team’s sector will start a countdown to a Defend mission. The     is true for your opponents, so each team will need to defend one spot while attacking another. How you handle that, and where you decide to go, is up to you.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rainbow Six Siege X: Dual Front Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s more, there is a neutral zone in between the mirrored zones held by each team, and extra objectives will appear there. Completing those objectives, such as rescuing a hostage and getting them to an extraction point, will give your team a big boost in the back-and-forth struggle for supremacy, so even if you fail to defend your first location or attack the enemy base, victory is still possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Dual Front expands the contested space so significantly, I was moving between attacking and defending to suit the team's needs, creating a more free flowing experience with way more variation between matches than your standard Siege match. What results is a fluid, chaotic mess I had a blast with.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dual Front Mode is, so far, a fluid, chaotic mess I had a blast with.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The seasonal Operator pools will be updated every month, and because your squad will need to do a little bit of everything, you’ll have access to both Attacker and Defender Operators on the character select screen. When you die during a match, you’ll quickly respawn and re-select your Operator, so changing strategies on the fly to counter your enemies is a central (and delightfully fun) part of the game now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Several times during my preview, it looked like my current (attacking) team was in a great spot, so I would rush across the map to help my other beleaguered comrades who were fighting for their lives to defend our own base objective. Sometimes, everything was as it seemed: I arrived in time, and our team brought home a victory. Other times, I got separated from my team only for them to be ambushed by reinforcements. Each match was tense, because in maps as large as Dual Front’s, it’s difficult to know where the enemy is until they become a capital “p” Problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of navigating larger areas, I should mention some of the new gameplay additions. You can now rappel around corners of buildings and even sprint while rappelling, so it’s easier to poke around and find ways to get inside structures. New fire extinguishers create concussive blasts and visual obfuscation when destroyed, gas pipes can be shot or damaged to create jets of fire before exploding and scattering fire around on the ground, and metal detectors can be disabled temporarily or permanently. Overall, it’s more fun to play in the space, and there is a lot more space to play in on Dual Front’s mirrored map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege X also marks a shift in monetization. After the update, Siege will adopt a free-to-play model, and for casual versus competitive stuff, here’s the skinny: casual and onboarding playlists, unranked quickplay, and Dual Front are all free, and will grant access to up to 26 Operators and skins. Siege Cup and Ranked modes will be pay-to-unlock, and grant access to all 50 Operators. So if you are jumping in as a casual player, there are no barriers to entry, but new players who want to get more serious on the competitive side will need to fork over some cash. If you already have Siege, don’t worry; you will keep everything you have, and retain access to all modes (and as an added bonus, Siege players will get a badge showing off the year they started and a little bonus for each year of Siege they played).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some other updates in the Siege X package include five modernized maps (Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Kafe, and Border), enhanced visuals, audio, first-person shadows, new menus, better player onboarding, the ability to inspect weapons, and a lot more. The dev team has also committed to introduce a new Operator (or remastering an existing one) each season, and a bunch more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But all those enhancements pale in comparison to Dual Front, which is on track to become my favorite mode for Siege, and once Siege X launches, it’s likely to be the only mode I’ll play as Siege marks its upcoming tenth birthday in an incredibly fun way.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-hits-2-million-sales-after-just-1-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hazelight Games says its latest co-op adventure game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction"><u>Split Fiction</u></a> is continuing its roaring start after selling 2 million copies in just one week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The dual-protagonist story dropped March 6 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S and quickly managed to secure itself as yet another success story for the studio. Hazelight took <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1900204006451925484" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to social media</a> to celebrate the strong launch, saying that it’s “blown away” by the support from fans both new and old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team’s previous update on Split Fiction sales numbers revealed that a whopping 1 million players picked up Mio and Zoe’s sci-fi story <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-sells-one-million-copies-in-48-hours"><u>only 48 hours after its initial launch</u></a>. That means another million have each picked up a copy in the five days since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Split Fiction’s status as a co-op game means the actual number of players engaging with the experience is surely much higher than the number of copies sold. Bolstering its impact with gaming fans is its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/features/friends-pass-pc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Friend’s Pass</u></a> feature, which allows one player to purchase the game while granting a friend access at no additional cost. As Hazelight’s adventure continues to make waves on social media, that 2 million sold number will surely only increase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hazelight’s previous title, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-winners-revealed"><u>2021 Game of the Year winner It Takes Two</u></a>, saw similar success after selling around <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-selling-1-million-copies-shows-that-players-want-co-op-only-games-josef-fares-says"><u>1 million copies a few weeks after its launch</u></a> in March 2021. That number ballooned to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-sells-5-million-copies"><u>10 million copies</u></a> by February 2023 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-crosses-20-million-copies-sold-as-creator-teases-next-project"><u>20 million</u></a> by October 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review"><u>IGN's Split Fiction review</u></a>, we called it “an expertly crafted co-op adventure that pinballs from one genre extreme to another.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

You've come to the right place. Below, you'll find all the currently active codes in Roblox's adorable evolution game, as well as a rundown of exactly how to redeem them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/12/screenshot-2025-03-12-194821-1741809571818.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Active Capybara Evolution Codes (March 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Below, you'll find all of the currently active and working Capybara Evolution codes in March 2025 that you can redeem for free rewards:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Brrrra</strong> - 2x EXP Potion (<strong>NEW!</strong>)</li><li><strong>NEWUPD1</strong> - 1 EXP Potion</li><li><strong>capycode289</strong> - 1x EXP Potion</li><li><strong>I2PERFECT</strong> - 1x EXP Potion</li><li><strong>Release</strong> - 1x Wins Potion</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Redeem Codes in Capybara Evolution</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/12/roblox-capybara-evolution-redeeming-codes-1741810119825.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To redeem Capybara Evolution codes, boot up the game and, once you’re in, follow the steps below:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Look in the bottom right-hand corner of the page and you'll see a <strong>flyer icon</strong>.

The first is that the Capybara Evolution code was inputted incorrectly. Check the spelling and that the case is correct, then redeem again. You can even copy and paste the codes directly from this article over to Roblox if you want to make sure you’re inputting them correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other possibility is the code has expired or you’ve already used it.

You can also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@i2Perfect/videos" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">i2Perfect's YouTube Channel</a>, where the creator posts clips that reveal secret codes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Capybara Evolution in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Capybara Evolution drops players into a colourful world as a tiny capybara with a single mission: evolve. Surrounded by formidable creatures, they must battle to level up and transform their capybara, making their way up the food chain across a variety of different worlds. To aid in their battle, they can purchase eggs that hatch into pets, which will help them take down stronger enemies and ascend to the ultimate capybara life form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.
