            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> developers 11 bit studios have cancelled a new, console-oriented game in response to both "shifting market trends" - in particular, declining player enthusiasm for "narrative-driven, story-rich games" - and specific problems during development. As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As detailed in an <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8">investor release this week</a>, the cancelled game was known as Project 8 internally, and had 37 team members as of September 2024. For context, 11 bit studios currently have over 150 staff, according to their <a href="https://11bitstudios.recruitee.com/">recruitment site</a>. It began development in early 2018, with total development costs of about 48.4 million zloties  - around 9.4 million pounds or 11.8 million dollars - by this September.
</p>
<p>
"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting," 11 bit's president of the management board Przemysław Marszał observes in a release. "However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal."
</p>
<p>
Gloominess about the layoffs aside, I'm predictably both intrigued and worried that 11 bit think there's less interest now in games with a pronounced narrative component. Then again, the reasons for the cancellation aren't all macroeconomical. "With Project 8, we experienced both breakthroughs and setbacks," Marszał went on. "During the COVID-19 pandemic, stabilising the development team proved particularly difficult, yet progress continued.
</p>
<p>
"While we achieved noticeable quality improvements in certain areas, several critical aspects of the game and its development process remained problematic despite multiple iterations," he said. "Over time, delays accumulated, and with each milestone, the project's budget grew."
</p>
<p>
During the unannounced game's last project milestone review, Marszał explained, "our findings revealed unresolved issues and challenges that would require further extensions of the production timeline and corresponding budget increases to address. This, coupled with revised sales forecasts, largely reflecting the changing market environment, raised significant doubts about the project's overall profitability."
</p><p>
It's not yet clear how many people will be laid off thanks to the cancellation, as it'll be a "phased" reduction. Marszał did specify that "more than half" of the Project 8 team will "be offered opportunities to transition to other existing teams or to new, as-yet-unannounced initiatives". 
</p>
<p>
I wasn't aware 11 bit were working on a console-focussed game. Their recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> enthused many reviewers, though our own Sin Vega was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-2-review">pretty mixed on it</a>, and her conclusions chime with my misgivings at the preview stage.</p>
<p>I'm also not entirely sure what to make of next year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a>, a fancy sci-fi yarn in which you play a castaway who clones himself in order to operate a rolling space base, and then has to deal with his proportionately-multiplied psychological baggage. I think it'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-have-sex-with-yourself-in-the-alters-but-its-not-like-this-topic-is-totally-removed">memorable</a>, whatever happens. In-house projects aside, 11 bit have also published some wonderful third-party creations, including acerbic religious fable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indika">Indika</a> and fantasy reshelving sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I'd have been interested to see Project 8, assuming it also shipped on PC. Best of luck to everybody affected by the cancellation. Hopefully this will be 2024's final <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoff</a> post. It's certainly been <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">a long year</a>, and not just for video game developers.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-adventure-game-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-action-adventure-game-of-2024.1065504/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-adventure-game-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games as a medium is a home for all kinds of experiences and challenges, and the past decade has only seen that variety grow. But while we’re excited about games that break new boundaries, we’ll always have time for the classics, and there are few genres that feel quite as foundational as the action/adventure. Its roots go all the way back to the 1980s, and many of its formative games live on today, such as The Legend of Zelda and Prince of Persia – both of which saw new releases in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while the action/adventure genre is a long-standing core pillar of gaming, it has changed, morphed, and evolved over the years. While we still have the 2D side-scrollers of yesteryear, we also have new subgenres that make the most of new ideas. For example, this year’s Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 is not just a technical showstopper, but a significant rethink on the relationship between story, exploration, and combat. Meanwhile, we can’t ignore the huge impact FromSoftware’s games have had on the genre, and this year’s Stellar Blade and Black Myth: Wukong both take ideas from the Souls series and rewrite them to fit their own goals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what action-packed adventure through digital worlds stole our hearts this year? Only one can take the title of Best Action/Adventure Game of 2024, and so here’s what the IGN editorial team decided…   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Action / Adventure Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The IGN Awards are voted on by the entire IGN editorial team, and as you can imagine that means the final results reveal just how broad and varied our individual tastes in video games are (that will hardly come as a surprise, have you ever read the comment section of a review?) Naturally, some staff members vote for games that ultimately don’t prove popular enough to make it into a category’s finals, and we don’t want to leave those votes unacknowledged. In this case, we’d like to make honorable mentions for two sword-slashing epics: Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 and Rise of the Ronin. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-hellblade-2-1734457971619.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While not to everyone’s tastes, it’s easy to see why some people have come to adore Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2. It’s a graphical powerhouse, for sure, but it's the atmosphere those visuals generate that’s the real thing to be impressed by. It helps ground you in Senua’s challenging, hostile world – a land further brought to life by incredible audio design. Hellblade 2 is a narrow, focused adventure that almost comes across as an interactive movie more than it does an action game. But it's that focus that allows developer Ninja Theory to really deliver on its ambition of exploring the mental health issues that form the bedrock of this darkly personal-yet-cinematic series. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-rise-of-the-ronin-1734457989292.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In contrast to Senua’s small, contained journey is Team Ninja’s Rise of the Ronin, a massive open-world adventure set during the final years of Japan’s Edo period. It draws on many of the refined, Soulsian ideas established in the studio’s Nioh games, but retools them to create a much more expansive, somewhat easier-going experience. Make no mistake, this is still an action game in which sword stances, parries, and careful positioning are still vital, but the sprawling map allows for a very different approach to similar challenges while also offering up many new ideas and Assassin’s Creed-flavoured exploration. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Black Myth: Wukong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-black-myth-wukong-1734458004791.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After years of impressive trailers and a strong showing at Gamescom 2023, Black Myth: Wukong arrived this year to a warm reception. It’s safe to say it has been one of, if not the most talked-about new game of the year, and for good reason: its boss-rush design allows it to put its best foot forward and showcase some exceptional combat. While certainly displaying some of the hallmarks of FromSoft-style battle, including limited health potions and careful observation of an enemy’s moveset, Black Myth: Wukong has its own original ideas to contribute to the action scene. Among the most interesting is the ability to momentarily transform into an enemy you’ve defeated on your travels, allowing you to become a giant frog that can slap your target with its elastic tongue; a shield-bearing warrior who can tank damage; or even a fiery wolf guardian with a unique moveset. These, along with other mystical abilities, help define Black Myth’s exciting approach to combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the boss battles, though, developer Game Science’s latest is an exciting journey through a culture that rarely enjoys the AAA limelight. Black Myth: Wukong is unapologetically Chinese. It adapts and continues Journey to the West, and so is dense with classic Chinese mythology that may not be familiar to Western audiences brought up on American, European, and Japanese games. It’s this that allows Black Myth: Wukong to feel like something of a new, exciting frontier: while its gameplay may be Souls-ish and its gear system parallels God of War’s, its universe and storytelling are entirely its own. At least until the next Chinese AAA that hits big on the worldwide stage, that is.       </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Stellar Blade</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-stellar-blade-v2-1734458020027.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade is yet another action game victory for an East Asian developer. Created by South Korean studio Shift Up, Stellar Blade’s combat design is as razor sharp as its visuals – fast, responsive, and immensely rewarding. It too draws on FromSoftware for inspiration (in this case the fierce parry action of Sekiro) but blends that challenge with a stylish, ability-driven approach that combines sword strikes with grenades and guns. The result is an absolute blast, especially when it comes to the cinematic showdowns with grotesque Alpha Naytiba bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While both fans and Yoko Taro himself have recognised Stellar Blade’s relationship to Nier Automata, it’s also worth mentioning the game’s fascination with The Matrix – an influence that not only informs ship designs and place names, but also the story’s philosophical approach to AI, machines, and the survival of the human race. Stellar Blade doesn’t quite live up to the lofty bar of its inspirations when it comes to story, but its biome-hopping adventure certainly asks questions in many of the right places.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-1734458035916.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There are, of course, two sides to the action/adventure genre. Where Stellar Blade and Black Myth: Wukong clearly go all-in on the action part, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle dedicates itself almost wholly to adventure. That’s not to say the folks at developer MachineGames haven’t put their famous Wolfenstein-honed anti-fascist skills to good use – you can’t have an Indiana Jones game without punching a Nazi every now and again, after all. But the Great Circle surprisingly has more in common with the likes of Broken Sword and Dishonored than it does Uncharted or Tomb Raider. It’s this surprisingly fresh approach to Dr. Jones’ digital adventures that makes the Great Circle feel so faithful to the films that inspired it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stepping into the shoes of Indy (as well as putting your head in his hat), you explore the corridors of the Vatican, tombs of the Ancient Egyptians, and rivers of Siam. Each intricately designed hub level is the canvass for organic exploration – the more you dig into an area’s history and secrets, the more it reveals its hidden pathways and undiscovered relics. While there’s always a main story mission that pushes towards the inevitable puzzle-filled tomb, each zone also offers up excellent “fieldwork” side missions that not only provide even more adventure and archaeology work, but neatly tie into the core story to provide a denser, more fulfilling experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games often claim they can make you really “feel” like their protagonists, but MachineGames absolutely scored the golden idol on this one: smart puzzles, a genuine sense of discovery, and a solid amount of stealth encounters-turned-whip-cracking battles ensures the Great Circle is one of the best action/adventure games of the year. Not only that, it’s also Indiana Jones’ best adventure since 1989. Now that’s something worthy of a place in a museum.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-1734458055928.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1989 designer Jordan Mechner created a revolutionary leap with Prince of Persia. A tricky adventure that combined 2D side-scrolling platforming with swashbuckling combat, it remains a cornerstone of video gaming’s foundations to this day. 35 years later, Ubisoft Montpellier created Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown; an excellent return to the series’ 2D roots and – in the IGN team’s opinion – the best action/adventure game of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many successful games with a long and storied legacy, The Lost Crown is a smart blend of the old and new. It pulls on the dastardly trap-filled level design of Mechner’s original game, but those lethal pathways have been extended and looped to create a modern, interconnected metroidvania map. This world provides a perfectly judged exploration challenge, allowing you the space to investigate every layer and corner while also frequently asking you to prove your skill in order to navigate through swinging pendulums and over deadly spike pits.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Excellent enemy design and parry-filled engagements ensures The Lost Crown feels like a sharp and satisfying combat challenge, especially when it comes to its centrepiece boss battles. Again, it's that blend of old and new – the swashbuckling blades of classic Prince of Persia, augmented with the supernatural smarts of The Sands of Time and the responsiveness of Hollow Knight – that makes The Lost Crown such a winner. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the game’s real secret weapon is perhaps its most simple addition to the formula: a camera. The campaign’s design leans on the locked gate traditions of classic metroidvanias, asking you to explore further and deeper in search of keys to those barriers. But that gameplay loop often results in doors being forgotten, the treasures behind them left unfound. But The Lost Crown allows you to snap a photo of a progress blocker and pin it to the map – a constant reminder of that place you couldn’t get into hours earlier. And so the moment you find the key, you’ll know exactly where you need to return. It’s a game-changer for the genre, and this feature alone would have been enough to secure The Lost Crown a space on this list. Combined with its many other achievements, though, this year’s Prince of Persia becomes a more-than-worthy winner of our award for the best action/adventure game of 2024.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

But thanks to Mew, every single deck in the game can now have its own version of Mewtwo ex, and one that can be activated quicker given its three Energy cost compared to Mewtwo ex's four.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can simply insert Mew ex into their decks and deploy it if coming up against a Mewtwo ex, removing its previously straightforward means of victory and, at the very least, allowing for a more dynamic match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewtwo ex decks will slot in Mew ex for the same reason, to have more control in the mirror match, and this already appears to be having a positive effect on the Pokémon TCG Pocket meta by injecting some diversity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The digital trading card game arrived October 30 and is a certified hit for Creatures Inc. and The Pokémon Company, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">having earned an estimated $200 million in its first month</a> across more than 60 million downloads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as Pokémon TCG Pocket follows the standard mobile and free to play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">outside of the occasional set drop like Mythical Island</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Speaking to Conner Mather (<a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/1868620511061627152" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GTA VI Countdown</a>), Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said the developers at Rockstar Games are trying to deliver something unexpected with GTA VI, even if that takes time.</p><p>"Our teams are focused on what's new that you haven't even thought about. You thought you were anticipating this thing but this is way bigger and way better and more exciting and more beautiful than you could have possibly thought of," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick said he understands that fans have become "a little frustrated" as Rockstar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">works in secrecy on GTA VI.</a> But he said Take-Two's philosophy is to "wait for a title to be ready" before releasing it.</p><p>"I think [GTA VI] will be extraordinary and worth waiting for," he said, adding that he expects GTA VI to be "breathtaking."</p><p>Of course, part of Zelnick's job is to hype his company's products and use all kinds of marketing speak and buzzwords to get people excited, so hearing him say all of this is no surprise.</p><p>Another noteworthy tidbit from the interview is that Zelnick said he is aware of the GTA VI memes about <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-got-x-before-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"We got ___ before GTA VI."</a> He said, "I've seen some of those."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R09uNAeQNdg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R09uNAeQNdg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>GTA VI is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">set for release in Fall 2025</a> on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.

Rival publishers are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-reportedly-waiting-for-gta-6-release-date-before-setting-their-own-2025-dates/1100-6528325/" data-ref-id="1100-6528325">reportedly waiting to assign dates to their own games</a> until Rockstar Games officially announces a release date for GTA VI.</p><p>In other news, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-reportedly-waiting-for-gta-6-release-date-before-setting-their-own-2025-dates/1100-6528325/" data-ref-id="1100-6528325">recent report</a> said that with GTA VI, "Rockstar is asking its writers to be less crude toward transgender people and other minorities."</p>

Arrowhead’s CEO made the argument that premium sets like the <em>Killzone </em>collaboration are how the company can afford to keep major updates, like the recent introduction <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355">of the Illuminate enemy faction, completely free</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="16ad83dcdf0f50c52c5e25c62311903d" data-recommend-id="image://16ad83dcdf0f50c52c5e25c62311903d" data-format="png" data-width="1105" data-height="141" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows comments from Arrowhead's CEO.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But many players felt like it was crossing a line and out of step with the game’s previous pattern of releasing new items as unlockable in $10 battle passes (which can be partly paid for with currency slowly accumulated in game). In fact, the <em>Killzone</em> set was originally supposed to be part of a Warbond, but the studio decided against that over concerns about a backlash to that as well. “Some of you are not happy with the prices of the items and we will revisit this,” the company responded in its latest update.</p><p>In addition to lengthening the stay of new crossover items in the shop’s monthly rotation, it sounds like Arrowhead is also looking at a way to have a secondary shop of items that never changes so that latecomers always have a chance to buy the more highly sought-after crossover merch. Some fans worried that this latest economic encroachment was due to publisher Sony’s meddling, but CEO Shams Jorjani said in the <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord that that wasn’t the case. “It’s a partnership but we are in the driving seat behind the decisions,” he wrote. “This one is on us.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Epic Games has had its share of legal victories over the years, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-wins-case-to-open-up-android-store-but-google-is-appealing/1100-6527001/" data-ref-id="1100-6527001">one over Google earlier in 2024</a>. But when it comes to the federal government, the United States Justice Department just came down on Epic Games for violating Section 8 of the Clayton Act, which was put in place to keep members of the board of one company from being able to serve in the same capacity on a competitor's board.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/tencent-removes-two-directors-epic-games-and-relinquishes-its-right-unilaterally-appoint" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Justice Department announced</a> that two members of Epic's board who were appointed by Tencent have voluntarily stepped down after the government raised the Clayton Act issue through its Antitrust Division. Tencent is a minority owner of Epic, and also the majority owner of Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends. Epic has since confirmed that the two departing board members are Ben Feder and David Wallerstein. Additionally, Tencent has relinquished its right to appoint any additional members to Epic's board of directors.</p><p>"Our relationship with Epic has always centered on making great games and delivering great experiences for players and developers," said a Tencent spokesperson. "We look forward to continuing to work with them on this shared vision."</p><p>Epic subsequently announced that Feder and Wallerstein will be replaced by "two new independent board members [who] will be nominated by committees of Epic's shareholders." Feder and Wallerstein will presumably retain their positions on Tencent's board.</p><p>Tencent is also a minority owner of Ubisoft, which is currently in negotiations with the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-co-founders-want-to-maintain-control-as-talks-with-tencent-continue-report/1100-6528283/" data-ref-id="1100-6528283">about a potential management buyout</a>. The Guillemot family--which owns the largest stake in Ubisoft--reportedly wants to maintain control of the company in any deal, while Ubisoft has been said to be in a "greater say on future board decisions" in exchange for any future investment in the company. For now, no deal between the two companies has been announced.</p><p>Earlier this week, Epic went to court <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-sues-fornite-tournament-cheater/1100-6528556/" data-ref-id="1100-6528556">to sue an alleged cheater</a>, whom the company claims has used unauthorized software to gain an unfair advantage during several of the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> tournaments, which allowed him to walk away with thousands of dollars in prize money.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-4k-30-fps-only/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 dock may have been designed to let the console run faster, but won't be able to output at smooth framerates at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>A Reddit user by the name of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NextHandheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextHandheld</a> allegedly has had access to the new console by Nintendo and has revealed some additional information on the system as well as on the dock and Joy-Con controller while also providing proof that their information has merit. Such proof, which includes pictures of the system's dock and the inside of a possible controller rail has also been provided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">The Verge</a>, which concluded that the leaker may be legit after talking with them as well.</p>
<p>While most of the information revealed by NextHandheld falls in line with other rumors and leaks that have been circulating online in the past few weeks, some of the information on the Nintendo Switch 2 dock, which was never shown in any of the previous leaks, is new. The picture of the dock shown to The Verge shows that it has big feet around the back so that it can be placed horizontally without blocking a potential set of vents. While no one would position the dock this way, these feet may have been placed in case the dock is accidentally knocked over to prevent overheating. And if vents are included in the dock, as the leaker seems to have confirmed, albeit cryptically, then there's a very good chance the console will run faster in docked mode. In addition, the leaker revealed that the dock is rated for 60W, while the Nintendo Switch 2 for 45W, values that are considerably higher than the original model, and that it will only output<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hgikth/comment/m2mwv50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 4K resolution at 30 frames per second,</a> which would definitely be disappointing if true.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, NextHandheld also revealed plenty of other information on the Nintendo Switch 2. You can find a summary of the information shared by the leaker on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hf06co/switch_2_ama_with_next_handheld_summarized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit. </a>Despite the proof the leaker has provided, we strongly suggest taking all the new information with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but there's been some chatter that its reveal could happen right after the new year begins. No matter when it is revealed and released, the console is projected to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sell-17-million-units/">most successful next-generation system</a>, something that will further solidify Nintendo's position as the console market leader for the next few years.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-review-an-amd-upgrade.1065444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Asus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24025592/asus-rog-zephyrus-14-16-strix-scar-laptops-ces-price-specs-impressions">overhauled its ROG Zephyrus gaming laptops</a> in 2024, giving them sleek, aluminum bodies and brilliant OLED screens. The Intel version of the ROG Zephyrus G16 looked like a potential MacBook Pro killer when it launched in February; it is thin, light, and powerful, but the Core Ultra 9 185H processor hampers battery life. Now that Asus has reissued the G16 with the latest flagship CPU from AMD, it has finally become an all-rounder with enough battery life to tote to the office.</p><p>This version of the Zephyrus G16 has the same Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU that powers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24215430/zenbook-s-16-2024-review-amd-ryzen-ai-laptop">Asus’ Zenbook S 16</a> to great effect. The better integrated graphics and improvements in efficiency and raw horsepower over Intel’s mobile Meteor Lake processors make the AMD model the clear winner. If only it weren’t so dang expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>Our $2,300 review unit, with an Nvidia RTX 4070 mobile GPU, is one of <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-ga605/wtb/">four G16 variants</a> with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU. There’s another 4070 model in white, with 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage for $2,300, while the least expensive version is $1,900 with an RTX 4060, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. More GPU power is only available on Intel models, with an <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-16-oled-240hz-gaming-laptop-intel-core-ultra-9-185h-32gb-ddr5-geforce-rtx-4080-1tb-ssd-platinum-white/6600365.p?cmp=RMX&amp;skuId=6600365">RTX 4080 option</a> at $2,700 and an RTX 4090 for $3,300. RAM is soldered to the motherboard, so it’s important to consider before purchasing.</p><p>Apart from the processor, and the jump to Wi-Fi 7 from Wi-Fi 6e, the AMD version of the G16 is nearly identical to the Intel version. Both use the same 0.59-inch-thick unibody aluminum chassis, ports, and 200-watt charging brick; the only visible difference is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24023809/microsoft-copilot-key-keyboard-windows-laptops-pcs">Copilot key</a> on the AMD model in place of the right-hand Ctrl key. The AMD version is also an ounce lighter at a scant 3.99 pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a solid basis for comparing the two G16s here. In search of a portable work machine I could also game on, I ditched my desktop and bought the Intel version of the G16, with an RTX 4070 and 16GB of RAM, in August. Since then, I’ve used it not only to work at home and in coffee shops but also to play all the games I’d normally play on my tower. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The OLED panel really makes the Armoury Crate software pop. </em></figcaption></p></div><p><h3>Brilliant display, semirestrained lighting</h3></p><p>Whichever processor and graphics card is inside, using the G16 is a rock-solid experience. There’s very little chassis flex except for the plate in the dead center of the keyboard, the lid lifts easily with a single finger, and screen wobble is minimal. But the 2560 x 1600, 240Hz OLED ROG Nebula Display steals the show. Thanks to the excellent motion clarity, color accuracy, and contrast, it’s just about the best screen you can find on a gaming laptop. The smaller <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison">Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</a> uses a 2880 x 1800 OLED panel, but it’s only 120Hz.</p><p>Asus factory calibrates the screen in each G16 and claims an average Delta E of under 1, a peak brightness of 500 nits, and 100 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color space. These are bold claims, but they largely hold up. I measured 100 percent coverage of the sRGB color space, 97.2 percent of Adobe RGB, and 99.9 of DCI-P3. Although maximum brightness in SDR only reached 397 nits, that’s plenty bright enough to use outdoors in the shade. HDR is even brighter, reaching 644 nits in a 10 percent window. The average Delta E, the difference between an expected value and what was measured, came in at only 0.17. This is an astoundingly accurate display and good enough for color-sensitive work.</p><p>Apart from the floating volume controls and dedicated Armoury Crate button above the F row, the minimalist design and keyboard layout are a change from the 2023 model and now look much more like those of Asus’ own Zenbook line. While the keys aren’t mechanical, the 1.5mm key travel is enough to stave off fatigue during long typing sessions. The spacebar is a bit stiff and can skip if tapped at the furthest edges, but it doesn’t happen often enough to become a problem.</p><div><figcaption><em>Slash Lighting: for when you’re only trying to be mildly distracting. </em></figcaption> <p><cite>Video by Jonathan Hilburg / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The Zephyrus G16’s appearance has taken a turn for the demure, but Asus couldn’t resist keeping some gamer flair. Gone is the addressable matrix of LEDs previously splashed across the back of ROG Zephyrus laptops, replaced with a diagonal strip of lighting that runs across the lid. Different Slash Lighting patterns are programmable in Armoury Crate, but the only color available is white.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The keyboard and trackpad are excellent, but the single RGB lighting zone might be underwhelming if you’re used to per-key customization.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The effect is underwhelming, and that extends to the keyboard. Despite the $2,000 price tag, all versions of the G16 are equipped with single-zone RGB backlighting, meaning that all keys will always be backlit with the same color and brightness. Competitors like the HP Omen Transcend 16 and Razer Blade 16 both offer per-key lighting. The exclusion here, combined with the Slash bar, feels like Asus is trying to toe the line between slim studio laptop and full gaming aesthetic, but the result feels unlikely to please either crowd.</p><p><h3>Gaming performance</h3></p><p>Despite the identical looks, the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU pulls ahead of the Intel Core Ultra 9 185H in every single synthetic benchmark. In most cases, it’s a small improvement in both single and multicore tasks, but AMD takes a whopping 20 percent single-core and 10 percent multicore lead in Geekbench 6.</p><p>That lead unfortunately doesn’t scale uniformly to gaming. It’s true that, at 1080p, where CPU differences are most obvious, the AMD version of the G16 puts up a commanding performance over Intel’s chip. Results are better across the board, with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 improving 14 percent in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, 13 percent in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and 12 percent in <em>Returnal</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Make no mistake, both the AMD and Intel versions of the G16 are capable gaming machines, and moving up to 1440p or the native 2560 x 1600 resolution erases any difference between the two. The bottleneck here is the GPU. While the RTX 4070 is still a capable mobile graphics card nearly two years after release, it can’t quite hit 60 frames per second in every game at maxed-out settings. Less demanding titles like <em>Elden Ring</em> will still run at 60fps on Ultra all day, but this midrange card shows its age in newer games.</p><p>Tweaking settings or enabling an upscaler like Nvidia’s DLSS in games that support it is a perfectly viable solution, and even the most demanding titles like <em>Alan Wake 2</em> are playable on the 4070 versions of the G16, with compromises. Running around Coffee World as Saga midway through the game, neither the AMD or Intel version could crack 60fps at 1440p or native resolution, and enabling DLSS at the Quality setting only delivered about 50 frames per second. The game becomes much more playable when settings are dropped to medium or frame generation is turned on.&nbsp;</p><p>Ray-tracing enthusiasts and those with 4K external monitors should consider the 4080 and 4090 models. Asus limits the RTX 4080 and 4090 to 115 watts of power draw to keep temps down, meaning a thicker laptop like the Razer Blade 16 with a 4090 in it will score about <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-laptops/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-review/">10 percent higher in Time Spy</a> than a G16 with a 4090, owing to its beefier cooling solution and higher power allowance of 175 watts. This is a negligible difference for most people, but diehards looking to wring out every ounce of performance will want to look elsewhere.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Look at that big, beautiful touchpad.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><h3>Integrated graphics and battery life</h3></p><p>AMD consistently dominates Intel in the integrated graphics department, and that hasn’t changed with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. The AMD Radeon 890M is the most powerful integrated GPU on the market and can deliver solid 1080p gaming performance even on battery power — it’s no wonder that <a href="https://ayaneo.co/ayaneo-3-all-you-need-to-know/">Ayaneo</a> and other manufacturers are using the chip in their newest gaming handhelds.&nbsp;</p><p>Playing <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> at 1080p on battery power using integrated graphics is a surprisingly great experience. The benchmark returned 40 frames per second with everything set to its maximum, and dropping the settings to high and enabling Intel’s XeSS upscaling netted 47fps. The APU — as AMD calls its CPUs with integrated graphics — pulls 42 watts with this setup, meaning about an hour and a half of runtime despite the G16’s large 90Wh battery. With a custom power profile that limits the APU to 25 watts total (more granular control is available with open-source Armoury Crate alternatives like <a href="https://github.com/seerge/g-helper">G-Helper</a>), the results were about the same but stretched the battery life to two hours.&nbsp;</p><p>Even heavier titles like <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>are playable on integrated graphics. With the 25-watt cap in place, I recorded 47fps in the benchmark with everything set to Medium and AMD’s FSR upscaler set to Balanced and the same 1.5-hour runtime as <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. The Arc Graphics on the Intel Core Ultra 9 185H will play 2D and lighter indie games just fine, but it can’t crack 30fps in the above games at the same settings.&nbsp;</p><p>This makes the integrated GPU a compelling option if you’re away from wall power. Running <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>on the RTX 4070 with high settings at 1080p got a frame rate of 60fps and a scant 45 minutes of playtime. Locking the game<em> </em>to a 30fps cap and medium settings at 1080p results in one hour, 20 minutes of battery life.&nbsp;Gaming on integrated graphics might be the solution for those who want to leave the bulky 200W charger at home and travel with a USB-C wall wart (up to 100 watts) instead.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The area just above the keyboard here isn’t quite as hot as it is on the Intel version.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><h3>AMD pushes battery life further</h3></p><p>Battery life outside of gaming is the main reason to consider the AMD version of the G16. The Intel Core Ultra 9 185H model offers about six to seven hours of real-world use, which is fine for most people but won’t make it through an entire workday. The AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 is simply more efficient, lasting about nine hours in real-world use. That extra three hours pushes the G16 out of the realm of typical gaming laptops and closer to productivity machines like the Zenbook S 16 or the Dell XPS 16.</p><p>A more efficient processor means less heat, which was (and is) the G16’s Achilles’ heel. Having lived with, gamed on, and typed more articles than I can count on the Intel version, I can confidently say that this is a spicy laptop — so much so that the underside gets uncomfortably hot when gaming on the 4070, even using the Silent power profile (which restricts power to the CPU and GPU and cuts fan noise accordingly), and the area right above the keyboard on the Intel version reaches a scorching 123 degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp;</p><p>The AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 thermal throttles at 95 degrees Celsius like its Intel-based cousin when under load, but no point on the chassis registered over 120 degrees during testing. Running around the titular city in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> using the Turbo power profile no longer results in a burned lap. Cooler temps might let the CPU boost higher, but it would still be constrained by the relatively modest 200-watt overall power limit.&nbsp;</p><p><h3>Asus falls down on software</h3></p><p>I’ve been singing the G16’s praises for most of this review, but the sacrifices Asus undertook to make a gaming laptop this portable are glaring, even if they might not affect day-to-day use. Repairability and upgradability are next to nil. Storage is easy to upgrade, and there’s a second 2280 M.2 slot, but the RAM is soldered to the motherboard in all versions. (Which is unfortunately the norm in laptops this thin. Look to thicker competitors with socketed DDR5 RAM, like the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/alienware-m16-r2-gaming-laptop/spd/alienware-m16-r2-laptop">Alienware m16 R2</a>, if you want the option to upgrade later.) If the 16GB offered by the base configuration isn’t enough, you’ll have to pony up an extra $300 at minimum for a model with 32GB and can’t go higher from there.&nbsp;</p><p>Software has never been Asus’ strong suit, and Armoury Crate continues to be Armoury Crate: laggy but serviceable enough for most people. Manually disabling the dedicated graphics in Armoury Crate is the best way to optimize battery life, but often, it requires closing all programs using the 4070, trying again, then closing and reopening Armoury Crate to actually make the change. I’ve also noticed that the G16 sometimes fails to wake properly if set to hibernate while plugged in and then reawoken on battery.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of the battery, the only way to enable Battery Care mode, which caps the battery at 80 percent charge to prolong its life, is through the MyAsus app, an entirely separate control panel you have to register for to use. Being prompted to sign up and make an account as part of the Windows 11 setup feels extra intrusive.</p><p><h3>The G16 is the one to beat, if it’s on sale</h3></p><p>Asus succeeds in delivering a great machine for gamers who don’t want their laptops to live on their desk, as well as content creators. The color-accurate, high refresh rate screen looks fantastic displaying any type of content, the speakers are just about the best you can find on a Windows laptop, and the port selection, especially the full-sized SD card reader, is good enough for photographers and video editors, though the lack of an ethernet jack is conspicuous. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>Left ports: power, HDMI 2.1, USB4 (40Gbps, with DP 1.4 and 100W power input), USB-A 3.2 (10Gbps), combo audio.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>On the right, a full-sized SD card slot, USB-A 3.2 port (10Gbps), and USB-C 3.2 (10Gbps, with DP 1.4 and 100W power delivery). </em></figcaption></p></div><p>The price remains the biggest sticking point for either model of the G16. I’ve seen the Intel version on sale for as low as $1,400, which undercuts less expensive, chunkier competitors with similar specs like the Alienware m16 R2 or the Lenovo Legion Pro 5i and even Asus’ own ProArt line aimed squarely at artists. A 16-inch ProArt P16 configured with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU, RTX 4070, 32GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage but a 4K, 60Hz screen and slightly thicker chassis costs $2,300, while the comparably equipped G16 has recently been on sale for $1,999.&nbsp;</p><p>Not that $2,000 for a laptop with an RTX 4070 inside is an objectively good deal when 4080-equipped devices fall below that mark on sale. The Intel version of the G16 provides the best value, especially when it drops below $1,500. Best Buy frequently lists open-box models for as low as $1,100, even cheaper than the smaller G14 with an RTX 4060. Whether the extra three hours of battery life is worth up to $900 more is subjective and depends on how frequently you travel, though most people will be better served by saving that money and throwing a USB-C charger in their bag to keep the G16 topped off.</p><p>Of course, this might be a moot point. It’s rumored that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264418/nvidia-ces-2025-keynote-rtx-5090-rumors">Nvidia will debut its latest 5000-series RTX graphics cards at CES 2025,</a> and manufacturers including Asus will launch revamped laptops soon after, although concrete details haven’t been confirmed yet. If the RTX 5070 isn’t a substantial improvement over the current generation and Asus launches a new version of the G16, keep an eye out for deep discounts on the 2024 models. Both versions of the G16 are objectively good all-around laptops, but at price parity, the AMD model wins out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The announcement of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>'s Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">Speaking to Eurogamer this week</a>, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The specific section of the interview in question begins with Weber noting that, in the original Witcher books from Andrzej Sapkowski, Ciri is repeatedly described as a witcher, so you're all out of luck if you're arguing against her protagonism on the basis that it disagrees with the source material. He and Kalemba acknowledge that, yes, fair enough, Geralt is a good laugh and some people would love to have him back, but Ciri is already playable at points in The Witcher 3, and CD Projekt want to see what more they can do with her.
</p>
<p>
"I think for me, and I think for all of us [at CDPR], it's also just really exciting to see all the opportunities that Ciri brings us, both with her character, and also by just virtue of who she is, what we can do with her in terms of the gameplay as well," Weber said. "So I think the best answer for us, for those people that really are worried right now, is basically to show them, when we are ready, that we really do this well and with care."
</p><p>
Did CD Projekt consider introducing a custom Witcher 4 protagonist, Eurogamer asked, as in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>? "I think, honestly, this character-driven storytelling has been always in the DNA of our Witcher games," said Weber. "First with Geralt, and then, of course, we started setting up Ciri as a second protagonist in The Witcher 3, and now we want to continue with her as well." 
</p>
<p>
Weber added that what makes Ciri an intriguing choice of protag is partly that she <em>isn't</em> quite a witcher. She might not be a fully customisable character, but she has room to grow where grizzly Ger had already nailed down his Eastwoodian outsider persona by the time he became a video game leading man.
</p>
<p>
"One of the things that makes Ciri into an interesting new protagonist for us is, of course, also that she is at the beginning of her journey as a witcher," said Weber. "So as an example, Geralt was very, very experienced already. He went through so many things. And, you know, he created his own code, his value of neutrality, he created through so many experiences. And Ciri still has to make many of those experiences. She has to go through so many of these things. 
</p>
<p>
"So in a way, even though Ciri is, of course, a defined character, with her, players will have the opportunity to still define her quite a bit more, specifically define the path that she will take on her way to becoming a witcher, and basically also what kind of person that will make her."
</p><p>
Naturally, Ciri also promises to bring a fresh perspective to the broadly misogynistic, alternately sensitive and pervy universe of The Witcher, a video game series that once let you collect porno cards for female characters, and still loves to make a spectacle of its nubile sorceresses.
</p>
<p>
"I mean, I would say the world of The Witcher is a really dark one that's really inspired by, of course, dark fantasy folklore," Weber commented, when asked about the game's portrayal of gender politics and sexism. "But also medieval to early Renaissance history, and that is a world that was tough - tough for many different groups, women among them. As an example, in The Witcher, we also deal a lot with racism when it comes to non-humans, and this is something that we want to keep up with The Witcher 4. I think it's something that has always been really important. 
</p>
<p>
"We make games for adults, and it also means that we tackle some difficult topics," he suggested. "We tackle them in interesting ways. We tackle them without giving easy answers, but often opening difficult questions that players have to answer. And I think some of those questions might be going in this direction as well, because, yeah, Ciri is a woman, and as a witcher in this world, this is an unusual state. So I don't think it's going to be this story everywhere, but since this is a part of this world, and we want to tackle so many of those different themes, it's definitely also going to appear there as well."
</p>
<p>
There's also the tiniest snippet of hand-wavey commentary on the question of Ciri's various supernatural capabilities, and how they might disrupt the quest design and slash-dodge-aard combat of The Witcher 3. Will Ciri begin The Witcher 4 in a low-power state, without the kinds of abilities she acquired in The Witcher 3, pressed Eurogamer? CD Projekt don't have anything to share for the moment. 
</p><p>
"No, we cannot tell you exactly how," said Kalemba. "But we can tell you just, like, believe us: that was one of the things, or first things, that we were solving, to make sure - the way we develop here, we do not leave anything without a clear answer." OK then. 
</p>
<p>
Previously codenamed Polaris, The Witcher 4 is the first of several new Witcher experiences. You can read more about it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-is-here-and-ciri-is-the-star">our announcement post</a>. If you're still pining for Geralt, you might prefer to read about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-red-unveil-codename-canis-majoris-as-the-witcher-remake">The Witcher 1 remake</a> in development at Fool's Theory. I wouldn't be surprised if it did away with some of the original game's laddier elements.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/activision-confirms-it-recast-black-ops-6-zombies-actors/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision has seemingly confirmed that the actors in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 zombies have been recast. </p>



<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-zombies-actors-quit-lack-of-ai-protection-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors began</a> to circulate that actors within the mode quit the game over concerns surrounding AI protections, the studio has released a statement on the matter. </p>



<p>&nbsp;“We respect the personal choice of these performers,” an Activision spokesperson said to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>. “Out of respect for all parties, we won’t add new commentary about the ongoing negotiations with SAG-AFTRA. We look forward to a mutually beneficial outcome as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>The current SAG-AFTRA strike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began in July</a> over the aforementioned AI protections. It came after “18 months of negotiations” between the union and various studios, including Activision Blizzard. As of writing, there is still no deal.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering why the game isn’t a part of the strike, it’s because of a clause in the contract. This clause allows union member actors to work on games that were in production before the strike was called. However, should a member be on a “daily contract”, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/ima-strike-notice-members" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the union says</a> they can choose to not re-new their deals.</p>



<p>Activision has been using AI in its game development for some time, according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a>. There is even evidence that shows that in various artwork in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. One <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1865107470751834402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">specific example shows</a> a holiday-themed loading screen featuring a zombie with six fingers. For those unaware, generative AI software is notorious for issues when generating hands on characters.</p>



<p>What do you think of the issues surrounding the Black Ops 6 zombies actors being recast and AI in game development in general? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1340/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p>Capcom has detailed its targeted performance for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> on consoles, confirming a day one patch will be available on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>The game's director Yuya Tokuda shared details in a pre-launch community update stream covering various elements of the game following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-numbers-are-well-wild">open beta test</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-specs-revealed">PC specs have already been revealed</a>, but in this stream performance targets on console were shared.</p>
<p>Both PS5 and Xbox Series X will include a Prioritise Graphics mode at 30fps and a Prioritise Framerate mode at 60fps. Xbox Series S will only run the game at 30fps, while on PC the frame rate will of course vary depending on hardware.</p>

<p>No specific details were provided on the PS5 Pro patch, beyond confirming it will enhance the graphics and will be available from launch. More details will be provided closer to launch.</p>
<p>"The target frame rate we have here was not being achieved in the OBT build," said Tokuda (via translator). "To be honest it was an earlier version that wasn't quite as optimised and there were also some rendering issues with the graphics when using frame priority mode."</p>
<p>The current full version has seen an improvement on fine details like fur and feathers and is "getting closer to that target of 60fps".</p>
<p>The Xbox version of the game has had a similar improvement to PS5, while on PC the development team is looking to lower the minimum required specs, though the details are still being worked on.</p>
<p>Capcom is also considering releasing a benchmark tool for PC to help players determine if the game will be playable on their machines.</p>

In November you could battle Snoop Dogg and Eminem while sporting a brand new pair of Nikes on your amorphous blob-creature. It’s a corporate soup of cameos and crossovers which, viewed from the outside, can appear rather gross. And now, Mariah Carey of all people might be getting in the mix?</p><p>I’m a recent convert to <em>Fortnite</em>, drawn in by my 10-year-old, having made the lazy (but understandable) mistake of thinking it just a cacophony of cartoonish noise. It turns out, beneath the corporate tie-ins and embarrassing celebrity endorsements, it’s one hell of a solid online shooter. I thoroughly enjoy playing, ideally in Duos with the boy, but spend a lot of time playing solo too. Thanks to some superb, parkourish movement (made even better in this latest season with wall-scrambling, roly-poly landings and samurai-sword-induced double-jumps), excellent gun fighting, and a vast variety in approaches, I’ve found my groove.</p><p>That doesn’t mean the corporate nonsense grates <em>less</em>, but once through the looking glass you can at least appreciate why people put up with it. And...sometimes it’s fun?</p><p>Given that November’s shorter so-called “Remix” season (which brought back season 2's map and dreary weapons) featured Snoop, Ice Spice, Eminem and Juice Wrld, the idea that Mariah Carey might be hiding in a vast block of ice (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1giQVuoTAFM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1giQVuoTAFM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as she apparently so often does</a></span>) doesn’t seem very far-fetched. Heck, at the end of Remix, there was a (stunning) slightly interactive event in which an Ice Spice the size of a skyscraper performed a gig in New York City, while titanic Eminems fought one another and a Juice Wrld as big as the solar system sang as players jumped around the rings of Saturn. It’s tough to rule anything out after that.</p><p>Anyhoo, that’s what the leakers are saying is due to happen in just a couple of days:</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Gaming World Tour has wrapped for 2024, and after a year of stellar events, the team is looking forward to what comes next in 2025. This year, the squad – including Jake Lucky and Hunter Grooms – travelled to South Korea, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Germany, but in 2025, they’ll be going bigger and broader at every event.</p>



<p>Here are the events that the team at Gaming World Media is most looking forward to for 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-around-the-world-with-gwm">Around The World With GWM</h2>



<p>I caught up with Jake and Hunter recently, eager to learn about their most anticipated events coming in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-tokyo-games-show-japan">1. Tokyo Games Show (Japan)</h3>



<p><em>Tokyo Games Show is an event that has been on our radar for a long time, as one of the biggest games shows out there. After visiting Korea for G-STAR, I can’t even begin to imagine how much bigger and better TGS will be.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-2-blast-austin-major-united-states">2. BLAST Austin Major (United States)</h3>



<p><em>A North American Major is extremely exciting for us, as we get to see all the NA Counter-Strike fans come out to enjoy the esport. Esports events don’t often happen in North America, so the excitement that surrounds something like this is definitely something to look forward to.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-3-runefest-united-kingdom">3. Runefest (United Kingdom)</h3>



<p><em>As a lifetime RuneScape fan, Runefast has been something I wanted to attend since I was a kid. After hearing that Jagex is working on a new open-world survival game, I’m even more excited to see what they have in store.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-4-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia">4. Esports World Cup (Saudi Arabia)</h3>



<p><em>The EWC really just gives us some of the best access to multiple esports and players. Being able to hop from stage to stage and put out loads of coverage and interviews is a perfect scenario for us.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-5-six-invitational-boston-united-states">5. Six Invitational Boston (United States)</h3>



<p><em>Though I can’t expect the Six Invitational to match up to the hype it had this past year, I’m still thrilled that the event is in North America. We had a lot of fun with the Rainbow Six crowd and Ubisoft this past year, so I can’t wait to run it back in Boston.</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">The longtime franchise mode in the Madden NFL series lets players make decisions for their favorite team, such as drafting players and signing free agents. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson gets to oversee these decisions in real life but has apparently used the Madden games as a pivotal resource in decision-making. In fact, Johnson reportedly axed a trade this past offseason involving a wide receiver because the player's rating in Madden NFL 24 was too low.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005485/2024/12/19/jets-jerry-jeudy-trade-madden-woody-johnson/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a>, the Jets were close to agreeing to a trade with the Denver Broncos in March for wide receiver Jerry Jeudy. But then, Johnson reportedly killed negotiations after looking at Jeudy's Madden NFL 24 rating. Electronic Arts tweaks player ratings throughout the season, but <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2023/07/24/madden-nfl-24-denver-broncos-ratings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Denver Post</a> notes that Jeudy was an overall 83 before the start of last season. Interestingly enough, the wide receiver--who ultimately was traded to the Cleveland Browns--still sports the same <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/ratings/player-ratings/jerry-jeudy/20940"

                <p>11 Bit Studios has canceled Project 8, its console-centric game that began development around 2018. As of September 2024, 37 team members were involved in the project.</p><p>"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting. However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal,” said president Przemysław Marszał in a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>He blamed COVID for some of the game's setbacks, and over time, delays accumulated and the project's budget grew. During Project 8's most recent milestone, the studio found that unresolved issues and challenges would have extended development time, and lost confidence in completing the game within a reasonable timeframe and at satisfactory quality. Thus, it was canceled.</p><p>An unknown number of developers will be laid off as a result of Project 8's cancellation, and some employees will be offered opportunities to transition to existing projects.</p><p>11 Bit Studios' latest game, Frostpunk 2, was released in September. It won the award for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">Best Strategy Game at The Game Awards 2024</a>. This year's show also introduced the "Game Changer" award for Amir Satvat, who has helped laid-off game developers find openings at other companies over the last year.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-drawing-a-line-in-the-snow/1900-6418286/" data-ref-id="1900-6418286">Frostpunk 2 review</a>, we said, "Frostpunk 2's challenging gameplay makes for a compelling experience despite a dour and cynical view of human nature."</p>

		<p>Having skin is kind of overrated, don’t you think? Looking like a bad guy getting flayed after opening the Ark of the Covenant is definitely the look for the 2100s, and you will soon be able to prove that beauty is more than skin deep with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fallout-76">Fallout 76’s</a> playable Ghouls when they arrive in early 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hands on Fallout 76 Playable Ghouls –&nbsp;Grabbed by the Ghoul-ies" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JH2vPV7a4t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, with Ghouls being more popular than ever thanks to Walter Goggins’ star turn as a bounty hunting Ghoul in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">Fallout TV series</a>, you’ll soon be able to play as a Ghoul yourself in Fallout 76. But you aren’t born &nbsp;with it, and it definitely doesn’t involve make up. No, you’ll have to undertake a quest to be all Ghoul-ified once you’re deep into this game – you need to have a level 50 character, to be precise.</p>


<p>It all starts when you pick up a radio transmission from a distressed man who’s just about survived and attack by some rather ghastly bandits, and should you follow up on the call track Leman down as he visits the human doctor, it quickly becomes clear that he’s not going to be long for this world. The only chance he has it to find a… different kind of doctor and scientist way up in the North East of the map. Maybe they someway, somehow have a solution?</p>
<p>Well, since they’re part of a secretive society of Ghouls, they might have a thought or two on how to handle lethal doses of radiation, and so their solution is to transform Leman into a Ghoul himself. Along the way you’re given some almost perfunctory decisions to make. Do you egg Leman on and encourage him to accept the transformation to join this small community of outcasts? And following that, will you more willingly choose to become a Ghoul yourself?</p>


<p>There’s a ton of reasons why you might want to. You lose none of the stats and skills that you have from before, but there’s now a whole new endgame progression to engage in with 30 new Special cards focussed on all the special traits and abilities of the Ghoul characters.</p>
<p>The biggest perk is that Ghouls are not only resistant to the radiation that caused their transformation, it will actually help and heal you now. No need to avoid dirty water anymore, you can just slurp it up and eventually gain Glow, even. But you don’t really need to, since you’re no longer subject to hunger or thirst.</p>
<p>If that sounds like Fallout 76 easy mode, then there are some downsides as well. Instead of hunger and thirst, you have to manage your Feral meter which, if you let it get a bit out of hand will significantly debuff your ability to use ranged weapons, though your melee attacks are boosted quite a lot.</p>

<p>Being a Ghoul, pretty much all the regular humans will now absolutely detest you. Any cities and encampments will want to turn you away if you ever show your face, and the Brotherhood of Steel will really not take kindly to your presence… so you’ll now have to hide it. Visit makeover guru Jaye Vo within the Ghoul enclave’s bunker, and she will work wonders to help hide your ghastly appearance from view.</p>
<p>It’s a rather randomised process that can sometimes cover you up with a bandana and nice hat… or basically just wrap your head up in a bin bag with some breathing apparatus. It would be nice to have more flexibility here, as you don’t get to make the choice for what your disguise will be, and have to revisit Jaye Vo to swap between displaying your Ghoul publicly and keeping it private. It’s a bit clumsy and feels like you should have a little more of a handle on it alongside the rest of the customisation suite, where you still have a great deal of freedom to customise your Ghoul’s appearance, right down to the skin texture.</p>
<p>If that all becomes a bit too much, you will have the opportunity to revert from Ghoul-dom to being human. This can be done once for free, as Bethesda don’t really want people switching back and forth at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p>Still, it’s a rather attractive proposition, especially when considering the kinds of challenges that you will face in Fallout 76’s end game. There’s the recently released Gleaming Depths raid where the sequence of challenging boss fights could use a bit of added durability from your character build, for example, and there’s no doubt that radiation resistance will be handy at more than a few other instances across the irradiated wastelands.</p>
<p>Fallout 76 seems to be in a pretty good place right now. The lasting memory of this game for many will be of its rather rocky launch, but that’s more than six years ago now, and Bethesda has brought a lot of big updates into the mix, and introduced broader ideas, like MMO-style raids and map expansions. It’s not Fallout 5, of course, but similar to The Elder Scrolls Online, it can scratch some of that itch.</p>
<p>Oh man, I bet being a Ghoul is really itchy…</p>

		<p>Just before they presumably clock off for Christmas, GSC Game Worlds has released the first major update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>. STALKER 2 patch 1.1 promised fixes for over 1,800 issues, including a first set of improvements for the game’s A-Life 2.0 system.</p>
<p>Since launch, A-Life 2.0 has been a major source of disappointment for players of STALKER 2. A-Life is responsible for a fluid game world that’s filled with AI characters and creatures going about their own business, even while a kilometer away from you. There could be factional battles that you never see, regions can change hands or be overrun by mutants overnight, and more. However, GSC seemingly had to make cuts and compromises to the system in order to get STALKER 2 out the door and with a decent frame rate, especially on Xbox Series X|S.</p>


<p>Now A-Life will be more able to spawn and exist in “offline” mode, which is when they’re outside of a player’s visualisation range, being more persistent to run into again later, and more able to take on tasks, like clearing out mutants. It’s a good first step to realising the potential of the system.</p>
<p>Looking at our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2 review</a>, Miguel said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes (with possible spoilers redacted) for STALKER 2 Patch 1.1:</p>


<ul>
<li>Fixed the issue with spawning NPCs behind the player’s back.</li>
<li>Players can now encounter roaming NPCs across the Zone more often.</li>

<li>Players may now have opportunities to encounter A-Life NPCs they’ve previously met by following in the same direction as the NPCs.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-ghoul-experience-detailed-by-bethesda/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tomorrow, Bethesda Game Studios will open up the gates of the Fallout 76 PTS (Public Test Server) to allow fans to play as a Ghoul for the first time in the franchise, likely in response to the massive acclaim enjoyed by the TV show's Cooper Howard character played by Walton Goggins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they shared a few details with the press. Playing as a Ghoul (with customizable design and even skin texture) is an endgame experience, as the related quest only starts at level 50. Ghouls will have 'dozens of alternate ways' to specialize their character, according to the developers.</p>
<p>To begin with, they are not only immune to radiation; it actually heals them. If your character is hurt, standing on top of some radioactive material will start healing them. Moreover, once fully healed, the excess radiation will build up into a new resource called Glow. Depending on how the player character is specialized, Glow can provide various effects. Ghouls can also utilize 32 exclusive perk cards on top of those already available for human characters, providing great variety when it comes to character progression.</p>
<p>Ghouls do not feel hunger or thirst in Fallout 76. However, they must manage a feral meter instead. If a character turns full feral, they'll suffer from drawbacks like reduced hit points and worse accuracy with weapons, but they'll also get a boost in hand-to-hand combat, potentially unlocking a berserker type of playstyle.</p>

<p>Many NPCs (non-player characters) and factions will interact differently with player ghouls, such as the Brotherhood of Steel, who do not take kindly to ghouls. You won't be blocked from their stories, though; instead, this will reportedly open up new narrative paths to experience. Bethesda also said there will be in-world ways to disguise your being a Ghoul. Last but not least, player Ghouls will have the ability to revert to human form, though you will only be able to do this once for free.</p>
<p>There's no final release date for this update yet, although the developers aim to launch it sometime in early 2025. As a reminder, Fallout 76 was recently updated with a brand new raid experience called <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gleaming-depths-update-now-available-adding-biggest-boss-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleaming Depths</a>, an <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-a-proper-mmo-style-endgame-raid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MMO-style endgame dungeon</a> where a party of four players must go through five tough encounters to obtain the new four-star legendary weapons.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/24305493/apple-arcade-best-games-2024-ios-iphone-ipad</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/8-great-apple-arcade-games-for-your-iphone-or-ipad.1065363/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24305493/apple-arcade-best-games-2024-ios-iphone-ipad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>It was a bit of a weird year for Apple’s subscription gaming service. 2024 saw very few notable exclusives launch on Apple Arcade; instead, the service was fleshed out with a number of big games that you can already play on other platforms. It hasn’t been great for showcasing what makes Apple Arcade unique, but on the other hand, it’s hard to complain too much when it means your subscription now includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/23827123/vampire-survivors-news-announcements-updates-dlc-spinoffs"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. Here’s the best of what came out this year.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balatro/id6502451661"><em>Balatro Plus</em></a></h3></p><p>This poker game has been an unexpected hit ever since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">it launched on PC and consoles at the beginning of the year</a>. It’s sort of like a solo version of poker, only with the gameplay loop of a roguelike, which means that you’ll be collecting rare joker cards to augment your hands as you create a deck capable of turning out absolutely absurd scores. It takes a moment for it to click, but <em>Balatro</em> is particularly well suited to mobile, where you can squeeze in a few quick rounds wherever you are… or accidentally let a few hours go by while you try to complete a run.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dicey-dungeons/id6477867401"><em>Dicey Dungeons Plus</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Dicey Dungeons</em> is a few years old at this point — it originally launched on PC in 2019 — but if you missed this excellent release from Terry Cavanagh, now is a great time to jump in. Just like <em>Balatro</em>, it uses a roguelike structure, where your progress resets after every death, but every run is different. Here, the goal is to explore dungeons by fighting monsters and collecting loot, which is all done through an engrossing deckbuilding mechanic. Also, for some reason, you play as a die. If nothing else, it’s a great entry point to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/30/23181999/roguelike-deckbuilder-genre-slay-the-spire-inscryption">an intimidating genre</a>.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy-iv-3d-remake/id6504607951"><em>Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake) Plus</em></a></h3></p><p>Apple Arcade is slowly becoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad">a pretty good place for roleplaying games</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295537/final-fantasy-4-apple-arcade">now that includes the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series</a>. First up is the 3D remake of <em>Final Fantasy IV</em>, one of the most beloved entries in the long-running series, along with its direct sequel, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ff-iv-the-after-years/id6504608150"><em>The After Years</em></a>. Square Enix has done a pretty solid job of porting RPGs of late, so the mobile versions are well suited for your phone. Even better: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy/id6504607244">the original <em>Final Fantasy</em></a> is coming to Apple Arcade in January, in all its pixelated glory.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfl-retro-bowl-25/id6476767864"><em>NFL Retro Bowl ‘25</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Retro Bowl</em> (and its soccer sibling <em>Retro Goal</em>) is a very straightforward experience. It’s designed to bring the joyous simplicity of old-school sports games to modern smartphones. That means pixel art graphics, streamlined gameplay, and no fussing about with always-online features. The latest edition is no different, except that it has an NFL license, so you can enjoy that classic experience while controlling real football teams composed of real football players. The developers at New Star Games have also done a great job of keeping it updated since it launched in September.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/outlanders-2/id1614682164"><em>Outlanders 2</em></a></h3></p><p>Perhaps the biggest Apple Arcade exclusive this year, this sequel is the follow-up to one of the most chill and beautiful city builders around. The new version of <em>Outlanders</em> has more detailed visuals, an evolving story campaign, and regular challenges for when you just need a quick fix. The sequel also brings the series to Macs, in addition to iOS and Apple TV.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/return-to-monkey-island/id6476317779"><em>Return to Monkey Island Plus</em></a></h3></p><p>It was a long wait for a proper <em>Monkey Island</em> sequel, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23360869/return-to-monkey-island-review-nintendo-switch-pc">but it was worth it</a>. The point-and-click adventure sees original creative duo Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman return, and while it has a very different visual style, the game itself is classic <em>Monkey Island</em>. Which is to say, it’s hilarious and full of all kinds of oddball puzzles to solve. This time, the game has also been streamlined to get rid of some of the more annoying aspects of the genre, with features like a hint system to keep you from getting really stuck.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vampire-survivors/id6478975337"><em>Vampire Survivors Plus</em></a></h3></p><p>You really need to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/23827123/vampire-survivors-news-announcements-updates-dlc-spinoffs"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> to get it — but once you do, it’s hard to put down. The survival game starts out slowly, as you attempt to kill as many undead creatures before they overwhelm you. But over time, you’ll unlock new characters and abilities, allowing you to take on ridiculously large groups of enemies. This cycle continues for a long time, with a huge number of things to unlock to progress through the many, many levels.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/words-in-progress/id1021231678"><em>Words in Progress</em></a></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">Daily puzzle games are everywhere now</a> following the breakout success of <em>Wordle</em>, and this is Apple Arcade’s best current entry. <em>Words In Progress</em> is a bit like a single-player take on Scrabble. You’re presented with a vertical list of letters, which you have to combine to create words in the hope of getting a high score. It’s one of those seemingly simple concepts that has a lot of replayability, helped along by multiple modes, including multiplayer and daily challenges to take on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
