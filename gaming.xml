            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224261/valve-counter-strike-2-razer-snap-tap-wooting-socd-ban-kick<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve is banning <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> players from using keyboard features to automate perfect counter-strafes. Razer was the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194977/razer-snap-tap-mode-huntsman-v3-pro-wooting-rappy-snappy">first keyboard maker to add</a> a Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions (SOCD) feature to its range of Huntsman V3 Pro keyboards last month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204422/wooting-razer-snap-tap-socd-beta-feature">followed shortly by Wooting</a>. Using Snap Tap as Razer calls it or Wooting’s Snappy Tappy will now get you kicked from <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> games.</p><p>“Recently, some hardware features have blurred the line between manual input and automation, so we’ve decided to draw a clear line on what is or isn’t acceptable in Counter-Strike,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F730%2Fview%2F6500469346429600836">says Valve</a>. “We are no longer going to allow automation (via scripting or hardware) that circumvent these core skills and, moving forward, (and initially—exclusively on Valve Official Servers) players suspected of automating multiple player actions from a single game input may be kicked from their match.”</p><div><figcaption><em>You’ll get kicked from a Counter-Strike 2 game if you use Razer or Wooting’s new SOCD keyboard features.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>I’ve tested using SOCD in <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> this morning and can confirm you get removed from a game on Valve’s official servers, but there’s no account ban. Valve is banning the use of these keyboard features, but it doesn’t appear to be ready to ban accounts for using them right now.</p><p>Razer and Wooting’s SOCD features both let players automate switching strafe directions without having to learn the skill. Normally, to switch strafe directions in a first-person shooter, you have to fully release one key before pressing the other. If both are pressed, they cancel each other, and you stand there for a moment until you release one of the keys. SOCD means you don’t need to release a key and you can&nbsp;rapidly tap the A or D key to counter-strafe with little to no effort.</p><p>Some professional <em>Counter-Strike 2 </em>players had called for SOCD to be banned, much like how null binds that prevent you from pressing two opposing directions have been banned in tournaments for years.</p><p>Wooting reluctantly added a beta version of SOCD to its range of keyboards after Razer introduced the feature on its own hardware. “We are glad Valve has taken a stance against Snap Tap,” says Wooting in a <a href="https://x.com/WootingKB/status/1825799396459515913">post on X</a> today. “Don’t use Snappy Tappy (SOCD) or Rappy Snappy in CS2 any more as it will result in a kick.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-player-count-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is out today and it’s already storming up the charts. On Steam, the game has skyrocketed to a peak concurrent player count of almost 1.5 million players, which is coming remarkably close to threatening the spot held by Counter-Strike 2 (formerly CSGO), with a record of 1.8 million concurrent users.</p>



<p>This Chinese blockbuster of a title has been widely regarded as one of the most highly anticipated releases of 2024 for quite some time. In recent days, we’ve seen plenty of leaked content that showcased just how impressive this Tencent-backed action RPG is, and now that it’s here, the numbers are backing up the hype.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-wukong-rising">Wukong Rising</h2>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong comes from Game Science, a studio headquartered in Shenzhen. Inspired by <em>Journey to the West</em>, Black Myth puts players in control of the ‘Destined One’, bound to a journey that’ll see them explore a vast world while fighting some of the most gargantuan, impressive bosses we’ve seen in recent years.</p>



<p>As a result of a solid pre-launch marketing campaign, Black Myth: Wukong’s status started gathering pace with reckless abandon in the last couple of weeks. It has been released to an overwhelmingly positive reception worldwide, and on Steam especially, the player count is soaring.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2358720/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1.42 million peak concurrent players</a> are neck-deep in Black Myth, exploring all that this stellar title has to offer.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean all is going swimmingly in the world of Game Science, though. Most recently, the studio was lambasted for issuing ‘influencer guidelines’ that warned users against the promotion of feminism or the discussion of almost anything related to China on stream.</p>



<p>Will Black Myth: Wukong top the all-time high held by Counter-Strike?</p>

But when the next round began, Cifuentes was in Robb's place, sparking confusion among observers and throwing the bracket into chaos.</p><p>As it turned out, Robb had been issued a loss over what The Pokémon Company International Global Esports and Events Director Chris Brown called an "unsporting conduct penalty" in a follow-up interview with IGN.</p><p>"It was an unsporting conduct penalty," Brown said. "We applied it to the match that had just occurred and the standard penalty for that's a match loss."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— ゆうD (@ikuo_x) <a href="https://twitter.com/ikuo_x/status/1825030789651890401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The unsporting conduct Brown was referring to was a motion that Robb performed after claiming victory that many took to be an offensive gesture. The result was that Robb was removed from the tournament, though he was allowed to keep his prize money for placing in the final eight. Quarterfinalists receive $15,000 while the winner receives $50,000.</p><p>The decision was criticized by some fans for altering the tournament, though others came forward to defend The Pokémon Company's judgment.</p><p>"When I first heard about it I assumed Pokemon was being soft, but after seeing the clip I think they made the right call.

"Generally the match is not considered to be over until you've actually signed your match slip...And so that's sort of that key moment. There's other kind of moments, and this is really fine detail and sort of the rules and policies, but in the [Swiss-system tournament] for example, when the information is actually put in the computer could be a factor, because then we have to pair the next round.

		<p>A few years on from the two-case collection of Famicom Detective Club remakes, Nintendo is following up on the promise and potential of this visual novel series with the first fully new entry in 27 years. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-has-been-revealed/">Emio –&nbsp;The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club</a> is coming out at the end of this month, putting our youthful sleuths through the wringer of another traumatic murder case.</p>
<p>From today and through to the game’s launch on 29th August, Nintendo is teasing out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/sample-a-multi-part-demo-for-emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-next-week/">the first few chapters of the game with a free demo</a>, and we’ve sampled the prologue and first chapter of the game a little ahead of time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club - Official Case Briefing #1 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/quR1vN9OeeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s another day at Utsugi Decetive Agency, with our 19 year old protagonist (who you get to name) continuing on as an assistant detective at the agency. Barely have you said hello to Utsugi when the phone rings with the police calling you to a strange and unsettling crime scene.</p>
<p>A body has been found that morning, a teenager still in middle school… but they were found with a paper bag on their head, marked with a smiling face.</p>

<p>This quickly grows into the revelation that this could be tied to a decades old case that Utsugi was aware of and the urban legend of Emio – The Smiling Man, a person with a bag on their head who finds crying girls and tells them quite specifically that they’re going to give them a smile that lasts forever. But is this the same killer? A copycat? Something else entirely?</p>
<p>If you’ve played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/01/famicom-detective-club-review-the-missing-heir-the-girl-who-stands-behind/">the remade Famicom Detective Club duology</a>, or even the more jovial Ace Attorney series, you’ll immediately find your footing with the visual novel-style gameplay of this game.</p>

<p>The early conversations and interactions through the Prologue and Chapter 1 gradually set out the scope of what you’ll have to do. Most of the time you’ll select ‘Ask/Listen’ and potentially a sub-topic to engage in conversation with someone, but sometimes the conversation might dry up, nudging you to ‘Look/Examine’ the person or the environment to prise out new clues, or to ‘Think’ and have your internal dialogue nudge you down another path. Thankfully you are generally prompted by highlighted words when you need to think or if there’s something new to ask about, though you might end up still simply tapping through all the options to try and find the one with new info.</p>
<p>There’s further options, to call over to another person, dip into your journal with all the collated details on people, and more, though the opening chapter only touches on this lightly.</p>
<p>One thing that does return for the chapter conclusion is the case review, a sit down chat with Ayumi to go over the facts and latest discoveries and try to draw some conclusions. It’s basically a mini quiz to see if you’ve been paying even a modicum of attention, though you can also point out suspects that could be a bit of a punt.</p>

<p>Emio – The Smiling man seems to take a few incremental steps forward in terms of the game presentation. The art style is very much in keeping with the 2021 remakes, but I feel like there’s a shade more animation to characters in their idle states, their hair waving gently in a breeze, and the like. Animation to go along with dialogue is snappy and to the point, fading between motions to quickly relate a motion, but without dragging thing out. Helpful when the game’s voice work is Japanese only, so you &nbsp;can skip through dialogue as fast as you can read.</p>
<p>But while this is a more serious kind of mystery than an Ace Attorney, that doesn’t mean there isn’t space for some unusual and memorable characters. In particular detectives Kuze and Kamihara are polar opposites to one another, Kuze being very intense and by-the-book, while Kamihara is a rather unserious character in some ways, deliberately a bit mean, it seems.</p>
<p>This is really just the very beginning of the case, and I can read barely anything into how it’s going to progress at this point, but I’ve no doubt that there will be plenty of twists and turns, more murders, and a gradually emerging gallery of suspects.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 will be available within the demo later this week on 23rd August, before the third chapter is added on 28th August ahead of the full launch. I’m already keen to peel back more of the mystery in the coming days.</p>

Instead, the company turned to its history by giving us our first look at the completed Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, Japan, which is now scheduled to open on October 2, 2024.</p><p>The presentation was hosted by none other than Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto, who walked through the main exhibits and activities museum attendees can expect at the new facility. Read on to learn everything announced at today’s Nintendo Museum Direct, including the existence of enormous Wii Remotes!</p><h3><strong>Miyamoto Introduces the Museum</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/nintendo-museum-direct-0-35-screenshot-1724110179484.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The presentation began with Miyamoto sharing the history of the museum site, revealing that the Nintendo museum is built on the same grounds as Nintendo’s original playing card factory, which was then used for quality checks during the Famicom (NES) era. The entrance to the museum greets visitors with a Mario-themed plaza, complete with warp pipes, a question block, and more Super Mario Bros. items.</p><h3><strong>You Can Play Nintendo Games With Enormous Controllers</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/nintendo-museum-direct-11-36-screenshot-1724110179484.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The highlight of the presentation was seeing the enormous recreations of Nintendo controllers visitors will be able to use to play a selection of classic Nintendo games from the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and Wii eras. While we got an extended demo of Miyamoto playing Super Mario Bros. alongside a museum staff member, the star of the show was undoubtedly watching two museum staff members working together to play Wii Sports Resort using a giant Wii Remote’s motion controls. Just look at it!!</p><h3><strong>Attractions that Pull from Nintendo’s Toymaking Days</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/nintendo-museum-direct-6-48-screenshot-1724110179483.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Direct only showed off three of the eight interactive experiences, but the <a href="https://museum.nintendo.com/en/exhibition/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Nintendo Museum website details</u></a> the rest. This is the full list of unique play experiences the Nintendo Museum will offer on the first floor:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Shigureden SP </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Explore Hyakunin Isshu poems using smart devices and the giant screen on the floor.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Zapper &amp; Scope SP</strong> <ul data-cy="list"><li>Experience shooting using the Zapper and Super Scope in the world of Mario that spreads out on the giant screen in front of you.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ultra Machine SP </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>A batting-cage experience inside a room. Hit the balls pitched by the Ultra Machine.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ultra Hand SP</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Use the Ultra Hand to grab the balls rolling down the lanes, and drop them into the pipes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Love Tester SP</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Two people join hands and work together on tests that measure their Love Level.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Game &amp; Watch SP</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Play Game &amp; Watch games using your own shadow.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Nintendo Classics</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo 64. Choose from over 80 games to play.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Big Controller </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Controllers from past hardware generations made giant. Two people must work together to take on challenges in games released back in the day.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Visitors Can’t See Every Attraction with a Single Ticket</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/nintendomuseum-1724110179483.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One odd wrinkle about the Nintendo Museum is that visitors can’t experience all eight exhibits with a single ticket. As detailed on the official website, digital coins are required to experience the interactive exhibits, and each visitor is only granted 10 coins upon entry. <a href="https://museum.nintendo.com/en/guide/service/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>You can’t purchase additional coins</u></a> once you run out, so as of now it seems you’ll need multiple visits to the Nintendo Museum to get your hands on everything it has to offer. We’ve reached out to Nintendo for comment and clarification on this.</p><h3><strong>A Rotunda of Nintendo Products</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/nintendo-museum-direct-2-16-screenshot-1724110179482.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The second floor has a gallery of products created and published by Nintendo from NES to now. This includes games and consoles in Nintendo’s catalog, complete with different iterations of hardware and game boxes to account for differences across Japan, North America, Europe, and other regions. Each section of the exhibit is marked with a big (but not quite as huge) replica of each Nintendo controller and handheld. </p><p>There are also exhibits for products played by moving your body, the evolution of the Question Block, the evolution of graphics in games like Mario and Zelda, and an exhibit of products Nintendo made before it entered the video game business, like a copy machine and even a baby stroller.</p><h3><strong>Make Your Own Hanafuda Cards</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/nintendo-museum-direct-12-1-screenshot-1724110179481.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Nintendo Museum harkens all the way back to the beginning of the company with an interactive experience where visitors can design their own Hanafuda cards. This hour-long experience does cost extra, but participants will get to take home the four cards they made. There is also a Play Room where visitors can learn to play one of the most popular versions of Hanafuda.</p><p>Along with a museum restaurant and shop Miyamoto teased at the very end of the presentation, that’s what Nintendo fans can expect if they make the long trek to the Nintendo museum in Kyoto. Tickets will cost 3,300 yen (~$23 USD) for adults, with cheaper price ranges for children. Right now, the museum is holding a lottery drawing for the chance to purchase tickets for dates beginning with the museum’s grand opening on October 2, which <a href="https://museum-tickets.nintendo.com/en/calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can enter here</a>.</p><p>What did you think of today’s Nintendo Museum Direct?

MachineGames' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will reportedly launch for PlayStation 5 in the early half of 2025, following an Xbox Series X/S and PC release at the end of this year.
</p>
<p>
That's according to industry insider Nate the Hate (one of the first people to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">break the news of Microsoft's multi-platform plans</a> at the start of this year) who <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1825594654387294219">made the claim on social media</a>. "MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will release on Xbox &amp; PC this holiday (Dec) as a timed console exclusive," they wrote. "After this timed-exclusive window expires, Indiana Jones &amp; the Great Circle is planned to come to PlayStation 5 in the first half of 2025."
</p>
<p>
Nate the Hate's claim tallies with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-mulls-major-xbox-exclusives-starfield-indiana-jones-for-playstation-5-reports">report by The Verge</a> back in February, which said Microsoft was planning to go beyond its initial slate of comparatively low-key multi-platform releases by launching some of its flagship games on competing consoles. These were said to include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, with the latter supposedly due to arrive on PS5 "some months" after its Xbox and PC release.

<p>
Skip to the present, and Nate the Hate's latest claim follows recent word from noted industry insider Shinobi602 that Microsoft was preparing to reveal another "big" Xbox game for PlayStation 5 at some point this week. Windows Central then <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/rumor-another-big-xbox-game-is-heading-to-ps5-to-be-announced-next-week">threw its hat in the ring</a>, saying there was a "large" chance that game would be Indiana Jones - all of which brings us to Gamescom 2024.
</p>
<p>
Gamescom Opening Night Live host <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-time-where-to-watch">confirmed</a> the Great Circle will feature during the show, which is set to air on 20th August from 7pm in the UK - and that would be an obvious moment for Microsoft to announce a release date for Indy on Xbox and PC, as well as to share its latest multi-platform news.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has so far only confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-xbox-exclusive-games-heading-to-ps5-and-switch-according-to-phil-spencer">handful of Xbox first-party titles</a> for competing platforms - namely <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-review">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, Hi-Fi Rush, and Pentiment - but a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-bosses-reportedly-pushing-for-no-red-line-around-which-xbox-games-launch-on-playstation">report in May</a> claimed company bosses were pushing for no "red line" around which Xbox games launch on PlayStation.

Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-playstation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">corroborated the report</a>, claiming that some outlets have been given this announcement under signed NDAs. Currently, it's unknown whether this will be announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live tomorrow.</p><p>Last year, Microsoft confirmed that the game was actually exclusive for Xbox and PC, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-game-is-only-coming-to-xbox-and-pc/1100-6515432/" data-ref-id="1100-6515432">Bethesda amended its multiplatform console deal with Disney</a> post-acquisition.

            <p>
Nintendo's 135-year history will soon be brought to life inside the walls of a new purpose-built Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, Japan - and ahead of its opening on 2nd October, legendary designer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has revealed some of its intriguing exhibits in a new video tour.
</p>
<p>
The Nintendo Museum has been built on the site of the factory where Nintendo originally made its Hanafuda cards, and which was later used for quality checks during the Famicom era. That building and its unremarkable carpark are no longer standing, however, now replaced by a shiny two-floor monument to Nintendo's history and a Mario-themed plaza.
</p>
<p>
Miyamoto's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JApUMBscKOc">13-minute tour</a> begins on the second floor of the museum, where several huge curved glass displays - containing many of the products Nintendo has released since its founding in 1889 - can be found. This whole area is intended to chart the evolution of Nintendo's approach to entertainment, from its earlier non-video game products - including copy machines, baby strollers, RC cars, and pitching machines - into more familiar territory, beginning with 1977's early video game forays, the Color TV-Game 6 and Color TV-Game 15.

<p>
From there, the video game stuff begins in earnest, with Miyamoto highlighting exhibits showcasing different iterations of Nintendo's games and consoles from all across the world, displays charting how the graphics of its most beloved franchises have changed over the years, the evolution of the ? block, the history of titles played with the whole body, and more. It's a neat bit of (presumably educational) nostalgia, but the niftiest stuff appears to be reserved for the museum's first floor.
</p>
<p>
Here, Nintendo has created eight activities reimagining some of its earliest products for the modern era. There's a giant screen in the floor where visitors can play the traditional Japanese game card game Hyakunin Isshu using a smart device, and recreations of Japanese homes where guests can pick up a foam baseball bat and whack balls as they shoot out of an Ultra Machine DX - the twist being that objects in the room come to life, bottles spinning and printers printing, as balls bounce into them.
</p>

 </a>

<p>
Then there's the Zapper &amp; Scope SP exhibit, inspired by Nintendo's Laser Clay bowling alley shooting galleries of the 70s. This reworking of the experience sees up to 13 players - armed with either NES Zappers or SNES Super Scopes - blasting Mario-themed targets as the likes of Shy Guys and Koopas dance and spin across a huge horizontal screen, all in a battle for the highest score. And Miyamoto's final video tour stop takes him to room where guests can play classic Nintendo games from the Famicon to Wii era - but only via comically huge controllers requiring multiple people to coordinate their inputs.
</p>
<p>
And that's alongside other interactive experiences not showcased in Nintendo's video but <a href="https://museum-tickets.nintendo.com/en">briefly detailed on its website</a>, including exhibits inspired by the Ultra Hand, Love Tester, Game &amp; Watch, and more. Other activities include an area to play Hanafuda, workshops where guests can make their own Hanafuda cards, a cafe, and a shop selling exclusive merchandise.

                <p>Arguably the coolest Nintendo Lego set, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, had been unavailable at Amazon earlier this month (a common occurrence), but now it's back in stock--and with a <em>slight </em>discount as well. Normally $270, Amazon's latest restock shaves the price to $262. While a savings of $8 isn't much, at least it's something considering we actually have <em>never </em>seen a discount on the Lego NES at Amazon. In the event that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> sells out again, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-nintendo-entertainment-system-set-71374%2F-%2FA-80130334%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can also find it at Target</a> for the same price.</p><p>If you thought this Lego set could be purchased for less than $270 at one point, you'd be correct. Released in 2020 with a launch price of $230, the Lego NES was one of many sets that received substantial price hikes in 2022. For the past two years, the Lego NES has remained at its $270 price--when it's available to purchase at all. Major retailers--sometimes all of them--are constantly sold out of the Lego NES.</p><p>It's not the only hard-to-find Lego Nintendo set.

NES cartridge as well. The end result is a surprisingly intricate display piece, full of interactive elements like a working cartridge slot, rotating dials on the CRT TV, and a crank-operated screen that emulates a Super Mario level. It also has a very charming secret that will delight long-time fans.</p><p>This is one of only a handful Lego Nintendo display pieces on the market--the playsets are wildly different--and if you're looking to get the complete collection or spoil a Lego fan in your life, you can't go wrong with the handful of other kits currently available.</p><h2>Lego Nintendo Display Sets</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352615" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352615"></a><figcaption>Lego Super Mario Question Block</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FMVDHDM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario 64 Question Block at Amazon</a> (2,064 pieces) -- $200</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego NES at Amazon (2,646 pieces)</a> -- $262 (<del>$270</del>) | <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-nintendo-entertainment-system-set-71374%2F-%2FA-80130334%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Also at Target</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-super-mario-world-mario-38-yoshi-nintendo-figure-71438%2F-%2FA-90573772&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorder Super Mario World: Mario &amp; Yoshi at Target (1,215 pieces)</a> -- $130</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Mighty-Bowser-Building-Collectible/dp/B0B3BZZWSL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mighty Bowser at Amazon (2,807 pieces)</a> -- $270 | <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-6379558-Super-Mario-The-Mighty-Bowser-71411-Building-Toy-Set%2F321283899%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Also at Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-TBD-Super-Mario-71426/dp/B0BXQ3M8JH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piranaha Plant at Amazon (540 pieces)</a> -- $60 price</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fgreat-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorder Zelda - The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 (2,500 pieces)</a> -- $300</li></ul><p>Mighty Bowser is quite expensive at $270--but it is gigantic when fully constructed--so as a Koopa King alternative, we'd recommend the adorable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Bowsers-Muscle-Expansion-Collectible/dp/B0CGY1MQFD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Bowser Muscle Car</a> for a cute and compact take on the Mario Rival.
