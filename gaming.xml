			<p>NVIDIA announced that its DLSS 3 technology will be featured in four of the biggest PC game releases out this week.</p>
<p>Square Enix's Final Fantasy XVI, which will be launched in just a few hours on Steam, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">features DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation</a>, DLAA, and Reflex. If you're planning to play on your own PC, make sure to <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-released-supports-final-fantasy-xvi-god-of-war-ragnarok-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download the latest optimized Game Ready driver</a>. If you prefer the cloud, Final Fantasy XVI is also playable via GeForce NOW, and DLSS 3 is supported there for GFN Ultimate subscribers.</p>
<p>At 4K resolution and with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode, the GeForce RTX 4090 averages 173 frames per second in Final Fantasy XVI, while the RTX 4080 SUPER registered 134 FPS, the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER stops at 118 FPS, and the RTX 4070 SUPER at 105 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other major launch of the week is Sony Santa Monica's God of War: Ragnarok, due on Thursday, September 19. Once again, DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex are all supported. DLAA isn't there, but there are unofficial ways to add it. According to NVIDIA, DLSS 3 lets you play God of War: Ragnarok at nearly 200 frames per second (4K resolution with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode) with a 2X performance boost if you own a GeForce RTX 4090. The RTX 4080 SUPER gets nearly 160 FPS, the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is almost at 140 FPS, and the RTX 4070 SUPER is almost at 120.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Capcom's Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is also scheduled to be released on September 19. Powered by the RE Engine, the remaster offers the same NVIDIA feature set as God of War: Ragnarok.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Enotria: The Last Song, the Soulslike game developed by Jyamma Games and inspired by Italian folklore, also supports NVIDIA DLSS 3 and Reflex. The game described as 'Summer Souls' debuted yesterday <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102450/Enotria_The_Last_Song/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-fully-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pathea Games has fully revealed&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, the third game in the&nbsp;<em>My Time&nbsp;</em>series, and it comes complete with a new art style, city management elements, and more.</p>
<p><i>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</i>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-pathea-games">teased a couple of weeks ago</a>, but today, Pathea has revealed more information about what the game will actually be, and the studio says it's designed to "appeal to both life simulation fans and RPG enthusiasts".</p>
<p>The studio is promising a 40-hour storyline "brimming with exploration", as well as a "diverse cast of romanceable characters" and "revamped gameplay mechanics", so if you were expecting a low-effort sequel to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-sandrock"><em>My Time at Sandrock</em></a>, it looks like you'll be pleasantly surprised.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-reveal-combat.jpg?itok=8t9G11E0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-reveal-combat.jpg?itok=e8gcSMuy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>will feature "deep role-playing elements", according to Pathea.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike in&nbsp;<em>Sandrock&nbsp;</em>and its predecessor&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-portia"><em>My Time at Portia</em></a>, in which you played as a builder "tasked with completing essential jobs" to keep your town running,&nbsp;<em>Evershine&nbsp;</em>will cast you as the town's governor.</p>
<p>The game will take place in a new settlement "on the fringes of the Free Cities", and you'll be facing down the Duvos Empire, recruiting settlers and creating a stronghold from which to resist a "more defined antagonist" than in previous series installments.</p>
<p><em>Evershine</em>'s campaign will fully support co-op for up to four players, although you can, of course, still enjoy it solo if you want to. It'll also feature "town management" gameplay for the first time in the series.</p>
<p>If you want to get a look at&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>in motion, you can check out the game's announcement trailer right here.</p>

<p>As well as all the above, Pathea says&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>will also support modding for both single-player and multiplayer, so if you're the kind of person who likes to switch up their gameplay experience, you're in luck.</p>
<p><em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>is still "very early in development", according to Pathea, but the studio is launching a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign for the game</a> on September 24th, which is also when we'll get to learn more about it.</p>
<p>When it does eventually launch, you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">future Nintendo platforms yet to be announced</a>", Pathea says. Stay tuned for more.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Hayao Miyazaki is a legendary director and animator whose entire filmography is exceptional, so ranking his films is no easy feat. You’d be hard-pressed to find a “bad” film from the Studio Ghibli co-founder, so this piece is more about ranking from great to masterpiece rather than from good to bad. Miyazaki’s meticulously crafted, hand-drawn animations are colorful and imaginative spectacles with strong female characters, fascinating fantasy creatures, and strong takes on environmental justice.<br></p><p>Hayao Miyazaki’s films may be animated, but they explore mature coming-of-age themes such as developing compassion, individuality, strength, and independence. There’s a deep and thought-provoking wisdom beneath his exciting adventures and magical worlds, which makes his films resonate with audiences of all ages. Read on to see how I ranked each of Hayao Miyazaki’s masterpieces, and see if you agree. <br></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3e9971ce76b6b4725b8d1b47c3115a11" data-recommend-id="image://3e9971ce76b6b4725b8d1b47c3115a11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man sits on top of a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man sits on top of a car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Toho Co., Ltd / Columbia Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3e9971ce76b6b4725b8d1b47c3115a11" data-recommend-id="image://3e9971ce76b6b4725b8d1b47c3115a11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man sits on top of a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s unfair to compare <em>Castle of Cagliostro</em> to Hayao Miyazaki’s other films because it was not only his feature film debut but also part of the <em>Lupin III </em>franchise, a popular manga and anime series about legendary thief Arsène Lupin going on daring heists around the world. This time, he wants to rescue Princess Clarisse from being forced to marry a count. This is not one of Miyazaki’s more personal and imaginative stories about environmental justice, coming of age, or resilient female leads, but it does have some enjoyable broad comedy.<br></p><p>The animation is not as intricate as in his later films, but you can certainly see Miyazaki’s flair for whimsy in the thrilling set pieces such as car chases, clock-tower fights, and villains getting trapped in a castle’s catacombs. <em>Castle of Cagliostro</em> is a romp, and though it doesn’t reach the heights of the rest of Miyazaki’s filmography, it’s exciting to see the kernels of what the legendary director would become known for. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cbb6bf774b8dc75785f364f5a25556e2" data-recommend-id="image://cbb6bf774b8dc75785f364f5a25556e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pig pilot gives a thumbs up.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Porco Rosso</em> is one of Hayao Miyazaki’s silliest films, telling a tale about a World War I fighter pilot who is turned into a pig. With his devil-may-care attitude and salty humor, the various hijinks he gets into are a delight to watch. As with most of Miyazaki’s films, the highlights are invigorating action scenes (in this case, aerial ones) that show off fast-paced, slick animation.<br></p><p>The surly Porco humorously contrasts with the strong-minded female characters like Fio, the plane repairwoman, and Gina, who is in love with him and unfazed by his pig-like appearance, and since Porco exudes so much confidence, her love seems perfectly believable. <em>Porco Rosso</em> is a playful adventure that lightly touches on much deeper themes of wartime trauma and fascism, in ways that only Miyazaki can.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0198b2f498f39f6bea100b28ab789b3d" data-recommend-id="image://0198b2f498f39f6bea100b28ab789b3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ponyo floats in front of a boy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ponyo floats in front of a boy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Walt Disney Pictures / Toho Co., Ltd.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0198b2f498f39f6bea100b28ab789b3d" data-recommend-id="image://0198b2f498f39f6bea100b28ab789b3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ponyo floats in front of a boy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Ponyo </em>is one of Hayao Miyazaki’s most light-hearted films and an adaptation of Hans Christen Andersen’s <em>The Little Mermaid</em>. A five-year-old boy named Sosuke discovers a goldfish that wants to be a human little girl—even though this upsets the balance of nature and is against the wishes of her father, a sorcerer who lives in the depths of the ocean. After she gains the ability to become human and chooses to stay on land, a giant tsunami wreaks havoc on Sosuke’s coastal town, satellites fall from the sky, and the moon spins out of orbit.<br></p><p>Despite this, there’s lots of adorable, family-friendly humor to be found in Ponyo’s misunderstanding of life on land, along with quirks like her obsession with ham and the gleeful wiggling of her new toes. The story is thin and predictable, not quite as profound as Hayao Miyazaki’s more original fantasies, but the visuals of Ponyo’s underwater world are truly stunning—the vibrant schools of sea creatures, the amoebas, and the fish-shaped waves that Ponyo skims across are all eye-popping.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="11f95994500397b0255b5e127d0df6cf" data-recommend-id="image://11f95994500397b0255b5e127d0df6cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A girl looks up with an adorable fox-like creature perched on her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl looks up with an adorable fox-like creature perched on her shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Toei Company / Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="11f95994500397b0255b5e127d0df6cf" data-recommend-id="image://11f95994500397b0255b5e127d0df6cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A girl looks up with an adorable fox-like creature perched on her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> is grand in scale and has powerful ecological messages, with a story of two nearby nations at war amidst an environmental wasteland. Nausicaä is the first of many of Miyazaki’s intelligent and brave heroines who must navigate a post-apocalyptic world. Her adventure takes her the Toxic Jungle, a thicket of giant plants, fungi, and huge, creepy-crawly insects, in search of hope and healing. </p><p>There’s a lot of visual variety in this film’s landscapes, from the rolling green hills and peaceful windmills of Nausicaä’s country home to ancient, magical ruins and dense, mysterious forests. But the highlights of <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind </em>are its action-packed flying scenes in which Nausicaä soars swiftly on her glider while warriors maneuver their giant bomber-like planes around her. It’s a rousing journey that is clearly in awe of both the beauty and mystery of nature, reminding us of our duty to protect our planet.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7d4a181bba1cb4ed348435a3c516e26" data-recommend-id="image://e7d4a181bba1cb4ed348435a3c516e26" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sheeta and Pazu stand with arms around each other.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The title itself, <em>Castle in the Sky</em>, brings to mind an otherworldly spectacle, and the film gives us one: Laputa is a magical kingdom hidden amongst puffy clouds and shadows and one of Miyazaki’s most visually stunning settings. The quest young Pazu and Sheeta embark on to reach the titular castle is filled with action, high stakes, and drama. Sheeta and Pazu share a heartwarming friendship that’s tinged with romance—Sheeta is bashful and withdrawn, while Pazu is more lively and exuberant.<br></p><p>Their contrasting personalities make them compelling characters. They are both equally protective of one another; Sheeta bravely wants to finish the mission on her own so that Pazu is not hurt, but he refuses to leave her side. <em>Castle in the Sky </em>also features some of Miyazaki’s most vibrant villains, including an old crone and her quirky group of sky pirate sons and the stoic, deceitful Colonel Muska, who relentlessly pursue Sheeta’s crystal amulet. <em>Castle in the Sky </em>is a soaring fairy tale with a classic good-versus-evil story. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e49ae4cdbf5444cbdca4306890ec48ea" data-recommend-id="image://e49ae4cdbf5444cbdca4306890ec48ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with a bandage on his head stands in front of a house.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Released a decade after his intended retirement, Hayao Miyazaki made <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> at 82 years old. The ambitious film treads familiar territory as a young boy goes on a journey to a brightly colored fantasy world where the living and the dead live in harmony (and there’s also an army of human-like parakeets). Set in 1940s Japan, the film centers 12-year-old Mahito, who has been mourning the death of his mother in a hospital fire after a Tokyo bombing raid by the Allies.<br></p><p>Miyazaki confronts this devastating event in a harrowing flashback sequence, set against a nearly black background, with huge balls of fire raining down on the city—it looks like hell on Earth. Miyazaki uses a hazy, sketch-like animation style to evoke the pain of Mahito’s memory. It’s a very visceral way to confront the audience with the pain and devastation of war, showing how trauma lives inside victims, especially the young ones, forever.<br></p><p>Mahito’s grief allows him to become easily swindled by a mysterious bird, voiced by a gravelly Robert Pattinson, who promises to reunite him with his mother. While <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> explores the ideas of grief, legacy, and family—which feel especially poignant coming from an older filmmaker—the story doesn’t quite come together as much as in Miyazaki’s other films, and the fantasy world is not as striking.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a6a975579366955120ceb8a248fa14f4" data-recommend-id="image://a6a975579366955120ceb8a248fa14f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Howl embraces Sophie.

Transformed into a short crone, Sophie volunteers to work as a cleaning lady in Howl’s castle, a steampunk patchwork of wood and metal that loudly lumbers through the countryside. Sophie is kind and hardworking, while Howl is vain and self-absorbed, often throwing tantrums if his hair dye doesn’t turn out right. Despite his flaws, though, he has a good heart. Their differences make the romance that develops between them an enchanting watch.<br></p><p>The castle is also home to other eccentric characters that add a lot of humor, like Calcifer, a fire demon voiced by Billy Crystal, and a cute scarecrow named Turnip Head. Miyazaki ties all of these whimsical elements together with a poignant anti-war message, as you’d expect. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a8f24032a416eb7248cf3217054b5a46" data-recommend-id="image://a8f24032a416eb7248cf3217054b5a46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Princess Mononoke stands next to a wolf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Mononoke stands next to a wolf." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Toho Co., Ltd. / Miramax</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8f24032a416eb7248cf3217054b5a46" data-recommend-id="image://a8f24032a416eb7248cf3217054b5a46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Princess Mononoke stands next to a wolf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Princess Mononoke</em> takes a more biting, intense approach to environmentalism than some of Miyazaki’s other films. It’s a lengthy, sprawling epic about a young man involved in a war between the forest gods and a mining colony. He comes across the iron-willed Mononoke Hime, a young woman raised by the wolf god Moro. A nimble warrior and princess who wields a bone knife and spear, she’s not afraid do whatever it takes to protect the forest gods against the humans who have been systematically destroying their home. Princess Mononoke loves and fights fiercely, making her a bewitching heroine.<br></p><p>Unlike the fanciful creatures of Miyazaki’s other works, the animals in <em>Princess Mononoke</em> are more life-like, majestic, and hauntingly beautiful, and their detailed animation is breathtaking. There’s a towering elk with impressive antlers, a massive wolf, and the Forest Spirit—an awe-inspiring figure resembling both a stag and a mythical Kirin from Japanese folklore. <em>Princess Mononoke</em> does not hold back on the violence and suffering that comes standard with environmental destruction, making this high fantasy epic one of Miyazaki’s darkest and most powerful films.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4292f58267a27e02ab5d8eaa8cefa230" data-recommend-id="image://4292f58267a27e02ab5d8eaa8cefa230" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jiro Horikoshi looks up at a plane.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Aside from a continued fascination with flight, <em>The Wind Rises</em> stands apart from Hayao Miyazaki’s other films. There are no mythical realms with fantastical creatures; instead, it’s a sophisticated World War II biopic of Jiro Horikoshi, the Japanese engineer who designed the fighter jets used at Pearl Harbor. Taking some creative liberties with Horikoshi’s life, <em>The Wind Rises</em> explores complex ideas about the price of artistic creation.<br></p><p>Miyazaki contrasts the lovingly crafted details of Horikoshi’s sleek machines and the serene countryside where they were created with the destruction and havoc these machines cause in the world, an internal struggle Horikoshi grapples with throughout the film. These contemplative themes are complemented by Jiro Horikoshi’s touching romance with a woman named Nahako. They meet unexpectedly during an earthquake and never forget one another until they reunite years later. After quickly falling in love, they marry when Nahako is diagnosed with tuberculosis.<br></p><p>The final words on the screen, “The wind rises...We must try to live” are a poetic reminder that although we are constantly swept away by the difficult changes of life, we must adapt to them. The sensitive, humanistic approach to adapting the life of a real person whose passion had severe global repercussions makes <em>The Wind Rises</em> one of Miyazaki’s greatest works.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c54a119fcaf18cac5945096406d021a3" data-recommend-id="image://c54a119fcaf18cac5945096406d021a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kiki and her cat fly on a broomstick over the ocean.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Kiki is one of Miyazaki’s most endearing heroines: resourceful and kind, curious and outspoken, gregarious and hardworking. At 13, all witches must live independently and discover their “special skill” and Kiki decides to explore flying, which she uses to start a delivery service for a bakery in a quaint coastal town. The gentle charm of <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service </em>lies in the various townsfolk she encounters—like a rambunctious little boy with a huge, sleepy dog, an artist who wants to paint her, and kindly elderly ladies Kiki helps with household chores.<br></p><p>We follow the small, everyday challenges she faces, from hauling packages up tall stairs to dealing with a mischievous gust of wind that makes her lose her first delivery. <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service </em>builds to a thrilling climax in which Kiki must rescue her friend from a burning blimp. It’s a sweet, cozy coming-of-age journey that beautifully captures the uncertainties and heightened emotions of growing up and going out on your own.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b02d88732f949c78ffef57a6ab16bbe1" data-recommend-id="image://b02d88732f949c78ffef57a6ab16bbe1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Totoro and kids sit on a tree branch over a river.

Not much happens in this simple tale about sisters adjusting to their new rural home while their mother recovers in the hospital, but it has so much imagination and heart. The lovely and uncomplicated narrative lets you focus on the magical forest spirit Totoro, a gentle giant with a fluffy, gray body and tall ears.<br></p><p><em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> is mostly composed of cute, breezy vignettes of Totoro and the sisters engaging in various activities: learning how to use an umbrella, making trees grow out of the ground with a dance, and flying through the air while hanging onto Totoro’s belly, overlooking the entire countryside. There are other enchanting creatures, too: dust bunnies, a giant cat bus with glowing eyes and mice for headlights, and tiny little Totoros that scurry through the forest. There’s a very emotional climax in which the 4-year-old Mei argues with her older sister Satsuki and gets lost, but for the most part <em>My Neighbor Totoro </em>is just a simple story about the magic of being a child. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c58d58ede18a18df6253ee7279799dc5" data-recommend-id="image://c58d58ede18a18df6253ee7279799dc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chihiro looks shocked.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Spirited Away</em> has all the elements that make Hayao Miyazaki’s films so unique, but with a darker, Grimms’-fairy-tale-esque edge. 10-year-old Chihiro gets  swept away to a dreamlike fantasy world, but not one of excitement and adventure—one of uncertainty and danger. She must face numerous trials to rescue her parents who have been transformed into pigs.<br></p><p>While working at a spirit bathhouse, Chihiro meets surreal creatures that really show off the power of Miyazaki’s designs: evil twin witches, a giant baby, and No-Face, a masked spirit who grows larger with everything and anything he consumes. There’s also the repulsive Stink Spirit, a huge puddle of sludge, and the Susuwatari, small fuzzballs whose entire existence revolves around endlessly putting coal in the bathhouse boiler. </p><p><em>Spirited Away </em>is Hayao Miyazaki’s most mesmerizing film, thanks to its inventive design, sensitive portrayal of childhood fears, and suspenseful story. It’s an absolute classic that transcends the genre. <br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Building on the overwhelming success of its predecessors, <em>My Time at Sandrock</em> and <em>My Time At Portia</em>, this new chapter innovates and redefines the life-<a title="Genres > Simulation [568 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> genre. Designed to appeal to both life-simulation fans and RPG enthusiasts, <em>My Time at Evershine</em> features deep <a title="Genres > RPG [16,614 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">role-playing</a> elements, from meaningful character progression to expansive exploration and quests. Pathea invites everyone to build a new home together.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The multi-million selling <em>My Time</em> series expands with a fresh and exciting formula that builds on everything players loved. Featuring a stunning new art direction, revamped gameplay mechanics, a diverse cast of romanceable characters, 40-plus hour narrative brimming with exploration and, new to the series, town <a title="Genres > Management [26 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>. RPG fans will find themselves right at home.</p><p>In <em>My Time at Portia</em> and <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, players embraced the role of the builder, tasked with completing essential jobs to keep the town running—often taking on work others avoided. <em>My Time at Evershine</em>, however, introduces a fresh dynamic, transforming the player’s role and elevating you from builder to Governor. As the city’s key figure, you’ll start with nothing more than a modest campfire, but your vision and leadership will drive the development of the entire city and its citizens. With other characters handling the smaller, routine tasks, your role as Governor feels more relaxed, giving you the freedom to focus on shaping the city’s future and dive into the dangers that await.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>All New Story-Driven Campaign</strong> – Be the Governor of a brand-new settlement on the fringes of the Free Cities, facing the almighty Duvos Empire. Recruit settlers, build infrastructure, tame the wilds, and lead your people to create a new idyllic stronghold for the Alliance filled with enchanting characters and memorable stories to enjoy. This new sequel will feature a more defined antagonist, bringing even more <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,755 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> and excitement than ever before.</li><li><strong>New Art Direction</strong> – <em>My Time At Evershine</em> is the most beautiful and realistic game in the franchise to date. Environments are more expansive and varied, characters look more realistic, and animations are motion-captured to create a more believable world.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Multiplayer [381 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> Cooperative Play</strong> – For the first time in the <em>My Time</em> series, the campaign can be enjoyed both solo and in <a title="Genres > Co-Op [201 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">co-op</a> mode with up to four players, making it perfect for family and friends. The host controls the pace of the main story, while all players share resources and money, allowing everyone to collaborate and contribute to the adventure together.</li><li><strong>Build a Society</strong> – This ambitious sequel casts players as the all-powerful Governor, who can not only build new facilities, and explore but also command a team of recruitable and customizable NPCs. These NPCs handle the day-to-day tasks like construction and resource gathering, allowing the Governor to focus on more important decisions.</li><li><strong>Meaningful Relationships</strong> – Social play was a key part of <em>My Time at Sandrock</em> and <em>My Time at Portia</em>. In <em>My Time at Evershine</em>, Pathea Games is set to expand these systems even more. Players can recruit up to three followers to stay with them during day-to-day tasks or they can dispatch them to do their bidding across Northern Eufala. Pathea Games is targeting eight to 10 romanceable characters in the campaign with dozens of other characters spread throughout the game. Players will also have to take their followers’ needs and wants into account with tiredness and hunger impacting morale and performance. RPG players will love the deep character interactions and the ability to forge meaningful relationships, with romanceable characters integrated into the storyline and more opportunities to develop connections earlier in the campaign.</li><li><strong>Tame A Wild New Frontier</strong> – Three years after the events of <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, the Duvos Empire has taken over the Orzu Ruins which Ethea also claims as their own, leading to a tense situation just north of the Alliance of Free Cities border in the Northern Eufaula region. In response, the Alliance has launched the North Development Plan to move settlers into the area and establish a new City-State for better defense. Evershine is one of six major new settlements in the area and will prove pivotal in the ongoing hostilities.</li><li><strong>Mod Support</strong> – <em>My Time at Evershine</em> will include full mod support for both single-player and multiplayer modes, allowing players to customize and expand their RPG experience.

                <p dir="ltr">The kart racer Disney Speedstorm has already included a wide selection of racers from new and classic films across Disney animation, Pixar, and even live-action franchises. But so far the game has not invited Maleficent to join the competition, and we all know how she feels about being snubbed. Gameloft has announced Maleficent will join with a Limited-Time Event during Season 9, Part 2, and we have a first look at the trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">Maleficent is a Trickster racer, meaning her class specializes in disrupting other racers and has an enhanced speed boost ability. Her unique ability, Mistress of Evil, has two applications. The standard attack has her raise her staff to call down lightning on the track in front of her, and successful hits will gain her a flame. Under the charged version, collecting six flames will activate her Dragon form, transforming Maleficent and her kart into a dragon that flies (in autopilot) at increased speed, and takes out any racers in her way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Disney Speedstorm - Exclusive Maleficent Racer Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Though Gameloft has not announced the details of her LTE, these events generally run for about a week and let you unlock new racers through completing a series of objectives with your other, already-unlocked racers. Maleficent joins as the special unlockable character in this part of the season, joining Cruella who was added during the last part.</p><p dir="ltr">Disney Speedstorm is currently in Season 9, Part 2. Speedstorm's Golden Pass track was split into two parts per season recently, and all of Season 9 is themed after Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean. The Pirates franchise was already represented by Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann at launch, but the new season adds a new Pirates track along with four more Pirates characters: Davy Jones, Will Turner, Hector Barbossa, Tia Dalma.</p>

            <p>Sundance audience award-winning documentary The Remarkable Life of Ibelin - which tells the story of quadriplegic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> player Mats Steen - is set to debut on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> next month.</p>
<p>Norwegian gamer Steen battled the degenerative disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and passed away in 2014 aged 25. However, during his 25 years, he touched many lives via his World of Warcraft avatar, Ibelin.</p>
<p>"Unbeknownst to his relatives, Steen was able to form deep friendships across vast distances, because of his passion and pastime," reads a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/ibelin-release-date-trailer-news">Netflix feature</a> on the documentary.</p>

<p>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin has been brought together by filmmaker Benjamin Ree, and features interviews with Steen's friends and family.</p>
<p>In addition to using archival footage, Ree also worked with animators on the documentary. These animators "used models lifted directly from the game to show viewers exactly what [Steen] would have seen as he played the game between 2004 and 2014".</p>
<p>When Ree finished creating The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, the filmmaker asked World of Warcraft developer Blizzard would consider waiving its intellectual property rights so the film could find a release. After watching the documentary themselves, and hearing Ree had "no plan B", the company's executives acquiesced.</p>
<p>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin will be available to stream via Netflix from 25th October. You can check out a trailer for the upcoming documentary above.</p>
<p>"It's a huge honour that Ibelin will now be on Netflix," Ree said. "Mats Steen's story will be available to so many millions of people across the world.</p>
<p>"I couldn't be more excited."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1835989031714169035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1835989031714169035%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by Rockstar leaker Tez, the PC version of GTA V was updated earlier today to add the third-party anti-cheat system BattlEye, a popular software used in games like APB Reloaded, ARK, Arma, Battalion 1944, Conan Exiles, DayZ, Destiny 2, Escape from Tarkov, Fortnite, Insurgency, Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord, PlanetSide 2, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, PUBG: Battlegrounds, Skull and Bones, The Crew, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, Watch Dogs: Legion, and XDefiant.</p>
<p>The lack of a proper anti-cheat system has long been the source of complaints among those who play GTA Online, the multiplayer mode of GTA V, on PC. BattlEye could certainly help improve the cheating situation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Tez also looked into the new files released with the update and <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1836008467066147071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1836008467066147071%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noticed</a> a leftover metadata file that reportedly hints at Rockstar working on porting the next-generation update released on consoles to PC. GTA V on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X has included ray traced shadows and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-gets-ray-traced-reflections-on-ps5-and-xsx-still-no-word-for-pc-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ray traced reflections</a> for years now, so it might finally be time for PC players to get a visual upgrade.</p>
<p>Even with the bulk of Rockstar busy on GTA VI (currently slated to land in Fall 2025, barring any further delays), GTA Online is still being regularly updated with new content and events. The latest ongoing event is called 'Executive Bonuses':</p>
<p><em>Once you amass a stockpile of contraband inside your Warehouses, speak to Lupe and put your Staff to work sourcing Special Cargo at double the usual speed this week, and complete Special Cargo Sales to rake in 2X GTA$ and RP. Selling GTA$300,000 worth of Special Cargo throughout the week will complete the Weekly Challenge and land you GTA$100,000 as a reward. Pawning off extra crates in Export Mixed Goods will also dish out Double Rewards through September 18.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-game-store-and-fortnite-now-available-in-eu-on-ipad<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> fans still in the European Union can now play Epic Games' battle royale on iPad.
</p>
<p>
The Epic Games Store - and through it both Fortnite and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> - are now available on Apple's tablet, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">their relaunch on iPhone in the EU and on Android phones worldwide last month</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In a briefing to press attended by Eurogamer last month, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said he had "no regrets" over Fortnite's lengthy absence from mobile platforms as the company has waged legal battles to change app store policies. 
</p>
<p>
Four years of courtroom wrangling and an estimated $1bn in lost revenue later, Epic Games has now been able to launch its own mobile app store on Apple and Google devices - including now on iPad in mainland Europe.
</p>
<p>
Downloading the Epic Game Store requires you to load up Epic Games' website and download the storefront from there, navigating through a number of warnings by Apple - which would really rather you did not.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games previously said it would continue to push for iPhone and iPad launches of the Epic Game Store in more countries - including the UK and Japan - over the next year.
</p>
<p>
"We've probably lost a billion dollars not having Fortnite on iOS the past four years," Sweeney said. "But what's the price of freedom?"
</p>
<p>For those looking to catch up on Fortnite's current shenanigans, today's big mid-season update has added yet more Marvel to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-and-marvel-confirm-new-crossover-season-starring-doctor-doom-as-disney-integration-deepens">Absolute Doom season</a>. Iron Man has returned to the game - via a new skin you can buy from its Shop, rather than the one in its previous Marvel battle pass. There's also a new Marvel characters limited-time mode, with various superpowered abilities to wield.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-elden-ring-60-fps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro game boost mode could make the system the only one capable of running FromSoftware's Elden Ring at locked 60 frames per second, according to a new analysis.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their Weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> attempted to get a first look at how the console's game boost mode could provide improvements to games that won't get PlayStation 5 Pro patches. The test was conducted using an RX 6800 GPU, as it is around 45% more powerful than the base PS5, just like the Pro, and features 60 compute units and possibly similar clock speeds.&nbsp; The test was focused on Elden Ring and was conducted using the same resolution as the game's Quality Mode on the base console and similar settings. Unfortunately, it was not possible to recreate the same identical settings on PC due to the lack of a dynamic resolution scaling option and settings quality adjustment on the fly that are available on console, and some console setting not having an equivalent in the PC version, being a mix between medium and high.</p>
<p>Even so, the test made it clear how the PlayStation 5 Pro game boost mode may not entirely deliver a locked 60 FPS experience in Quality Mode, as, in some instances, the game running on the RX 6800 GPU dropped to the 50 FPS range. However, in Performance Mode, with dynamic resolution scaling and settings quality adjustments on the fly, the console may very well run Elden Ring at 60 FPS with game boost if the feature really delivers the full power of the system's GPU. The FromSoftware game is obviously not going to be the only game that will see an improvement even without a dedicated PS5 Pro patch, as games using AMD FSR 2 and dynamic resolution scaling should see a significant image quality boost as well, as the higher the base pixel count, the better visuals AMD's upscaler delivers.</p>

<p>We won't have to wait much longer to see how unpatched games will take advantage of the PlayStation 5 Pro's power. The console will launch in less than two months, on November 7th, worldwide.</p>

<p>Rockstar Games has finally added anti-cheat to GTA 5 on PC 9 years after the game’s initial release.</p>



<p>TexFunz2 <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1835989031714169035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first spotted</a> the information on X (formerly Twitter), who posted a steamID patch notes screenshot of GTA 5 showing the update on PC. The patch notes reveal that Rockstar Games has opted for BattlEye for its anti-cheat.</p>



<p>As the community has rightfully pointed out, the news of anti-cheat in GTA 5 is welcome, but there are concerns as to whether it will impact the modding community. So far, Rockstar Games are yet to officially announce the implementation of anti-cheat, but an announcement is likely soon.</p>



<p>For those familiar with anit-cheat and the cheating community, cheaters have already said that BattlEye isn’t the best at preventing cheaters. Rainbow 6 Siege, which also used BattlEye, has been slammed by the community for its poor anti-cheat in recent years, with many of its games containing hackers. </p>



<p>As for whether it will prevent the cheating situation in GTA 5 on PC, it remains to be seen, but at the moment, it seems to be a welcome sign for those who are still playing the game. Despite being nine years old, GTA 5 on PC still achieves around 160,000 concurrent players in any given day.</p>



<p>What do you think of Rockstar Games’ decision to implement BattlEye anti-cheat into GTA 5 for PC? Let us know in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a>. </p>

            <p>Backwards compatibility is a key reason AMD will be the chip manufacturer for Sony's PlayStation 6 console.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-intel-lost-sony-playstation-business-2024-09-16/">Reuters</a>, AMD and Intel were the final two contenders in a bidding war to manufacture the computer chip for Sony's next console.</p>
<p>However, AMD ultimately won the bid - with the need to provide backwards compatibility for previous consoles reportedly a major factor.</p>
<p>Both Sony's PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles feature custom AMD CPU and GPU chips, so it makes sense to maintain consistency to ensure compatibility with games from previous generations. This, and the rise of digital ownership, has helped the transition between these consoles.</p>

<p>Speaking to Reuters, sources said a swap to Intel would have risked backwards compatibility, by making it more costly to develop and requiring additional engineering resources.</p>
<p>Indeed, the unique IBM-developed "cell" processor of the PS3 caused problems with ports - it's why on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus games</a> from that console are only available via the cloud.</p>
<p>On the one hand, then, AMD's win suggests backwards compatibility will be part of Sony's next console, which is good news for players.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is a major loss for Intel, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/intel-says-painful-decision-to-cut-15000-jobs-is-one-of-the-most-consequential-changes-in-its-history">last month cut 15,000 jobs</a> as part of "significant actions to reduce costs" and save the company $10m next year.</p>
<p>Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the layoffs were "painful" as the company makes "some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history".</p>
<p>An Intel spokesperson told Reuters in response to its failure to win Sony's PS6 business: "We strongly disagree with this characterisation but are not going to comment about any current or potential customer conversations. We have a very healthy customer pipeline across both our product and foundry business, and we are squarely focused on innovating to meet their needs."</p>
<p>While the PlayStation 6 is still a long way off, last week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">Sony revealed its long-expected PS5 Pro console</a>. It's digital-only and features an upgraded GPU among other features to provide higher fidelity graphics with a higher frame rate, all for the price of £700.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/max-payne-rtx-remix-path-tracing-new-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the Max Payne RTX Remix path tracing mod demo is now available for download, introducing further visual improvements.</p>
<p>Version 0.5, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/max-payne-rtx-on-demo-level/downloads/mp-demo-roscoe-v05">here</a>, removes the normal maps from the main character model's head, face, arms, and hands, as well as from surfaces to make them flat, improving how they look with path tracing. Additionally, the new version reworks lighting throughout to make everything brighter and introduces some experimental physical lighting to muzzle flashes and a few more changes over the previous version.</p>
<p>The Max Payne series is getting closer to its official revival with the remakes of the first and second entries in the series. Announced two years ago, Remedy Entertainment confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/">last month</a> that the remake combining the two games has finally entered full production, with the current goal being to have the game in an early functional state from beginning to end. As such, it may not be long before we finally see how Remedy will modernize two of the most popular games of all time. Besides working on this project, Remedy is also working on the second entry in the Control series and the second Alan Wake 2 DLC, the Lake House expansion.</p>
<p>The original Max Payne is available for purchase on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/201330/Max_Payne/">Steam.</a></p>

			<p>A new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch is now live, introducing performance and stability improvements, as well as a Casual Mode and plenty of balance tweaks.</p>
<p>The September 17th patch introduces further fixes to issues around CPU overload in certain situations, which should lead to performance improvements in areas with a lot of NPCs, like town centers. The new patch also reduced the frequency of crashes, improving game stability.</p>
<p>All of the other changes the new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch introduces are related to gameplay. The patch brings a Casual Mode, which tweaks some aspects of the experience to make it easier, such as reducing inn fees and the price of Ferrystones, stamina consumption when dashing outside of battle, and more. In this mode, Pawns will also recover from the dragonsplague without triggering its most devastating effects, even when the symptoms progress to a terminal stage.</p>
<p>The new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch also introduces tons of Vocation changes for almost all Vocations, with the exception of the Trickster Vocation and other gameplay changes and fixes. You can find the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2054970/view/6976727636231899159?l=english">here.</a></p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about what is more of a reboot of the series, rather than an actual sequel, with Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">review</a>.</p>

Arrowhead said this will make it much easier for players to take them into consideration when deciding their next move. The new emote wheel feature lets players equip up to four emotes in the armory and access them using the new emote wheel feature by holding the emote button.</p><p>Patch 01.001.100 arrives two days before the next Premium Warbond, dubbed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-next-premium-warbond-adds-chemical-weapons-new-stratagems-and-a-pull-my-finger-emote">Chemical Agents</a>, launches on September 19. While Chemical Agents does not include any new weapons, it adds two stratagem variants — the TX-41 Sterilizer, which lets you spray a gas at the Terminids and Automatons, and the Guard Dog's ‘Dog Breath,’ which is a corrosive gas sprayer — and, in keeping with the alien exterminator theme, the G-4 Gas grenade, which covers the whole area in a cloud of noxious fumes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Thank you for your valuable feedback,” Arrowhead said in the patch notes, below. “Many players have expressed feeling constrained in how they approach challenges, often relying on a limited set of tools while other options seem less effective. This has impacted your ability to play the game in a way that suits your preferences.</p><p>“So, what’s changing? For all the bugdivers out there, many situations were previously either resolved with your primary weapon or anti-tank weapons, which haven’t always performed as expected. With the overwhelming presence of Bile Titans and Chargers, many weapon choices therefore became invalid. </p><p>"To address this, we've reworked armor penetration, anti-tank weapons, enemy armor and health values. Our goal is to improve the effectiveness of weapons such as the Autocannon, Heavy Machine Gun, Flamethrower, and Anti-Materiel Rifle against heavily armored enemies. Although they may not be as effective as specialized anti-tank weapons, they are now more viable choices making your loadouts more versatile, fostering better team collaboration and planning.</p><p>“On the Bot front, Hulks have also had their armor reduced, making them more vulnerable to a wider range of weapons. Additionally, to improve the gameplay experience, the Devastator and Gunship will now have a limited supply of rockets, and those rockets won’t hit as frequently as before. This comes alongside the previously updated smaller impact radius for rockets, reducing excessive ragdolling.</p><p>“We’ve also made improvements to many primary weapons, bringing them closer in effectiveness to the most popular choices. This should offer more variety and flavor during your play sessions.</p><p>“We are adjusting damage mechanics to make the damage Helldivers receive more consistent over time by reducing 100% extra headshot damage to 50%. To maintain the overall challenge of the game, we've slightly increased the damage taken to other parts of the body. Our intent is to preserve the intensity of the gameplay while minimizing frustrating situations where sudden headshots cause large damage spikes.</p><p>“With these changes, along with an upgraded Helldiver arsenal, enemy adjustments, and more consistent damage, the overall difficulty may slightly decrease. We'll be monitoring this closely and will listen to the community on how you think it feels.</p><p>“We want to assure you that your feedback remains essential to us. Please share your thoughts on these updates, as we are actively listening. We plan to conduct another balance pass by Day 60 of our commitment to ensure we’re aligning with what you need for the best possible experience and to address any concerns or adjustments required. Your insights will be invaluable in refining these changes and making sure the game remains engaging and enjoyable for everyone.”</p><h2>Helldivers 2 update 01.001.100 patch notes in full:</h2><p>Balancing</p><p><strong>General</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Previously, partial damage dealt 50% of full damage, which we found to be overly punishing and reduced effectiveness too much, leading to an excessive reliance on high armor penetration weapons.

The publication was established in 2008 and sought to cover the (then) emerging mobile game market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://toucharcade.com/2024/09/16/toucharcade-is-shutting-down/">In a lengthy post on the TouchArcade website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, editor-in-chief Jared Nelson explained normal daily operations will cease ahead of a total shutdown.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This is a post that I've known was coming for quite some time, but that doesn’t make it any easier to write. After more than 16 years TouchArcade will be closing its doors and shutting down operations," he wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There may be an additional post here or there in the coming weeks as we try to honor any previously agreed to obligations, and a proper farewell post is in the works too, but as of now our normal daily operations have ceased. The reason we're shutting down probably isn't a surprising one: Money."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nelson said the outlet has been struggling to make ends meet for years and suggested it was a "miracle" it survived as long as it did. "The truth of the matter is that a website like ours just doesn't make money anymore," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"To our own detriment we've resisted things like obnoxious in-your-face advertising, egregious clickbait headlines, or ethically questionable sponsorships, which sadly are the types of things that actually still make money in the internet of today."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">TouchArcade currently bills itself as the "largest site dedicated to iPhone and iPod Touch gaming," although it also covers other portable hardware such as Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch, and peripherals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Aside from impacting the livelihood of Nelson and freelancers like Shaun Musgrave and Mikhail Madnani, TouchArcade's closure will perhaps make it even harder for mobile developers to cut through the noise in a competitive and crowded market.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="TouchArcade to preserve content archive, continue podcast with Patreon support">TouchArcade to preserve content archive, continue podcast with Patreon support</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">TouchArcade's complete content archive will remain freely accessible for the "foreseeable future." That means over 33,000 published articles, including more than 4,000 game reviews, have been preserved.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"These should hopefully all continue living on into the future for reference purposes and just to look back and see how drastically the mobile gaming landscape changed over the last decade and a half," said Nelson. "We are also hoping to continue with our Podcast, The TouchArcade Show, which very recently just celebrated its 600th(!) episode."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nelson will now look to pivot the TouchArcade Patreon towards supporting the podcast, but noted it could still enable the team to publish "occasional posts or special features."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's just a nugget of an idea right now, but it would be pretty cool to see TouchArcade be able to live on even in that small way," he added. "Whatever the case ends up being, I will explicitly change the verbiage of our Patreon to state that it's no longer about supporting the website, and if people choose to stop contributing then that is totally understandable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whatever happens, TouchArcade as we know it will largely cease to exist. It's a reality that proves how hostile the video game industry has become for workers of all creeds, including members of the press.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news comes after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ign-entertainment-buys-gamesindustry-rockpapershotgun-and-other-outlets">IGN Entertainment purchased Gamer Network publications</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> including GamesIndustry,biz, Rock Paper Shotgun, VG247, and more only to immediate conduct a round of layoffs. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/kotaku-australia-is-being-shuttered-by-pedestrian-group">Kotaku Australia was also shut down by parent company Pedestrian Group in July</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p>This marks another occasion PlayStation is removing one of its console exclusives from the service, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/littlebigplanet-3">LittleBigPlanet 3</a> being published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-is-pulling-its-own-blockbuster-game-from-ps-plus">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-is-leaving-playstation-plus">Horizon Forbidden West</a> were also both removed from PS Plus.</p>
<p>"Held together by Sellotape rather than superglue, LittleBigPlanet 3 is in constant danger of falling apart," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/littlebigplanet-3-review">Eurogamer's LittleBigPlanet 3 review from 2014</a>. </p>
<p>Another surprise removal is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-evil-within">The Evil Within</a>, which would make for a very suitable pre-halloween scary game choice for anyone looking to get their thrills and bloody spills without leaving the comfort of home.</p>
<p>
"Shinji Mikami has yet to make a poor game, and The Evil Within does not blemish his record. But neither does the game enchant and disrupt in the way that Vanquish and the others managed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-evil-within-review">Eurogamer's The Evil Within review</a>. "This is Mikami revisiting his past glories and, as such, it's both a delight and a disappointment."</p>

            <p>
Having shot up the near-future in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, DICE and EA are using a modern-day setting with the next instalment of their military <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> series. According to EA studios group general manager and Respawn chief Vince Zampella, the new, currently untitled shooter will be one of those "back to basics" sequels that tries to rebottle the lightning of Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 - these being the "peak" Battlefield games, in Zampella's view.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
All this comes care of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">an interview with IGN</a>, who have also bagged the first piece of concept art, above. Good job, Ian Games! The artwork shows an urban riverside landscape covered in explosions, streaking missile smoke and raging wildfires. We can see helicopters and warships in the river, and the whole thing sports an orangey-dark colour scheme which, as IGN notes, recalls the key art for Battlefields 3 and 4. 
</p>
<p>
"I mean, if you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it's that Battlefield 3... Battlefield 4 era where everything was modern," Zampella commented in the piece. "And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we'll see where it goes from there. But I think for me, it's that peak of Battlefield-ness is in that Battlefield 3 and 4 days. So I think it's nostalgic for players, for me, for the teams even. Those are kind of the heyday... although I would say [Battlefield] 1942 also."
</p>
<p>
The ungenerous reading here is that "getting back to the core" is marketing speak for "getting the hell away from Battlefield 2042", which has gone down poorly with players for a host of reasons ranging from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-removed-its-128-player-breakthrough-mode-but-is-still-advertising-it">its 128-player engagements being unfocused</a>, to its "specialist" system being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-will-revive-its-old-class-system-next-week">an ill-advised leap into customisable hero shooter territory</a>. It's been heavily revised and updated since its 2021 launch, but has yet to enjoy any kind of serious resurgence. In the interview, Zampella defended the work of the Battlefield 2042 team while acknowledging a few of the complaints.
</p>
<p>

"Yeah, the 128 player, did it make it more fun?" he said. "Like... doing the number for the sake of the number doesn't make any sense. We're testing everything around what's the most fun. So like you said, the maps, once they get to a certain scale, become different. It's a different play space, and I think you have to design around that. So we are designing something that is more akin to previous Battlefields. I'd rather have nice, dense, really nice, well-designed play spaces."
</p>
<p>
Battlefield has always fetishised big-team PvP, and it's always interesting to see the developers come and go about how many players is too many players. I haven't played enough to comment as regards Battlefield 2042, however. I only ever played the Xbox One version, which had some genuinely fascinating technical limitations, with sandy skyscraper maps that looked like they were made of beige packing foam.
</p>
<p>
As for Specialists, Zampella commented that: "I wasn't there for 2042. I don't know what the rationale was, but for me, it's like the team tried something new. You have to applaud that effort. Not everybody liked it, but you got to try things. It didn't work. It didn't fit. Specialist will not be coming back. So classes are kind of at the core of Battlefield, and we're going back to that."
</p>
<p>
The new Battlefield is the work of several EA studios - DICE, Motive, Ripple Effect and Need For Speed developers Criterion (a small "core group" of Criterion devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-majority-of-need-for-speed-dev-criterion-are-shifting-to-battlefield">are still working on Need For Speed</a>). Ridgeline Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefields-next-campaign-being-developed-by-halo-co-creators-new-studio">were also briefly involved</a> before they got shuttered. As Matt Jarvis (RPS in peace) reported in May, it'll be another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/next-battlefield-game-will-have-connected-multiplayer-and-single-player-offerings-made-by-series-biggest-team-yet">live service affair</a> - Zampella doesn't mention single player in the IGN chat.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the interview is mostly just paeans to those terrible furies, "the fans". Zampella mentions the importance of "expanding out and getting more players into the universe and seeing what we can do, so when you want a different experience, you don't have to leave Battlefield", which sounds like groundwork for some cross-media announcements of some kind. There's also the obligatory question about ancient rival Call Of Duty (Zampella co-founded Infinity Ward and worked on the earlier Modern Warfare games before jumping ship to launch Respawn). "We're not looking to take down Call of Duty," Zampella told IGN. "We're making something that's different and we're making something that's us. But yeah, it definitely has the possibility."
</p>
<p>
We can expect more concrete details about the new Battlefield next year. "We have a program that we're going to announce next year around getting more community in, because that's kind of the core of what we have to do - get the community back on our side, get that trust back," Zampella told IGN. "So I think we're in a really good place. Is it challenging? Of course, but it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't." 

</p>
<p>I haven't felt the urge to play Battlefield in a long while but I will always cherish the experience of being pinned down near an objective in Battlefield 3, with the combined ordnance of the entire enemy team concentrated on the top of my head. I hope the next game rediscovers a bit of that, erm, magic.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nvidia boss Jensen Huang has discussed the advantages of AI, and said it was now a key component for the advancement of graphical capabilities.
</p>
<p>
"We can't do computer graphics anymore without artificial intelligence," Huang said, speaking recently at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4720501-nvidia-corporation-nvda-ceo-jensen-huang-presents-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology">SeekingAlpha</a>). 
</p>
<p>
"We compute one pixel, we infer the other 32. I mean, it's incredible," Huang continued. "And so we hallucinate, if you will, the other 32, and it looks temporally stable, it looks photorealistic, and the image quality is incredible, the performance is incredible."
</p>
<p>
While the energy costs of using AI are often highlighted as one of its various downsides, Huang argued that using it to compute parts of an image was instead saving power versus creating the image directly.
</p>
<p>
"The amount of energy we save - computing one pixel takes a lot of energy," Huang added. "That's computation. Inferencing the other 32 takes very little energy, and you can do it incredibly fast."
</p>
<p>Nvidia uses AI generation in its powerful DLSS technology, which boosts performance by AI-generating additional frames. Last week, we learned more about how Sony was implementing a similar idea with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-ps5-pros-pssr-ai-upscaling-could-be-a-game-changer">PSSR AI upscaling in the freshly-unveiled PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>
AI is frequently criticised for its planet-melting energy costs, particularly in the growing usage of publicly available large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot. Still, Huang said the "productivity gains" from using these to generate code were "just incredible".
</p>
<p>
"There's not one software engineer in our company today who doesn't use code generators," Huang said. "The days of every line of code being written by software engineers, those are completely over. And the idea that every one of our software engineers would essentially have companion digital engineers working with them 24/7, that's the future. 
</p>
<p>
"The way I look at Nvidia, we have 32,000 employees. Those 32,000 employees are surrounded by hopefully 100x more digital engineers."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, Eurogamer took a deep dive into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">how AI is changing video game development forever</a>, with various companies now dabbling in its usage for artwork and coding, and even scriptwriting and voice acting - to a decidedly mixed response. Regardless, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">AI is already used by 62 percent of game development studios</a>, a Unity report has claimed, with animation its top usage case.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/17/space-marine-2s-eternal-war-is-a-multiplayer-throwback-we-need-more-of/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’</a>s Eternal War was always going to be a little out of place compared to the game’s stellar campaign and online co-op Operations. One of the major ways the game has evolved since THQ’s 2011 original is the emphasis on dynamic melee combat that rewards well-timed parries and dodges, all while gunning down waves of swarming enemies, but Eternal War is a mode with its heavily armoured foot stuck in the past.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Extended Multiplayer Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moaWKtTq1zc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Eternal War isn’t a score chase to see who can kill the most Tyranids: it’s a small spread of PvP modes that put two teams of six players in direct opposition, the God Emperor’s elite warriors going up against their Chaos-tainted brethren. Space Marine 2 offers a trio of game modes including Annihilation, Seize Ground, and Capture &amp; Control. In Call of Duty speak, that’s Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint.</p>
<p>If you’ve spent hours Chainswording your way through Tyranids, Space Marine 2’s PvP gameplay will give you a bit of a shock. Despite being clad in Ceramite Power Armour, Space Marines are surprisingly squishy when caught in the crosshairs of their fellow superhuman soldiers and in those first few matches you’ll no doubt find yourself obliterated within seconds of entering a firefight. The TTK (time to kill) will feel jarring at first, though the more time you spend in Space Marine 2’s competitive multiplayer, the more it makes sense. It forces strategic play through cunning ambushes and tactical retreats, preventing teams from locking down areas of a map for too long.</p>


<p>Much like Operations mode, Eternal War offers six playable classes. Each has their own unique ability, weapon loadout, and armour stats with bulkier, less mobile Space Marine archetypes being tougher to kill. The abilities attached to each class aren’t quite as powerful or disruptive as ultimates are in Overwatch, but they can help turn the tables if used effectively while also giving each class their own distinct flavour. For example, the shield-wielding Bulwark can jab a Chapter Banner in the ground that restores the armour of nearby comrades, while the Assault class can unleash hell from above using their Jump Packs.</p>
<p>As you play Eternal War, you’ll level up and unlock new weapons, giving you more ways to play though – for the sake of balance – these don’t have a natural upper hand on the starter guns available. Additional customisation and appearance options are also unlocked over time, with some pretty gnarly armour sets up for grabs as well as an extensive palette of Chapter colour schemes.</p>

<p>Space Marine 2’s PvP completes a pretty stellar all-round package that, while not as flashy as the other modes, has kept us coming back match after match. There’s a tempo and simplicity, akin to multiplayer experiences like the original Gears of War and Halo, that meshes well with Eternal War’s class-based antics. However, a sparse handful of maps and cookie cutter game modes won’t be enough to keep players fixated for long – it’s a good thing that a batch of free Eternal War content is planned for season 3 in early 2025…</p>

            <p>Capcom has released a chunky update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-guides-tips-tricks-9422">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, which adds a number of features, including a new casual mode.</p>
<p>This casual mode has reduced inn fees and also cut the cost of Ferrystones, while players will now expend less stamina when dashing outside of battle. Also, a notable boon: when playing in casual mode, Pawns will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2s-dragonsplague-pawn-affliction-can-wipe-out-an-entire-town">recover from the dreaded Dragonsplague</a> without <em>that </em>devastating calamity occurring. This is even if a Pawn's symptoms progress to a terminal stage, Capcom said.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition to the casual mode, Capcom has also added a number of adjustments to Dragon's Dogma 2's Vocations. For example, Capcom has increased Strength for all Fighter weapons and has reduced weight of the Archer items such as Explosive Arrow, Drenching Arrow, Tarring Arrow, and Blighting Arrow.</p>
<p>There are also a large number of fixes across the board for the player, NPCs, Pawns, enemies, quests, equipment and more. Now, players should no longer notice their leg armour stretching "unnaturally" (which I can't say ever happened to me, but kind of curious now).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Capcom noted this patch makes further fixes to issues around CPU overload in certain situations. This means frame rates in areas with a lot of NPCs bustling about, such as town centres, should be improved.</p>
<p>This Dragon's Dogma 2 update is available now across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam. You can check out the <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/topics/update/">full patch notes via Capcom here</a>.</p>

<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 has been a hit for Capcom, with the game selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-sells-25m-as-fixed-frame-rate-arrives">2.5m copies in under two weeks after its release</a>. Back in April, the company actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-success-boosts-capcoms-expected-profits">revised its full-year earnings forecast</a> following this success, combined with the success of its other popular releases over the last year.</p>
<p>The game is "a huge improvement over the original, and a captivating journey from beginning to end," reads Eurogamer's five star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-review">Dragon's Dogma 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is one of the already announced games set to receive a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-listed">PS5 Pro Enhanced patch upgrade</a>, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PlayStation 5 Pro makes its debut this November</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>EA has confirmed that the next Battlefield will be returning to a modern day setting, returning to the still popular themes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/10/31/battlefield-3-multiplayer-console-review/">Battlefield 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/11/04/battlefield-4-review/">Battlefield 4</a> after games that explored <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/17/battlefield-1-review/">WWI</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/13/battlefield-v-review/">WWII</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/15/battlefield-2042-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-ps4-pc/">the near future</a>. They’ve also released the first concept art for this game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">Speaking to IGN</a>, Head of Respawn &amp; Group GM for EA Studios Organization Vince Zampella said, “If you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it’s that Battlefield 3… Battlefield 4 era where everything was modern. And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we’ll see where it goes from there.”</p>



<p>Battlefield 2042 had some ambitious goals to push the series forward in a number of ways. The game at launch featured huge maps aiming to cater to a new 128 player maximum game size, as well as distinct characters as a hero shooter spin on the series’ traditional class system.</p>
<p>Zampella said, “128 player, did it make it more fun? Like…doing the number for the sake of the number doesn’t make any sense. We’re testing everything around what’s the most fun. So like you said, the maps, once they get to a certain scale, become different. It’s a different play space, and I think you have to design around that. So we are designing something that is more akin to previous Battlefields.”</p>

<p>Both 128 players and characters proved to be major sticking points for fans, with the map sizes leading to even more unfocused battles, and over the course of numerous game updates, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/19/battlefield-2042-update-4-1-ditches-128-player-breakthrough-patch-notes-server-maintenance/">DICE rolled things back to supporting 64 players on map</a> and restoring a class system more in keeping with previous games. Of course, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/23/battlefield-2042-patch-notes-hovercraft-nerf-debuff-rebalance/">they also had to deal with myriad other problems and deficiencies</a>, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/08/battlefield-2042-update-3-3-scoreboard-patch-notes-voip-in-april/">not featuring a classic score board at launch</a>.</p>
<p>With DICE having already rolled these elements back in BF2042, it makes sense that the next Battlefield has these core principles being baked in from the off.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors for Zampella is getting the fans on side again, “We have to have the core,” he says. “The core Battlefield players know what they want. They’ve been with us forever, they’ve been amazing supporters. We need to earn their trust back and get them back on our side. And then it’s expanding out and getting more players into the universe and seeing what we can do, so when you want a different experience, you don’t have to leave Battlefield. You can experience more things within the Battlefield universe. So we’re expanding the offerings that we’re giving.”</p>
<p>EA are putting a huge amount of resources behind this,&nbsp;with four studios involved – DICE, Motive, Ripple Effect, and Criterion – and EA CEO Andrew Wilson claiming it’s one of the “most ambitious projects in [EA’s] history.”</p>
<p>Sounds like Battlefield: Bad Company 3 is going to be great, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>I can dream…</p>
<p>Looking back at the launch of BF 2042, I said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/15/battlefield-2042-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-ps4-pc/">our review</a>, “There’s a good game to be found within the Battlefield 2042 and fun to be had as the spectacle of Battlefield’s signature gameplay is taken to new, more expansive heights, but it’s marred by a handful of unsuccessful gameplay design changes, hurriedly implemented features and bugs at launch.”</p>
