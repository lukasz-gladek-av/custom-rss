            <p>
It is inevitable that when a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> rocks up, is really good, and makes a gazillion dollars, that there will be the odd imitator here and there. Sincerity, flattery, yada, yada, yada, point is, it's all fine as long as you at least put enough of a twist in there to make it more of an "influenced by" over a "wholesale ripoff" kind of thing. I think Gambonanza, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilding chess game, fits into the former quite nicely.
</p>
<p>
Now, I'm not going to explain chess to you, you already know how that works. How Gambonanza works is that instead of the usual 8x8 grid, it has a much smaller 5x5 one. When you start a run, you have just three lowly pawns to work with. Your goal is to capture all of the enemy pieces, which are randomised per run, and if a pawn manages to reach the other end of the board it gets a promotion, i.e. you can turn it into a rook, knight, queen or other pieces. But the Balatro of it all are perks you can acquire called Gambits.
</p>
<p>
These are essentially the equivalent of Balatro's Joker cards, modifiers that can aid you in your quest to chess. For example, one Gambit allows you to skip your opponent's turn if you manage to capture an opposing piece with a pawn. Another Gambit earns you a king piece upon earning a promotion, which, as a point, you can also have a team full of kings, if you can get that many - as long as you have no more than three per round.
</p>
<p>
Beating a round earns you money, money lets you buy gambits or more pieces, you can continue to see the Balatro comparison in its meta strategic elements, but ultimately you're still playing Chess. Well, chess where there are boss battles, and pieces that have extraneous effects like tiles disappearing when your opponent captures one of your pieces, so not exactly chess, but you get what I mean.
</p><p>
It's all quite neat and satisfying, there isn't the overwhelming sensation of stress that comes from playing actual chess, the Gambits feel useful, and you can only have five of them so no overpowered runs for you. It's chess Balatro! And there's nothing wrong with that. If you'd like to have a go yourself, then you can head to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3509230/Gambonanza/">Steam page</a> to try out its current playtest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, and Capcom is letting players know what they can expect if they have Sony’s best PlayStation console.</p>



<p>In a post on the Japanese PlayStation Blog, game director Akishi Nakanishi discussed how Resident Evil Requiem will play on the PlayStation 5 Pro (PS5 Pro).</p>







<h2 id="h-ps5-pro-gets-an-optimized-experience">PS5 Pro Gets An Optimized Experience</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2026/01/27/20260127-requiem-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nakanishi revealed that</a> PS5 Pro users will be able to turn ray tracing on and off. With ray tracing turned on, players will be able to play Resident Evil Requiem at 4K resolution at 60 frames per second (FPS). </p>



<p>Should you be on a monitor that supports higher frames, you’ll be able to take advantage of rates up to 120 FPS. Nakanishi said that there will be an average of 90 FPS on the system.</p>







<h2>What Is Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline game in the long running horror franchise. The new game follows FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she’s tasked with investigating a number of strange deaths at the Wrenwood Hotel in Racoon City. It’s the same location where her mother, Alyssa Ashcroft, was killed eight years prior. </p>



<p>It also seems the return of Leon Kennedy who has to look into incidents that have been linked to scientist Victor Gideon. The game’s events are set roughly 30 years after Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.</p>



<p>The game releases on February 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>

            <guid>1416859</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Once-ubiquitous online game streamer Herschel “Dr Disrespect” Beahm, who was banned from Twitch after <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-sexting-minor-response-1851559888">sending “inappropriate” messages to a minor in 2017</a>, posted a photo of a media badge on January 26 and said he had been invited to a pre-release hands-on event for the newly released, free-to-play raid shooter <em>Highguard</em>. However, multiple people who attended the event denied seeing him there, and some Reddit users believe his photo was faked with gen AI or Photoshop. And <em>Highguard’s</em> creator manager says he wasn’t invited and didn’t attend.</p> <p>On Monday, ahead of the launch of <em>Highguard</em>, DrDisrespect posted an image of a keyboard, a can of energy drink, a personalized controller, and a <em>Highguard</em> media badge with his name on it to his X account. He claimed to have played <em>Highguard</em> at a recent media event in Los Angeles. “Last week we took the Lambo to LA to check out #Highguard,” he wrote. “Monday, January 26th at 10am PST, we enter another dimension! Yayayaya.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last week we took the Lambo to LA to check out <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Highguard?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Highguard</a>.</p> <p>Monday, January 26th at 10am PST, we enter another dimension!</p> <p>Yayayaya <a href="https://t.co/kQ56GEfonB">pic.twitter.com/kQ56GEfonB</a></p> <p>— Dr Disrespect (@DrDisrespect) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015156898040049967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Immediately, people online began sharing the post and claiming the PR team behind <em>Highguard</em> had made a huge mistake inviting someone like DrDisrespect to the event. The streamer was suddenly banned from <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854">Twitch in June 2020</a> and then later lost sponsorships and other business deals after confirming he’d once sent messages that were “inappropriate” but not “illegal” to someone else on the platform who was under the age of 18. He now streams exclusively on Rumble and YouTube, which allowed his channel to be monetized again after <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083">a multi-month review of the allegations</a>.</p> <p>“Choosing to work with a self-admitted pedophile to market your game is certainly…A choice,” <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/2015836937865634276">posted a game dev and writer.</a>&nbsp; “Never heard of <em>Highguard</em>. Is it good marketing to have the first news about your game that some people hear be that you invited a pedophile to your preview event?”<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3mddtienlps2x/quotes"> posted someone else on BlueSky.</a></p>

 <p>But, not long after the post started going viral online, creators came out to deny that DrDisrespect was ever at the event, claiming he was lying about being invited.</p>   <p>“Dr. Disrespect was not invited to the early access event,” <a href="https://x.com/TheMacroShow/status/2015875906271904060?s=20">posted creator Macro on Twitter</a>. “I know this because I WAS THERE, and I promise you, everyone would’ve noticed that pedo a mile away. There’s so many valid things you can criticize <em>Highguard</em> for, but this isn’t one of them.” Kate Sánchez, the EIC of<em> ButWhyTho</em>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3mddwfcpcf22h">also denied he was there, adding</a>: “I literally did not see him there – unless creators had a different day.” Another content creator, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blessingjr.bsky.social/post/3mddxvxapqs2q"><em>Kinda Funny</em>‘s Blessing Adeoye Jr</a>., also believed DrDisrespect was not at the LA event, but said there was a second day for creators only. Sánchez and Adeoye Jr. didn’t attend the creator day.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinpua?originalSubdomain=ca"><em>Highguard</em> creator manager Chin Pua</a> replied to a viral tweet about DrDisrespect and <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060">confirmed that he</a> “was not invited to any <em>Highguard</em> event past or present, and the badge was not an official badge.”&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to <em>Highguard</em> PR but has yet to hear back.&nbsp; A freelancer <em>Kotaku</em> sent to the event didn’t see DrDisrespect at the press day either.</p> <p>Over on the <em>Highguard</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1qnd1vl/is_dr_disrespects_badge_fake/">some players are theorizing that DrDisrespect faked the image</a> using AI tools or Photoshop. The evidence involves how the media badge looks compared to other real, confirmed badges from the event. It does seem like, if he were there, he was given a somewhat unusual badge with a different layout than other attendees. If DrDisrespect didn’t attend, he has yet to publicly confirm that on social media or elsewhere. He also streamed the game on <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015815750825730082">Rumble and YouTube</a> on launch day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The internet’s social corners are ablaze following a recent claim from Dr Disrespect that he was invited to play Highguard alongside Wildlight Entertainment in Los Angeles. The ‘Two Time’ posted an image on social media of an ID card from the recent event and directly stated he’d taken ‘the Lambo to LA’ to play Highguard.</p>



<p>Even though it took literal seconds to figure out Dr Disrespect’s image was a fake, likely manufactured by the same folks who make his streamer art, some have <strong>boycotted Highguard </strong>because of this impossible collaboration.</p>







<h2 id="h-dr-disrespect-fakes-highguard-invite">Dr Disrespect Fakes Highguard Invite</h2>



<p>On January 24, Dr Disrespect posted an image on social media of his desk, some streaming and gaming equipment, and an ID card that marked him as an attendee to the recent Highguard event in Los Angeles. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was a staging ground for Wildlight to showcase the all-new shooter in full to a wide audience of streamers, creators, pro gamers, and influencers, and some folks believed that Dr Disrespect also went.</p>



<p>When the image cropped up on social media, it took some who <strong>were </strong>in attendance mere seconds to debunk the image, simply by showing their own, legitimate passes, and pointing out the inaccuracies. But that wasn’t enough for the detritus of those social circles that avoid using logic and reasoning to solve something cryptic.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many took to those same social circles to slam Wildlight for associating with a creator with Dr Disrespect’s reputation. Anyone even remotely interested in the creator space knows about the recent controversies that the scandalous streamer found himself embroiled in over the last couple of years.</p>



<p>Now, the Creator Manager for Highguard at Wildlight Entertainment, Chin, has <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a definitive comment</a> on social media, further debunking the image:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey there! I’m Chin, the Creator Manager for Highguard / Wildlight and I can confirm DDR was not invited to any Highguard event past or present, and the badge was not an official badge.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, no, Dr Disrespect did not jet off to Los Angeles to play Highguard with everyone else. He is <strong>streaming </strong>the game as this article is being written, but that’s the closest to it he’ll ever be.</p>

<p>You can’t have a new live-service game without a Battle Pass, and Highguard doesn’t advertise a properly labeled Battle Pass, to an extent. This guide covers how to get a free War Chest and how it relates to Highguard. </p>



<p>Everyone gets the ick at the mention of a Battle Pass due to the negative connotations. However, if something is free to play, it’s going to have a Battle Pass, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-file-sizes-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> complicates things with its War Chest system.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-highguard-have-a-battle-pass">Does Highguard Have A Battle Pass?</h2>

<p><strong>Highguard has a fully fledged Battle Pass system under the guise of a War Chest.</strong></p>



<p>Same thing, different name. A War Chest is the name for the game’s Battle System. It has the Pages system that Fortnite and others have adopted in recent years, allowing you to have more freedom in how you accumulate Highguard rewards.</p>



<p>Each reward requires so much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-currencies-how-many-are-there-how-to-earn-how-they-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard currency</a>, and they include the usual slew of live-service cosmetics: Skins, weapons makeovers, customizable player profile items, and more. Subsequent War Chests will presumably require real money or acquired in-game currency, but not the first one.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-free-war-chest-in-highguard">How To Claim Free War Chest In Highguard</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Generous. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to go into the Highguard Store, click on War Chest, and claim your free Battle Pass.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick step-by-step guide on what to do:</p>



<ol>
<li>Load up Highuard.</li>



<li>Go to the main menu.</li>



<li>Make sure you’re on the tabs at the top.</li>



<li>Cycle across to <strong>Store</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>Inspect War Chest</strong> in the corner.</li>



<li>Claim the War Chest.</li>



<li>You now have a free Battle Pass for Highguard Episode 1.</li>
</ol>



<p>The first War Chest has a total of 44 items to claim. Goodies vary in terms of rarity, and they’re spread across ‘4 Chapters.’ You need to play matches and rack up a serious amount of Vigil Tokens—which are used in exchange for the rewards found in the War Chest.</p>



<p>It’s expected that future War Chests will follow a similar format, unless there’s stern opposition from the Highguard community.</p>



<p>Will you endeavour to complete the first-ever Highguard War Chest, AKA Battle Pass? Or do you think the rewards are a complete waste of time and not worth the effort?

<p>The marketing train is in full swing for WWE 2K26. Not only have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-king-of-kings-edition-cover-features-triple-h/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various editions</a> of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game been revealed</a> in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-reveals-monday-night-war-edition-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent days</a>, but it’s now known when the game will release as well as some of the platforms.</p>



<p>According to known <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/wwe-2k26-switch-2-plateformes-date-de-sortie-ce-que-lon-sait-60917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Billbil-kun</a>, WWE 2K26 will launch on Friday, March 13.

<h2 id="h-last-gen-and-pc-status-remain-unknown">Last Gen and PC Status Remain Unknown</h2>



<p>There was no confirmation regarding the game’s availability on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. There was also no mention of WWE 2K26 on PC in Billbil-kun’s report.</p>



<p>Last year’s was available on the platform, but it was treated as a last-gen version of the game, meaning it didn’t include The Island. Also like</p>



<p>As far as what to expect from this year’s game, Insider Gaming was the first outlet to exclusively report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CM Punk will be the feature superstar</a> for the game’s Showcase Mode.

		<p>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered, or DW3CER as no one is calling it, was set to be released on March 19th 2026, but that is no longer the case.</p>
<p>A message from producer Tomohiko Sho reads as follows:</p>


<p><em>“The release of Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered has been postponed from the previously announced March 19th, 2026.&nbsp; As the first remaster of the Dynasty Warriors series,&nbsp; in order to satisfy our fans, we have made the decision to further improve the quality of the game. The new release date will be announced at a later date. We appreciate your patience as we take a little more time before the game releases”&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered looks to retain the gameplay of the original game, but has been completely remade using Unreal Engine 5. The team has also reconsidered some of the gameplay and UI elements to refine the experience.</p>

<p>The remake includes the original game plus the Xtreme Legends expansion which includes more scenarios, officers such as Lu Bu, Meng Huo and Yuan Shao, four challenge modes and more weapons. That will boost the roster to over 40 officers who will be battling thousands of enemies all at once.&nbsp; Dynasty Warriors 3 was the first game in the series to feature mechanics that would become a mainstay for the series, such as True Musou Attacks, two-player simultaneous play, and the officer development system.</p>
<p>When it does eventually get released the game will be launching on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-currencies-how-many-are-there-how-to-earn-how-they-work/</link>
            <guid>1416802</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a common trend in multiplayer games to have numerous currencies, and Highguard appears to be no different. As soon as you load into the game, you’ll see a selection of small symbols at the top right of your screen, indicating how much of each currency you own. </p>



<p>The thing is, when you’re loading into a new game like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> for the first time, the whole experience can be overwhelming, and the last thing you want to figure out is which currencies can be spent where, let alone how to earn them!</p>







<p>Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has you covered, as in this guide, you’ll find out everything you need to know about Highguard’s various currencies. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-currencies-are-in-highguard">How Many Currencies Are In Highguard?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There are already plenty of bundles in the store. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are three currencies in Highguard, and each one has its own unique purpose. </strong></p>



<p>The currencies in question are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Highguard Gold</li>



<li>Warden Credits</li>



<li>Vigil Tokens</li>
</ul>



<p>As is often the case, these currencies have their own rules: each one can only be spent in certain ways, they cannot be interchanged between one another, and they’re all earned in their own unique way. </p>



<p>But don’t worry, there’s no need for confusion, as Insider Gaming have broken down each currency for your convenience.</p>



<h2 id="h-highguard-gold-explained">Highguard Gold, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The bundles don’t come cheap. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard Gold is the premium currency of Highguard. It is used to purchase War Chests and Store Cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>The main way to earn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-launch-day-content-maps-content-weapons-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> Gold is through direct in-game microtransactions, with the prices shown above in GBP. As things stand, there are no other ways to earn the currency.</p>



<p>It’d be great to see it available through other means in the future, either via War Chests or perhaps even Ranked rewards, as plenty of other live-service games offer their premium currency as in-game rewards. Until then, though, if you see something you fancy in the store, you’re going to need to pull out the wallet.</p>



<h2 id="h-warden-credits-explained">Warden Credits, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Some simple cosmetics are on offer. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Warden Credits are used to purchase cosmetics from the Trading Post, an in-game store that rotates its stock weekly.</strong></p>



<p>The Trading Post is similar to the Store, except it offers a smaller variety of cosmetics that can be earned without the need for microtransactions. That’s because Warden Credits can be earned in-game, either by completing challenges or simply playing games.</p>







<p>However, if you’re managing to accrue a lot of them, be warned, as Warden Credits are capped at 10,000. Once you hit this upper limit, you’ll stop storing them in the bank, so be sure to spend them!</p>



<h2 id="h-vigil-tokens-explained">Vigil Tokens, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Similar to a battle pass. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Finally, there’s Vigil Tokens. These are used to purchase items in War Chests, which are packed with various cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>The primary way to earn these Vigil Tokens is simply by playing matches. The more you play, the more you’ll earn, so it’s a great incentive to reward regular players with some high-tier cosmetic items.</p>



<p>Similar to the Warden Credits, though, there’s an upper limit to how many you can hold onto. 3,000 is the maximum amount of Vigil Tokens you can have at one time, so once again, be sure to spend them when you get them!</p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

And there’s at least one of the vinyl figures made of every single character in the history of pop culture. And while some find these facts annoying, there’s something to be said about a great-looking Funko Pop based on something you personally like. The latest Funkos to go up for preorder are based on Pokémon, and there are some bangers in here: an angry, electricity-summoning Pikachu, an angry, vine-summoning Venusaur, and more. Take a look and see if you want to <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wB4Zp?object_uuid=e4307149-1afe-4077-8d0a-39deb7f32979&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder any from Amazon</a> ahead of release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémeon Funko Pops Up for Preorder</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The two centerpieces of this new batch of Pokémon Funkos are the aforementioned Pikachu and Venusaur. Both are Funko Pop! Premium figures, meaning they’re 4.5 inches tall, rather than the 3.75 inch height of standard Funko Pop figures. They’re also in more dramatic stances, as if sculpted in mid-attack. They look pretty great, even for a seasoned commerce editor like me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the upcoming Pokémon Funkos are standard Funko Pops. We have Ivysaur, Zoroark, Electabuzz, Magmar, and the adorable Goomy. Some people don’t like the Funko style, with its <a href="https://youtu.be/u9S41Kplsbs?si=a7KxzDJOBQQWYl9Y&amp;t=86" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll’s eyes</a>, but I think it works perfectly with Pokemon. There’s just less stylization going on between the real thing (as depicted in the games) and the vinyl figures. They’re also made in eye-catching bright colors, so they look great wherever you decide to display them.</p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qd8lY5?object_uuid=e4307149-1afe-4077-8d0a-39deb7f32979&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If Pokémon isn’t your speed, you can likely find another upcoming Funko Pop that appeals to you more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Earlier this month, Wildlight Entertainment invited a whole host of media and content creators to take a hands-on look at <em>Highguard</em>–a 3v3 “raid shooter” whose big reveal was the closer to last month’s Game Awards. Reaction to that trailer was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088"><span>decidedly mixed</span></a><span>. This article isn’t about my thoughts on the game itself, which <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">you can find here</a>, but rather what it felt like to attend an event for a game which was already being treated by some online as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475"><span>gaming’s next </span><i><span>Concord</span></i></a><span>. What’s it like to be one of the first people outside of the studio to play something that so many had already written off despite not really knowing what it was even trying to be?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137"><span>The </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i></a><span> Launch Event, as my lanyard calls it, was an all-day affair held in Los Angeles that was scheduled to run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Making the trek from Long Beach, I boarded my Lyft (paid for by Wildlight) at about 7:45 in the morning, and despite my best efforts at being punctual, didn’t arrive at the venue until about 9:15. Being stuck in a sea of cars on the I-110 gave me a lot of time to think about what the day ahead had in store.</span></p>

 <p><span>While players experiencing the game for the first time today will have an entirely different experience, myself and the other folks who experienced the game that day only had the TGAs trailer to base our expectations on, and it hardly told us anything about the game at all. None of us knew what a “PvP raid shooter” was, nor did we know anything about the moment-to-moment gameplay beyond a short description on the Steam store page: “From the creators of</span><i><span> Apex Legends</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Titanfall</span></i><span>&nbsp;comes </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.”&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>9:16 AM – January 21 – NYA West, A Hazy Recollection, And Coffee #2 (and #3)</h2> <p><span>The first thing I noticed upon arriving was a faint feeling of deja vu. I’d been to this venue before, I thought. It took me a few moments to realize that I’d been in this same part of town for EA’s own preview event for </span><i><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></i><span> back in 2023; I wondered if the members of Wildlight in charge of picking the place had still been at Respawn back then. After checking in at reception, I walked into a lobby filled with fellow members of the press from all over the world. I grabbed my second coffee of the day, some yogurt, and an apple Danish from an assortment laid out in front of me; besides the coffee I’d grabbed earlier that morning I hadn’t yet had any breakfast, and the longer-than-expected commute had me starving.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663168"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663168">Kotaku / James Galizio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Conversing with other members of the press, I confirmed what I’d already assumed; none of us quite knew what we were about to play. Despite this, there was a quiet hope that perhaps the trailer was a misstep, and that the game itself might impress. I spoke with </span><i><span>GameSpot</span></i><span>‘s Jordan Ramée and another L.A. native freelancer friend of mine, Luis Joshua Gutierrez, among a few others, as I scarfed down my food and coffee.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Out of the corner of my eye I noticed Geoff Keighley. The Game Awards host was the only person outside of the development team who might be able to answer our questions as to what exactly </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> is, as he’d played it the previous summer before asking the team to let him put it in his December showcase. Had he selected a surprise hit, or attached his brand to another live-service dud?. I downed Coffee #3.</span></p> <h2>9:52 AM – So, What On Earth Is A “PvP Raid Shooter,” Anyway?</h2> <p><span>The event running slightly ahead of schedule, we were shepherded into an auditorium. Once everyone had been seated, we got the whole spiel–who Wildlight are, how <em>Highguard</em> came to be, and what being a “raid shooter” actually entails. Roughly 4 years ago, when Wildlight was only about 5 members big, the team spent some time playing shooters all day in search of inspiration. As the team put it, “we were trying to figure out what the question was that we wanted our game to answer.” Inspiration itself came from the experience of riding to and raiding bases in </span><i><span>Rust</span></i><span>; the team wanted to figure out a way to distill those experiences into something repeatable, without all the busy prep work that survival crafting games require.</span></p>

 <p><span>Of course, everyone wanted to know why the team had opted for radio silence since the game’s reveal; the answer to that was twofold. We were given one half of the answer there and then, with the other coming just a bit later in the day. Originally the team had intended to shadowdrop the game, much as they had done with </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span> when they had still worked at Respawn. As it so happened, the Game Awards trailer only came to fruition at the eleventh hour after Geoff Keighley had offered up the spot upon being impressed by the game during his personal demo earlier in the year.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663167" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663167"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663167">Kotaku / James Galizio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In hindsight, given how complicated the game’s systems are to explain and the TGAs’ strict runtime, it’s little surprise the trailer struggled to land. The radio silence, then, was equal parts a return to the original plan as well as an acknowledgement that the game would perhaps best speak for itself. Still, rather than being tossed in entirely blind and letting the game make its own impression, press and influencers had to watch a thorough overview of the shooter’s mechanics and systems before getting our hands on the controllers and keyboards laid out for us.</span></p> <p><span>Entering the auditorium, I saw the venue was split in two halves. On the right were groups of PCs, 6 a piece, paired with some very expensive Dell 4K OLED monitors. While by default players could play with mechanical keyboard and gaming mouse, Wildlight quickly noted that anyone who wished to play with a controller could request either a PlayStation 5 Dualsense or an Xbox Wireless Controller, and they would bring one right over. On the opposite wall was a collection of 3D models of in-game assets, heaps of concept art showcasing the game’s world and its characters, and more.</span></p>

 <h2>11:30 AM – Probing the Vibes</h2> <p><span>With lunch scheduled for noon, I only had time for a handful of matches. </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>‘s Travis Northup had his first interview with the team scheduled early, leaving myself and the other member of our impromptu group–</span><i><span>GameSpot</span></i><span>‘s Jordan Ramée–to wander over to the art that caught our eye. I wondered how the artists that had drawn these felt about the reception to the game’s reveal.</span></p> <p><span>It occurred to me at this point that the event took up a great deal of space, especially when considering the modest number of press in attendance. There were a couple dozen of us, by no means a small amount, yet the venue was so large that it bordered on feeling empty. I wondered if the team had expected or planned for a larger audience when they’d booked the location; there was certainly room for double, maybe even triple the number of attendees. Maybe the crowd during the influencer session, held a day earlier, had been a lot bigger. I grabbed Coffee #4 from a concessions table while waiting for the lunch spread to be set up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663169"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663169">Kotaku / James Galizio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After gorging myself on sandwiches, wraps, an energy bar and at least one more cup of coffee I played a few more rounds of the game before heading off to a set of interviews with some of the game’s core designers, as well as the studio’s cofounders. As the day progressed, it was fascinating watching folks slowly come to grips with some of the intricacies of the gameplay loop. You can read my <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">hands-on impressions here,</a> or decide for yourself now that the full game is live.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>5:12 PM – Winding Down, and Cacio e Pepe Pizza</h2> <p><span>The event was set to go until 6PM, but with the memories of my agonizingly long ride to the event I had no intentions of grabbing my Lyft home right in the middle of L.A.’s notorious rush hour traffic. There were no plans for an afterparty, though we had been given per diem cards to help pay for food and other amenities and a few of us had the same idea<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></span><span>we decided on grabbing some pizza and drinks from a bar close by that came recommended.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While waiting in line to order my first drink, I witnessed what felt like a microcosm for the day’s events as a whole when the bartender tripped up and spilled a drink order for one party. She quickly adjusted, repouring their beers and bringing them over successfully with the second attempt, ultimately no worse for wear. I doubt the two gentlemen who’d ordered them even remember the spilled drinks; I get the feeling that Wildlight is banking on something similar. If </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> can ultimately speak for itself, then will it matter in the end that they messed up with the reveal trailer? No one will remember. Well, except maybe Geoff Keighley.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Scanning through the menu, my eye was drawn to an unorthodox-sounding pizza flavor; Cacio e Pepe, like the pasta dish. Evidently I was the only one at the table that was familiar with the flavor, and we ordered the pie to give it a shot. It was delicious, and I’d only wish it hadn’t been devoured so quickly–I would have loved a slice or two for the ride home. Sometimes it’s good to take a chance on something different.</span></p>

              <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088">The Game Awards 2025 ended with a trailer for <em>Highguard</em></a>, a new FPS from some ex-<em>Titanfall</em> devs, it failed to wow the internet, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-breaks-radio-silence-and-the-internet-reacts-2000662650">the weeks of radio silence that followed</a> only provided a void that was quickly filled by speculation, debate, and skepticism. Now, weeks later, <em>Highguard</em> has finally launched, and everyone has a chance to play it and really figure out what this game is, likely determining if it will be a hit or <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">another short-lived multiplayer flop like <em>Concord</em>.</a> Early impressions are that it’s solid, but many are struggling to even play the game due to server queues, disconnects, and performance issues on console and PC.</p> <p><em>Highguard</em> went live on January 26 across consoles and PC to a large amount of confusion, curiosity, and, sure, some actual hype. The devs did a big deep dive on Monday, revealing that the game is a 3v3 PVP “raid shooter.” This translates into what looks like a game that mixes together <em>Rainbow Six Siege’</em>s base defense mechanics, MOBA-like clashes between teams in the field, gear upgrades, and a final big raid on one of the team’s bases to decide who wins the match.</p>

 <p>From what I’ve seen so far and played, it could be a lot of fun. <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">Our preview of the new FPS is similarly positive about <em>Highguard</em></a>. But the game isn’t running well on my RTX 5070 PC, even at medium settings with DLSS. And I’m not alone in dealing with performance issues and other problems.</p>  <h2><em>Highguard’s </em>PC problems and no FOV slider on PS5</h2> <p>On the game’s subreddit, more than a few players are complaining about <em>Highguard</em> running poorly on their rigs, even those with solid specs. Other players are having issues with the game’s settings not changing despite multiple attempts to do so. Some are also running into a bug where dialogue is missing during the tutorial. On console, <em>Highguard</em> lacks an FOV slider, an issue that led to a lot of angry fans when<em> Borderlands 4</em> was missing the same popular feature on PS5 and Xbox. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-fov-slider-consoles-ps5-update-pc-crashing-patch-performance-2000628823"><em>Borderlands 4</em> eventually added it</a>. I’ll be curious to see if <em>Highguard</em> does, too. Players are also complaining about the game looking blurry on consoles, which might be a quicker fix.</p>

 <p>Another issue that will likely be smoothed out over the next 24 hours is players getting stuck in server queues or getting disconnected while playing. Considering the fact that nearly 98k players all tried to play <em>Highguard</em> on Steam alone, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">according to SteamDB data,</a> I’d bet that the servers are just struggling to keep up with the demand. It’s annoying for gamers, but I can imagine the devs are thankful that so many people want to play <em>Highguard</em> that the servers are struggling to get them all in.</p>

 <p><em>Concord</em> didn’t have such high playercount numbers on Steam. In fact, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/">it failed to crack 1,000 concurrent players</a>. <em>Highguard</em> has been compared many times by online commentators to that live-service flop, which shut down less than a month after its dismal launch. It seems all but certain that <em>Highguard</em> will stick around a bit longer than that. Hopefully some of the technical issues and bugs can be ironed out. The devs have confirmed they have around a year of content in development for <em>Highguard</em>, which will get regular updates like most live-service games.</p> <p>Now that it’s finally out, all the speculation can be replaced with what tends to come next when live-service games launch: People claiming it’s a dead game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Life is a perpetual performance, a ceaseless carousel of masks we rotate through depending on who’s in the room, while the truest version of ourselves only surfaces in the moments no one bothers to watch. Inside the crucible of GKids’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki?ref=aftermath.site"><u>kabuki</u></a><em> </em>drama film <em>Kokuho,</em> the question “Which me am I going to be today?” takes on a sharp edge. When an actor’s goalpost shifts from entertaining crowds to becoming the greatest, that question stops being rhetorical and becomes a matter of artistic survival: creating the perfect mask to spite the performer's true face.</p><p>Adapted from former kabuki stage assistant–turned–novelist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuichi_Yoshida?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Shuichi Yoshida</u></a> and directed with operatic precision by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0498212/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Sang‑il Lee</u></a>, <em>Kokuho </em>traces the rise of Kikuo Tachibana (Ryo Yoshizawa), a lifelong outsider wrestling with imposter syndrome that calcified long before he ever graced the stage. His childhood unfolds like a conveyor belt of catastrophe: a family claimed by the bomb disease in the wake of the atomic blast in Nagasaki; an adoptive father and yakuza patriarch gunned down before his eyes; and a youth spent drifting from household to household, never once feeling rooted in any place to call home.</p><p>Everything shifts when he’s taken in by the legendary kabuki performer Hanjiro Hanai (Ken Watanabe), who, alongside Hanai’s prodigy son Shunseki Ogaki (Ryusei Yokohama), molds the pair into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onnagata?ref=aftermath.site"><u>onnagata</u></a> dual act. Under Hanai’s strict and demanding tutelage, kabuki becomes both a sanctuary and a cut-throat testing ground where Kikuo’s all‑consuming obsession to perfect his art reshapes his life and identity as he chases the impossible dream of becoming a living, breathing national treasure on stage.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p6k9Y-irvOE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="KOKUHO | Trailer 2 - In theatres Feburary 2026"></iframe></figure><p>We meet Kikuo as a blank canvas of a human being who’s hungry, diligent, and terrifyingly receptive to instruction. But the more he absorbs, the more the cracks begin to show. He’s a performer so dedicated to his craft that he often forgets how to act like a human being.&nbsp;</p><p>As an onnagata, Kikuo is molded, bruised, and sculpted into a vessel of beauty so captivating that audiences far and wide pack music halls to see him perform, all while his own self-identity is treated as malleable clay to use or be disregarded. And the film traces his evolution in an operatic sweep from a 1964 child apprentice to an emerging performer in the 70s, to a virtuoso in the 80s, and through all the setbacks trailing into the 2010s. All the while, <em>Kokuho </em>threads the iconic roles Kikup inhabits, from the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renjishi?ref=aftermath.site"><u> Two Lions</u></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_Suicides_at_Sonezaki?ref=aftermath.site"><u>The Love Suicides</u></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shosagoto?ref=aftermath.site"><u>The Heron Maiden</u></a>, not as mere performances, but as a living epochal beat in his life where his art and identity blur into one another.</p><figure><figcaption><span>GKids/Shuichi Yoshida</span></figcaption></figure><p>For Kikuo, the answer to the existential question “Which me am I going to be today?” never needs to be voiced. It's carved into the mirco-expressions he can’t quite suppress—the smirk he swallows when praise is lauded his way at a rival’s expense; the way his body recoils, sweat stippling his brow, as his mentor hurls cutlery to punish a falsetto that isn’t convincingly feminine and heartwrenching enough; the frozen mask he wears long after the curtains fall, as if the performance refuses to release him. Beneath the facade burns an insatiable flame, one that won’t rest until he’s the singular figure audiences and peers look to—a performer who answers the existential question a thousand times over, even if the pursuit consumes him whole, no matter how many bridges he incinerates.&nbsp;</p><p>Kabuki, like football, is a game of inches. A pose held one millimeter out of place, a fan flicked a beat out of step with a shamisen or taiko drum, or a breath that betrays performative strain with one’s own exhaustion become margins where greatness is either forged forever in the history books or lost to time. Or at least, that’s the pressure Kikuo places on himself. And <em>Kokuho </em>revels in showcasing how the kayfabe of performance and one’s own story bleeds into their art. Some sequences blur into a dreamlike mirage, where the boundary between performer and role dissolves. Others are grounded in the grit of rehearsal rooms where humiliation and bruises, both physical and emotional, are as common as a round of applause.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>GKids/Shuichi Yoshida</span></figcaption></figure><p>Where <em>Kokuho </em>sings is in its resounding understanding that an actor, regardless of their latent talent or hard work, is only as great as the stage they perform on. Here, Yoshizawa and Yokohama deliver moving performances, as Kikuo and Shunseki pour their hearts out in whatever venue will have them over the course of their rising and plateauing careers.&nbsp;</p><p>From sold‑out historical theaters where the air hums with reverence, to seedy hotel lounges veiled in cigarette smoke, to luncheon halls where half‑attentive diners treat their art as ambiance, every venue becomes another step toward glory hell‑bent on pitting the two brothers against each other—and with each climb, they deliver a stirring, heartbreaking performance as they struggle not to totally eclipse one another’s hard‑won sliver of limelight.</p><figure><figcaption><span>GKids/Shuichi Yoshida</span></figcaption></figure><p>The film’s just‑shy‑of‑three‑hour runtime is visually decadent, deliciously messy in both its staged and unstaged melodrama, and utterly gripping from first frame to last. What unspools between its opening and closing credits is an exhaustively engrossing tangle of criss‑crossing loyalties—childhood friends, lovers, rivals, found family, and Kikuo himself—woven into a lattice of perceived slights, bruised pride, and emotional wipeouts that would leave the Corleones spinning. Each of the film’s time jumps lands like a small act of violence, flinging viewers four, six, sometimes eight years ahead, slow‑cooking resentment until it curdles into tragedy, only for the film to lift the lid, let the steam hiss out, and bring everything back to a boil. And yet, watching Kikuo’s bishōnen body dragged across the proverbial glass of this saga never feels overlong even when you’re certain the peak of his tragedy has already passed, only to discover there’s still an hour and change of thread left to pull through the loom. The hanging question mutates from “Who am I going to be today?” to “Who are people insisting I am?” as Kikuo’s willingness to answer both—clawing his way up every rung, no matter who he has to shoulder‑check aside—turns feral in the most riveting way imaginable.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Kokuho </em>stands as an utterly gorgeous, resplendent, emotionally thunderous epic about the cost of perfecting one’s art, the brutality baked into tradition, and the impossible contortion act of performing both loyalty and selfhood at once. And in its final stretch, all that pent‑up passion avalanches forward as it barrels toward its climax, erupting in a full‑body reckoning that is nothing short of soul‑rattling.</p><p><strong>Correction 1/26/26, 3:35: </strong>The review has been updated to the correct spelling of the protagonist's name. We regret the error.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Highguard</strong> was the surprise 'one more thing' game shown at the end of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">The Game Awards 2025</a></strong>, a new free-to-play, PvP 'raid shooter' from <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong>, a studio made up of former <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/titanfall/">Titanfall 2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a></strong> developers, all joining together to launch their own first-person shooter.</p>



<p>Today, the new shooter went live across PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5, following a 25-minute gameplay and launch showcase, with founder, studio head, and game director <strong>Chad Grenier</strong> and design and creative director <strong>Jason McCord</strong> taking players through the ins and outs of Highguard, and what exactly the studio means when it calls the game a 'raid shooter.'</p>



<p>The basics of Highguard are that it is a 3v3 first-person shooter, where two teams of three start on either end of one of the five available maps at launch, each in one of six base types. The objective of the game is to acquire a big magical sword called the <strong>Shieldbreaker</strong>, to break down the shield protecting the enemy base. Once the shield is down, you then have to work your way through the enemy base and destroy three generators to destroy the entire base and win the match.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Highguard | Official Launch Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0qR9Xbzt5t0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You play as a Warden, one of eight magical characters, each with their own unique abilities that shake up combat in various ways, equipping yourself with one of ten weapons on top of one of three stronger, limited-use Raid weapons. Being a Warden also leads to one of Highguard's other wrinkles, the fact that you travel across the map not on foot, but on one of three mounts, which are a horse, a panther, and a bear.</p>



<p>Essentially, Highguard is a whole mish-mash of game types, distilled into something new with its own twists. Capturing and keeping control of the Shieldbreaker is a bit of Capture the Flag, while the larger-scale maps and boxes of loot that can be found across them, each packed with better weapons and armour, feel like it pulls from popular battle royale titles, namely Apex Legends in this case. And because you're planting bombs that can be defused by enemy players if you're not careful, the attacking and defending of bases is like adding a touch of Search and Destroy.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Highguard-Launch-Content-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Wildlight Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Highguard's placement as the final game revealed at The Game Awards 2025 meant that there was a lot of discussion around the game, namely around whether it was the right choice of title to end the show. But also because players weren't entirely clear on what kind of game Highguard is trying to be.</p>



<p>We'll have a better understanding of how players are reacting to Highguard as the week goes on, now that the game is live. On Steam, it got off to a fairly strong start, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">reaching <strong>97K</strong> <strong>concurrent players</strong> in just its first hour on Steam alone</a>.</p>



<p>Regarding what's next, Wildlight has a roadmap for the whole of 2026 already planned out, with more Wardens, bases, weapons, maps, mounts, and more set to arrive as soon as next month. </p>

<p>Highguard is finally here, and after a long month of waiting and speculating, we finally know what the game is about. Not only do we know how the game plays, but we also know what it’s launching with, and it’s a whole lot of content. </p>



<p>For live-service games like Highguard intends to be, it’s important to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep content pouring in</a>. However, if there isn’t enough to start with, then players won’t have anything to get hooked to.</p>







<p>It doesn’t seem like Highguard will have that issue, as there’s a wealth of content to explore at launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-wardens-amp-mounts-available-for-highguard-launch">All Wardens &amp; Mounts Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who is your pick? Image by Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are eight Wardens to choose from, each with their own abilities and skills, as well as three different Mounts. More are scheduled to come with future content updates.</strong></p>



<p>It looks like there’s a nice variety of Wardens to choose from in Highguard, with five playstyles seemingly catered for with their classes. There are three Assault and two Defensive Wardens, making them the most common class at launch.</p>



<p>The eight Wardens available at launch in Highguard are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Warden Name</th><th data-align="center">Warden Class</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Redmane</td><td data-align="center">Destruction</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Condor</td><td data-align="center">Recon</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Atticus</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kai</td><td data-align="center">Defensive</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mara </td><td data-align="center">Support</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Una </td><td data-align="center">Defensive</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Scarlet</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Slade</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The three Mounts available at launch in Highguard are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Horse</li>



<li>Panther</li>



<li>Bear</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-maps-amp-bases-available-for-highguard-launch">All Maps &amp; Bases Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Explore before the sword falls. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five maps to play at launch for Highguard, with a roster of six Bases to select from each match.</strong></p>



<p>Wildlight Entertainment describe the Maps and Bases very distinctly. The Maps are more open-world environments full of loot and gear to collect, whilst the Bases are smaller, typical FPS-style areas that offer more close-quarters combat. It looks set to offer diverse gameplay scenarios, and it’s notably different from other titles in the genre.</p>







<p>Here’s all five Maps available at launch in Highguard: </p>



<ul>
<li>Dustline</li>



<li>Kingdom</li>



<li>Rivermark</li>



<li>Summit</li>



<li>Vesper City</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-weapons-available-for-highguard-launch">All Weapons Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A solid selection. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ten Primary Weapons are available at launch in Highguard, with three Raid Weapons up for selection too—and don’t forget your Melee Axe!</strong></p>



<p>That makes a total of 14 weapons in Highguard, with plenty more bound to arrive across the year. It’s a simple but healthy selection that should hopefully see balancing not become an issue so early in the game’s lifecycle. </p>



<p>Here’s all 14 weapons available at launch in Highguard:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Weapon Name</th><th data-align="center">Weapon Type</th><th data-align="center">Weapon Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Corsair</td><td data-align="center">SMG</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kraken</td><td data-align="center">Pump-Action Shotgun</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Paladin</td><td data-align="center">Full-Auto Shotgun</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Viper</td><td data-align="center">SMG</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vanguard</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Big Rig</td><td data-align="center">LMG</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Dynasty</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Saber Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Burst Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Longhorn</td><td data-align="center">Revolver</td><td data-align="center">Marksman</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Ranger</td><td data-align="center">Bolt-Action Sniper</td><td data-align="center">Marksman</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Blast Hammer</td><td data-align="center">Sledgehammer</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Zipline</td><td data-align="center">Utility</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rocket Launcher</td><td data-align="center">Rocket Launcher</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Axe</td><td data-align="center">Axe</td><td data-align="center">Melee</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

			<p><strong>Embark Studios</strong> is already executing on the first part of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-roadmap-january-april-2026-embark-studios/">recently revealed <strong>January to April 2026</strong> roadmap</a> for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a>,</strong> with its first new update for the year, titled <strong>Headwinds</strong>, arriving to all players tomorrow, <strong>January 27, 2026,</strong> introducing a new map condition, a new Trophy Display project, and most importantly, a new <strong>Solos vs. Squads</strong> matchmaking queue option.</p>



<p>Following last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-update-now-live-embark-studios/">Cold Snap update</a>, the Rust Belt has thawed, and the <strong>Buried City</strong> is becoming '<strong>Bird City</strong>,' with plenty of birds flocking to the area and gathering resources in nests on high chimneys, resources that are ripe for the picking if you're able to climb to them. Bird City is the update's new map condition, with Embark warning that you'll want to have a serious look around before going for one of the nests, as you're likely to draw the attention of another Raider, waiting to catch you off guard.</p>



<p>The new matchmaking option, Solos vs. Squads, is a big update for PvP-focused players. If you feel like you could take on a full enemy squad on your own, and you're above <strong>level 40</strong>, then this new matchmaking option will let you really push your limits for a chance at higher XP and loot rewards.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The update also adds a new <strong>Trophy Display</strong> project, where you can build out your trophy case of the different ARC machines you've taken down. Lastly, the update also brings some new cosmetics, introducing the <strong>Sandwalker Set </strong>for users to grab.</p>



<p>Embark's new entry into the extraction shooter genre has <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">sold more than <strong>12 million copies</strong> since it launched last October</a>, and was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">best-selling games on Steam in 2025</a>. It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">currently nominated for several DICE Awards,</a> including Game of the Year. </p>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Fromage</h2><p>Publisher: r2I Games / Asmodee USA</p><p>Originally published in 2024 but reaching a wider U.S. release in 2025, <em>Fromage</em> absolutely stunned us with its unique approach to worker placement. Putting players in the role of cheesemakers in the early 20th century, <em>Fromage</em> asks its players to carefully consider the cost of each action they take.</p><p>With the shape of the cheese wedges you place on the board determining when you get them back (they have to be pointing at you), <em>Fromage </em>stuck with us throughout the year, lingering like only the funkiest cheese can!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - The Crooked Moon</h2><p>Publisher: Legends of Avantris</p><p>From <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/crooked-moon-review-incredibly-spooky-adventure-that-dms-will-love" rel="nofollow">Andrew Stretch's Original Review</a>:</p><p>"The Crooked Moon was an absolute delight to read. The team at Legends of Avantris has taken the theme of Folk Horror and explored every nook and cranny of it, creating a tense but whimsical adventure from start to finish.</p><p>The player options are vast, but are also very specific to the Folk Horror settings. You might be able to play a Harpy in a more traditional game of D&amp;D, but it might be a bit harder to get away with a Scarecrow person.</p><p>For a DM, this game sets a gold standard. From the adventure preamble and history lesson, to plenty of clear references and a way to include characters' personal stories in the adventure clearer, The Crooked Moon handles a lot of the prep for you so that you can just enjoy running the game.</p><p>If you're looking for a new adventure that allows you to take your party on a creepy adventure, where a lot of the heavy lifting is done for you then this is an excellent next adventure to play."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>First Place - Guards of Traitor's Toll</h2><p>Publisher: Grey For Now Games</p><p>From <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/guards-of-traitors-toll-and-busy-streets-expansion-review" rel="nofollow">Adam Potts' Original Review</a>:</p><p>"I'm a huge fan of Guards of Traitor's Toll. The token system for activation, which can be a bit random in Test of Honour (and other Warlord Games systems) when looking for a competitive battle, suits this perfectly, with the random movement capturing the feel of a bustling city perfectly. The advance and trait cards start to bring to life your constables, and the citizens themselves start to develop their own stories within your game. The Busy Streets expansion, while appearing for solo players to lock content behind a miniatures purchase, adds a lot of variety to games, and the extra citizens and guards aren't wasted. For 3 or 4-player games, Busy Streets is essential.</p><p>Guards of Traitor's Toll plays well at all player counts, and always feels natural, rather than solo rules being bolted on. Exploring the narrative through the plot and secret cards, as well as watching your guards develop and rivalries grow if playing with 2 or more players, is a true joy. It perfectly captures the feel of a skirmish and adventure game, in a living environment, where the civilians and suspects' AI control feels random and realistic."</p></div><div><p><span><div>
