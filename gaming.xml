<p><em>Over four years since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/our-verdict-on-animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-2-0-the-last-major-free-content">Update 2.0.0</a> — which was billed as the "last major free content" — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-3-0-0-patch-notes-switch-2-and-switch-new-content-features-and-more">Animal Crossing: New Horizons Update 3.0.0</a> has arrived, alongside the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>.</em></p>

<hr>
<p>Back when — what feels like forever ago — we found out that a new <strong>Animal Crossing</strong> game would be coming to Switch, we were told basically diddly squat about the whole thing, but excitement ensued nonetheless. As time went by and we learnt more and more about it, the hype reached ever higher rungs on the big ladder of development, only hindered <em>slightly</em> by a delay of an undisclosed number of months. Previews came and went, and frankly, we weren’t certain such an intolerable fever could happen over a game without ‘<strong>Mario</strong>’ or ‘<strong>Zelda</strong>’ in the title, but here we are; with expectations verging on the impossible and justifiable impatience about to become legal tender, can the proverbial skills of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> pay the bills?</p>

<p>Much like every other Animal Crossing game, you arrive fresh-faced in a town that’s seen better days. Unlike every other Animal Crossing game, the town isn’t really there yet, and it’s basically all down to you to fund a tycoon raccoon’s mad obsession with Bells, and maybe make your island into a town in the process.</p>
<p>This time you’re also able to actually choose how your character looks, rather than being asked a series of seemingly arbitrary questions by a cat of no fixed abode in order to determine your genetic makeup. You’re also under no obligation to keep the face you’ve chosen, and every single choice you make when crafting your character — from your hair colour right down to rosy cheeks — is immediately rectifiable with any sort of mirror or vanity you can get your globular hands on. It seems basic by modern standards, but credit where credit’s due and all that.</p>
<p>But just how un-towny is this island you’ve been dropped on? Well, in short, you and everyone else will be spending at least the first night in a tent, with no buildings, structures, pathways, or anything else to keep you company – besides hundreds and hundreds of weeds, that is. This is nature’s home for sure, and unless you stop playing pretty much immediately, you’re going to want to make sure it knows <em>you’re in charge</em>. Plucking weeds, gathering fruit, selling them at Resident Services to Tom Nook’s unpaid nephews who seem to have an endless supply of funds at their disposal... it all needs doing, and none of the other islanders are going to do it.</p>

<p>This mega-early stage of the game feels surprisingly different to Animal Crossing as a whole; you’re supremely limited on what changes you can make, and your only real goal is to lay the groundwork for what's to come. The only thing that’s established is the layout of the land itself, although that too will eventually be yours to mould. Despite it being <em>so</em> different from previous games, we found the whole thing incredibly engrossing and appealing. The feeling of being isolated on a deserted island with not a care for what’s going on in the outside world is intoxicating and even somewhat addictive. Even in highly distracting real-life environments, we couldn’t stop thinking about that patch of weeds we didn’t <em>quite</em> have time to clear.</p>
<p>Speaking of weeds, they’re now more than just a nuisance; not only can they be straight-up sold for cash, but it's also possible to use them in the game's fancy new DIY system. This allows you to take raw materials that otherwise would serve little to no purpose and fashion them into swanky new gubbins. Stone, iron, three kinds of wood – none of the island’s resources are useless. All this needs to be carried in your inventory, and as such, the infamously limited space is thankfully bigger than ever before – although the old 'storing-things-as-presents-on-old-letters' trick can no longer be used, but then when did you <em>really</em> need to carry all those letters around anyway? It doesn’t end at a measly two rows, either; eventually, you’ll be able to upgrade your inventory to include two additional lines — one at a time — of extra space, which is so painfully welcome it actually <em>hurts</em>.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 3 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103616/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>To do this, you’ll need to exchange Nook Miles, a rewards system created by Tom Nook that almost feels generous. By completing various tasks throughout the island you’ll be slapped with an amount of Nook Miles that can be redeemed for all manner of interesting prizes. These are each only one-time offers, but it won’t be long before you unlock Nook Miles+, which gives you a random selection of tasks to complete that get replaced as soon as they’re done. It’s a really great way to get players to try a variety of different tasks that they might otherwise have overlooked, and with the rewards ranging from clothing to new hairstyles, you’ll want to get as many as you can.</p>
<p>Classics of the series such as Nook’s Cranny, the Able Sisters’ shop, and the Museum all return in full form, except this time they don't appear right away – but when they do eventually arrive, you get to demand where they're built, like the dictator that you are. You’re also able to eventually change your mind and relocate amenities, as well as your home and those of other villagers. This level of flexibility is entirely optional for purists, but the fact that it’s even just possible opens up the scope of what’s available to a degree never before seen in the series – and the options don’t end there either.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 4 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103611/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The DIY system expands far further than we originally expected as well; we’ve seen a huge number of items that are available to purchase (or find) the old-fashioned way that can <em>also</em> be crafted if you happen to have the appropriate DIY recipe on hand. Said recipes can be nabbed in numerous ways, such as being gifted to you by other villagers, acquired as part of standard progression, or even found frequently as a sort of 'message in a bottle' washed up on the beach. In short, <em>we love it</em>. It might be a bit weird to hit a tree with an axe three times a day to gather from a seemingly limitless font of wood, softwood, and hardwood, but despite its arguably nonsensical qualities, the end result is a system that works beautifully.</p>
<p>You’ll need to work this system hard as well if you want any more than the starting two villagers milling about your island. Mr Nook will task you with fulfilling his lofty promises to prospective inhabitants by supplying items they deem <em>absolutely</em> necessary to live, like a birdbath. Our tanuki friend provides the DIY recipes, but everything else is (of course) down to us. This can hit your resources <em>hard</em>, and so it may be worth your while if you’ve exhausted your island’s supplies to take a trip with Dodo Airlines to a mystery island, after exchanging 2000 Nook Miles for a ticket.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 5 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103628/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>These mystery tours place you on a randomly generated mini-island where resources, fish, bugs, and even new villagers can be found. They may be small, but we’d be lying if we said we didn’t get a thrill from the whole luck-of-the-draw system at play. Most of the time we went to these islands because we needed to get more resources, but a few times we went just for a change of scenery – and when we happened upon an island full of bamboo, we felt our Nook Miles had been <em>very</em> well spent indeed.</p>
<p>So, with all the new systems in place, we were having a wonderful time; our emotions expertly tapdancing between excitement, wonder, anticipation, and relaxation. But we can’t deny that after a week or so the great steam locomotive that is our enthusiasm was beginning to slow somewhat. No sooner had this feeling arrived than the all-powerful Nook hit us with the news that the Resident Services tent would be upgraded to something that looks <em>suspiciously</em> like a town hall in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>We were pleased, but we had no idea just how much more would be opened up with this single building. Suddenly we could create ramps, a town tune was in place (which was instantly changed to ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSsfjHCFosw">At Doom’s Gate</a>’ by parties unknown), bridges could be sprinkled wherever we wanted, we could change the flag, the previously-absent hourly music appeared, the entire island had erupted in new possibilities, and our eagerness spread across our faces like a big, grinning, ear-to-ear grin.</p>
<p>It doesn’t even end there, either; our DIY horizons were expanded even further with the ability to customise objects with different colours, and in some cases even with custom designs. Bedding, cushions, even your NookPhone case can have whatever sordid graphics you wish plastered all over them. It’s something fans have understandably been asking for for a long old time, and to see it realised so effortlessly makes our hearts swell in a safe and metaphorical sense.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/accessibility-report/2209/embed @ 1768476319 -->
<p>With all this customisation in objects, building locations, paving, and even the land itself, the only major limitation (besides your wallet) is your imagination, and whether you’re willing to put in the time to make it a reality. Nothing happens overnight (actually, buildings and renovations <em>do</em> occur overnight, so scratch that), so you’d better be ready to sink some serious hours into this game – and with so much here that’s so well realised, it’s hard not to. This is the point where we’d ask a question about whether the game looks good, but come on, we all <em>know</em> it looks good.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, the presentation in every sense here is all but flawless. It’s one of the prettiest games on the Switch, so when you couple that with atmospheric lighting, a crisp 1080p docked resolution running at 30fps, sound design that hangs like honey in our ears, and undoubtedly the finest museum in video game history, this is nothing short of an audio-visual dream. Handheld play unsurprisingly feels extremely natural given the series' history, but docked is where you'll get to see the shiniest of the pretty things in the quality most deserving.</p>

<p>And the loveliness doesn't end on a pixel level; the world feels far more <em>alive</em> than ever before. Villagers will wander around holding books and examining flowers, watering them, singing on the plaza, bashing away at a DIY Bench, running up to you to give you stuff you feel you can't turn down... it's all a rich tapestry. Integral characters like Tom Nook and Isabelle also have far more life in them, dusting, sorting, busying themselves appropriately rather than just waiting for your inevitable interaction with slightly dead eyes. The leaves on the trees all move independently, the footprints you leave on the beach behave differently if it's raining. The level of charm and attention to detail is simply unparalleled.</p>
<p>You’re not restricted to the delights of your own island, either. As with previous entries, you can take your charming little self off to visit the wonders found on the islands of others, either locally or via the internet. The system remains largely unchanged from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">New Leaf</a>, except with an extremely pleasing little classic airport information display-themed animation to announce the arrival of any new players, and it works well. We can’t say the idea of having a whole 8 people trampling around our simple but extremely personal town is something we’re clamouring to do, but the ability to do so shouldn’t be scoffed at in the slightest.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 6 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103610/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>If wireless ‘ain’t your thang’ you can also rope in another user (or three) from the same console to join you in your endeavours. A single Joy-Con is all that’s required for each player, meaning those who picked up a shiny new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/03/video_the_animal_crossing_switch_is_one_of_the_most_beautiful_things_humankind_has_ever_created">New Horizons Switch console</a> can dive right into co-op without delay. Players who aren’t classified as the singular ‘leader’ can’t pick anything up due to lacking an inventory, but it’s extremely simple and straightforward to swap who the leader is with just a few inputs. It’s a feature that will no doubt go down very well with families as well, and for a quick romp around the island, it works impressively well.</p>
<p>If we have one complaint, it would be that very occasionally the UI, whilst extremely smart and functional, isn’t as snappy as we’d expect it to be, resulting in some (thankfully rare) mistaken inputs as we feverishly rifle through menus to complete the next task. There’s no option to use the touchscreen when creating custom designs either, which is a bit strange. Those are <em>honestly</em> our only gripes.</p>
<h2>Update 3.0.0 (January 2026)</h2>
<p>Version 3.0 brings with it a fair few new additions to the base game. The standout inclusion is the hotel, now teetering off the edge of the once near-empty pier of your island, but there’s also a whole load of smaller, less shiny inclusions that are arguably just as important. More on them later, though.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 7 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103622/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you’re familiar with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/animal_crossing_new_horizons_-_happy_home_paradise_dlc">Happy Home Paradise DLC</a> that Nintendo released back in 2021, you’ll fall into most of what the new hotel (run by Kapp’n’s extended family) has to offer with little effort. The hotel has eight standard rooms for the common muck that waltzes in, and one VIP room for the lucky guest of your choosing. Your job is to decorate the rooms using all the furniture you’ve unlocked throughout your playtime.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:123203 @ 1768482004 -->
<p>Yeah, it’s not exactly breaking new ground, but for those without the DLC, this offers a ‘light’ version of that experience. It’s not all the same — you’re decorating rooms to attract guests rather than fulfilling their every whim — but the long and short of it is you’re decorating rooms; if that’s not your bag, you’re going to get tired of this stuff <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p>The VIP room is a bit different, as it resets each and every day, meaning you’ll have what is essentially a room-making daily ‘challenge’, which is quite a meaningful item to stick on your daily task list. We say ‘challenge’, but of course the game would be happy if you stuck an open bag of crisps slightly off-centre in the middle of a blank white box. But hey, who are we to judge <em>style</em>?</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 8 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103614/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You also have a gift shop where you can spend the tickets you receive from decorating rooms for special items, just as you could on Happy Home Paradise, including retro Nintendo consoles that let NSO subscribers play classic games à la the GameCube original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> (although only one game per system). Sounds like a racket, personally. Probably lets them dodge Nook taxes or something.</p>
<p>The best part of having eight tourists on your island is just that: your island now has a lot more characters bumbling around, and every day you’ll get a new set to take up your precious space. It’s really lovely to have a change of faces after staring at the same ten gormless stares for years and years.</p>
<p>There are plenty of smaller things to enjoy as well. You can now stick to the island’s hidden grid system and strafe by holding down 'L', which is an inarguable godsend for laying paths and terraforming; you can access the crafting materials in your home storage from any DIY bench; you can craft up to ten DIY items in a single go; you can clear vast swathes of land (and even your entire island) of any and all clutter with the help of Resetti’s exorbitant 60,000-bell clean-up service; and you can join friends on special Slumber Islands which let you fashion the terrain on a fresh island and play together more freely than before.</p>

<p>And these are all separate from the additions of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, as well. All good stuff and no mistake. Many of these new features are being introduced nearly <em>six whole years</em> after the game’s launch, granted. Better late than never, we suppose.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons takes Animal Crossing and not only drags it back onto home consoles, but improves upon every single facet imaginable. There's more to do, more to see, more to change, more to mould, and more to love; fans and first-time players are going to find themselves losing hours at a time gathering materials, creating new furniture, and making their island undeniably <em>theirs</em>. Every moment is unashamedly blissful, with excellently-written characters that truly feel alive and an island paradise that gives back infinitely more than you put in.</p>
<p>Back when Animal Crossing: New Leaf hit the shelves all those years ago and created a whole new generation of fans, many people were wondering how Nintendo could possibly top it, but here we have our answer. This is a masterpiece that has been well worth waiting for.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[‘When People Have Already Decided That You’re Going to Fail, It’s Actually Freeing to Some Degree’, Says Bethesda Dev About Fallout 3 Hate]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bethesda-dev-speaks-fallout-3-pre-release-hate/</link>
            <guid>1406803</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the news that <strong>Bethesda</strong> had acquired the <strong>Fallout</strong> license and would develop <strong>Fallout 3</strong>, the studio, known for the <strong>Elder Scrolls</strong> franchise, faced a significant amount of online criticism. In a retrospective article published in the latest issue of <strong>EDGE Magazine</strong> (<a href="https://fave.co/4aXc54h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2026, #419</a>), <strong>Angela Browder</strong>, current Studio and Production Director at Bethesda Game Studios, looked back at the controversy and found that, in a way, it freed the team to do what it wanted.</p>



<p><em>There was a section of the Fallout fandom that felt that a team famous for making elves and fantasy games should not be touching this series. It was surprising to us how much hate we got. They were not very happy that we had bought this licence. [...] I wasn’t concerned about what the haters might have thought. When a group of people have already decided that you’re going to fail, it’s actually freeing to some degree.</em></p>



<p>Now that many years have passed, Browder feels the franchise's expansion under the Bethesda banner is there for all to see (despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care-fallout-new-vegas-lead-chris-avellone-comments-on-series-direction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticism levied against the studio</a> just a few days ago by <strong>Fallout: New Vegas</strong> lead <strong>Chris Avellone</strong>).</p>



<p><em>You look at the amount of fans that Fallout had for 1 and 2, which expanded with 3 and expanded with 4, and now you have a television show. That, to me, is the success of it – all these people who become lifers.</em></p>



<p>Like many Bethesda games at launch, Fallout 3 had a lot of bugs, which Browder and Studio Design Director <strong>Emil Pagliarulo</strong> explained with the following statements: </p>



<p><strong>Angela Browder</strong>: <em>We try not to say ‘no’ to the player. If you want to do something weird, you can go for it. And if we’re not saying ‘no’ to the player, why would we say ‘no’ to the staff who are making it? We had a grand vision of this thing, and a very small staff, and we just went. And if something went wrong, we just pivoted.</em></p>



<p><strong>Emil Pagliarulo</strong>: <em>We were trying to do so much and we couldn’t really comprehend the complexity of the freedom we were trying to give the player, and how that can screw things up. There’s a human element, too. As it gets deeper into development, people get tired. They make mistakes. And then, when you go to fix bugs, you have to be so careful – you can change a line of text and it blows up some art somewhere.</em></p>



<p>Fallout 3 returned in the news in the last few years following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaster leak</a>. Lately, the rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has expanded to also include Fallout: New Vegas</a>; <strong>apparently, Bethesda is working on remasters for both games</strong>.</p>

              <p>January is often a quiet month for big video game releases. So this cold, wintry month becomes a perfect time to evaluate your ever-growing backlog of video games and start chipping away at it. That’s what many of us at <em>Kotaku</em> are doing right now, and so we figured hey, let’s turn our lives into content for the website.</p> <p>Welcome to the start of <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews/backlog">Backlog Week</a>, a way to celebrate, critically evaluate, and document those massive lists of games we all have. Those lists of games we need to get around to…one day. Games we want to play. Games we want to finish. Games we want to give a second or even third chance to in the hope that maybe this time it will stick. Looking at you, <em>Cyberpunk 2077!</em></p>

 <p>So what should you expect over the next seven days? We’ll have new blogs from us and some talented freelancers about finally playing backlog games, dealing with that dreaded list, what a backlog even is in 2026, and some remastered old posts from our <a href="https://kotaku.com/welcome-to-backlog-month-1846621879">Backlog Month in 2021</a>. And with comments back, feel free to tell us about any games you’re finally getting around to after they lingered on your backlog for weeks, months, or even years.</p>

 <p>And yes, we are starting a theme week in the <em>middle</em> of the week and not on a Monday. It will even run over the weekend. We’re rebels. And like, a week is just seven days, baby. We can start that whenever we so please. And so we are starting…now. Well, actually, we started like four paragraphs up, but whatever, welcome to <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/backlog-week-2026">Backlog Week 2026</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A brand new season in Marvel Rivals has arrived with the launch of Season 6, and with it comes the usual balancing update full of fresh nerfs and buffs. </p>



<p>Season 6 of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-players-can-now-buy-gift-items-directly-from-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> features many tweaks fans have long called for, along with an update to Team-Up Abilities. Some new ones have been added, whilst a couple have instead been removed. </p>







<p>If you’re looking for the full breakdown of nerfs and buffs coming alongside Season 6 of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadpool-is-marvel-rivals-most-versatile-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>, then you’re in the right place—it’s all available below.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-season-6-buffs-amp-nerfs">All Marvel Rivals Season 6 Buffs &amp; Nerfs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A flurry of nerfs is coming. Image by NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 6 offers a large variety of balance changes, though the likes of Star-Lord and Hela manage to evade nerfs despite their OP nature.</strong></p>



<p>A handful of Vanguards have seen some notable buffs, including the likes of Doctor Strange, Hulk and Emma Frost. Hulk has received a variety of cooldown improvements, whilst Doctor Strange has been given some movement adjustments to his Cloak of Levitation. Meanwhile, Angela is slightly easier to deal with, now that her shield value has dropped from 350 to 300.</p>



<p>Duelists have seen some hefty changes, too, with Black Panther and Iron Fist both receiving buffs. Diving the backline should be slightly easier now, thanks to some damage increases to some of their abilities. Blade has seen some tweaks, as you’ll need to choose between your weapons more carefully. Sadly, though, Daredevil is the main target for nerfs, as the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen was running riot last season. </p>







<p>Finally, the Strategists have come out the worst with Season 6’s balance changes, as the likes of Rocket Raccoon, Invisible Woman, and Gambit have all been nerfed. Rocket Raccoon has been slowed down slightly during his Wild Crawl, whilst Sue Storm’s Guardian Shield has dropped from 250 to 200 health. Gambit’s overall healing output has been lowered, as NetEase look to weaken his cards.</p>

<p>"When you find your passion, stay with it"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>You're never too old to pursue your passion, and as demonstrated in the above video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcZRU4Qxh20">Killer Carp</a>, 91-year-old Jan is proof of that.</p>
<p>Jan started playing Nintendo games when she picked up the N64 along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, and has since developed a huge love for the <strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> franchise. The video spends a bit of time taking a walk down memory lane, with Jan providing her thoughts on some of the series' most iconic entries.</p>
<p>In fact, her comment on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Zelda: Majora's Mask</a> while shaking her fist was particularly amusing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That mask in somethin' else. That son of a gun! You wanna... Oooooh!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, it's just a lovely video, and Jan is a real treasure. We often get so caught up in what others are thinking these days, it's nice to see someone just embrace their passion and really lose themselves in it.</p>
<p>We'll leave you with a quote from Jan that we should all heed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When you find your passion, stay with it, because it's the best time of your life. You don't get tired of it, you look forward to doing it over and over again, and you're at your happiest you've ever been."</p>

			<p>Earlier this month, IO Interactive made more than a few brows rise when it shared <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-unveils-partnership-with-nvidia-official-pc-system-requirements/">the minimum and recommended PC specifications</a></strong> for the highly anticipated <strong><em>007 First Light</em></strong>. The <strong>32GB of RAM recommended for 1080p resolution, 60 frames per second gameplay</strong> was particularly concerning, suggesting potential optimization issues that may have made the game run poorly on many system configurations.</p>



<p>Thankfully, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">you won't have to empty your wallet to purchase more RAM</strong> during the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">current memory crisis</a></strong> to run 007 First Light decently at 1080p resolution,</p>



<p><em>"We are providing today an update to the PC system requirements for 007 First Light after the community flagged some inconsistencies in an earlier version of the listing,"</em> the developer wrote on the game's <strong><a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2011735420631982151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official X profile.</a></strong></p>



<p><em>"After a thorough re-examination and additional testing, <strong>the recommended RAM has been corrected from 32GB to 16GB, VRAM values have been updated, and the minimum CPU line has been fixed</strong>. Additional performance targets will be shared closer to launch,"</em> the developer continued, confirming that the updated specs are now reflected across store pages.</p>

LinkedIn today is a terrible den of web3+ grifters, obsolete CVs, frog-boiling pressure to buy a subscription, and scurrilous journalists hunting for leaks in job listings. But every now and then it comes good. For example, there’s a discussion underway between various senior developers, including current and former staff of Remedy, Ubisoft and Naughty Dog, about the causes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/crunch">crunch</a>, aka ruinous overwork. 
</p>
<p>
There’s a pervading atmosphere of former triple-A blokes warming up their soapboxes for a GDC talk down the line, and a certain amount of insider jargon about “pipelines” and so forth – somebody should probably do a piece on the etymology of “pipelines” in software development. But it’s otherwise a useful chat. There is minimal indulgence of the old saw about crunch being unavoidable because ‘passionate’ creative people are inherently prone to burning themselves out. The emphasis is on crunch as a structural phenomenon.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The chinwag’s instigator is Novaquark technical director John Walther, a former senior technical artist at Ubisoft, where he worked on the Anvil engine used by Assassin’s Creed and Ghost Recon. He <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnw91_the-big-reason-its-so-important-for-every-activity-7414836160482553856-0yqh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAsO93UBTZM2evkelLuCJQRZA60kwdEabuQ">kicks off with the hopeful assertion</a> that “the big reason it's so important for every studio to improve their pipelines and processes right now is because of the industry trending away from crunch.” Walther continues that “crunch has been used to make some of the biggest blockbuster AAAs but it's not sustainable as it burns out dev teams” and as such, has been “universally rejected across the games industry.”
</p>
<p>
Less positively, he feels that “many companies are turning back to crunch as it's the only way they know to find success”, with “pressure coming from publishers tightening their grip”. This may “work in the short term but the long term solution is improving pipelines and processes”. Walther argues that “scoping down” is “the easy and boring solution” to this. “I think we should continue to make ambitious games, we just need to work in a more efficient and organized manner.” I’m not sure I recognise the implied link between “ambition” and sheer production scale here, but I appreciate the sentiment.
</p><p>
People responding to the post include Robert Krekel, former audio director at Naughty Dog, who is now audio director at Atomic Arcade. “While crunch is often blamed on poor production, over-scoping, or broken processes which all absolutely contribute, there’s another factor that doesn’t get discussed nearly enough: ego,” he argues. “When you put a large number of high performers on the same team, there’s often an unspoken pressure to define what the 'industry standard' is in your specific discipline not because it’s required to ship the product, but because individuals want to be seen as the best at what they do by their peers. It’s an uncomfortable reality at studios like Naughty Dog. The studio attracts people with that mindset by design.”
</p>
<p>
As such, Krekel thinks studio managers need to both fix “broken processes” and “give people the autonomy to push boundaries, exercise real agency, and feel genuine pride in their work, while also putting guardrails in place to protect them from themselves.”</p>
<p>Going by his comments, I would suggest that Naughty Dog especially still need to undergo some more general reflection about whether they want to cultivate this behaviour from the point of recruitment onward. This is assuming a fair bit of good faith on the part of bosses and parent company Sony, of course. Naughty Dog have long had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crunch-once-again-in-the-spotlight-after-damning-report-on-the-last-of-us-2-developer-naughty-dog">reputation</a> for crunch culture - they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crunch-returns-to-naughty-dog-for-xmas-as-intergalactic-devs-work-overtime-on-a-demo-for-sony-claims-report">made headlines recently</a> for requiring developers to work longer hours on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet in the run-up to Xmas.
</p>
<p>
Josh DiCarlo – former Insomniac Games principal character technical director, and current creative technology director of Persona AI – feels that “crunch is not a SCOPE problem, it's - at its core - an institutional problem and it's almost entirely avoidable.” He begins by comparing his experiences of game development to his time in the film biz, commenting that “I've worked on films from beginning to end that had virtually no overtime - I have never heard of a modern AAA title that didn't have a soul crushing crunch period.”
</p><p>
“The problem is that solving crunch requires more than a verbal commitment from the studio to avoid it,” DiCarlo argues. “It requires buy-in and investment at ALL levels. To develop streamlined, holistic, automated pipelines that tackle asset publishing, versioning, and review material without reliance on individual contributors to follow elaborate processes. To enforce regular standardized reviews to buyoff and approve assets. To meticulously track development in a project and asset-centric way rather than a ticket centric one - and to have a financial consequence (i.e. OVERTIME).”</p>
<p>Some more context: Insomniac have seen their share of crunch, but they <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/insomniacs-ted-price-games-studios-must-break-the-habit-of-brute-forcing-through-problems">caused a stir</a> back in 2021 for allegedly avoiding mandatory overwork during development of Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart.
</p>
<p>
Remedy’s principal audio designer Ville Petteri Sorsa has the snappiest reply. “Crunch is the easiest workaround for failures in management and project planning,” he says. “It usually emerges as a response to financial pressure and deadlines that were never realistic to begin with.”
</p>
<p>
I’ve crunched myself for various employers. It has always been due to some combination of inadequate project structure, not enough resources to do work I'm proud of, and putting myself under unnecessary pressure to deliver quantifiable results.</p>
<p>My workplace experiences are very different from those of game developers labouring on just the one release for years, milestone to milestone, amid a changing industry. How about you? Any memories of crunch - or successfully avoiding crunch - to share? Some follow-up material: back in 2021, People Make Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/outsourcing-doesnt-solve-crunch">ran a video</a> about how even companies that avoid crunch may outsource it to studios overseas.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/15/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-control-resonant/</link>
            <guid>1406761</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It both feels like an awful long time, and barely any real time at all since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/control-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Control burst onto the scene in 2019</a>, putting Remedy Entertainment back on the map after their split with Microsoft and bringing millions of new fans into their expanding supernatural universe. Expectations are much higher for its recently announced sequel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-resonant">Control Resonant</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="CONTROL Resonant – Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhQm-ExRz60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Control Resonant was revealed at The Game Awards, putting a name to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-2">a sequel</a> that we knew was in development since all the way back in 2022.</p>


<p>Things have gone from bad to worse at The Oldest House and the Federal Bureau of Control, and salvation will come from another rather unlikely direction. After Jesse Faden found herself suddenly wrapped up into becoming the FBC’s Director, it’s now Dylan Faden, her brother who was confined at the FBC for years as the character P6, who has to fight back a mysterious cosmic entity.</p>


<p>This threat has been able to spill out of the confined of The Oldest House and into Manhattan, creating a large, but unfamiliar rendition of the world as the cosmic force reshapes the environment, breaks down laws of physics and reality, and even extends into Dylan’s psyche. It’s all a bit Doctor Strange and Inception in the announcement trailer, but expect it to get much more twisted and darker.</p>
<p>Luckily Dylan finds new powers awakening within him to fight back, with Jesse having disappeared. There looks to be more of a melee action adventure RPG tone to this, after the third person shooting of the original, but the snippets of gameplay from the reveal trailer look truly spectacular. We can’t wait to see more.</p>

<p>Control Resonant was originally announced back in November 2022 when Remedy Entertainment and 505 Games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">announced</a> an agreement to co-develop and co-publish the new game. At that point Control 2, as it was known, was still in the initial pre-production concept stage, with an initial budget of €50 million.</p>
<p>Things changed in 2024 when Remedy Entertainment has acquired the full rights to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a> franchise as a whole from 505 Games, including both the already-released 2019 game, and any future projects.&nbsp; Remedy asked for this freedom in order to give themselves a fresh chance to either self-publish the games or find a new publishing partner for these two games.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what they did a few months later when Remedy Entertainment and Annapurna <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">announced</a> a strategic partnership which will see Annapurna provide 50% of the development budget for Control 2. Additionally, the two companies will work together on bringing Control and Alan Wake to both film and television. Annapurna’s main focus will primarily be the films and shows, allowing Remedy to focus on the game development side of things.</p>
<p>Control Resonant will launch in 2026 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and Mac.</p>
<p><em>Alright, that’s all but one of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a> accounted for. Can you figure out which title has landed in the top spot? Come back tomorrow for our chart topper to confirm or defy your expectations.</em></p>

            <p>A group of modders who got multiplayer servers running for Rockstar's schoolyard mischief simulator Bully <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bully-online-sees-modders-have-another-go-at-schoolyard-multiplayer-mayhem-arrives-in-paid-early-access-this-year">late last year</a> have suddenly pulled all traces of their creation offline. The project's been shutdown about a month after release, and thus far its creators haven't offered an explanation as to why, beyond emphasising that this outcome wasn't what they hoped would happen.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The Bully Online project is shutting down forever," reads an announcement which popped up on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1275210273481031752/1449940958794747985/1461027105054789814">Discord server</a> of project lead and YouTuber Swegta yesterday afternoon. "Which unfortunately means all the following is going to happen in 24 hours: our official Bully Online server (on swegta.com) will be shutdown, development of scripts for Bully Online will stop, the source code will be removed from swegta.com, all our webpages referring to it will be removed, the launcher downloads will taken down, and all Bully Online account data will be permanently deleted."</p>
<p>As you'll also be dutifully informed if you head over to <a href="https://swegta.com/">that website</a>, Swegta's set to make a statement about the shutdown on January 21st, with this looking set to come in YouTube video form. Outside of that, all the mod's team currently said regarding the reasoning behind the shutdown in that Discord post is this: "For now though, know this was not something we wanted." They added that Bully Online players had 24 hours from the announcement going live to hop on, take a final stroll in the mod, and backup any screenshots they want to keep.</p>
<p>While we'll have to wait and see if the YouTuber's full statement confirms as much, the whole thing smells very much like some Lionel Hutzes have been in touch and politely delivered a message amounting to 'please knock this off'. Rockstar and Take-Two have a lengthy history of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike">dishing out such things</a> to modding projects, even if the company's general stance on modding has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-launch-official-roleplay-mods-store-where-you-can-spend-67-to-turn-gta-into-euro-truck-simulator-2">grown a bit more complex</a> in recent years.</p>
<p>If that is the case, it's sad to see a mod that sounded when I first heard about it back in November like it'd been in the works for a good while meeting such a rapid demise.</p>

<p><strong>Not too much is known about what you can expect from Marvel Rivals Season 6.5, but one thing is clear: Elsa Bloodstone is on the way. </strong></p>



<p>NetEase has confirmed that Elsa Bloodstone will be the next playable hero in Marvel Rivals. She’ll be joining the roster on February 13, when Season 6.5 kicks into gear.</p>







<p>If you’re not familiar with who Else Bloodstone is, then don’t worry. She’s a relatively new figure in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-blade-dev-is-super-proud-of-special-game-its-creating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel universe</a>, as she first appeared in Bloodstone #1 in 2001. Elsa is a British monster hunter who gains her powers from her father’s magical bloodstone choker. </p>



<p>As things stand, it’s unknown what her role will be in Marvel Rivals, but judging by her gun and sword combo, the odds are she will most likely arrive as a Duelist. Considering she hunts monsters for a living, she should have no trouble going toe-to-toe against the rest of the heroes.</p>

Fast-forward just a few short months later, however, and now the Bully online project is "shutting down forever."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bully was a humorous action game that put players in the role of high school outcast Jimmy while attending a pretentious private school. Fans have long called for a sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-rockstar-developers-share-details-on-the-development-of-the-cancelled-bully-2"><u>which was once in development at Rockstar’s New England studio in the late 2000s</u></a>, and while Bully 2 was obviously never released, some of its ideas made it into other Rockstar games like Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though the game was developed to be a single-player experience, the mod, which has been in development for years and fully released only last month, allowed players to team up for minigames, roleplay, compete in racing, and face off against NPCs, instantly drawing the attention of fans… and IP owner Rockstar, it seems.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Coming with sad news today," wrote one of the Fat Pigeon Development team on the project's Discord. "The Bully Online project is shutting down forever, which unfortunately means all the following is going to happen in 24 hours."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post reported that the Bully Online server would shut down, development of Bully Online scripts would stop, the source code would disappear, and all webpages referencing it would be removed, along with the launcher (which has seemingly already happened). All Bully Online account data will also be "permanently deleted" and even Discord channels related to the mod are getting nuked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team held off on detailing why this was happening, only confirming that lead dev SWEGTA hopes to upload an explanatory video to his YouTube channel. "For now, though, know this was not something we wanted," the statement added.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar parent company Take-Two has a history of clamping down on fan projects, although after it acquired <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-officially-working-with-gta-roleplay-server-team-sparking-fresh-excitement-about-gta-6"><u>the modding team behind the wildly popular Grand Theft Auto 5 roleplay servers</u></a> FiveM and RedM back in 2023, it was felt a change in approach might have been in place. In fact, just yesterday (January 14), we reported that Rockstar had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-launches-official-user-generated-content-marketplace-for-mods"><u>even launched an official marketplace where creators can sell mods</u></a>... which could be the issue, as some players suggest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think we all know the reason, it's got everything to do with Rockstar's new CFX launch mod site where they make more greedy profit for [publisher] Take-Two Interactive by putting pay-walls on mods," <a href="https://x.com/VIK19941/status/2011511769433587753?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posited</u></a> one unhappy player. "I expect more mods to be shut down as the months go on with this new CFX marketplace."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, as this <a href="https://x.com/jordychinchin/status/2011561295838134277?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenter</u></a> points out, Bully Online was already effectively paywalled to donors of the project, which is widely frowned upon across the modding space. "Not surprising at all," they said. "Dude was pretty much asking to get shutdown the moment he paywalled early access to this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for if there'll ever be an official Bully 2? Dan Houser, Rockstar Games co-founder and the writer behind the studio's biggest games, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/grand-theft-auto"><u>Grand Theft Auto</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption"><u>Red Dead Redemption</u></a> series, recently sat down for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ign-in-conversation-with-dan-houser-at-la-comic-con-2025"><u>an exclusive interview with IGN</u></a>, revealing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-just-cant-do-all-the-projects-you-want-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-says-bully-2-didnt-happen-due-to-bandwidth-issues"><u>Bully 2 didn't happen because of "bandwidth issues."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

<p>007 First Light devs have now released an updated set of PC System requirements after the community pointed out several errors. </p>



<p>IO Interactive’s next big title, 007 First Light, is all set to release on May 27, 2026, across all major platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC. The title was initially set to release in March, but it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-delay-may-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed late last year</a>, providing the devs enough time to refine and polish the build. Check out the PC System requirements for 007 First Light below to see if your PC is capable of running the title. </p>







<h2 id="h-updated-007-first-light-pc-system-requirements">Updated 007 First Light PC System Requirements </h2>

The recommended RAM has been reduced to 16GB from 32GB, and the error in the minimum CPU line, which previously stated “Intel Core i5 9500K” (K being the issue), has been updated as well. The VRAM has also been reduced for both sets of requirements. Additional performance targets for the title will be shared closer to launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last week,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-06/chat-platform-discord-is-said-to-file-confidentially-for-ipo?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg reported</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;that Discord has filed confidentially for an initial public offering. With more than 200 million monthly users globally, Discord is among the few major social media platforms to remain private.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, it&nbsp;could be about to push ahead with the largest IPO in the video game industry since 2021, when Roblox Corp. and several other companies went public, according to PitchBook senior research analyst Eric Bellomo, speaking to Game Developer. It means Discord, used by both industry professionals and consumers, is at a juncture that will certainly have an impact on the platform itself and the wider industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bloomberg reported that Discord is working with Goldman Sachs Group and JP Morgan Chase on the listing. Discussions are ongoing, and the company could still decide to hit the brakes. Discord told Bloomberg that it remains focused on "delivering the best possible experience for users and building a strong sustainable business."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Talk about a potential IPO has been ongoing for some time, and continued when Discord co-founder and former CEO Jason Citron stepped down in April 2025 and named former Activision Blizzard vice chairman Humam Sakhhini as his successor. Just a month prior,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/technology/discord-ipo.html">the New York Times reported</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;the company was in talks with bankers about an IPO.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-had-nothing-to-offer-halifax-union-calls-out-ubisoft-after-first-talks-following-studio-closure" target="_self" data-discover="true">'It had nothing to offer:' Halifax union lambasts Ubisoft after first talks following studio closure</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Humam and I are fundamentally aligned that creating long-term value requires long-term thinking and focusing on an amazing user experience,"&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/blog/passing-the-torch">Citron said in a public letter to staff when announcing his exit as chief exec</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord was born out of a failed mobile game studio by Citron and Stanislav Vishnevisky. Though the game didn't take off, its internal messaging tools worked, and the company pivoted from the Hammer &amp; Chisel studio into Discord. It succeeded—and quickly—as a chat platform for gamers and has continued to grow; the company made a reported $890 million in revenue in 2024, almost double what it earned in 2022. Investors valued the company at $15 billion after a&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/chat-app-discord-is-worth-15-billion-after-new-funding">$500 million funding round in 2021</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sheer amount of financing pumped into Discord over the years means it's not necessarily surprising that Discord would seek to go public. Investors, at some point, want to make a return on their&nbsp;investment.&nbsp;An acquisition, like the $12 billion bid Discord rejected from Microsoft in 2021, is one way to achieve that goal. An IPO is another. Discord will still have institutional investors, Bellomo said, but an IPO widens who can buy shares in a company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It brings liquidity," Bellomo said, "It's also a way to finance future operations without navigating these kinds of opaque and sometimes slow private markets."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rockstar-launches-an-official-mod-marketplace" target="_self" data-discover="true">Rockstar Games launches an official mod marketplace</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord, as a private company, focuses primarily on growing its user base as a free-to-use platform. "When they stay private, they can test different ways to monetize their user base," Bellomo said. "They are primarily a freemium service right now, but there's a lot more latitude to experiment, to fail in some cases, and keep growing. As a public company, that balance shifts."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;It's a key validation that gaming can still be a venture scale ecosystem and still attract venture dollars and continue to grow&quot;">"It's a key validation that gaming can still be a venture scale ecosystem and still attract venture dollars and continue to grow"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord, as a public company, has to publicly report to shareholders who demand growth—both in the user base and how Discord is able to monetize its service. Discord, as it stands, is a perfectly fine product to use at its free tiers. Its Nitro subscription makes that basic service better, in some ways, like allowing better streaming quality, custom emojis, and the ability to upload larger files. Discord's main Nitro subscription is $10 a month, and its Basic tier is $2.99 a month.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sort of further monetization expected of a public company could look like "the introduction of an advertising service, higher prices, more tiers, additional services to businesses, so B2B offerings in the form of ecommerce infrastructure or game publishing services."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ubisoft-laying-off-staff-at-abu-dhabi-studio" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Ubisoft confirms layoffs at Abu Dhabi studio</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The primary distinction is, as a consumer product in the private markets, you can really focus on growth and experimentation," Bellomo said. "On the monetization front, as a public company, you need to both grow and monetize more and more each quarter."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite being a multi-billion company, Discord has had this reputation as a platform for gamers; it's dialed into the culture it has cultivated as a company. Discord has a lot in common with a chat platform like Slack, but the target audience is clearly different. It's the gamer's platform, and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/discord-reddit-ipo-gaming-server-gta-6-enshitification-1851768033">there is already concern regarding what some call the</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;"enshittification" of companies that go public and become fixated on delivering value to shareholders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A key challenge for Discord will be in maintaining that image as "a third digital space, and one that is very welcoming of tech-forward users and its user base culture," Bellomo said. "Its credibility attracts new users to the platform, and it will need to do so while also monetizing those users more in the future."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond the direct impact on Discord as a platform and the business around it, the potential IPO has wider implications for the video game industry. Bellomo said the massive IPO validates the video game industry for investors in a period where there has been "a pretty precipitous decline in the number of investors who are actively writing checks to gaming startups."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's a key validation that gaming can still be a venture scale ecosystem and still attract venture dollars and continue to grow," Bellomo said, while noting that the industry's trajectory goes well beyond what happens with the Discord IPO.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second big impact an IPO of Discord's size has on the industry is in transparency, Bellomo said. The fact a public company needs to make its financials available to existing and prospective investors will be an asset for those looking to conduct an industry health check, which often includes keen-eyed reporters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another undercurrent behind Discord's potential IPO is the scrutiny the company has faced over its approach to child safety. Like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Discord has been sued for allegedly&nbsp; facilitating the exploitation of children.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/discord-rolls-out-new-teen-safety-and-moderation-tools-for-guardians">Discord rolled out new safety and moderation tools</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in November following the filing of several lawsuits,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.njoag.gov/ag-platkin-sues-messaging-app-discord-for-unlawful-practices-that-expose-nj-kids-to-child-predators-and-violent-sexual-content/">including one from New Jersey attorney general Matthew J. Platkin</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In September, Sakhnini was asked to appear at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to testify regarding the platform's role in "the radicalization of online forum users," citing the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That hearing does not appear to have been scheduled at the time of writing.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Columnist, Game Developer</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nicole Carpenter is a veteran reporter who has been covering the video game industry for over a decade.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-discord-s-potential-ipo-means-for-its-business-and-the-video-game-industry]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has re-uploaded a sizable selection of sea shanties from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a>, the latest indication that a remake announcement is imminent.</p>
<p>Found as the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UbisoftMusic/videos">video uploads on the Ubisoft Music YouTube channel</a>, a collection of sailing bangers including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhmjBzuXM4">Over the Hills and Far Away</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2IxTpgLQjo">Spanish Ladies</a> can be enjoyed in all their glory. A few comments have even been made by early birds, including one by Spriteking3944 who wrote: "Very subtle release Ubisoft".</p>
<p>What are they talking about? Well, the Black Flag remake is perhaps the most poorly kept secret in Ubisoft's repertoire as of writing. Back in August of last year, voice actor Matt Ryan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">claimed legal action was brought against him by Ubisoft</a> after cheekily hinting at its existence at a convention.</p>

<p>Then, last November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">Ubisoft financial reports stated an unannounced title was due to release in the fourth quarter of this financial year</a>. If that wasn't enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">a PEGI listing for a Black Flag remake was spotted</a> in December, ahead of The Game Awards. This isn't even the first hint at a Black Flag remake this year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">a Raid: Shadow Legends collaboration with Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed leading many to further expect its imminent reveal</a>.</p><p>These music tracks, which on their lonesome appear to be just a part of a continued archival process by Ubisoft for its music library, is yet more sponge on the ever-growing Black Flag remake layer cake. When we'll see it properly revealed, or whether we will at all, remains a mystery.</p>
<p>If you've not played Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>! In it, Tom Bradwell noted: "Edward doesn't have the impish wit of fan favourite Ezio Auditore, against whom all Assassin's Creed protagonists are destined to be measured, but in the end he felt more rounded to me. The revelation, though, is the treasure of a game he stars in."</p>

            <p>There are two blue wolves inside you. One is actually a hedgehog, prone to loop-the-loops and drowning in caves. The other one is actually a dolphin, who is also prone to loop-the-loops and drowning in caves. Clarification: when I said you I meant me. I’m referring to my own squalid psychological architecture as a Sega Mega Drive player with vivid memories of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> (especially the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-can-a-34-year-old-sonic-level-teach-us-about-videogame-light">Star Light Zone</a>) and Ecco the Dolphin. </p>
<p>While Sega’s pugnacious pinball mascot continues to star in videogames of all flavours, poor Ecco has been absent from screens since the early noughties. No longer: this year shall be the year of Ecco. Developers A&amp;R Atelier – whose members include the character’s original creator, Ed Annunziata – have <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/THE-WORLD-NEEDS-ECCO-THE-DOLPHIN">declared</a> that they are working on “several” new Ecco things, including a videogame. No, I won’t accommodate any criticism of my framing here. If we can have a year of Luigi and a year of Shadow, we can have a year of Ecco.</p><!--more-->
<p>New to Ecco? The original Mega Drive/Genesis games were 2D action-adventures in which you swam around beautiful pixel grottos, surfacing periodically for air and singing at other sea creatures and alien crystals. Wonderful, dreamy, frightening exercises in exploration and puzzling with a splash of ram-the-shark combat. The overarching storyline involves time travel and saving the planet. I have never played a swimming game with quite this ambience.</p>
<p>"It has been years in the making and we're honored to bring Ecco back," said Ed Annunziata, Chief Creative Officer of A&amp;R Atelier. "Ecco has always been more than a game about a dolphin - he's a bridge between worlds." Oh god, please let that be a reference to the aforesaid storyline and not a hint about some Netflix transmedia merchandising op. In general: please let A&amp;R Atelier not be some kind of shady cash-in operation. I've never heard of them before and they <a href="https://www.anratelier.com/">don't have a proper website</a>, at the time of writing.</p><p>We do already have some concrete indications of what those new Ecco projects are, concrete enough that the elusiveness of this week's announcement feels slightly weird. In <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">an Xbox Wire post from May last year</a>, Annunziata revealed that "me and the entire original team are going to Remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games. Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities." I also notice that the official <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">Ecco the Dolphin site</a> has a countdown on it, with approximately 2329 hours or 100 days to go.</p>
<p>While Ecco hasn’t attracted quite the same glut of fangames as Sonic, there are some <a href="https://forums.sonicretro.org/threads/ecco-the-dolphin-reverse-engineering-and-preservation-project.39893/">preservation projects</a> in the wilds, and <a href="https://itch.io/search?q=ecco+the+dolphin">a few Ecco homages on Itch.io</a>. Annunziata has himself hosted an <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ecco-jam-0-tickets-1782288836889?aff=oddtdtcreator">Ecco gamejam</a>, though it was a private affair. If I were rebooting Ecco today, I would definitely be aiming to team up with some fangamers akin to the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">Sonic Mania</a>. Also, the new one had better not be 3D, you savages. We already have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> at home.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>You might be aware of the great Disco thrupening, or quadrupening depending on how you classify things. Over the past couple of years, a number of new studios have loudly hoovered up various ex-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> devs following internal conflict at ZA/UM, and announced games that aim to rebottle the RPG's lightning. One such studio is Londgue, who recently told me their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-look-at-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-shows-a-painterly-gorgeous-and-utterly-unconvincing-rpg">partially-crowdfunded RPG</a> called Hopetown now has a playable intro, despite quietly switching narrative leads last year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I <a href="https://www.vg247.com/hopetown-disco-elysium-shadow-interview">interviewed two of Hopetown's key developers</a> in April last year, around the time Longdue launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/longduegames/hopetown">Kickstarter campaign</a> to provide "a small percentage of the total budget" for the game. The campaign's since more than doubled its original £25,000 goal, amassing £117,924 from just over 2,700 backers. Development is now underway, but the narrative lead I interviewed, Grant Roberts, is no longer at Longdue. Roberts' <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantroberts/">LinkedIn profile</a> indicates he left the studio in July 2025, just three months after the Kickstarter's launch.</p>
<p>The former Rocksteady and Bungie writer's departure from a project his LinkedIn profile cites him as having "defined, refined, and evangelised the vision for" appears to have happened pretty quietly - so quietly that, as of writing, he's still listed in the team section of <a href="https://www.hopetowngame.com/">Hopetown's website</a>.</p>
<p>To be fair, former ZA/UM developer Martin Luiga was acknowledged as Hopetown's narrative lead in a <a href="https://www.hopetowngame.com/post/hopetown-developer-interview-martin-luiga">short developer update</a> posted by Longdue last August, though that update doesn't mention him having taken over from Roberts. I recently reached out to both Roberts and Longdue about this. The latter responded with the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>We decided to part ways with Grant Roberts - who was narrative lead - after Martin Luiga (former co-founder of ZAUM and writer on Disco Elysium) scaled up his work with Longdue, and took over the role of narrative and creative lead after re-designing the skills system of the game.</blockquote>
<p>The studio also provided a quote from Luiga outlining how Hopetown's development is going as of January 2026. "We've re-designed and extensively tested a new skills system, based on my learnings from the early days of writing on Disco Elysium," the developer said. "We've also made incredible progress on the world, characters, and plot and have defined the opening scene of the game itself that is now in playable form, with variations of the introductory sequence written by myself and our writing team."</p><p>Longdue have been posting monthly short developer updates with different members of Hopetown's current team since that one with Luiga last August, so here's hoping on behalf of any folks who've backed the Kickstarter that a proper look at all of this apparent progress is released as part of those soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, original Disco studio ZA/UM continue to plow ahead with their own Disco follow-up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zaums-spy-thriller-zero-parades-sure-looks-like-disco-elysium-in-glasses-and-a-moustache">Zero Parades</a>. Dark Math Games and Summer Eternal - two studios which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick">IGN</a> reported in 2024 are or have been linked to each other and Longdue in various messy ways which occasionally beggar belief - are also working on their own Discoey things. For Dark Math, that's now a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/would-be-disco-elysium-successor-xxx-nightshift-morphs-from-an-isometric-rpg-into-a-third-person-ski-resort-murder-mystery">ski resort murder mystery game</a> called Tangerine Antarctic. For Summer Eternal, it's a mysterious game codenamed Red Rooster, which they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-former-disco-elysium-devs-of-summer-eternal-announce-their-new-game-red-rooster-in-the-form-of-a-book">announced by way of a book</a>. Finally, Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov are reportedly working on their own game at another studio named Red Info, and have remained relatively quiet compared to ZA/UM and the thruple of studios I've just mentioned thus far.</p>
<p>I personally remain rather sceptical of any of these shots to the Disco chaser, something which extends to ZA/UM's in-house attempt to re-ignite the magic following what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">certainly sounds like a horrible few years</a> to have been a dev on the original.</p>

<p>According to the developer, these inconsistencies were due to "internal miscommunication", which resulted in previous versions of the game's PC specs being shared. IO has now conducted further testing, and made corrections to 007 First Light's PC specifications, including updated VRAM values, a reduction in the recommended RAM (it's gone from 32GB to 16GB) and the minimum CPU line "has been fixed".</p>
<p>The studio apologised for any confusion it caused with its earlier specifications, adding it will be sharing additional performance targets for 007 First Light closer to the game's launch in May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There was a pleasant surprise for fans of Nintendo’s biggest hit of 2020, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> update 3.0.0 went live a day early!</p>
<p>Update 3.0.0 for Animal Crossing: New Horizons brings a bunch of new features to the five year old game, alongside today’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2 Edition</a> release and paid upgrade to bring more support for the new generation of Nintendo’s console. This update is all about the universal new features, with the paid DLC giving 4K support, Joy-Con 2 mouse mode and larger multiplayer lobbies to the game for Switch 2 players.</p>


<p>The free update has a major addition with a new resort hotel run by Kappn’s family, and your role is to help decorate the rooms to draw visitors to the island. Once a room is decorated you will get hotel tickets that can be used to exchanged for items in the hotel shop – it’s basically Happy Home Paradise DLC, but a free Hotel-based version.</p>
<p>Some amiibos will also be compatible and those characters can be invited as guests to the hotel, but there’s also a big old list of quality of life improvements that includes an increased storage capacity from 5000 items to 9000 items, and the ability to store flowers. Resetti will be available to clear up items that you do not want on display, and they can be put in storage to reuse at a later date. The action does not stop when your character goes to sleep. When they hit the hay they can be transported to Luna’s dream world which takes players to Slumber Island. Slumber Island can be decorated in whatever you want, terraform the environment, add bridges, change the time and weather, and add residents. Players can have up to three islands and choose from small, medium, and large sized islands. Players can be invited to each other’s islands and work together on making changes. There will be additional crossover items including consoles, and those who have a Switch Online membership will be able to play games on those consoles. There is also a collaboration with LEGO which will bring LEGO items into the game.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s now more! Nintendo hand-wave all of that previously announced stuff away and then include things like letting you craft using your home storage materials, purchasing up to 50 customization kits at once, additional Nook Miles tasks and more.</p>

<figure data-uuid="e88eb0d8b197c"><a title="Super Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e88eb0d8b197c/super-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've not seen a great deal of Kevin Afghani since the voice actor took over the envious role of Mario from veteran Charles Martinet. But this coming weekend, Afghani will meet his fans for the very first time when he attends <a href="https://www.charliescomiccon.com/">Charlie's ComicCon in Estero, Florida</a>.</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, Afghani recently caught up with <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/14/nintendo-new-mario-kevin-afghani-video-games/88185428007/">USA Today</a> to chat about all things Mario, including his prior experience with Nintendo games, how he feels to voice the world's most famous plumber, and what it's like to follow up on the work done by Charles Martinet.</p>
<p>When asked whether he was nervous about stepping into the shoes that Martinet had filled for so long, Afghani confirmed this vehemently, heaping praise upon his predecessor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Look, Charles, as far as I'm concerned, IS Mario. He created something that is so unbelievably iconic. And he did it so masterfully. If I wasn't nervous, then I'm the wrong guy.</p>
<p>"I'm the second guy who's doing Mario. Charles is THE guy. There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We expected nothing less, but it's lovely to see Afghani paying his respects to Martinet. The latter is now acting as the official brand ambassador for the Mario series, and frequently attends events himself to meet fans and regale audiences with stories of his career.</p>
<p>Afghani also took the time to debunk an unsubstantiated rumour speculating that he previously took part in Nintendo Direct presentations as a narrator, confirming "I never worked for Nintendo before being Mario".</p>

            <p>We'll heave him up an away we'll go. 'Way, me Assassin's Creeda! We'll heave him up an away we'll go. We're all bound over to Ubisoft's official music YouTube channel! We'll heave him up from down below. 'Way, me Assassin's Creeda! Oh, this is where a bunch of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Black Flag</a>'s sea shanties have just been reuploaded, potentially providing yet another hint that we're all soon bound to be playing that long-rumoured remake of the pirassassin adventure!</p>
<p>This sudden influx of classic ditties might not have meant much in a vacuum, but it follows many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">reports about the badly kept secret that is the remake</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">PEGI rating</a> that's about as close as you can get to a seal of approval short of Ubisoft finally giving up the ghost anmd revealing the thing themselves.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you fancy filling your brain with these pervasive earworms from the Age of Exploration once again, the fact 18 of them have been reuploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UbisoftMusic">Ubisoft's music channel</a> within the past 24 hours makes doing so easy. These cuts of tunes ranging from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vkoDWgLAQ">Way Me Susianah</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syW8yEW1HRE">Billy Riley</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xgr3Ne6hNk">We Be Three Poor Mariners</a> appear to be the same ones originally released in the sea shanty compilation album released around the time of Black Flag's original 2014 release.</p>
<p>Their appearance on this Ubisoft channel doesn't just appear to be part of a regular cycle of randomly reuploading older material either - the other recent soundtrack excerpts uploaded there have all been timed up to mirror the release of new stuff by the publishers. For example, a lot of the most recent tunes prior to this Black flag deluge are from December's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> DLC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-mirages-allegedly-saudi-backed-dlc-valley-of-memory-releases-november-18">Valley of Memory expansion</a> from November.</p><p>So, while my personal favourite Black Flag sailing song The Worst Old Ship sadly isn't among these reuploaded shanties, they certainly look like another in the litany of Remake signs that even any vessels whose lookout desperately needs new spectacles have spotted by now.</p>
<p>Relatively recent reporting's alleged that said Remake, or Resync if the PEGI rathing has is name correct, is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">set to arrive in March</a>. So, these tunes may be intended as something to help folks pass time while waiting out the last couple of months patrolling a deserted dock.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new rumor has emerged online suggesting that Fortnite may be collaborating with Minecraft.</p>



<p>Fortnite is a major player in the realm of collaborations within the gaming industry, partnering not only with various media franchises but also with different games. In the past, we have seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-rare-fortnite-skins-that-need-to-return-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters from iconic games</a> such as God of War, Halo, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and more appear in Fortnite. Now, it appears the devs may be collaborating with one of the largest games of all time, Minecraft.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-minecraft-seemingly-in-early-development">Fortnite x Minecraft Seemingly in Early Development </h2>



<p>The information about Fortnite’s Minecraft being in early development comes from <a href="https://x.com/AdiraFNInfo/status/2011541834959671372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> user (formerly Twitter) AdiraFNInfo, which was reposted by reliable Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2011542845010952494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>. However, HYPEX’s post has the word ‘rumored’ in it, which means that they haven’t been able to confirm whether this is indeed true. At the same time, if this is true, it could go down in the books as one of the biggest Fortnite collaborations of all time. </p>



<p>Fortnite has definitely levelled up their collaborations game over time, from just introducing skins, to introducing mythics and special abilities, and now designing their Island inspired by the collab. If Minecraft gets a similar treatment, we might see the Island adopt Minecraft’s unique art style. We could also see skins like Steve and other items make it into the game. However, this is just speculation, and readers should take this information with a massive grain of salt. </p>







<p>In other news, another claim states that Fortnite could be collaborating with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-office-x-fortnite-collaboration-could-be-coming-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a>. Additionally, here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch notes</a> for the January 9 39.20 update.

            <p>Earth Must Die, the new game by Dan Marshall's Size Five Game, has just been given a 27th January release date and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639780/Earth_Must_Die/">a Steam demo</a>.</p>
<p>Earth Must Die is the comedian-packed, point-and-click-style space comedy in which you play as the villain - a Ming the Merciless-style tyrant called VValak Lizardtongue - and where you have to decide "how much of a dick you're going to be". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/earth-must-die-is-a-comedian-packed-point-and-click-in-which-you-decide-how-much-of-a-dick-you-want-to-be">Those are the words of Dan Marshall</a>, by the way, who I talked to about the game when it was announced last year.</p>

<p>Like many of Size Five Games, it plays in the classic point-and-click, adventure game way, but also like Marshall's previous games, there's a twist. In this case, it's a point-and-click game without an inventory and in which the main character doesn't want to pick anything up, because he thinks it's beneath him.</p><p>Arguably the most eye-catching feature of Earth Must Die, though, besides the bright cartoon artwork, is the list of actors voicing the game. Leading it are Joel Fry (Hizdahr in Game of Thrones, if you watched it), Ben Starr, Martha Howe-Douglas (co-creator of Ghosts), Alex Horne (Taskmaster), Mike Wozniak (Man Down, Taskmaster, Three Bean Salad podcast), Don Warrington (Rising Damp!), Matthew Holness (Garth Marenghi's Darkplace), Tamsin Greig (Black Books, Green Wing!), and Stevie Martin, Julie Nolke, Sophie Duker, Emma Fryer, Alasdair Beckett-King, Rosie Holt, Jon Blyth, Sam O'Leary, Tom Lawrinson, Sally Beaumont, David Montieth and Inel Tomlinson. See what I mean?</p>
<p>If that wasn't enough of a recommendation, consider Size Five Games' previous work: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lair-of-the-clockwork-god-review-platform-meets-adventure-with-hilarious-consequences">Lair of the Clockwork God, a relentlessly hilarious point-and-click game merged with a platformer</a> that I'm still sore I didn't give five stars to instead of four. "Bottomless wit and some inspired design choices make this genre mash-up a joy to play," I wrote at the time (2020).</p>
<p>Publisher No More Robots added during the release date announcement that Earth Must Die will be roughly an eight-hour game.</p>

			<p>Much has been said about the underwhelming <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> PC performance ever since <strong>CAPCOM</strong> launched the game nearly a year ago.</p>



<p>Mere days after the release, renowned modder <strong>Praydog</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-addresses-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a new version of his <strong>REFramework</strong></a> to improve certain stuttering instances caused by the game's anti-tampering technology. In April 2025, a texture decompressor tool <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-tool-improves-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released</a> to minimize the stuttering caused by the real-time in-game decompression process.</p>



<p>The developer also worked to improve the Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance. One step was the addition of <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong> and <strong>AMD FSR 4</strong> support, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were introduced with <strong>Title Update 2</strong> in late June</a>. However, that wasn't nearly enough, and a few days later, Capcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-cancels-monster-hunter-wilds-lecture-amid-player-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to cancel</a> a technical lecture it was scheduled to hold at the Computer Entertainment Developers Conference 2025 (<strong>CEDEC</strong>) event in Japan due to harassment from players.</p>



<p>The recent <strong>Title Update 4</strong> introduced <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over a hundred additional performance improvements</a></strong>, which finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemed to address most of the remaining critical issues</a>. Still, there was at least one big issue left: the game <strong>apparently constantly checks whether you own every piece of released DLC, and for each DLC that you do not own, the performance gets worse</strong>.</p>



<p>Reddit User De Tylmarande, who already spotted a fairly similar oversight in CAPCOM's Dragon's Dogma 2 that the developer later patched, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered this phenomenon</a> through testing two Steam accounts on identical hardware:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Account 1:</strong> Base game only with severe FPS drops (20-25 FPS in hubs)</li>



<li><strong>Account 2:</strong> All DLC installed with smooth performance (80+ FPS)</li>
</ul>



<p>Every variable was controlled (character appearance, location, time of day, graphics settings, drivers). The only difference was DLC ownership, and the issue was consistently replicated. Switching between accounts consistently replicated the issue. De Tylmarande then created a small "mod" that <strong>tricked the game into recognizing all DLC as owned (without actually unlocking anything)</strong>, and the Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance <strong>skyrocketed immediately</strong>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MH Wilds DLC Presence Check Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uf5cICpDXX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Needless to say, it is a bit baffling that a modder had to discover this nearly a full year after a game (and a triple-A one, no less) had launched. De Tylmarande added that <strong>Digital Foundry</strong> had reached out and would conduct their own analysis, so we can likely expect more insights soon. However, the video above already appears convincing enough.</p>

            <p>A new job listing posted by MMO developer ArenaNet has reignited hopes about Guild Wars 3 being in development.</p>
<p><a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/arenanet/jobs/7536965">The listing</a>, advertising a role for a senior writer / narrative designer, explicitly states this new employee would be working on an unannounced project,  though one aspect of the role would be editing: "the narrative of Guild Wars". This, alongside a stated desire for applicants with experience working on MMO and a familiarity with MMO narratives, has many Guild Wars fans excited.</p>
<p>It is true too that the existence of Guild Wars 3 has been whispered about for some time. Last year, <a href="https://www.mmorpg.com/news/guild-wars-3-confirmed-to-be-in-development-though-it-seems-its-still-in-its-early-stages-updated-2000130976">the game was mentioned explicitly in an NCSoft Shareholders meeting as an 'in-development project'</a>. At the time, ArenaNet stated: "the team's focus is on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a> development".</p>

<p>The job listing also requests a familiarity with Unreal Engine 5, indicating that the proprietary engine used in Guild Wars 2 (and the original Guild Wars) may be left by the wayside for this new ArenaNet project.</p>
<p>There has been some increased murmuring around Guild Wars as of late. Not only have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29720/Guild_Wars_Reforged/">Guild Wars: Reforged</a> and Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity been released recently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpm2fBvrAbw">but an extensive documentary about Guild Wars</a> was created at the tail end of 2025 to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary.</p><p>It's true that the MMORPG space is in a bit of a weird spot right now, with older MMORPGs seeing a resurgence as new releases fail to entice genre fans. Guild Wars 2 itself has benefited from this, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1284210/charts/">seeing an all-time-peak of Steam players only two months ago</a>. Meanwhile the future of new MMORPGs looks somewhat sparse, save for whatever ArenaNet is working on and Riot Games' own MMO project.</p>

            <p>Amazon's live action God of War series has found its Kratos, and it's a name you may already recognise from the franchise.</p>
<p>Ryan Hurst has been cast as Kratos in the upcoming show from Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios. Along with his live action credits, which include as Gerry Bertier in Remember the Titans and Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy, Hurst also portrayed Thor in 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, for which he scored himself a BAFTA nomination.</p>

<p>Sharing the news of Hurst's casting, game developer <a href="https://x.com/SonySantaMonica/status/2011529734682010108">Sony Santa Monica said</a>: "We're excited to see his take on Kratos as he joins the legendary ranks of T.C. Carson and Christopher Judge who have each shaped this character in unforgettable ways."</p>
<p>Speaking of Judge - who played Kratos in God of War 2018 and its sequel - the actor also sent his congratulations to Hurst. "You're gonna be great… BOI !!!" he <a href="https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/2011575459436454176">wrote on social media</a>, with an accompanying heart emoji. Of course, Judge's booming call to Kratos' son Atreus with a simple "Boy!" is one of God of War's most memorable lines.</p><p>As for the series, it will follow the path of Santa Monica's most recent Norse-based God of War games. "God of War follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human," <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/ryan-hurst-tapped-to-play-kratos-in-prime-videos-i">reads the show's official logline</a>.</p>

<p>Last month, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes of the upcoming God of War series</a>. Toye's works include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-is-now-an-emmy-winning-series">Amazon's acclaimed Fallout series</a>, and The Walking Dead. Meanwhile, in 2023, Toye won the Emmy for outstanding directing for a drama series for his work on Shōgun's ninth episode, Crimson Sky.</p>
<p>The director joined showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore on the upcoming series. Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of 2024</a>, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>.</p>
<p>We still don't have a release window for the first season, however a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>. Now I just wonder who will play Atreus…</p>

			<p>The giant inflatable multi-coloured spider demon looms towards us. My co-op partner and I unleash a barrage of bubbles towards the beast, each bubble affixing to the ball-like structure of the creature, distorting it into a misshapen nightmare version of Bertie Bassett. Once three coloured bubble balls meet, in a match-3 style, they burst, leaving our opponent missing several legs and spasming on the ground. Akin to a daddy-long-legs that just fell afoul of a particularly vindictive three-year-old. With a final whimper, the boss explodes in a brightly coloured eruption. This is totally bonkers. This is Popucom.</p>

<p>A third-person puzzle shooter, Popucom is intended to be played with a buddy in split-screen co-op. There’s a plot, but it amounts to little more than establishing the mission of rescuing dozens of little fried egg looking aliens. To do this, the players must navigate linear levels cram-packed with rather ingenious puzzles and colour coded bad guys made up of a load of balls.</p>


<p>With a series of bizarre inventions – including a drone flown by a kitten, force shields, teleportation devices and the ability to transform into a Nintendo-lawyer baiting Samus Aran ball – the two of you must work with something resembling synchronicity to overcome countless physics-based traps. Proceedings are tremendous fun, and all constructed around the simple premise of each player being able to switch between two colour types, and every interactable object or enemy to shoot being one of those corresponding four colours.</p>


<p>One moment, you’ll be in a purple colour configuration, walking along a purple path, holding aloft your force shield with your partner stood on top. They, in turn, are using their blue force shield to deflect blue laser beams, before switching to yellow mode to blast some yellow light-sabre wielding minion-looking dude. Suddenly, both the path and the laser beams change colour, and you and your buddy must quickly switch roles to prevent death by touching the wrong colour. It’s frenetic, furious, and often demanding, yet oh-so satisfying when you finally manage to clear a challenge that’s take several attempts.</p>
<p>The game starts off simple enough, but through the twelve hours of content, the difficulty soon rockets up, demanding swift reactions and expert off-screen communication to beat later levels. Thankfully, frustration is mostly alleviated by frequent and smartly placed checkpoints, though there will be some teeth-gnashing when a handful of particularly nasty challenges respawn you too far back, forcing you to get through a particularly tricky bit just to have another go at the trap that killed you.</p>

<p>Collision detection can be occasionally poor, with players slipping from a platform even though they just successfully made that tricky final leap. Indeed, jumping in general feels a little woolly, often failing to provide the responsiveness the game demands. Still, with numerous accessibility options to tweak, including activating temporary invulnerability and granting auto-aim, this is perfect family gaming, and something people of varying gaming abilities can enjoy.</p>
<p>Other than some notable frame rate drops when things get busy on screen, this is bright, bold, over-the-top brilliance. The sort of sunny fun that will effortlessly pass a rainy Sunday afternoon or two.</p>
