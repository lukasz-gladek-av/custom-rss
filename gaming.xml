			<p>Fallout: London has received a massive patch from Team FOLON, which includes hundreds of changes/fixes to enhance the overall game experience.</p>
<p>With an overwhelmingly positive community response seen by Team FOLON following the release of Fallout: London (which has been redeemed almost a million times), the developers are now saying that the newest Patch, 1.02, has significantly improved the mod. Interestingly, Team FOLON did tease about how they are working on a massive patch and were said to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-londons-next-patch-said-to-bring-huge-improvements-team-folon-drafted-extra-help-for-mod/">bring in "extra workforce"</a> to ensure that the execution is optimal this time.</p>
<p>While the patch covers several areas of problems, the primary focus was to improve the visual experience. Hence, more significant changes were performance optimization, mesh fixes, and even the implementation of collision measures to avoid inconsistent game crashes during specific scenarios. It surely is a huge update; hence, here is the changelog below, mentioning all the major improvements made by Team FOLON:</p>
<p><em><strong>Major Fixes:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unexpected broken LOD clip volumes have now been identified and removed across the board:</em><br>
<em>This should fix save corruption/save file issues in Islington world, Dump world, IWM World and St pauls world. </em><em>This requires a rework of the LOD in these worldspace. (Check 3D Section for more information)</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Previsbine (PRP) regeneration:</em><br>
<em>Previs and Precombines have been regenerated for the project. Requires further testing on completion. </em><em>This should fix various random/repeatable crashes and previsibility issues (Culling issues, Check 3D Section for more information)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There were also many other fixes for 3D art and animation in Fallout: London, such as:</p>
<p><strong><em>Over one hundred mesh fixes:</em></strong><br>
<em>Various improvements to meshes to increase performance and fix precombine crashes</em><br>
<em>Various collision meshes fixed both to improve gameplay and fix potential crashes</em><br>
<em>LOD Updates:</em><br>
<em>Identified and fixed all missing LOD materials for material swaps across all worldspaces - (Implementation still happening)</em><br>
<em>New/Missing LOD textures and materials generated</em><br>
<em>Mushroom meshes optimized for LOD</em><br>
<em>Weeping willow trees improved</em><br>
<em>Regeneration of LOD with much higher detail texture atlas (This will increase the size of the LOD files but improve visual quality and performance)</em><br>
<em>A massive rework of the "Mega meshes" is happening (These are the large meshes used to display a separate worldspaces LOD, which may be causing dump load crashes)</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout: London - Official Patch 1.02 Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANhbGzvUVnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Several other quest-related changes were made, including "tiny" fixes that aren't worth mentioning here, but it is safe to say that Patch 1.02 marks a significant milestone for Fallout: London.</p>

            <p>The team behind "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> meets Skyrim" viral hit Hawthorn are "developing this game from [their] personal pockets".</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-rpg-hawthorn-looks-like-stardew-valley-and-skyrim-had-an-adorable-baby-together">we reported</a> that several former developers from studios such as Bethesda, BioWare and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> had banded together to develop the delightful-looking Hawthorn, which you can check out below:</p>

<p>Despite popping up on <em>thousands</em> of wishlists, however, Near Studios co-founder and CEO, Heather Cerlan, has revealed that despite the fervent interest its game has sparked, the dozen or so developers responsible for bringing Hawthorn to life are still not getting paid as the studio has no funding.</p>
<p>"The fact that we are developing this game from our personal pockets was completely lost," Cerlan told to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-18/viral-new-indie-video-game-hawthorn-has-a-tragic-backstory?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a>. "We have the ambitions and the visions; we don’t however have the funding yet."</p>
<p>Near Studios was founded in 2022 but following a desperate family tragedy, Cerlan's plans were derailed and the team lost two of its original co-founders - one "because of a disagreement in direction; the other because he couldn’t get out of a previous contract". She then got in touch with former Bethesda coworker Jason Richardson, who "had been envisaging Hawthorn for many years".</p><p>This delay, however, meant the team was looking for financial backing when independent games funding had all but dried up. But although Cerlan said she tried - and failed - to secure funding for the project throughout most of 2024, the team remains "pretty determined to get this to market one way or another". If funding cannot be found, Cerlan said the studio is considering a KickStarter campaign.</p>
<p>"I had a general idea for a game, but it was never about the game," Cerlan said. "It was about building a culture, building a team I was excited about essentially retiring at.</p>
<p>"Now we're focusing on the game and the community. Our hope is everything else will come."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a tweet posted earlier today on the game's official X/Twitter account, Game Science thanked players for their patience, and said that now Black Myth Wukong's master disc is "ready", "the PS5 physical editions" were coming soon.</p>

<p>If you were hoping for a solid commitment or release date, I'm afraid Game Science stopped short of giving any specific dates, only committing to a vague statement that the physical game would be available "very soon".</p>
<p>"Destined Ones, thank you for your patience!" the team said. "With the master disc for Black Myth Wukong ready, the PS5 physical edition will be available to you very soon."</p> <div>

<p>There's still no word about an Xbox version, however. Last month, Microsoft once again confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delay to the Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">not due to "platform limitations"</a>, but even though Game Science's action-RPG was released in August on PC and PS5, the Xbox version is still delayed for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>Speculation grew the developer was struggling to run the game on the Series S console, while other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">rumours suggested the game was in fact a PlayStation console exclusive</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As your typical non-manga-reading, mainstream-anime-watching child of Toonami, I drew a line in the sand a few episodes into <em>Dragon Ball Super </em>when I first gave it a chance. I wasn’t going to continue watching because its earliest episodes didn’t feel like the action anime I’d grown up with. Likewise, before <em>Sparking! Zero</em>, I hadn’t played any Dragon Ball video games since <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 3 </em>because none of the titles released in between lived up to what I considered the IP’s quintessential fighting games. </p><p>Luckily, time is a flat circle in a culture hopped up on nostalgia, and today, I have a new <em>Tenkaichi</em> game in my life. But with the benefit of maturity and hindsight, I’m wondering how much good shit I’ve missed out on by being too loyal to the anime and fighting games of my childhood. Will this growth and clarity compel me to finally play <em>Kakorot</em> or <em>FighterZ</em>?

<p>"Last year we announced that Squadron 42 is feature complete, so what's the team been doing since?" CEO Chris Roberts said.</p>
<p>"Given the scale and ambition of Squadron, our teams have been focused on polishing and optimising to ensure the game meets all the high standards that I have, the team has, and <em>you</em> guys have."</p>
<p>Roberts also revealed that the story will take "anywhere" from 30 to 40 hours to complete, and confirmed he was "confident" it would be released sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>Squadron 42 boasts a stellar <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5194726/fullcredits/">cast</a> that includes Mark Hamill, Gary Oldman, Gillian Anderson, Henry Cavill, Liam Cunningham, Andy Serkis, Mark Strong, Ben Mendelson, and Sophie Wu, amongst others.</p>
<p>The single-player, story-based Squadron 42 was announced way back in 2014, but has been delayed multiple times.</p>
<p>If you fancy seeing for yourself why Star Citizen has raised an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-but-has-raised-over-700m">astonishing $700m in crowdfunding</a>, <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/star-citizen">sign up now</a> to get the CitizenCon 2954 "exclusive starter pack", available from now until 31st October.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-developer-ordered-to-pay-27k-to-disabled-worker-in-return-to-office-discrimination-claim">Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) was ordered to pay more than £27k to a disabled former employee</a> who brought a discrimination claim against the company.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>Coming into Europa, I had no idea what to expect. Indeed, before I mentioned in a chat with other Wccftech folks how I like to cover indies, and I was going to look for one to give a bit of coverage, Europa wasn't even on my longest distance of radars. Unlike the Europa around Jupiter, the Hubble Telescope would have had little chance of picking this up. It would have been a shame, too, because you can tell the passion of developers Novadust Entertainment.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Europa is inspired by Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's aesthetically and thematically, which certainly works in the game's favour. This is, without any doubt, a gorgeous game; the environments are splendid to look at, and the art style is similar to that of a watercolour painting. Adding to this is a strong soundtrack, understated when it needs to be and picking up at other moments. For the most part, it complements the game perfectly,&nbsp; with only a few moments when a track draws too much attention to itself (even if the music itself is excellent).</p>
<p>In keeping with the Ghibli theme, Europa's story could be out of a Ghibli movie. I think it would make a better Ghibli movie than a game, if I were honest. Without giving any spoilers away, you are Zee, live on Europa, and are on your way to a giant floating island where the settlers who came from Earth are. What you're doing there, I won't spoil it for you. Why you're going, and the path you're taking is a spoiler.</p>
<p>Well, that, and I'm not entirely sure I understand it. The story is vague, and the ending is wide enough open to fit a whole dreadnought through. The overarching theme is about humanity and not wrecking our environment. Even if we got to Europa or another planet, we would likely only end up wrecking the place like we have Earth.</p>
<p>This is quite hands-off, through quick text and dialogue when you pick up diary pieces. Some questions will naturally flag up as you get to understand a little more of the world. You may wonder why, when attacked by one of the mechanical beasts of the game (the gardeners), it doesn't kill you - and why some of them are simply friendly. You will most certainly wonder what the ending means. I'm not sure if there's a special ending if you collect all 40 gems, but there's a reason I won't find out. Still, I'm not looking to spoil any more of the story. It isn't bad, but a little too vague.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Now, let's get to gameplay. This is where I find Europa has missed its mark a little. The biggest issue of the game is that there is no failure state. The only way you lose is when you're stun-locked by an enemy; you get annoyed enough to throw something at your PC or console and break it. One could say that it is masterful storytelling on the futility of anger, and actions taken out of anger will inevitably only harm the person taking it. One could say that if they weren't talking out of their arse.</p>
<p>So yes, there is no failure state. If you fall off a ledge, you pop back. Take fifty bombs and energy blasts to the face, put a few stars around your head, and walk slowly. You're flying through the sky and hit a mine. There's no problem here; keep flying. The decision genuinely took me out of the game and made a few points tedious rather than engaging. I don't think every game needs combat, and this certainly doesn't need combat - it's part of the theme - but when it gets to the point you can quite literally put the controller down and it's playing itself because there are no consequences, I'm going to do just that.</p>
<p>The same goes with the stun-lock enemies. There was no worry of them hitting me because I couldn't lose or be sent back. The only feeling was annoyance because you could get stun-locked into oblivion with more than one around, slowly trudging to a bit of cover. The only time I ended up going back to Europa wasn't through damage; it's because in one part where the only choice is meant to be "walk forward", I walked backwards and fell through the floor.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>If there is one other sin Europa commits, it takes away your jetpack (It's called something else, but it's a jetpack, so I'm calling it that). I'm sorry, but when you give me a jetpack and some of the most gorgeous vistas I've seen in at least twenty minutes, I want to fly around them. Even though I knew there was nothing to do - not a criticism, sometimes just exploring a lovely painting is enough - I was looking around. There are 40 gems to collect around the game levels, and you can also collect other gems which increase your jetpack's fuel.</p>
<p>Far too often, Europa has flying fish that zap your fuel. Or you'll get to the determined "you must do some platforming" or "here's a simple puzzle" section, and boom - pink crystals or force fields zap your fuel. The fish are the worst because they're often in an area where you can refuel if you trudge for around twenty seconds. It never added challenge, it just annoyed. It's particularly annoying because going around on the jetpack was <em>fun</em>. I smiled, simply flopping around, aiming for the little blue circles to refuel mid-flight and taking in gorgeous sights while hunting for the few collectables and exploring every cranny to ensure I hadn't missed something.</p>
<p>When the fish and crystals stopped this, and the annoying stun-locking started, I decided, "No, I'm not exploring any more; it's time just to finish the game", and I started just pushing through levels, start to finish. Maybe there's a secret ending if I collect all 40 gems, but the annoyances later mean I don't care. I can't help but think I would have adored this if they had toned that back just a little so it didn't kill the exploratory, harm-free game they put forward.</p>
<p>What makes it more annoying is that the puzzles and platforming it kills your jetpack for are basic at best and, due to the lack of failure state, offer nothing to the game. I don't feel like I need to solve them; they're just something put in my way to grind the fun and story to a halt. There's no real narrative explanation either, unlike the blast monsters.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>There's something almost meditative about the best parts of Europa. It's reminiscent of Flower, which concerns me when I realise I bought it on the PlayStation 3 fifteen years ago. I'm getting old. Though yes, the style of movement with your jetpack, the gorgeous vistas, and the way the story is told against what is an idyllic backdrop, Europa has a lot to offer and a lot to say about itself. Still, I don't doubt some flow-destroying missteps will irritate others as they have me.</p>
<p><em>PC version reviewed. Copy provided by the publisher.</em></p>

					
					

<p>Europa looks to offer a meditative experience, as you explore gorgeous vistas backed up by an outstanding soundtrack, and it can offer this, only it is piecemeal. Far too often it trips itself up by killing the traversal and exploration, and throwing things at you that are never challenging, and only annoying, </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Gorgeous visuals and soundtrack.

			<p>At CitizenCon 2024, Cloud Imperium Games has shared a new hour-long gameplay demo of Squadron 42, the story based single player game set in Star Citizen's universe. They also finally announced the release window: 2026. This gives credence to <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-expose-paints-a-fairly-bleak-picture-theres-no-actual-focus-on-getting-the-game-done/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henderson's repor</a>t, which mentioned the game only reached feature complete status recently, as opposed to the developer's claim <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in October 2023</a>.</p>

<p>The presentation wasn't without issues between crashes and frame drops, making it clear why CIG still needs a couple of years before releasing Squadron 42. On the CitizenCon stage, Chris Roberts shared an estimate on the campaign's length: between thirty and forty hours.</p>
<p>In the narrative, players will step into the shoes of a rookie pilot of the UEE (United Empire of Earth) who gets assigned to the Navy's notorious 42nd Squadron. The plot begins in 2945, with the Vanduul raid on Vega II.</p>

The demo was heavy on flashy cutscenes with CGI representations of Hollywood stars such as Gillian Anderson, Henry Cavill, Gary Oldman, and Mark Strong, mixed with on-rails turret action in a huge space battle. The demo ended with a first-person shooter segment as the alien enemy boarded the player’s ship.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/19/screenshot-2024-10-19-193434-1729363460625.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Chris Roberts on-stage at CitizenCon.

But there’s a lot more in the game than we were just showing there. It’s also been a lot more stable for me when I’ve been playing these last few weeks.”</p><p>Roberts continued: “As I said at the start, we have 30 to 40 hours of gameplay. We feel confident we can bring the quality of the game up to the level we've just shown and more, without crashes. Both the team and I are confident of giving you this game in 2026.

<p>The Call of Duty League is shaping up for another season, and like every year, the buzz is now around where the major tournaments will be held. In a string of posts on social media, it was claimed that the first tournament – a CDL Major – will take place in Barcelona in early February, marking the first time in many years that a Call of Duty League Major has been held in a European city.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-in-barca">Black Ops in Barca</h2>



<p>It was claimed by <a href="https://x.com/_TheRotation/status/1847706695600066729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Rotation on Twitter</a> that the CDL’s 2025 season, which will be played out on Black Ops 6, will kick off in Barcelona. This will be the site of Major I, and as the year unravels, we’ll see other Major tournaments take place in Toronto, Miami, and Dallas.</p>



<p>It was also claimed that there will be a fifth Major in 2025, potentially being hosted in Chicago.</p>



<p>There’s no indication of where 2025’s COD Champs tournament will be held.</p>



<p>This year’s Call of Duty League only had four Majors and was wrapped up by late July, leaving a gulf of a gap between that season and the next. If Major I doesn’t occur until early February, it’ll be a whopping six months between seasons, which is one of the immense sticking points with the Call of Duty competitive community.</p>



<p>The CDL returning to Europe for a Major is a monumental thing, though. Barcelona is a strange spot, but many fans will be overjoyed to see it returning to the EU region after several years of being ‘locked out’ of the CDL action. I for one will be on site reporting everything as it unfolds, if that’s the case.</p>



<p>What are your expectations for the CDL 2025 season? Do you hope we get a Major tournament in Europe? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Squadron 42 has received a 2026 release date at this year’s Citizencon and has been confirmed to have 30-40 hours of gameplay.</p>



<p>The announcement came following a demo of Squadron 42 at Citizencon, which showcased the game’s first chapter in spectacular fashion, featuring a prologue of a space battle that introduces players to the universe.</p>



<p>The demo wasn’t without its hiccups, though. Two game crashes occurred throughout the presentation, played live on stage. The second crash was comically blamed on the computer rather than the game’s unstable nature.</p>



<p>After the demo presentation, Chris Roberts went on stage to reiterate that the game has approximately 30-40 hours of gameplay and that the team is “confident” in its 2026 release window. </p>



<p>It’s no secret that Cloud Imperium Games tends to miss its scheduled release dates, so whether they can stick to that release date remains to be seen. Earlier this week, Insider Gaming reported some of the issues that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Imperium Games has faced with its development timelines</a>. </p>



<p><span>Squadron </span>42 was announced on October 10th, 2012, together with&nbsp;Star Citizen&nbsp;and the launch of its crowdfunding campaign. According to its <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, Squadron 42 and Star Citizen have raised $729 million as of this writing.</p>

			<p>Black Myth: Wukong has been a huge success, and those who had access to a PlayStation 5 or PC were able to play the hit game. In previous reports, Black Myth: Wukong was known as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoos-august-2024-report-reveals-black-myth-wukong-top-grossing-game-across-six-markets/">top-grossing game across six markets</a> and is set to be getting a DLC, which is slated for early 2025. However, a <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40203/black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rating on ESRB</a> has appeared for the Xbox version of the game. Of course, this isn't an absolute confirmation that the game will be coming to Xbox soon, but it's a pretty good sign.</p>
<p>The ESRB is the rating board in North America, and thus far, there haven't been any ratings from other regulatory bodies, such as Europe's PEGI rating board. It isn't a secret that Black Myth: Wukong was going to be released on Xbox. When the game was showcased at Summer Game Fest 2024, it was announced by the developers that there would be a delay for the Xbox Series X|S version of the game. With that announcement came a lot of speculation about whether or not the game was a console exclusive to PlayStation, but it was then confirmed that the reason there was<a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delay-has-nothing-to-do-with-xbox-limitations-says-microsoft/"> a delay</a> was because there was a memory leak. The information given to the audience about why the delays were happening was quite vague, with Microsoft declining to provide much information about the situation.</p>
<p>With the rating by the ESRB, it's possible that the Xbox port of Black Myth: Wukong is closer than the audience originally thought. The title is already incredibly successful, with the game selling over 18 million units. By releasing the game on another platform and allowing more players to access it, it has the potential to sell a couple million more copies. It's unlikely it'll sell the amount it's currently sold on PlayStation and PC, as Xbox seems to be the less commonly chosen platform. However, if the game is opened up to players via Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, the game has the potential to get a second resurgence when it releases on Xbox.</p>
<p>For now, we will have to wait and see if the developers announce the upcoming release of Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X|S or if it was a false alarm. It's possible that we'll see the PEGI rating board also rate the game if its to be released on Xbox soon.</p>
<p>Do you think the game will be released on Xbox this year? Let us know in the comments!</p>
