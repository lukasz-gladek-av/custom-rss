                <p>Thanksgiving isn't traditionally the time for receiving gifts, but that's not stopping Digital Extremes from doing a giveaway of its own. The developer behind Warframe is offering its 2008 third-person shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-sector-review/1900-6188387/" data-ref-id="1900-6188387">Dark Sector</a> for free, but you only have until November 30 to claim it.</p><p>Digital Extremes shared the announcement on X, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dark Sector's page on Steam</a> where the game is temporarily yours for the taking.</p><p>Digital Extremes credits Dark Sector for inspiring Warframe, and the game was initially released on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The story puts players in control of covert operative Hayden Tenno as he embarks on a mission behind enemy lines in the Eastern European nation of Lasria. He'll soon discover that there's a deadly secret that leaves him infected by a bio-weapon called the Technocyte Virus.</p><p>Ordinarily, the Technocyte virus turns its victims into mindless killing machines. Hayden avoided that fate--for now at least--and he's been left with superhuman abilities that may give him the edge if he wants to make it out of Lasria alive.</p><p>During the summer, Digital Extremes offered up a preview for Warframe's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-1999-looks-like-the-party-of-a-lifetime/1100-6526024/" data-ref-id="1100-6526024">Warframe: 1999</a>. The story thrusts players on an alternate Earth, and it looks very intriguing so far.

Post written by Jordan Mallory.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While designing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Brode and his team faced the interesting challenge of making a game simple enough for an extremely wide audience to vibe with, while still somehow giving themselves enough design space to introduce new cards and mechanics regularly over the course of several years. Solving these problems first required a concrete understanding of what the core game is, and to obtain that, the team had to experiment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Becoming an expert in the game you are designing">Becoming an expert in the game you are designing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Part of the process is becoming an expert in your game, right?" Brode says. "When we first started out, I didn't know the right number of cards per location, the right number of locations, the right number of turns for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the right number of energy to start with. We tried seven turns and five turns, and starting on turn two and nine cards per location and four cards per location, three cards per location and two cards per location, and infinite cards per location. We tried everything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Brode continues, these variables coalesce into the foundation of the product, and once that's all settled, you can go about the business of actually designing cards. But how much viable content can your new game actually support?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You need to actually make sure you can make a bunch of stuff," Brode says. "Like if your goal was 'Hey, let's make Tic Tac Toe a live service game,' and we're gonna add cards you can play before every turn of Tic Tac Toe … there's a couple designs that may be kind of interesting and not broken but not that many."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For this hypothetical, Brode would ideally design out a year's worth of content just to see if the idea had legs. "Even if you don't end up shipping any of those cards, you're like, 'Oh my God, I've used all the design space, Tic Tac Toe is too simplistic. I just can't come up with another 500 of these for the next 10 years.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Second Dinner is sitting at the Godot table">Second Dinner is sitting at the Godot table</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant also speaks with Brode about Second Dinner's embrace of Godot for another project that's already in development. The engine has grown leaps and bounds over the last few years, Brode says, thanks in-part to its open source nature and the responsive folk shepherding the project. And for his team specifically, Godot offers tremendous value in its ability to issue over-the-air updates for "literally anything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because we're writing the whole game in [GDScript] … this means if we wanted to do something like launch on a platform that is maybe notoriously difficult to get new content and new features shipped live to players quickly, well, we can just do that over the air without having to go through an approvals pipeline for [a] AAA platform," says Brode. "That could take a long time and we just don't have to do that. We can just quickly get stuff to players in a day or something. That's really mega, especially for a live service project."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Listen to the rest of our really mega conversation on your podcast platform of choice, and might we be so bold as to suggest adding </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gdconf.com/">GDC 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to your March to-do list for more valuable insights from leading developers?</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

            <p>Let's face it, nothing important happens in December. I'm scheduling 24 advent calendar posts this week and then spending the rest of the year eating boxes of Cadbury Mini Yule Logs Triple Chocolate. So it's no surprise that Devolver have announced their remaining slate of games aiming for release in 2024 are actually coming out in 2025.
</p>
<p>The games that slipped are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, and Stick It To The Stickman. Devolver released the news with typical style, via the 15th annual Devolver Delayed awards, which you can watch below.

<p>I enjoyed the in memoriam section for games that released this year which can therefore no longer be delayed, all of which are currently available at a discount via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/DevolverDigital/sale/autumnsale2024">Devolver's autumn sale on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Baby Steps is the pick of the Delayed Three that I'm most looking forward to. It's a literal walking simulator from Bennett Foddy and the makers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ape-out">Ape Out</a> in which you pilot limbs individually to steer your pyjama-clad protagonist up a mountain, like a marriage between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/qwop">QWOP</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>, and whichever third-person game with a mountain you care to choose from. Skyrim? Jusant? I bet God Of War's got a mud-soaked hill in it somewhere.
</p><p>Skate Story is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater if Tony Hawk was a demon made out of glass. Stick It To The Stickman is that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw4wzwYeZ0Y">Flash animation you watched 20 years ago</a> but with a physics simulation and made by the Broforce developers. I want to play both of these games, too.
</p>
<p>Check out the graphic design on these bad boys. The blurriness on the image of the mini roll isn't my camera, that's actually how it looks on the box.

                <p>Plague Inc. developer Ndemic just dropped a surprise sequel to the smash hit Plague Inc. Instead of a pessimistic pandemic simulator, the sequel is a sunny strategy game about rebuilding after the end of the world.</p><p>After Inc. is set in the aftermath of Plague Inc.'s zombie scenario. It tasks you with running human civilization in the United Kingdom after a zombie apocalypse. Unlike its predecessors, After Inc. has an optimistic hue. The aesthetic is colorful and painterly, in contrast to the harsh UI of Plague Inc. or the cold satellite-map style of Rebel Inc., a previous follow-up about combating insurgencies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4406661" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4406661"></a><figcaption>A screenshot of After Inc. showing off the game's bright, lush aesthetic and friendly UI.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png"></figure><p>In an interview with newsletter <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/after-inc-plague-inc-ndemic-pandemic" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, game designer James Vaughn said, “I've tried to make a more happy and optimistic game this time." In each session, you play as the leader of a settlement. You combat zombies, search for resources, navigate communal disputes, and research new tech. Playing through a scenario lasts around 20 minutes and will unlock meta upgrades that affect future settlements.</p><p>After Inc. costs $2, the same price as Rebel Inc. and $1 more than Plague Inc. The store page claims this is a "special sale price" to mark the game's launch. Ndemic promises "no 'consumable microtransactions,'" meaning any content you spend money on will last in the game forever. The app store page promises that it will be "updated for years to come."

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> didn't get off to the smoothest of starts, but eight years after its controversial launch, Hello Games' exploratory space sim has reached a significant milestone, finally gaining enough favourable player reviews on Steam to shift its overall rating to "Very Positive".
</p>
<p>
When No Man's Sky released back in August 2016, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-isnt-going-over-well-on-steam">player sentiment was such</a> that it quickly found itself damned with an "Overwhelming Negative" rating on Steam. It took two years and a number of significant updates for No Man's Sky to secure enough positive reviews that its average tipped over to "Mixed", and then a further three years after to that to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-five-years-no-mans-sky-has-finally-hit-mostly-positive-reviews-on-steam">reach an all-time user review average of "Mostly Positive"</a> in 2021.
</p>
<p>
As Hello Games' Tim Woodley explained at the time, "Each percentage point becomes exponentially harder to earn as you move up the ratings. Moving from 20 percent positive to 21 percent positive may only require a few hundred positive reviews whereas moving from 69 percent to 70 percent needed 10,000 positive reviews. This is why it's so rare for games to change their All-Time rating and why we'd assumed that we might never be able to."

<p>
Another three years - and a total of 35 free content updates - later, No Man's Sky has finally achieved the seemingly impossible, turning its initial "Overwhelmingly Negative" rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/">into "Very Positive"</a>. That means 80 percent of its 245,857 Steam reviews are positive - which is to says it's secured 196,686 blue thumbs up versus 49,171 red thumbs down. Addressing the milestone, studio boss Sean Murray <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1861859832187211963">wrote</a>, "Holy shit you guys - it happened. ALL REVIEWS: Very Positive. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You have no idea what this means to us."
</p><p>
No Man's Sky's next challenge, then, will be to nudge into the prestigious "Overwhelming Postive" category inhabited by the likes of Sekiro, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, Hades, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a>, the Silent Hill 2 remake, and Half-Life: Alyx. That's a significantly tougher goal, however, requiring 95 percent of life-time reviews to be positive. In other words, assuming No Man's Sky doesn't receive a single negative review from this point forward, it'll need a total of 983,420 positive reviews - or 786,734 more than it has now. By which point the <em>actual</em> universe might be 16 minutes away from obliteration.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, the shift to "Very Positive" is still an incredible achievement, and testament to the incredible work Hello Games has put into its space sim over the last eight years. No Man's Sky's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-rolling-out-cross-save-support-from-today-as-ps5-pro-enhancements-arrive">most recent update</a> released earlier this month, introducing cross-save support, PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements, and the return of Mass Effect's Normandy. It's the sixth major update this year, following on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-the-cursed-is-a-spooky-expedition-for-halloween-set-in-a-collapsing-reality">October's spooky The Cursed</a> (which, among other things, introduced flying saucer ships for players), while other 2024 additions have included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-reel-in-new-aquarius-fishing-update">fishing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-orbital-update-overhauls-space-stations-today">refreshed space stations</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">massive world generation overhaul</a>.
</p>
<p>
Up next for Hello Games is its procedural planet adventure Light No Fire, which we've not had an update on since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">last year's reveal</a>. Perhaps we'll finally see more during December's The Game Awards, but regardless, it sounds like No Man's Sky journey is far from over.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a> was the best grand strategy game I'd played in years, because it tossed out all the genre's micromanagement in favour of a strategy puzzle where all your exploiting, expanding, et ceteraing could be squeezed into an hour's play. That game began as a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pico-8">PICO-8</a> prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slipways-review">polished to a fine shine in its full release</a>.
</p>
<p>All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where "all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible." Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can play Solitomb in <a href="https://krajzeg.itch.io/solitomb">your browser for free right now</a>. 
</p>
<p>Hit the how-to-play button in-game to <a href="https://html-classic.itch.zone/html/12080108/tutorial/index.html">go to this webpage</a>, which is the basic tutorial. If you've played solitaire before, the very basics are familiar: there are stacks of cards spread at the top of the screen, with some facing upwards. After that just about everything else is different.
</p><p>The cards themselves represent either the different types of monster you can fight, or the attack, shield, and potions you can take into that fight. The number on each card represents its efficacy. You build stacks of up to five cards - any lower numbered card can be placed on top of another - and drag them into your hand to start the fight. The aim is to defeat a certain number of a certain kind of enemy or to clear a pathway forward in order to reach the next level of the dungeon.
</p>
<p>Which probably all sounds a little abstract, but makes sense almost as soon as you start playing. Want to defeat a beast of five strength? Pair it with a sword of five strength. Want to win the fight without taking damage? Add a shield of 4 strength and a potion of 1 or higher, and drag all four cards together into your hand. Now do this again and again to clear all the cards in front of you, making sure not to squader power on lesser battles, to run out of health, or to run out of attack cards altogether.
</p>
<p>There are umpteen other systems layered atop this basic combat math. The dungeon houses an impatient demon and if you make too many dragging and stacking moves before you trigger combat, you'll start to take damage. There are damage bonuses for combos, such as cards of the same suit, rank or consecutive ranks. You choose a character class before a run, with a passive buff and a special ability, and there's a between-level shop for purchasing new cards and upgrades. Later floors introduce new card types. Prototype or not, it already seems rich in strategic potential.
</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://krajzeg.itch.io/solitomb">the Solitomb page on Itch to give it a try</a>. Or if you never got around to trying Slipways, you can pick that for half price right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1264280/Slipways/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/">Digital Extremes</a> and Valve are currently giving away free copies of Dark Sector, the third-person title made by the Warframe devs. From today until November 30, PC games will be able to obtain this game for free by visiting the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam store page</a> for Dark Sector. This game is a third-person action shooter that was first released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2008 and then was ported to Steam in 2009. If you've been wanting to try this game out but weren't sure whether you want to spend money on it, this is a great time to get hold of it and add it to your backlog.</p>
<p>Dark Sector is a game that does have mixed reviews, mainly based on the visual design of the game. This game has been compared to Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War by critics. Themes that were seen in Dark Sector were also seen in Warframe. For example, the name Tenno is seen very frequently throughout Warframe, as that is the name of the faction that is controlled by players.</p>
<p>In this game, you play Hayden Tenno (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum), a man who works at the CIA. In this game, you witness Hayden go through a transformation, as he has been infected with the Technocyte Virus on his right arm, which then begins to take over his entire body. As a result of the Technocyte Virus, you see his psyche begin to deteriorate. However, he begins to gain superhuman powers, including the ability to grow a bladed glaive on his arm. With this glaive, he can throw it at his enemies with precision. As you progress through the game, you see Hayden begin to transform further, and his powers evolve, making him a deadly force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Dark Sector's main focus is a single-player campaign, but the game also features a multiplayer game mode. At the moment, it's uncertain whether the multiplayer game mode is still active, but due to the game being free on Steam for now, it's possible that the multiplayer game mode will still be active and available to play.</p>
<p>The Steam Autumn Sale is also on right now, which will provide many discounts for any games that may be on your wishlist.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Dark Sector?</p>

            <p>Announced last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-rally-championship">Exo Rally Championship</a> does what the name suggests: takes the rugged, weather-battered terrain of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-one">Exo One</a>'s interplanetary journey and replaces the ponderous plot and gravitational rise-and-fall spaceship movement with a six-wheel, space buggy rally competition. Or put another way, if Exo One was Christopher Nolan's Tiny Wings, then this is Colin McRae's Interstellar.
</p>
<p>Now there's a demo, and it's substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three "ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards."

<p>This is no rally game reskin, but takes full advantage of the setting. The landscapes you're speeding across are vast and unforgiving, crater-marked, littered with boulders, and battered by rain, lightning and meteors. It's only possible to make your way across them because your six-wheel-drive rover can catch considerable airtime on the low-gravity planets.
</p><p>Land too hard and you'll lose a wheel or other valuable part of your machine, however. That's where air jets come in, which let you shunt your buggy around in mid-air to correct your orientation or soften your touchdown. The tutorials take you through using them in different scenarios, and it's a lot to consider. Enough that it's simultaneously intimidating but exciting to see what dedicated players can wring from these physics.
</p>
<p>It's a stark contrast to what I wrote about in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exo-one-review-a-gorgeous-sci-fi-marble-run-that-lacks-pace-or-friction">Exo One review</a>, a game which I felt lacked friction after you'd got to grips with its comparatively simple controls. Exo Rally Championship seems to have friction in spades, and promises a rich simulation with the ability to tune your rover, the need to repair it, and with tire and fuel types to match to different planetary destinations in the full game.
</p>
<p>That full game is still "coming soon", but you can grab the demo now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2262020/Exo_Rally_Championship/">from Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We’ve witnessed a lot of turmoil surrounding the development of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, with delays and controversy marring the title before its release. Well, as it turns out, there may be a reason why the upcoming AC game is so controversial. It appears Assassin’s Creed Shadows is going to be the first game for a number of game developers at Ubisoft. While it’s common practice to bring in new talent regularly and keep the old-timers on their toes, it would seem much of the team behind Shadows is completely green behind the ears.</p>



<p>In an appearance at the External Development Summit 2024 (XDS24), Assassin’s Creed Executive Producer Marc-Alexis Côté said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the things that I’ve noticed since the pandemic is that we have a lot of juniors in our teams. Probably half the team that’s building Assassin’s Creed is building a game for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the video below is set to begin approximately where Marc-Alexis Côté spoke about the game’s development, you can watch the full keynote from XDS24 here:</p>

                                        <p dir="ltr">Video games have traditionally been an expensive hobby, but thanks to the latest advances in cloud streaming, it's now easier--and more affordable--than ever to get into gaming. One of the best cloud gaming services is Amazon Luna, which lets users play some of the latest games in up to 4K quality directly on devices they already own--no expensive console or gaming PC required. If that sounds like something you're interested in, we've put together this comprehensive explainer for Amazon Luna so you can see how easy it is to sign up and get playing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What is Amazon Luna?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4406070-lunadevices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4406070" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4406070-lunadevices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4406070"></a><figcaption>Amazon Luna</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4406070-lunadevices.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna is a cloud gaming service that allows users to stream games directly from the cloud to various devices without needing a gaming console. You can think of it like the video game version of Amazon's Prime Video service, where instead of downloading and running games directly on your hardware, they're stored and played remotely via Amazon's Web Services (AWS) servers.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of benefits to cloud gaming compared to traditional console or PC gaming. For one, you can access your library of games from a long list of devices, including Windows PCs, Macs, Fire TV streaming devices, Fire tablets, Chromebooks, iPhones, iPads, Android devices, and select smart TVs. While you'll need a strong, stable internet connection for the best gameplay experience, cloud gaming can be much cheaper, too, since all you need is a Luna account, a controller, and one of the supported devices--many of which you probably already own. That means there's no need to buy an expensive gaming console or PC.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Much Does Amazon Luna Cost?</h2><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna requires a paid membership to access most of its games and features, but multiple subscription plans and optional add-ons are available to suit your preferences.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Luna+ membership</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">The primary plan is <strong>Luna+</strong>, which costs <strong>$10/month</strong> and gets you access to over 100 games that are playable at no extra charge, including a mix of AAA games like <strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong> and <strong>Middle-earth: Shadow of War</strong>, and indies like <strong>Overcooked</strong> and <strong>Guacamelee</strong>. Luna+ members can also sync their Ubisoft store and GOG accounts and play select games they already own from those storefronts over the cloud via Amazon Luna.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the game libraries, Luna+ members can also link their Twitch accounts and broadcast their gameplay live.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A <strong>seven-day Luna+ free trial</strong></a> is available if you want to try out the service.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Luna+ add-ons</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Luna+ members can augment their libraries with a couple of paid add-on channels.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">If you're a fan of <strong>Ubisoft games</strong>, you can play a large library of the publisher's games on Luna--including new releases and classic titles--by adding the <strong>Ubisoft+ channel</strong> to your membership for an additional $18/month.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>The Jackbox Games Channel</strong> is also available for an additional $5/month, granting you access to the popular series of <strong>Jackbox party games</strong>.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Amazon Prime</strong> subscribers ($15/month or $139/year) also get access to an additional rotating selection of games, including popular titles like <strong>Fortnite</strong>, <strong>Trackmania</strong>, and <strong>XDefiant</strong>, that you can play even without a Luna+ membership. Separate from Luna, Prime members also get a selection of free games via the Prime Gaming service, some of which are also playable on Luna.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">What Equipment Do You Need?</h2><p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, Amazon Luna works on various devices, and you can also play via Chrome or Microsoft Edge web browsers on PC or Safari on Apple devices. You'll need at least one of the supported devices and/or web browsers to use Luna.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Amazon devices</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Fire TV streamers and smart TVs running FireOS 5 and above, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-lite-latest-alexa-voice-remote-lite/dp/B091G4YP57?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-lite-latest-alexa-voice-remote-lite/dp/B091G4YP57?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick Lite</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick HD</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K,</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/dp/B09BZZ3MM7?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/dp/B09BZZ3MM7?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Cube</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fire+smart+tv&amp;crid=2YJV9MKHPNCK9&amp;sprefix=fire+smart%2Caps%2C383&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fire+smart+tv&amp;crid=2YJV9MKHPNCK9&amp;sprefix=fire+smart%2Caps%2C383&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FireOS smart TVs</a></li><li dir="ltr">Fire Tablets like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire HD 11 Max</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BL5XPDR6?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BL5XPDR6?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire HD 10</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Tablet-Black-32GB/dp/B0CVDN4QS6?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Tablet-Black-32GB/dp/B0CVDN4QS6?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire HD 8</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/dp/B096WJFX8M?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/dp/B096WJFX8M?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire 7</a></li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Apple devices</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">iPhones running iOS 15 and above</li><li dir="ltr">iPads running iPadOS 15 and above</li><li dir="ltr">macOS running 10.13</li><li dir="ltr">Safari 15 and above</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Android devices</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Android OS 9 and above</li><li dir="ltr">Chrome version 86 and above</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>PC</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Windows 10 and above</li><li dir="ltr">Chrome version 83 and above</li><li dir="ltr">Microsoft Edge version 90 and above</li><li dir="ltr">Linux, Ubuntu, and Chromium OS are also supported.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Select LG and Samsung smart TVs</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can check the full <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&amp;nodeId=GUFHUSX8X324T4XE&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&amp;nodeId=GUFHUSX8X324T4XE&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">list of supported devices here</a>.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>A controller</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Along with one of the supported devices or web browsers, Luna also requires a Bluetooth game controller to play.

The Luna controller can also connect directly to Amazon's AWS servers, which Amazon says reduces input latency by up to 30 milliseconds compared to other controllers.</p><p dir="ltr">The following controllers all feature official Luna support:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luna Controller</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088GJR4B9?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088GJR4B9?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wireless Controller</a></li><li dir="ltr">PlayStation DualShock 4</li><li dir="ltr">Mouse and keyboard (only on supported games)</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYNLANRYMK4WTXSS&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYNLANRYMK4WTXSS&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon's support page</a> says other third-party controllers outside that list may work with Luna, though full support is not guaranteed, so it's best to stick with the official list.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Internet connection</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">As a cloud streaming service, Amazon Luna requires an internet connection--and the better your connection is, the better the gameplay experience. Unlike traditional consoles and gaming PCs, where graphical quality and gameplay speed depend on your hardware setup, cloud gaming performance depends on how strong and stable your internet connection is.</p><p dir="ltr">While you can play Luna games at a maximum 4K resolution, gameplay quality may vary if your connection wavers. Amazon's minimum network requirements are 10Mbps internet speeds for 1080p gaming and at least 35Mbps for 4K. You'll also want to use a hardwired Ethernet connection whenever possible. If you play over Wi-Fi, you will want to use 5Ghz routers (though 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi is also supported).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/our-5-favorite-pieces-from-gravitrax-action-set-death-star<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Way back in 2021, we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/gravitrax-interactive-track-system-review" rel="nofollow"><em>GraviTrax</em> Starter Set Vertical</a>, the fast-paced build-your-own marble rolling system, so when we were offered the chance to cover the new&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax </em>Action-Set Death Star, I jumped at the chance. The <em>GraviTrax</em> system allows you to build mazes that literally fire marbles, or gravity spheres as they're known, around a track, racing and interacting with other gravity spheres as they go. We're not going to review the&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star, as we've already reviewed the system, but in this article, I'm going to look at my 5 favorite pieces that the Death Star set adds to your&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> tracks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-5.jpg?itok=SyLpzBJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-5.jpg?itok=kvji0Ltx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star includes 190 pieces of tracks and <em>Star Wars</em> themed components.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Does The&nbsp;GraviTrax Action-Set Death Star Contain?</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star is a full starter set for&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em>, so if it's your first time picking it up, it contains everything you need to build and play. The set includes 190 pieces of track, including corners, runners, special pieces, and the base it all fits into, which is the Death Star at the lower level, and an Imperial Destroyer and Millennium Falcon at the upper levels. The set also includes 6 exclusive marbles, with unique etchings on them for Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo, and 3 Tie Fighters, along with X-Wing and Tie Fighter pieces that sit above the corners to add further immersion in the setting.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em>&nbsp;system allows you to add this set to existing sets or add further sets to this one once you've mastered it. The instruction booklet takes you through building the pieces and then increasing the complexity of tracks before you set off to explore builds on your own.</p>

<p>The<em> GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star includes 4 X-Wing and 4 Tie Fighter miniatures that sit above the track corners on stands and add immersion to the tracks. The X-Wing is my first favorite piece from the set. They don't interact with the track itself, but they do help with the <em>Star Wars</em> feel, especially when viewed alongside the Death Star board.</p>

<p>My second favorite piece is the pole steps (name not official). The little cups on the top of the poles catch the gravity sphere, and momentum pushes the pole towards the next pole, where it drops it into the next cup, and so on. You do need to make sure there's some speed going into the first cup, otherwise, it doesn't move and the track ends there for that particular sphere, but hit it right, and it's quite satisfying to see them pass over each step and then continue along the track.</p>

<p>The catapult is pretty special which is why it features as my third favorite <em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star piece. The speed at which it enters the holder at the bottom coverts into how fast it whips over the top, carried by the two counterweights. Then it either continues on its journey, or like in the image above from one of the set builds, it goes straight into a slide, which did arrest some of its momentum here, but whip it onto a straight track and it can really get some speed up.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-9.jpg?itok=wTFW_y-c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-9.jpg?itok=aFdUERir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Piece 4 - Gravity Well</h2>

<p>The Gravity Well, our fourth favorite piece, is a drop into a slide, that can be rotated within the tile to face any direction you want. The slide itself does arrest the speed of the gravity sphere, so it won't plunge straight in and out, but once it exits the slide, it will already have a decent amount of momentum to keep it going. The piece in the image above fits into the Millennium Falcon level (and also the Death Star level piece), which looks great once set up, and feels really immersive as it drops the marble down and onwards.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-3.jpg?itok=QgQm9KkC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-3.jpg?itok=jxvZ3h8Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Piece 5 - Magnetic Cannon</h2>

<p>By far my favorite piece is the Magnetic Cannon. This piece appears like a stop, with a solid magnet blocking the track, but when a gravity sphere strikes it, a gravity sphere on the other side of the magnet is fired back onto the track. These offer a range of options like reversing the direction of a gravity sphere, adding full momentum on the bottom level to fire round with a new lease of life, or making pieces strike together when they meet at central tiles. This piece feels the most Star Wars, like punching a hyperspace drive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/video-game-champion-brings-retro-game-collecting-fun-to-gaming-tables<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arcane Wonders has announced an English language release of <em>Video Game Champion</em>. The acclaimed tabletop developer has announced they will localize this retro-inspired board game from its original Brazilian Portuguese version.</p>

<h2><em>Video Game Champion</em> English Launch</h2>

<p>According to an official press release. <em>Video Game Champion</em> is a family-friendly competitive board game for 2-5 players. It puts players in the shoes of a child in the 1990s, a world full of pizza bagels, video game cartridges, and rental stores. The goal is to get the most impressive collection of video games and be the coolest kid in the neighborhood.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/video-game-champion-dynamite-sweetie-artwork.jpg?itok=0RV9Gkqu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/video-game-champion-dynamite-sweetie-artwork.jpg?itok=XM7g3k4O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In a game of <em>Video Game Champion</em>, resource management is key. You'll navigate earning an allowance, convincing your parents to buy you games, and doing chores to save up for the latest cutting-edge 16-bit game releases. Those resources include money chips, button chips, and "I owe you" chips.</p>

<p>These decisions are taken via an Action Grid, which includes studying, reading gaming magazines, or completing household tasks. In addition, you will need to raid store shelves to find the best "fictional releases." After all, you don't want to just buy these games; you want to make time to play them too.</p>

<p>The titles in <em>Video Game Champion</em> aren't official releases, but they invoke the spirit of the era courtesy of 16-bit inspired box art and titles like "<em>Dragon Scales</em>" or "<em>Neow Racing</em>".</p>

<p>A terminally ill fan of the Borderlands series was given the opportunity to play Borderlands 4 after his plea reached developer Gearbox.</p>



<p>Caleb McAlpine, a Borderlands fan with Stage 4 terminal cancer, was flown out with a friend to Gearbox Software in order to experience the upcoming game. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1h01zdn/just_an_update_thank_you_everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Reddit</a>, McAlpine spoke about his experience at the studio. </p>



<p>After meeting the developers and CEO Randy Pitchford to playing an early build of Borderlands 4, he wanted to express his thanks to everyone who helped make this dream a reality. </p>



<p>“We got to play what they have for Borderlands 4 so far and it was amazing,” McAlpine said. “I don’t know if I will be around when the game Comes out but I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of your love and support and for helping in making this happen. It truly was an amazing experience and it was just awesome.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-announced-at-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch sometime</a> in 2025 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. More details about the game will be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>McApline’s latest prognosis as of October was that he had less than two years if chemotherapy slowed the progression of the cancer. </p>



<p>We wish Caleb all the best in his current fight. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fortnite-vbucks-fraud-credit-card-bank-chargeback<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Thursday, I woke up to an interesting notification: My credit card had declined on an otherwise routine transaction. “Maybe I’m just out of money,” I groggily considered, early-day brain fog preventing me from entering a state of full-on panic. A few hours later, my bank informed me of the true culprit: Somebody had fraudulently obtained my card info and had been using it to make purchases for weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>These included expensive jackets, regular trips to a kava bar, multiple OnlyFans subscriptions, and nearly $100 worth of in-game <em>Fortnite </em>items. Fortunately, the bank was able to resolve the situation relatively painlessly, but it got me wondering: What happened to those <em>Fortnite </em>items?&nbsp;</p><p>The bank issued a chargeback to Epic, meaning the company would not get to keep my money. But <em>Fortnite </em>skins, emotes, and whatnot are digital goods, theoretically infinite in supply unlike, say, a nice jacket or an amount of kava that I’m not sure is healthy. If this person was allowed to keep the items, Epic would suffer no (immediate) material harm.&nbsp;</p><p>Out of curiosity and a small amount of schadenfreude, I decided to ask Epic how it handles these situations – how the company responds once it has received a payment dispute resulting in a chargeback. An Epic spokesperson pointed me in the direction of <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/chargebacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bespoke page</a> on the official <em>Fortnite </em>website concerning these matters.</p><p>“Once a chargeback is filed, we will remove any purchased items that are associated with the chargeback from the account,” the page reads, meaning that this random person whose habits I’d come to know a strange amount about by way of them robbing me almost certainly lost their ill-gotten <em>Fortnite </em>goods. Bummer!</p><p>They won’t be able to get the items back, either – at least, for a time. My largely-circumstantial nemesis split their in-game purchases between two separate transactions on two different days, meaning two chargebacks. Unfortunately for them, Epic currently employs a two-strikes-and-you’re-out system.</p><p>"After two or more chargebacks,” reads <em>Fortnite</em>’s chargebacks page, “the account from which the unauthorized purchase was made will be blocked from making purchases across Epic products for up to one year."</p><p>Epic used to be even stricter about this stuff. For a time, it would ban accounts associated with chargebacks, but has since made changes to “better account for certain non-fraud-related scenarios that could result in a chargeback.” An Epic spokesperson told Aftermath that such scenarios could include a player initiating a chargeback “for an unwanted purchase instead of contacting Epic's Player Support to obtain a refund for a real money transaction.” Following those changes, Epic claims to have restored at least some accounts that were banned under the previous policy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Epic spokesperson would not provide examples of circumstances in which the company now bans accounts. “We do not disclose what leads to a permanent ban so players cannot game our system,” they told Aftermath.&nbsp;</p><p>All of which is to say, at the very least, the person who spent nearly $100 of my – and by virtue of Aftermath being a subscription-driven site, your – hard-earned dollars on <em>Fortnite </em>is now bereft, certainly of items if nothing else. This might seem like an instance of justice being served, but I find it difficult to feel entirely good about any of it. People don’t generally steal for kicks; they do it <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10354492/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because they’re in need of something</a>, whether that means supplies and shelter or simple joys.</p><p>On top of the aforementioned digital and non-digital goods, the person who got a hold of my card info also spent a truly alarming amount on insurance. I can’t fault them for that! If I suddenly found myself playing with what felt like house money, I’d almost certainly do the same. I don’t think I’d buy <em>Fortnite </em>items, but that’s more a matter of taste than anything else.</p><p><strong>Update 11/27/24: </strong>Clarified language around when Epic bans accounts as opposed to temporarily blocking their ability to make purchases.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ransack-mode-tips/</link>

<p>Are you struggling with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s new game mode, Ransack? Insider Gaming has a few tips and tricks to help you survive and excel in the new mode, score gold, help your team score big, and rank up in the process!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-ransack">What is Ransack?</h2>



<p>Ransack is the newest game mode added to Black Ops 6 in November 2024. It is a 6v6 mode where you loot gold bars from stashes around the map. One stash will open at a time; you gather the gold from it and bring it back to your team’s safe. You can also take gold off of enemies you down and steal from the enemy safe! Whichever team reaches the gold cap first or whoever has the most gold at the end of the round when the timer goes off wins.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-succeed-at-ransack">How to Succeed at Ransack</h2>



<p>Working with your teammates is critical in this mode. Each team must guard their safe, loot and steal gold from the other team, and watch their backs. Loadouts, scorestreaks, and equipment must be chosen carefully to maximize success. You should play your most comfortable loadout to play your best for your team; solo play is a detriment to your entire team.</p>



<p>Many players recommend varying your “tasks” in this game mode. You don’t want to always be on the attack or always on the defense. Changing your strategy to switch between looting, killing, and defending is essential.</p>







<h2 id="h-suggested-loadouts-scorestreaks-and-equipment-for-ransack">Suggested Loadouts, Scorestreaks, and Equipment for Ransack</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>As for loadouts, it’s once again worth mentioning that you should play how you’re most comfortable. If you’re great with an LMG or a shotgun, go for it. Just make sure your team is balanced between long-, mid-, and short-range weapons.</p>



<p>Scorestreaks are important in all modes of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, but for Ransack, they’re particularly essential. Some recommended scorestreaks are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scout Pulse</strong> so that you can see enemies around you.</li>



<li><strong>UAV</strong> so that you can see enemies all around the map.</li>



<li><strong>Counter UAV</strong> so that enemies can’t see you on the map.</li>
</ul>



<p>For equipment, go big or go home!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Lethal Equipment</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sticky Grenade</li>



<li>Frag Grenade</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Tactical Equipment</strong>
<ul>
<li>Concussion Grenade</li>



<li>Flashbang Grenade</li>



<li>Smoke Grenade</li>



<li>Shock Charges</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrades</strong>
<ul>
<li>Assault Pack</li>



<li>War Cry</li>



<li>Spring Mine</li>



<li>Trophy System</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>However you decide to play Ransack, know that it’s an entertaining mode. It’s one of my favorites to play while unwinding after a long day. Let us know in the comments how much you like (or dislike) this mode!</p>

			<p>One of the most controversial games in the Fallout franchise has officially reached over 21 million players and has now taken to social media to ask fans to consider nominating Fallout 76 for Steam's Labor of Love Award. Fallout 76 first launched in 2018, and had a bit of a rough start at launch. The game was pretty bug-ridden (much like many Bethesda games), but it is now in a much better place. Similar to how No Man's Sky started, the developers have been putting a ton of work into the game to make it more playable and add more content. This includes significant updates such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-76-update-launches-milepost-zero/">Milepost Zero</a>, which added Legendary crafting and new delivery quests for players to participate in.</p>
<p>In the blog post released by the Fallout 76 team, they stated that the game has had more than 50 free updates, and the community has continued to expand. They've stated that over 21 million Vault-dwellers have made it to Appalachia. Players have many opportunities to provide their feedback to the team at Bethesda Game Studios via Reddit, X, Discord, and more. Additionally, there is a Player Test Server where those who opt in can provide actionable feedback for the game.</p>
<p>To celebrate this news, they are now working on making more tweaks to the game systems and player loadouts, which were introduced in the Locked &amp; Loaded update. Additionally, on December 3, a new update will be released for Fallout 76. This update is called Gleaming Depths, which introduces a brand-new raid to the game, as well as C.A.M.P. pets, Four-Star Legendaries, Player Titles, and other quality-of-life improvements to the game. The team has been posting some glimpses of the Gleaming Depths update, where they've shown some of the pets that you'll be able to have at your C.A.M.P.</p>
<p>In the blog post, they go on to finish their statement by saying:</p>
<p>"Throughout these six years, the community has always been at the forefront of our mind when implementing changes and introducing new content. We cannot thank you enough for your contributions and support! We look forward to how the Fallout 76 community will contribute to the game in the years to come."</p>
<p>While <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5ATk04i7pbwOlbZqni7MNM/nominate-fallout-76-for-the-steam-awards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their post</a> was used to announce the number of players that are flocking to the game, as well as the new update they will be releasing, most importantly, they asked for a nomination for the Labor of Love Steam Award. The Steam Awards nominations have already opened, and you can vote for your favorites across a number of categories.</p>

It now feels like <em>Balatro</em>-pilling has just gotten started.</p><p>For anyone who hasn’t already played it, <em>Balatro</em> tasks players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124?_gl=1*2j6bsx*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjcxNTYxNS40MS4xLjE3MzI3MzU5MjcuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124?_gl=1*2j6bsx*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjcxNTYxNS40MS4xLjE3MzI3MzU5MjcuNjAuMC4w">with using poker hands to score points</a></span>. Players need to hit certain thresholds to progress, and earn gold for successful rounds that can then be spent on customizing their decks and acquiring powerful jokers that boost how their hands are scored in all kinds of ways. There’s no actual betting, but the constant risk-reward analysis required at every turn provides the stakes and tension associated with real games of chance. </p><p>After exploding back in February, <em>Balatro</em>’s second wave began in September. Developer LocalThunk brought the card game to mobile, which turned out to be a perfect platform for chasing rare jokers and high scores. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://appmagic.rocks/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://appmagic.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>App Magic </em>reported</a></span> that the game made $1 million in its first week, a small fortune for a $10  game in the App Store world of microtransaction- and ad-fueled free-to-play hits. </p><p>Then in November, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-elden-ring-dlc-goty-dragon-age-tga-2024-1851702305?_gl=1*1n8y3p6*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjcxNTYxNS40MS4xLjE3MzI3MzU5MjcuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-elden-ring-dlc-goty-dragon-age-tga-2024-1851702305?_gl=1*1n8y3p6*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjcxNTYxNS40MS4xLjE3MzI3MzU5MjcuNjAuMC4w"><em>Balatro </em>scored multiple nominations at The Game Awards 2024</a></span>, sending the whole thing into overdrive. It was represented not just in the best indie and mobile game categories, but in best direction and debut as well. It even snagged the most coveted prize of all, a 2024 GOTY nod, for five nominations in total. In a testament to both the impact of host Geoff Keighley’s awards show and how small <em>Balatro</em>’s footprint still was, tons of new players began to take notice. </p><p>Sales spiked on mobile, with <em>Balatro</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pocketgamer.biz/balatro-nears-44m-on-mobile-amid-a-sudden-spending-surge/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/balatro-nears-44m-on-mobile-amid-a-sudden-spending-surge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly raking in</a></span> $4.4 million since it launched on smartphones and over $727,000 last week alone following the Game Awards 2024 nominees reveal earlier this month. The game has also seen a resurgence in its concurrent player counts on Steam, as well as thousands of fresh reviews on the Valve-owned storefront (where the game is also currently 15 percent off). </p><p>But <em>Balatro</em> is clearly on the move in the popular gamer conscience as well. A common encounter with the name from a newbie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GHBSmith/status/1859257865837428866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GHBSmith/status/1859257865837428866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goes like this</a></span>. Someone who has never heard of<em> Balatro </em>finds out about it. They think the game can’t possibly be that hype and then they give it a try. The next thing they know, it’s all they can think about. Fans new and old have taken to expressing this obsessive quality by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/katsumashii/status/1860155170338099543&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/katsumashii/status/1860155170338099543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting explanation-less images</a></span> of the game’s iconic joker face under any mention of the game on social media. </p><p>Possibly adding to the renewed zeitgeist around the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1861191425913929935&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1861191425913929935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a bit of reactionary controversy</a></span> surrounding its official GOTY nomination. While some players have been griping about <em>Elden Ring</em>’s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>DLC getting a nomination instead of full games released this year like <em>Stellar Blade</em> or <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Lorgarwasright/status/1859057839270228250&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Lorgarwasright/status/1859057839270228250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">others have been denigrating</a></span> <em>Balatro</em> as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RinoTheBouncer/status/1859211239701815535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RinoTheBouncer/status/1859211239701815535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just a card game</a></span>” or a shallow splash in the mobile pan. </p><p>It seems like a good bet that<em> Balatro </em>will win at least one prize at the Game Awards, which will raise its profile even further. And deservedly so. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/09/26/balatro-mobile-release-localthunk-interview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/09/26/balatro-mobile-release-localthunk-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Balatro</em> is a masterclass</a></span> in how a game can get its hooks in a player and then never let go. It helps that LocalThunk has been prodigious with updates the last few months, adding crossovers with popular properties ranging from <em>The Witcher 3</em> to <em>Dave the Diver</em>. I wouldn’t be surprised if we get at least a couple more before the year is out. <em>Balatro</em> cannot be stopped. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Larian said Patch 8 is the game’s last major update, with the developer moving on to brand new games away from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Larian promised to continue to support Baldur’s Gate 3 modders, with “big updates still to come,” including more functionality “to let you tell your own stories.” Official mod tools were released in September, and since then players have uploaded more than 3,000 mods and downloaded over 70 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of crossplay means Baldur’s Gate 3 multiplayer will soon feature full cross-platform progression. Once the update is live you’ll be able to invite your friends to join your crossplay lobby directly, regardless of platform and find available multiplayer lobbies with friends on other systems using the Larian Network.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/0f91bcf1c662489467d8a4ccf8eec9e198829d34-1732729694218.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Crossplay is coming to Baldur's Gate 3 with Patch 8. Image credit: Larian Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Patch 8 adds one new subclass for each of the existing Bard, Barbarian, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard classes in the game. Larian said to expect new abilities, animations, VFX, summons and cantrips, and unique voiced dialogue lines for the Oathbreaker Knight with written reactivity for Oathbreakers, along with “a touch of homebrewing” on certain actions to enhance your role-playing experience.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 new subclasses:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bard - College of Glamour</strong><br>As a College of Glamour Bard, you’ll find you have the power to heal friends and command enemies in equal measure. Cast <strong>Mantle of Inspiration</strong> to bestow your allies with 5 temporary hit points. And should an enemy attack while it is cast, they’ll find themselves <strong>Charmed</strong>. Play your hand correctly and you’ll be able to use this to your advantage with <strong>Mantle of Majesty</strong>. Target Charmed enemies and you can command them to flee, move closer, freeze, drop to the ground, or drop their weapon.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/bard-1732729963269.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barbarian - Path of Giants</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Opt for the Path of Giants, and your newfound giant strength will make it easier for you to yeet friend and foe alike. Forget chugging potions to pump those muscles, these Barbarians benefit from the <strong>Giant’s Rage</strong> passive that grants both strength and size - allowing you to deal additional damage with Throw attacks. Pockets weighing you down? Not for you and your increased carry capacity!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cleric - Death Domain</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a cleric of death, you’ll find a few dark new tricks up your sleeves - from spells that specialise in necrotic damage to three new necromancy cantrips. This includes <strong>Toll The Dead</strong>, a cantrip that causes 1~8 damage when your cleric rings the bell of impending doom - a number that scales if your target has already been damaged. We’ve also added the homebrewed ability to explode nearby corpses, damaging enemies.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/cleric-1732730075166.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Druid - Circle of Stars</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Druids look to the stars for answers, accessing powers beyond those offered through the classic wildshapes. Taking on one of three <strong>Starry Forms</strong> for their power - the constellations of the Archer, Chalice, and Dragon. Each one favours a different play style and strategy - the Archer dealing radiant damage with astral arrows, the life-giving Chalice restoring hitpoints to you and others nearby, and the wise Dragon, allowing you to deal damage with an added bonus to constitution rolls. The Starry Forms offer not just a celestial aesthetic, but practical, powerful options to enhance your role as a healer, fighter, or strategist.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/druid-1732730104242.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve been sworn to uphold the principles of law. Stay true to your oath and you'll be rewarded with the power to aid your allies and disrupt your foes. Guide your companions in battle with <strong>Righteous Clarity</strong>, taunt enemies with strategic interrupts, and keep your party standing strong with <strong>Divine Allegiance</strong>, absorbing their damage while restoring their health.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fighter - Arcane Archer</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mastering the dual arts of magic and marksmanship, the Arcane Archer subclass offers unique skills on top of new shooting animations. Banish foes to the Feywild, removing them from the battlefield for a turn, or unleash Psychic damage that forces enemies to make a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the start of their next turn.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/fighter-1732730135487.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Monk - Drunken Master</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Putting the brew in homebrew, as the Drunken Master, you have the ability to consume alcohol straight from your inventory, as well as drink from bottles you see around the Sword Coast, in order to recover Ki. By sharing the bottle with your enemies using <strong>Intoxicating Strike</strong>, you’ll generate a buff towards your Armour Class and your Chance to hit Drunk targets. Drunk enemies are also susceptible to the Drunken Masters' other abilities, like <strong>Sobering Realisation</strong> - which sobers up drunk targets, dealing physical and Psychic damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Swarmkeeper subclass provides Rangers with three kinds of deadly swarms to assist them in combat. The <strong>Cloud of Jellyfish</strong> deals extra lightning damage - potentially shocking your enemy. <strong>The Flurry of Moths</strong> deals Psychic damage, giving you the potential to Blind your enemy. The <strong>Legion of Bees</strong> deals piercing damage and forces the enemy to make a strength-saving throw or be knocked back 15ft. Each swarm also has the ability to provide you with teleportation capabilities!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/ranger-1732730166286.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rogue - Swashbuckler</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Rogue subclass introduces a range of new actions fit for the piratical life. Play dirty by tossing sand at enemies to <strong>Blind</strong> them. Flick your weapon at a target to <strong>Disarm</strong> them. Or use your new <strong>Fancy Footwork</strong> passive while meleeing your enemy to ensure they can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Shadow Magic Sorcerer, you deal in a form of magic that makes you deadliest in darkness. This subclass gives its sorcerer <strong>Superior Darkvision</strong>, as well as the ability to <strong>Shadow Walk</strong> between places of dim light or darkness. It also lets you call forth the perfectly homebrewed <strong>Hound of Ill Omen</strong> to harass your foes, and use <strong>Strength of the Grave</strong> to prevent you from being downed - ideal for those attempting Honour Mode runs.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/sorc-1732730193758.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warlock - Hexblade</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hexblade Warlocks make a pact with an entity from the Shadowfell that manifests in the form of magical weapons. Curse your enemies and force their souls to do your bidding. Slay any enemy that isn’t generally an element of nature, construct, giant blob, or already dead, and you’ll be able to raise their spirit from their corpse for ten turns. This new summon can deal necrotic damage and will rip away a chunk of your enemy’s soul to provide your Hexblade Warlock with healing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wizard - Bladesinging</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bladesinging subclass merges swordplay with wizardry. Expect new spellcasting animations when casting spells with your weapon, a new Bladesong ability to grant you supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/wizard-1732730222341.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">And here’s the rest coming with Patch 8:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Photo Mode</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, you can stop using pictures of fish you’ve caught on your dating profile and start snapping photos with your Hound of Ill Omen. Photo Mode is coming to Baldur’s Gate 3 in Patch 8!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur’s Gate 3’s Photo Mode is a little like a photo booth that lets you set up pretty much any shot you’d like. This new feature introduces a whole slew of options to let you customise and edit your in-game photography, with various levels of freedom depending on whether you’re using it while adventuring, or during combat, dialogue, and cinematic scenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Camera Settings</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Toggleable from the HUD, located near the minimap, or by using the hotkey binding (F9 on PC, and by pressing both analog sticks at the same time on console), you’ll get to choose which character you want to take centre stage, determine their best side, and adjust the camera position to suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As long as they’re in your party while you’re adventuring, you’ll be able to line up your scene perfectly - including summons and those in a Wild Shape! For all budding virtual photographers, you can also turn on the camera reticle and composition grid to make sure you’re lining up the perfect shot.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/camera-1732730374794.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Lens Settings</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Determined the angle and sorted the positioning? You’ll be able to jump over to the Lens Settings where you can play around with the Field of View, Exposure, Depth of Field, and Focus.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/lens-1732730410800.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Scene Settings</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">NPC ruining your shot? Toggle off either Playing, Party, NPC or Enemy characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now you’re ready for your close-up! Or, if you’re feeling creative, set the scene for a full-on Faerûn musical - choose a set facial expression, plus a range of over 40 static and animated poses, each with multiple variations to help give you the perfect layout.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/scene-1732730460429.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Post Processing Effects</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you won’t be able to adjust your party or play around with lens and camera settings during cinematic scenes and dialogues, you’ll be able to colour-grade your shot and experiment with contrast, saturation, highlights, brightness and vignette.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Frames</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Add flair to your scene with a range of different frames and letterboxing to nail those cinematic shots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Stickers</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Choose from over 300 stickers and add up to 30 to your scene, including emojis, icons, blood splatters, textures, objects and items, and of course, cat ears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In your hands soon, you’ll be able to take role-play to the next level with unique combinations of poses, stickers, and frames. We can’t wait to see what absolute nightmare fuel you come up with.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/stickers-1732730518499.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian plans a Patch 8 stress test on Xbox and PlayStation, as well as PC in early January. “The goal is to go beyond our internal testing and help us catch things before they can become an issue once a patch has been released,” Larian explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Along with all of the newness coming in Patch 8, we’ll also be integrating a large selection of bug fixes and polishing up cinematics, including ensuring Shadowheart’s hair dye no longer washes away when she takes a dip with her romantic partner. We’ll be sharing more on what’s been fixed in a future update!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
