		<p>Everyone has a game from their past that they’d love to see again. That classic of your childhood that brimmed with imagination, and which you played to death because you only had one game. Well, if Croc Legend of Gobbos was that game for you, it’s time to rejoice, as both it, and original developers Argonaut Games, are returning, bringing that wiggly-bummed crocodile to modern platforms later this year, greener and shinier than ever before.</p>
<p><iframe title="Croc Legend of the Gobbos Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lxQ4m_g21I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Originally released in 1997 for the PlayStation 1, and selling over 3 million units, it was also ported to the Sega Saturn (the console of kings) and PC. It’s easy to throw around the word ‘classic’, but Croc Legend of Gobbos stands resolutely amongst the most beloved platformers of the era, and especially for PlayStation owners, bereft of games like Mario 64 and Bank Kazooie, Croc Legend of Gobbos filled that space admirably.</p>
<p>The remastered release is going to feature enhanced HD graphics, updated modern control mechanics, and an authentic gameplay experience that will take gamers back to the golden age of 3D platforming. Beyond that, fans will also have access to the Crocipedia, an extensive and meticulously curated digital museum containing long lost development assets including game design documents, concept art, animation tests, team member interviews, and more.</p>


<p>Unusually, alongside the remaster, the original developers are returning as well, after a 20 year hiatus. Argonaut Games were a huge part of the gaming scene of the 80s and 90s. Founded by gaming icon Jez San OBE, the team are known for bringing pioneering 3D technology to a 2D gaming world in the 1980s. Alongside Croc, the team are probably best known for the seminal original Star Fox for the Super Nintendo, as well as the Super FX chip that made its 3D visuals possible on the 16-bit console. The team went on to make some of the best-known licensed games of the era as well, with the awesome Alien Resurrection and Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone and its sequel.</p>

<p>A developers union at Call of Duty studio Raven Software <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/18-CA-349076" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have filed a complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. </p>



<p>First reported by Stephen Totilo in his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-partner-showcase-raven-activision-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameFile</a> newsletter, the union at Raven Software claims that its parent companies are bargaining in bad faith as well as taking part in “concerted activities” such as retaliation and discipline. There are also allegations of changes in the terms and conditions of employment without agreement of the union.</p>







<p>“After Microsoft’s acquisition of&nbsp;Activision Blizzard, our members were optimistic that they would progress quickly to a first contract at Raven Software,” CWA president Claude Cummings Jr. said to GameFile. “Unfortunately, that has not happened. We encourage Microsoft to address the concerns raised in the Unfair Labor Practice charge and make reaching a fair agreement a priority.”</p>



<p>Microsoft nor Activision Blizzard have responded to Insider Gaming’s requests for comment. Microsoft, however, did tell Totilo that it is “committed to negotiating in good faith.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has filed a request to view the full complaint, and will provide details should the request be granted.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-is-a-brilliant-evolution-of-persona-and-smt.965952/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>From each character’s magical awakening and all the RPG mechanics it opens, to the social sim elements that feed into how you interact with the world, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor ReFantazio</a> is clearly adopting the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona formula</a> – but it’s doing so for something seemingly bigger in scope from both a gameplay and storytelling perspective. After playing about five hours of Atlus’ upcoming RPG, it’s extremely apparent how it’s leveraging the strengths of its previous games to think outside the confines of traditional fantasy and create something wholly unique. And as much as I love Persona, it’s about damn time we’ve had a game of this style that goes beyond the classroom walls and halls of high school.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Metaphor ReFantazio Preview - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>No matter which way you cut it, Metaphor is a politically charged story – not just in the concept of being the main character who is striving to win an election to be the next king. Having played the opening hours, it boldly establishes the social dynamics of its medieval fantasy setting, the Kingdom of Euchronia. The story opens up with the protagonist in a carriage with a group of wanderers getting ambushed by bandits, where he witnesses a red-haired elven girl slice down the bandits before he gets kicked off a cliff to fend for himself. It’s a grim, hostile world outside of the towns and city walls where outlaws and monsters always seeking prey. And even within its capital, its society rife with classism and discrimination shows that nowhere is truly safe. Metaphor makes this clear as soon as you reach the Royal Capital in the opening hours, showcasing how poverty, racism, and militarism dictate life across the kingdom.</p><p>The protagonist is an “elda,” a tribe (or race) that presents as regularly human – they’re a rare sight in Euchronia and are treated with disdain. The elven “roussainte” and horned “clemar” are more commonly accepted while the hedonistic cat-like “paripus” live on the fringes of society. The tribal dynamics set the tone for a story that seems to wield social injustice as a major theme. But the main character isn’t just any young elda; he’s best friends with the crown prince, who’s effectively in a coma after a violent coup attempt from years ago. This relationship is revealed early on, which begs the question of what the protagonist’s role and motivations really are as he becomes a serious candidate in the kingdom-wide election process.</p><p>Significant parts of this opening use beautiful anime-style cutscenes and I didn’t mind putting the controller down for long periods because these show an elevated level of production chops compared to Atlus’ previous games. That extends to its stunning aesthetic; Metaphor brings the kind of flash and fashion you expect from Persona while blending in the harshness of a brutal medieval world.</p><p>However, I wasn’t <em>entirely </em>sold on Metaphor in the opening hours. It’s visually striking with a captivating setup, but it’s delivered in a fairly by-the-numbers sequence of events as it tries to build the foundation of a brand new setting. I started to see the vision once I got deeper into the preview demo, though. After signing up as a foot soldier in the army and getting sent off to a dangerous military operation, you’re paired with a clemar named Strohl, and your fairy companion Gallica reminds you that your mission is to meet with someone on the inside who has vital information for your true goal. Not much is explained at first, but as I got through the introductory dungeon, I saw more of Metaphor’s pieces fall into place. I began to see how corruption from within the kingdom exploits people who are used as political pawns. I forged an early bond with Strohl who’s a well-meaning noble willing to put his life on the line for what’s right. But I also questioned why all the bosses of this world are deranged amalgamations of humans with monikers that harken to our real world. So much of Metaphor remains a mystery, but I was quickly convinced that its world warrants a journey upwards of 80-plus hours. And one thing I was sure of was that it still has that badass edge expected from an Atlus RPG.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Metaphor brings the kind of flash and fashion you expect from Persona while blending in the harshness of a brutal medieval world.</p></div><p>Just like in Persona, each party member in Metaphor has an adrenaline-induced awakening that opens them up to supernatural powers, literally ripping their hearts out to transform into beastly figures. In battle, they transform into what are called Archetypes when casting spells or using certain types of attacks – they work more like RPG classes job system than they do than the Pokemon-like personas or demons from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-review">Shin Megami Tensei</a>. And instead of the Velvet Room or World of Shadows where you build a roster for combat, Metaphor has what’s called Akademia (which serves a similar purpose) where you assign and customize Archetypes for each party member.</p><p>When the preview demo fast-forwarded to much further into the story, the Archetype mechanics opened up significantly. Every character can unlock and spec into any of the 40-or-so Archetypes – a few of which include the spell-focused Mage, the swift trickster of Thief, the more balanced Seeker, and the tank-like Warrior. While I didn’t get to experience how deep it goes, I saw the various branches of Archetypes which also hinted at how they’ll evolve over the course of the game. Each of these come with their own stats that dictate combat roles, but also come with specific elemental affinities and spells, so party composition is still a fundamental part of Metaphor much in the same vein as a Persona or SMT.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Metaphor’s turn-based RPG combat leans heavier into SMT with the press-turn system where you earn extra actions for each turn phase, as opposed to Persona’s one-more and baton pass system. Although the naming conventions for certain elemental abilities have changed (light, dark, and buff spells have not, by the way), the flow is very familiar since you’re still targeting enemy weaknesses to get through battles effectively. A new wrinkle, however, is how you cast multi-target spells – in Metaphor, Synthesis attacks consume two turn icons and combine the elemental powers of two characters in order to execute devastating specials, including multi-target spells. It made me think more strategically about when I should use these kinds of abilities, but it’s also a clever rework since I no longer have to dedicate a character’s limited action slots to these spell types.</p><p>Another smart way Metaphor rethinks the formula is in how you initiate combat. There’s a real-time action element where you attack enemies in the dungeon to gain a turn advantage and damage foes before jumping into the turn-based battles. It’s a bit more involved than stealthy ambushes in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-5">Persona 5</a>, and instead of repeatedly churning through low-level enemies, you can reach a point where you just hack and slash through the fodder entirely. However, enemies fight back in the overworld so you have to approach them carefully and dodge their attacks, lest you yourself get ambushed and put at a severe disadvantage. While the action element isn’t intended to be in-depth and is more of a preface to the full battles, it improves pacing by having a more sensible flow between exploration and combat.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Metaphor’s lasting impact will be in how its political storytelling comes together.</p></div><p>When I jumped later into the story, I was able to explore the humble town of Martira and experience how the day-night cycle and calendar system work. Spending time to understand the cultures of the world and the different peoples who embody them to build bonds is a revamp of the Confidant/Social Link mechanics, and these feed into combat since they unlock new Archetypes and abilities. Taking part in certain activities boosts social stats to let you access new interactions or quests as well. There’s still a countdown of days until a major story event happens, requiring you to progress the main quest at the appropriate pace and make tough decisions about how you spend your limited time in each phase of the day – as is Persona tradition. But from a conceptual level, winning the hearts and minds of seemingly disparate peoples amid political turmoil while carrying out your own personal mission fits this gameplay framework incredibly well.</p><p>Time management isn’t just about how you spend parts of your day either. Going on expeditions for quests to far-off locations across the kingdom consumes multiple days, pushing you to plan ahead and think about what’s worth doing. During expeditions on your Gauntlet Runner (the ground-based ship that works like a mobile headquarters), you can access unique interactions with characters while in transit, so it’s not like you’re simply burning days off the calendar. I got to strengthen my bond with the former royal knight Hulkenberg better through her love for tabletop games, and I cooked with my guy Strohl to get know him better while making healing items. Sidequests themselves involve battling through curated dungeons and bosses, and also present supplementary story content you wouldn’t see from the main quest alone. Metaphor is said to be packed with so much side content that the development team claimed you won’t be able to complete it all in one playthrough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Playing five hours of Metaphor ReFantazio proved what I’d been thinking for years since I fell in love with Persona – that the series foundation could reach new heights if used in a different context. And the context here is a violent political fantasy drama. The daily structure and social sim mechanics built around a turn-based RPG are so familiar but have been revamped in several small yet impactful ways, and it’s shaping up to be a brilliant, synergistic way of exploring an entirely new and fascinating fiction in the comfort of a framework I already know and love.</p><p>Aside from the bold new soundtrack from longtime Atlus composer Shoji Meguro (who’s now wielding classical orchestras and a Latin-style choir), Metaphor’s lasting impact will be in how its political storytelling comes together. A preview demo of a lengthy RPG isn’t going to reveal that, of course, but it’s showing promise with characters who make great first impressions, narrative themes that are clearly inspired by the problems we face in our real world, and a signature style full of powerful imagery. </p><p>I was also left with questions I’m eager to seek the answers to. There's this book that the protagonist is always carrying with him, and it contains a story of a utopia where everyone has happy and prosperous lives with images vaguely representing our reality. And the very first thing you do in Metaphor is name <em>yourself</em> before naming the protagonist. Given the crueIty displayed and the statements it makes early on, I can't stop thinking about what Metaphor will ultimately say about virtues and perils of the human condition. It won’t be long until we get those answers because Metaphor ReFantazio launches on October 11 this year for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and 5, and PC.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-the-first-preview.965949/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ever since I pitted my brand new Bulbasaur against my rival’s Charmander in the opening chapter of Pokémon Red, I’ve loved turn-based combat. But I know this style of battle isn’t for everyone. Plenty have skipped over the likes of Baldur’s Gate 3, Persona 5, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns because of the slower, more managerial-like pace of turn-based combat. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 wants to provide the solution to those issues. The upcoming RPG has plenty of smart ideas that aim to evolve turn-based battles, transforming them from baton-passing attack sequences to thrilling, skill-based conflicts. </p><p>I recently met with developer Sandfall Interactive to watch creative director Guillaume Broche play through just under an hour of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. While clearly inspired by Japanese RPG titans like Final Fantasy, Clair Obscur feels distinctly European. Rather than sporting outrageous anime hair and a sword larger than the Empire State Building, protagonist Gustave is a handsomely dressed gent with a face that could be almost mistaken for Robert Pattinson’s. During my demo, he and the equally elegant mage Lune explored the ocean floor-like Flying Waters region, picking through the remains of prior expeditions that had been scattered among the coral. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Gustave and Lune are the latest team attempting to defy the will of the Paintress, a god-like figure who kills scores of people each year by painting a number on a monolith. Anyone of that age instantly fades away, Infinity War style. The demo’s short hour duration didn’t allow for much insight into this story, but what was obvious was the dark and melancholic tone. It seems somewhat literary in a manner I found very appealing, rooted in its character's emotions and fears. </p><p>Gustave was soon reunited with his foster sister, Maelle, who’d been lost in a manor that lies beyond the boundaries of time and space. Together with Lune, the trio formed a full party, which brings us to those aforementioned evolutionary ideas for turn-based combat. Broche tells me that he was inspired by Sekiro’s parry system to implement skill-based elements into the genre’s traditional tactical framework. The result is quick time event-augmented turns, with reflex and timing-based actions required in both the attack and defend phases. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Clair Obscur’s action elements really impress: you can dodge, jump, or parry every incoming blow.</p></div><p>Clair Obscur isn’t the first turn-based RPG to use QTEs in combat, but it’s the first I’ve seen that seems to put equal emphasis on both the action and tactical aspects. Every attack demands some kind of input, be that reflex-testing button prompts or manually aiming a weapon at targets. More complex attacks chain together QTEs, providing a better sense of kinetic energy in each phase of the fight. </p><p>But it’s when your characters are on the defensive that Clair Obscur’s action elements really impress: you can dodge, jump, or parry every incoming blow, and perfect deflects trigger powerful counter-attacks. Gone are the days of just watching a boss unleash hell on your party – here you can actively avoid and punish damage. Broche tells me that you can even do a no-hit run of the entire game, right up to and including the final battle. </p><p>Alongside these pacier ideas are more traditional staples. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 uses a menu-driven interface that looks like Persona 5’s UI as translated by Dishonored. Each move requires a character to spend from their pool of action points, which gradually increases as the turns tick by (an idea inspired by card game mana systems). Parries refund one action point, so there’s an incentive to try and nail that parry window – the better you defend yourself, the better attacks you can unleash on the next turn. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Each character’s ability set is unique to them, which hopefully makes them feel like significant individuals both in and out of combat. Spearheading their kits are special skills with bespoke mechanics; Lune is able to ‘stain’ enemies with her spells and then later consume those stains to inflict big damage, while Maelle is able to switch through a variety of stat-altering stances depending on which attacks she uses. </p><p>Sandfall Interactive also promises a deep progression system for each party member. Each level attained allows you to upgrade each character’s stats Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style, as well as choose a new ability from a skill tree. On top of that are Pictos, trinkets that provide tactic-shifting passive skills (such as parries granting an extra action point), plus the unique properties of the weapons each party member wields. Broche tells me that combining and upgrading these elements in the right way can unlock wild and destructive synergies. I hope this character build system, combined with the developer-crafted ability kits, allows players to put together fascinating, tactics-driven parties akin to the way that card game players hone a deck to a particular strategy.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is almost like a next-gen Final Fantasy from an alternate timeline.</p></div><p>Due to the somewhat contextless nature of the demo, much of what I saw outside of combat was harder to judge. What I did take away was the sense that this is almost like a next-gen Final Fantasy from an alternate timeline; like Square’s JRPGs of old, Clair Obscur is not open world, opting instead for linear regions complete with save point-like resting spots. Sandfall promises these regions have been built to be expansive enough to allow off-the-beaten-path adventures, though, including optional bosses. At this stage, I can’t say how strong Clair Obscur’s exploration chops are, but what I saw ranged from the relatively mundane (shoot three symbols to unlock loot) to the ethereal (a child NPC peeling away into the ether like an ancient painting) to the genuinely funny (a sentient, French-speaking paintbrush called Noco, who will sell you his best wares provided you fight his gigantic boss form). </p><p>While I’ve yet to form any significant opinions on its wider gameplay ideas, I can say that I really liked what I saw of Clair Obscur’s world. It has concepts and characters I’m looking forward to delving into, strong voice acting, and a genuinely gorgeous graphical style. But the thing I’m really excited about is the smarts-skills-smarts loop the fights seem to thrive on. A cerebral moment of lining up a clever attack is followed by a speedy burst of rhythmic button taps, a perfectly-judged parry, and then it’s back to quietly contemplating exactly what attack will rupture your foe’s defences. Staunchly traditional turn-based fans may consider this up-and-down tempo a bit too jarring – tactical combat for the short-attention-span generation. But from my perspective at least, this is the fresh approach the system has needed for some time. I hope, when I finally get to play Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 myself, it proves itself to be a more involving turn-based experience as opposed to a system that simply makes concessions to the action-loving crowd.</p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The more you know.</p><h2>What is Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster?</h2><p>The first Suikoden game released in Japan on the original PlayStation in 1995, with the sequel coming out in 1998 on the same platform. The games made it to the West a year after their Japanese release. Each game in the series focuses on having you recruit 108 warriors to fight by your side. So your job is to build up an army and fight the forces of evil.</p><p>Some remasters have completely overhauled graphics, which runs the risk of losing the charm of the original. That does not appear to be the case here. The original pixelated graphics are pretty intact, but now they fill modern wide-screen displays. They've also redone some of the spell effects to look better and more smooth, and redrawn the character portraits in HD.</p><p>In addition to the improved graphics, you now have the ability to speed up battles, or turn on an auto-battle mode. The game also has auto-save and a conversation log, in case you accidentally tap a button to progress the conversation before reading it (this happens to me all the time in RPGs). It also has a revamped UI, making things like changing equipment easier.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Suikoden I&amp;II Nintendo Direct August 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output></p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-is-up-for-preorder-out-september-6">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Sid Meier's Civilization VII Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-preorder-guide">Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-switch-ps4">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-xbox-pc">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster">Suikoden 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-release-date-preorder">Super Mario Party Jamboree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Here is an overview of the remastered release, via Argonaut Games:</p><blockquote><p><em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</em>, Argonaut’s 1997 multi-million-selling hit, features Croc, a lovable crocodile who embarks on a quest to rescue the Gobbos from the clutches of the evil Baron Dante. The game’s charm and creativity made it an instant classic, and the remaster promises to bring the beloved game to a new generation of gamers with enhanced high-definition graphics, updated modern control mechanics, and a nostalgic, fun, and authentic gameplay experience that will be sure to ignite the imagination of players and remind them why they fell in love with video games in the first place.</p><p>Additionally, retro-gaming fans will be excited to learn that the remaster includes the Crocipedia, an extensive and meticulously curated digital museum containing long-lost development assets such as game design documents, concept art, animation tests, team member interviews, and much more.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_909909"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“I worked closely with Jez on the design and production of <em>Starglider</em>, Argonaut’s first big hit back in 1986, so to take up the mantle of relaunching Argonaut Games nearly four decades later brings me full circle, and we have further exciting announcements in the pipeline in the coming months,” said Argonaut Games co-CEO Gary Sheinwald in a press release.</p><p>Argonaut Games co-CEO Mike Arkin added, “We wanted to honor the original game’s legacy while introducing it to a new audience. The HD remaster allows us to do just that. It’s been a labor of love for our team, and we can’t wait to share it with players on all the current consoles and PC later this year.”</p><p>Original Argonaut Games founder Jez San said, “I’m thrilled to see the Argonaut name back after 20 years away. Argonaut was always about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in gaming, and I’m excited to see how the relaunched Argonaut Games builds on that legacy, starting with the <em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</em> remaster.”</p><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer for <em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</em> below.

<p>In a new loosely translated <a href="https://x.com/ryugagotoku/status/1828767174678507927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Like a Dragon developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced that it will host another anticipated RGG Summit in September 2024.</p>

		<p>There’s no doubt about it, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the best looking games that’s expected to release next year. Built in Unreal Engine 5, it’s got the technical backing and prowess that this offers, but this would be nothing without the arresting art direction and the world that Sandfall Interactive is creating for their RPG.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Reveal Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDyqGZy78Ng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s a deep and mournful sadness to the world of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, a resignation to the inevitability of the fate of its people to simply disappear into nothingness one year at a time. That’s all thanks to the Paintress, who wakes up once a year, paints a number on a monolith and curses all the people of that age to turn into ashes and simply fade away. There’s echoes of Logan’s Run, but it’s steeped in an even greater tragedy as that number drops down and down and down.</p>


<p>What purpose the Paintress has in doing this, it’s far from clear right now, but just as she paints a number each time, an expedition is sent out each time to battle through a mysterious continent and try to stop her… or at least beat a path for those who will follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p>The visual style of this game is inspired by Belle Époque France, a period of 40-odd years that saw art leap from Impressionism through post-Impressionist movements, to Art Nouveau and beyond. I get the feeling that (while it precedes this specific time period by a couple years), Jules Vergne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas might have also provided some inspiration, not least because the gameplay demonstration saw our Expeditioners trying to reunite underwater and encountering… well, lots of strange stuff.</p>


<p>Despite very clearly being underwater, Expedition 33 don’t need to don diving suits and air tanks in order to survive, nor are they beholden to the buoyant physics of moving around at the bottom of the sea. As Gustave and Lune explore this strange environment, trying to find trace of their other companions, they will happen upon previous expeditions –&nbsp;in this demo it was Expedition 68, who you’ll then have the opportunity to learn more about and the trials that they faced.</p>
<p>That’s obviously rather ominous, and feeds into the hopeless-feeling endeavour, but so is where Gustave and Lune manage to find Maelle: a strange mansion where she’s being kept at the pleasure of a deeply unsettling being, the Curator. Thankfully they seem to be some kind of ally, helping to focus Maelle’s abilities and pushing her to train in combat.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur leans on tried and true forms for turn-based RPG combat, but throws in a few unique twists and combines ideas in an invigorating fashion. This is a turn-based affair, with the order of characters displayed clearly on the left side of the screen, while the menu of options fans out from your character in a manner that feels reminiscent of the Persona series. However, once you choose which attack to unleash, you’re greeted with an active QTE component that fans of Mario’s set of RPGs will be familiar with, timing a button press to ramp up the power of your attack or bolstering an ability, and when enemy attacks are incoming, dodging or potentially countering them right back –&nbsp;a high risk option as you need to block all incoming attacks in order to counter.</p>

<p>This is all rendered in Clair Obscur’s lavish style, with a particularly dynamic camera following sweeping animations, slow-mo and swirling effects to give each attack, ability and counter an artistic flair that looks simply awesome.</p>
<p>That would potentially be compelling enough, but Clair Obscur adds a few additional ideas into the mix as well. Ranged attacks can be free-aimed, letting you try to pinpoint an enemy weakness – or in the case of a boss battle, targeting the flowers that it spawns in a light puzzle mechanic – and each character has their own particular tweaks to factor. Lune’s role as a mage allows her to build up Stains that can then be spend to add damage to attacks later in the battle, while Maelle has different stances.</p>

<p>This was just a fairly brief glimpse at what Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 offers, the time available not able to show off the game’s more open zones, for example. However, it’s safe to say that this is a game than any turn-based RPG fan should be keeping an eye on. It looks stunning, the cause is utterly futile and hopeless, and the battle mechanics pick and choose ideas to weave together an engaging looking brand of combat. We can’t wait to see more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/metaphor-refantazio-preview-the-years-most-beautiful-rpg/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A mouthful in all senses, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, an original IP from Studio Zero – a team made up of Persona veterans – continues to stretch the word soup of game names to its limit. But what does it mean? Well, just like part of its namesake, it’s an idea, a comparison, and an image that is designed to take your mind to unexpected places. This becomes even more clear when you actually play it, with Metaphor: ReFantazio drawing on the grotesque and off-kilter ideas of the Persona franchise and spinning them out into an all-new RPG experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metaphor: ReFantazio — Travel Beyond Fantasy | Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_-BPELOl0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>My word, does it looks good! From the fully animated cutscenes, via the imaginative character and creature designs, the anime-esque gameplay envelops you in a fantasy world that’s totally its own.</p>


<p>Our playthrough starts with a murder. The king, already seemingly on his deathbed, has a blade plunged into his body, potentially sending the kingdom spinning off into chaos, as his only heir had recently died himself. There’s foul play afoot and Louis, a behorned knight, is at the centre of it.</p>
<p>You take on the role of a young Elda boy, whose origin in the story starts by being kicked off a cliff. Accompanied by the fairy Gallica, a slightly more combative Tinkerbell, you’re on a vital mission to infiltrate the royal guard, though that’s as far as your knowledge goes at this point. Perhaps it was the fall off a cliff.</p>

<p>As well as being our companion, the opening of our demo sees Gallica cast our character’s favourite spell, which suddenly brings the world to life with music. I love the idea that the soundtrack has been cast on our character rather than just accepting that every event is just accompanied by music. The vocal-led, high tempo track certainly makes things more dramatic, and throughout our hour with the game it’s often stunning.</p>

<p>Eight tribes and three nations make up the United Kingdom of Euchronia. As you’d expect, the city is more diverse than our characters have encountered out in the sticks, though it’s mainly two tribes – the Clemar and the Roussante – that you’ll see.</p>
<p>There’s some racial undertones at play within the fantasy setting, and as an Elda you’re looked down on by pretty much everyone else. Gallica speaks out against the prejudice, and here’s hoping that people become more accepting as you progress. It’ll be interesting to see whether the Studio Zero team use this opportunity for social commentary, or whether it’s purely a narrative tool.</p>
<p>You’re on the way to the Grand Cathedral, an inverted pyramid looming out of the desert. Despite the sandy setting, it’s a very British city that you’re visiting, with the localised language options using local accents to bed things in further, and Georgian-styled streets filled with people.</p>
<p>As you wander around you can listen in on all the gossip of the city-folk, with ‘PSST’ signs showing that you’re not really supposed to be listening in. It’s fun though, and gives the world some real grounding as the people talk in hushed tones about the assassination and how the country is going to hell. It’s so stereotypically British that you even get to join a queue. ‘Press A to join a queue’, might just be this winter’s favourite meme.</p>

<p>There were so many cutscenes in our hands-on that it feels as though this is a TV series that you’re occasionally playing, though I’m sure that balance is going to be a lot more gameplay-heavy across the finished game. What is does prove is how involved the storytelling is, and the production values are truly stunning. After an hour in this world I’m already fully invested in seeing where this tale goes.</p>
<p>Leon Strohl is your first companion, and it’s in his company that you first experience true battle. It’s here that it becomes clear who the monsters in this world are: they’re humans, though not exactly as you or I would know them. In fact, the first ‘human’ looks more like a dinosaur escaping from an egg, with vaguely human legs. So, there’s that.</p>
<p>You can start Squad Battles here, with turn-based combat playing out as you’d expect. You can choose to attack, defend, or utilise skills or items, gaining experience when the enemy is vanquished. You can surprise enemies by catching them unawares with a swipe of your sword, letting you enter combat with an unanswered attack and an initial stun which makes chopping them into bits a little bit easier.</p>

<p>During our hands-on this was the most straightforward aspect of Metaphor: ReFantazio, but the reassuring combat should allow the more unusual world and narrative room to breathe.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio was one of Gamescom 2024’s highlights, and a game to keep an eye on as we hurtle toward its <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/07/metaphor-refantazio-trailer-showcases-why-you-should-get-excited-for-this-rpg/">October release</a>. Our hands on gave us a massive taste of the world that Studio Zero are building, and it looks utterly fantastic across the board. Persona fans, or those seeking this year’s freshest RPG experience, should be salivating at the prospect.</p>

			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is a game that has been in the works for a very long time. Announced back in 2016 as Project Re: Fantasy, the first game by Studio Zero, a new ATLUS internal development studio headed by Persona 3, 4, and 5 director Katsura Hasino, the game only resurfaced <a href="https://wccftech.com/personas-team-fantasy-rpg-metaphor-re-fantazio-announced-for-a-2024-release/">last year</a> with a trailer that provided the first look at the project deeply rooted in traditional fantasy aesthetics. Even with a different setting, however, the Persona series DNA is still quite prevalent in Metaphor: ReFantazio, but that is not a bad thing at all, as I feel the game will be the first real step forward for the formula in a very long time.</p>
<p>During last week's Gamescom, I had the chance to play through the first hour of Metaphor: ReFantazio. Right from the beginning, I was hooked. The United Kingdom of Euchronia, the assassination of its king, and the main character's mission, which involves lifting the curse placed on the crown prince, was engaging from the start, as was the little world-building I experienced. The game's world seems to be rather complex, featuring multiple tribes with tense relationships among one another, which I expect to play a rather big part in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as everyone Persona fan knows, one hour of gameplay is too little to evaluate a massive game like Metaphor: ReFantazio, but I definitely appreciated how the adventure doesn't waste too much getting the main character and his fairy companion Gallica into the thick of things. As such, I was able to experience some short exploration sequences on the field surrounding the city of Grand Trad, and I couldn't help but notice how much better roaming around is compared to the latest Persona games. Fields, for example, are vast and filled with enemies and treasure, while cities are rendered in the proper scale that represents their grandeur rather nicely. Interaction with the environment and other NPCs was standard fare for JRPGs, but at least Metaphor: ReFantazio seems to do its best to properly represent the vastness of its world.</p>

</figure>


<p>In my hour with the game, I was also able to test out the game's combat system and explore one dungeon, the Northern Bord Fort, which honestly felt very straightforward and not particularly remarkable. Metaphor: ReFantazio employs the Turn Press combat system, which allows both player and enemy to obtain extra turns when hitting weaknesses, but with a new twist that gives players an advantage if they stun the enemy before entering combat by attacking them on the field. This is a great addition that does wonders for the game's pacing, even though this iteration of the Press Turn system is pretty snappy to begin with. For the rest, battles play the same as in the latest Persona and Shin Megami Tensei games: find an enemy's weakness, exploit it, and win the battle while avoiding getting one's own weaknesses exploited. I was unable to test out the Archetype system, unfortunately, as my time with the demo ended before it was properly introduced, and exactly when another feature from the Persona series got introduced: a time limit for main quests.</p>
<p>Evaluating a massive role-playing game like Metaphor: ReFantazio in just one hour is impossible, but my time with it during Gamescom definitely left me hungering for more. For the first time in a very long time, the formula of the Persona series is getting a much-needed shake-up, and I am very interested to see if the game will end up being something more than just Persona in a fantasy setting.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio will launch on October 11th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/18-CA-349076" rel="noopener" target="_blank">complaint</a>, which was picked up by <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1828561778978226446/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> (as well as the good folks at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/unionised-staff-at-cod-studio-raven-software-says-activision-is-stalling-over-contract-talks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VGC</a>), contains three allegations against Activision, Microsoft, and Raven Software itself.</p>
<p>Those allegations are as follows: "Refusal to Bargain/Bad Faith Bargaining", "Changes in Terms and Conditions of Employment", and "Concerted Activities (Retaliation, Discharge, Discipline)".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raven-software-activision.jpg?itok=N-Zm-QpX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raven-software-activision.jpg?itok=S5r0zdAS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Raven Software is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As noted by VGC and Totilo, Claude Cummings Jr, president of the Communications Workers of America union, said the union's members were "optimistic" that Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">Activision Blizzard acquisition</a> would speed things up for Raven Software's collective bargaining efforts.</p>
<p>However, he goes on to acknowledge that this "has not happened", imploring Microsoft to "address the concerns" raised in the complaint and to "make reaching a fair agreement a priority".</p>
<p>In response, Microsoft told Totilo and Game File that the company was "committed to negotiating in good faith". That, to me, seems a slightly mealy-mouthed response to a complaint that contains an accusation of doing exactly the opposite, but I'm not a legal expert.</p>
<p>Raven Software first announced its intention to unionize <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-is-unionizing-as-game-workers-alliance">back in early 2022</a>, and in June of that month, then-Activision head Bobby Kotick <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-to-start-talks-with-raven-software-union">declared the company's intention</a> to enter into "good faith" negotiations with said union.</p>

<p>It is, however, slightly disappointing to hear that Microsoft's acquisition doesn't seem to have done much to stop such behavior, at least not in the short-term.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the next couple of years, the situation for unions under Activision will improve, but that's got to start somewhere. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things gaming union-related.</p>

But we already knew a fair bit of that already, and Ethan Gach covered that side of things extensively when he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-6-atlus-fantasy-rpg-demo-1851553956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-6-atlus-fantasy-rpg-demo-1851553956">saw the game at Summer Game Fest</a></span>. I wanted to get a sense of what this new fantasy RPG Atlus had cooking was actually about. What I was most struck by was how overtly it tackles not only election anxiety and the various social issues that arise when people are fighting for power but also seems to be commenting on the futile notion of the fantasy genre as escapism…but Atlus wants to make sure you know the team has “no political agenda.”<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196572,195207" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-ui-collectors-edition-1851429642&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-ui-collectors-edition-1851429642"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a></span><em> </em>follows a young man and his fairy companion Gallica as they navigate the fantasy world of the United Kingdom of Euchronia, but despite its otherworldy nature, Atlus has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1667961162946994177&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1667961162946994177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explicit that this fantasy world is meant to “mirror” the real world</a></span>. Our hero is dragged into the world’s politics after the previous king is assassinated and the prince cursed, leading the protagonist to try and save his dear friend while the rest of the world is vying for political power. The ensuing election brings political turmoil to the surface as you travel through the world, with <em>Metaphor </em>delving into its own versions of classism, racism, and all the other -isms.<br></p><p><em>Metaphor</em>’s hero is part of the Elda tribe, one of the eight tribes found throughout the United Kingdom Of Euchronia. The Elda are viewed as “tainted” by the remaining seven tribes, and have been othered by everyone else. They’re seen as heretical against the teachings of the church and have become so rare in this world that some people don’t even believe they exist. There are systemic and cultural barriers that make it difficult for your character to navigate the world. Exploring a world already in the midst of political upheaval as a marginalized person lets you see the rot firsthand. That’s all well-worn territory, even in this team’s previous works like <em>Persona 5</em>, but the game’s portrayal of these ideas really struck me in how it frames the fantasy genre as escapism.</p><figure id="" data-id="f280de905b8594bf37cd19610472bacc" data-recommend-id="image://f280de905b8594bf37cd19610472bacc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two Metaphor characters shake hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two Metaphor characters shake hands." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f280de905b8594bf37cd19610472bacc" data-recommend-id="image://f280de905b8594bf37cd19610472bacc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two Metaphor characters shake hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The main character of <em>Metaphor</em> has a book that tells of a “fantasy” world that sounds a whole lot like ours. It depicts a modern-day metropolis, a completely unified world where everyone is equal and free to live as they choose. But we know that’s not how the real world actually operates, it’s very much projecting an idealized version, a fantasy, if you will, of reality. I’m curious to see if <em>Metaphor</em> examines that disconnect, and in the four hours I played, the game<em>&nbsp;</em>made several allusions to the fact that the real world seems to exist in this game. You name your hero and also yourself as a separate entity who guides him through his journey. The Akademia safe house in which you learn new truths about the world and expand your party’s jobs has books that reference your name. My theory is <em>Metaphor </em>is leading into a big metatextual twist that involves its fantasy world and its idealized vision of ours. That a fantasy world with so many problems that are analogous to ones we experience in the real world imagines mundane city skylines as its own form of escapism is a fascinating framing, especially when fantastical worlds full of impossible things are often used as an excuse by bad-faith actors to pretend works set within them should be viewed as entirely separate from ours and shouldn’t be beholden to any kind of real-world scrutiny.<br></p><h2 id="h1747"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is clearly based on real-world conflicts, but Atlus says it has “no political agenda”</strong></h2><p>After my hands-on, I sat down for a group Q&amp;A with a panel of Atlus developers with other members of the press. We asked about quest structures, combat design, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134">relationship building</a></span>, and plenty of other topics. But when it came to discussing the overtly political story, the conversation was in stark contrast to the game we’d been playing for several hours.</p><p><em>Metaphor </em>producer Junichi Yoshizawa explained through a translator that the election story allowed the team to portray “people putting in a lot of effort and power into making a better future.”</p><p>“We wanted to really focus on the power that it can potentially bring to make the world something better,” Yoshizawa said. “And of course, it being, you know, at times a battle, there’s also that festivity to it in trying to make the world better. So we wanted to bring that power to the forefront without ignoring it, but facing it head on depicted that realness within the state. We believe that it has that power to make changes. So this was an element that we had decided to incorporate from a very early conceptual stage.”</p><figure id="" data-id="0001f0f2019211dcaf84e0317dcd6416" data-recommend-id="image://0001f0f2019211dcaf84e0317dcd6416" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist pulls out his heart." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist pulls out his heart." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0001f0f2019211dcaf84e0317dcd6416" data-recommend-id="image://0001f0f2019211dcaf84e0317dcd6416" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist pulls out his heart." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Elections are one of the many tools that citizens have to try and enact change within society, and <em>Metaphor </em>doesn’t shy away from the imagery of the common people rising up against corruption to try and make the United Kingdom of Euchronia a better place. When Strohl, one of your party members, awakens to his <em>Persona</em>-like Archetype, he rallies a group of people to his cause, literally tearing his heart out and screaming into it like a microphone. <em>Metaphor</em> isn’t subtle about its ideology. But Yoshizawa immediately followed up his answer with the following:<br></p><p>“Of course, we have no political agenda or message that we want to push with this,” Yoshizawa said. “It’s more so a tool, if you will, that we decided to use to convey the story that we want to in this fantasy world. If there were to be an election, how would people would react to it, how people would think, what people would do to better the future for themselves? So we essentially took this concept as a tool as a motif to push our story to the forefront. So we do hope that separating from that sort of political agenda or message people truly get to enjoy this election perspective and tool within this fantasy story setting.”</p><p>Charitably, it seemed Atlus was most wary of Americans assuming this was in direct response to the vitriolic presidential election we are currently experiencing in 2024. Before any of us had a chance to play the game, Atlus played a video of <em>Metaphor </em>director Katsura Hashino introducing the game in which he made clear that its launching during an election cycle was merely a coincidence. I do believe that <em>Metaphor </em>is not a response to any specific election. I could even believe that there might not have been a specific inciting incident that inspired it, rather than just a long history of persecution, classism, and election anxiety that has plagued our world for centuries. But Atlus did, at least, acknowledge that the tribes are meant as a fantasy stand-in for how different cultures navigate political and identity-based anxieties.</p><p>“Nobody is perfect, so there are different ways that people face anxiety when they are confronted with it,” Yoshizawa said. “With that idea in mind, we decided to separate these tribes from the actual races that we see in real life where we created different tribes with [...] different sort of ways that they feel or how they feel or interact with anxiety. So we’ve taken away all these existing ideas of race and created these new tribes in this game with that as a foundation. So we believe that that is a very original concept for this game and something that we are proud of.</p><p>Here’s the thing, Atlus can say that <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>has no political agenda, but this isn’t a story that materializes out of thin air from a team that is imagining a worst-case scenario. Just because it’s not about a specific political campaign or candidate doesn’t mean it isn’t making a statement about the world we live in. The belief that the world can and <em>should </em>be made better than it is right now is an inherently political view that extrapolates beyond a fantasy setting.&nbsp;The attempts to distance itself from reality when it so pointedly mirrors current global, societal unrest isn’t surprising in the current landscape of the video game industry. No company who wants their game to sell millions of copies is going to say outright that “this game is about rising up against corrupt systems and those exist in our world.”</p><p>But saying your game has things to say about the way the world is doesn’t automatically mean you’re talking about Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Saying it’s all just hypotheticals when the game clearly unpacks the notion of the fantasy genre as idealized escapism undercuts the world the team built to examine class, political machinations, and othering. It was jarring to hear Atlus representatives’ attempts to distance <em>Metaphor</em>’s intriguing foundations from anything that might read as controversial. I mean, the game is literally called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kv2lVyWzRQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kv2lVyWzRQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“<em>Metaphor.”</em></a></span> Sometimes you just have to let the art speak for itself, and the excellent four hours I played of <em>Metaphor </em>shouted over even the sanitized answers from someone trying to sell me something.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoUq073Pp7I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent interview</a> with MinnMax, Astro Bot creative director Nicolas Doucet gave fans a clearer view of possible PSVR2 and PC releases for the upcoming game.</p>



<p>Early in the interview, Doucet said that there is “no chance” the new Astro Bot game is coming to PSVR2. They explained that it was “designed for a different medium,” and that Astro Bot “would be a different game” if released on that platform.</p>



<p>Just minutes later, the interviewer followed up about a potential PC launch, asking if Doucet had a message for PC players who are excited to play Astro Bot. Doucet replied that “we want to hear from you, absolutely, we want to hear from you.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following a series of rumors, Sony finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-officially-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Astro Bot</a> during the latest PlayStation State of Play showcase last May. The reveal trailer confirmed it will launch on September 6, 2024, and it will be available exclusively on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Since then, there have been a variety of updates on Astro Bot details. In a previous interview with Doucet just last month, the creative director also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-game-length-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed Astro Bot’s length</a>. They mentioned the game will last around 12 to 15 hours, without counting completionist collecting.</p>



<p>Fans also learned that Astro Bot will feature at least <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-biggest-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">150 PlayStation cameos</a>, and a leak later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-game-size-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed the game size</a> fans can expect.</p>

Set in the far future, humanity has gone to the stars in search for precious resources. And the planet orbiting our namesake star, Ruptura, while being a resource-rich open world is also rife with dangers.</p><p>In the teaser clip, we see our lone explorer face off against hordes of enemies charging a custom-built base. If that isn’t enough, our exploding star is mere minutes from releasing an apocalyptic fire wave on the planet’s surface. All of our fighter’s vitals are looking good, but Creepy Jar isn’t forgetting their roots in survival and eagle-eyed viewers will notice not only the health and armour stats for our player/character, but also the thirst, toxicity, and hunger levels, as well.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_909952"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Utilizing collected resources to create ammunition to load turrets as one line of defense, the player is valiantly attempting to protect a base under a full-scale assault and there’s no time to waste. As enemies make their way to destroy the base’s wind farm and storage buildings, a split-second decision is made to protect smelters and <a title="Genres > Crafting [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> pods from a terrifying new enemy assault on the other side of the base. While automated drones are busy zipping around their elevated tracks to deliver resources from location to location, the enemy assault becomes all but overwhelming. Making matters worse, our soldier looks up to see Ruptura ready to unleash its fiery blaze. With no time left to lose, the race is on to get to safety… but will he make it in time?</p><p>Taking what was learned over the five-year journey of <em>Green Hell</em>, Creepy Jar’s experience makes it the perfect developer to support <em>StarRupture</em>‘s three gameplay pillars of base-building, exploration, and combat. <em>StarRupture</em> sets itself in the story of man versus nature taking place in an otherworldly and breathtaking science-fiction environment where elemental cataclysms of extreme temperatures loom as a constant danger. The player takes up the mantle of a convict exiled from the Earth to serve their sentence by mining and expanding industrial production alongside researching new technology on a seemingly hospitable new planet rife with mystery and danger. Tasked with surviving the deadly waves of elements—not to mention facing down against hostile enemy monsters in tense combat—each cycle spells destruction yet ushers in a new era of growth and rebuilding. Played from a first-person perspective—adventuring solo or as part of an up-to-four-player group in cooperative mode—players will be able to explore, adapt, mine, gather resources, and build complex machinery to survive and prosper.</p><p>Though by definition it is a base-building simulator, <em>StarRupture</em> is much more. The game will invite players to push beyond, to stay resilient and sharp against every assault, building and forming prior to the cycling eviscerating conditions on an otherwise beautiful planet. For fans of builders, management, science-fiction <a title="Genres > Action [2,127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, and combat <em>StarRupture</em> will challenge all comers to utilize the technology at their fingertips and weather both the extremities and fierce enemies in order to survive and create a prosperous industrial complex.</p></blockquote><p><em>StarRupture</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,098 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/monument-valley-3-is-heading-to-netflix-games-to-avoid-app-store-compromise-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ustwo Games is revisiting the series that launched it into the stratosphere over a decade ago with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The threequel was unveiled at Gamescom 2024, but unlike its forebears will be shunning the App Store and launching exclusively on Netflix Games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn't the first time Ustwo has collaborated with Netflix. The studio launched </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Desta: The Memories Between</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> exclusively on the platform, which grants all subscribers access to a growing roster of video games on smartphones and other devices, before eventually bringing it to PC and Nintendo Switch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Monument Valley, though, is a different beast. When it launched in 2014, the atmospheric puzzler became a poster child for Apple's digital marketplace. The inevitable sequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, debuted exclusively on iOS in June 2017 before shuffling onto Android a few months later. So, what's changed?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer about Ustwo's decision to renew its partnership with Netflix on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, lead producer John Lau says the current incarnation of the App Store is a very different beast to the one that connected the studio with new audiences all those years ago.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you think about the choices one might have in the market economy, it's not the same as it was 10 years ago. I think discoverability is the key thing we're trying to maximise as much as possible. It's really important that we get our games in front of as many people as we can," says Lau.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He feels the App Store is currently more focused on surfacing free-to-play projects and titles that prioritize "high user-acquisition" above all else. As a result, he says it now makes a lot more sense for a morsel like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to venture onto mobile by way of a subscription service like Netflix Games, which he says will actually "allow people to see it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The thing about that is, it also allows it to stay Monument Valley rather than change its mechanics or do whatever else you need to do to survive in a different [ecosystem]," Lau continues. "[The Netflix Games deal is about] trying to make the kind of game we wanted to make, without having to compromise in order for it to survive in the kind of App Store that exists in the modern day."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game director Jennifer Estaris agrees. She emphasises the Netflix deal is about securing an audience, and points to the streamer's massive subscriber base–which currently includes almost 270 million households across over 190 countries–as a clear and obvious boon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q1/FINAL-Q1-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">In a recent fiscal report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Netflix stated it has an "audience of over half a billion people," and claimed developing and signing video games was a core part of its mission to create "great stories that appeal to lots of different tastes." Elaborating on that point specifically, Estaris states that families are a core part of Netflix's subscriber base, and feels </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will thrive among that demographic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although Netflix's lofty subscriber count makes for good reading, in 2022 it was reported that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/only-one-percent-of-netflix-users-have-downloaded-its-games">less than 1 percent of those paying customers had downloaded its games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's unclear how much the situation has changed, but there are signs of deeper engagement with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gta-trilogy-surpasses-a-reported-30m-downloads-on-netflix">Grand Theft Auto </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gta-trilogy-surpasses-a-reported-30m-downloads-on-netflix">Trilogy recently racking up 30 million downloads</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

			<p>The God Hand series began and ended with the release of the first entry in 2006, but if given a chance to revive any of the series he has worked on, director Shinji Mikami would choose it over every other.</p>
<p>In an interview with both the legendary creator of the Resident Evil series, among other franchises, and Goichi Suda, also known as Suda51, regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-gets-official-release-date/">Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</a> conducted during Gamescom last week, I asked which game or series they had worked on they would like to bring back and give another chance. Mikami-san answered first without hesitation, saying only "God Hand 2," to the cheering of most people in the room. Unfortunately, the chances of the game happening are very slim, considering CAPCOM owns the IP and has shown no interest in it since release, but still, maybe with enough demand, the Japanese publisher may give Shinji Mikami the chance to create the game and give modern players a taste of what it is that made the original so unique.</p>
<p>During the interview, Shinji Mikami and Suda51 discussed a variety of other topics as well, such as the possibility of a second entry in the Shadows of the Damned series, Suda51's desire to realize the original vision of the game, a potential complete edition of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/868520/killer7/">killer 7</a> featuring cut content and even a sequel, which he would very much like to create. Check back in the next few days for the complete interview!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-2tb-storage/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-could-come-with-2-tb-of-storage-will-likely-be-a-quiet-system-that-runs-cool-%E2%80%93-rumor.965820/</guid>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro could come with 2TB of storage, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the Broken Silicon podcast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> revealed that they have seen a PS5 Pro devkit and confirmed that it comes with 2TB of storage. While the storage space could be lower for the retail system, the fact that Microsoft is releasing an Xbox Series X with 2TB of storage suggests that Sony could do the same for what is effectively a premium gaming system.</p>
<p>On a related note, the PlayStation 5 Pro is likely to be a quiet console that runs cool. According to Moore's Law is Dead, the devkit uses the same power connector as the base model, meaning Sony is not going to push the system, keeping the same power draw. This, in conjunction with the transistor increase over the base model, should make the system quiet and cool.</p>
<p><iframe title="AMD 7600X3D Price, PS5 Pro TDP Leak, Zen 5 Windows 11 24H2, RDNA 4 Release Date | Broken Silicon 272" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/777_DEw3l5g?start=4200&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has quickly become one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming in 2024. After months of rumors, we ourselves <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/">heard</a> from a video game developer that the console will run Unreal Engine 5 better, and multiple reports from other sources essentially confirm the system is real and coming. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-launch-this-year/">According to Jeff Grubb</a>, the system is still scheduled for release this year, although the reveal timings are still unknown.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

						<h5>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club</h5><p><span>August 29, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>The Nintendo Switch has seen a lot of deep-cut releases over the past year, but arguably none slice quite as deep as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club</a>. A series of surprisingly-mature 8-bit visual novels written by Metroid co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/famicom-detective-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famicom Detective Club</a> games gained a certain amount of notoriety over the decades amongst hardcore Nintendo fans who like to keep up with the company’s unlocalized oddities. It certainly came as a surprise when Nintendo brought remakes of the first two Famicom Detective Club titles, The Missing Heir and The Girl Who Stands Behind, to worldwide audiences in 2021. While that was a big deal to a certain niche audience, the remakes didn’t exactly do Mario numbers, so many assumed the series might just disappear again. Thankfully, the surprises kept coming, with the first all-new entry in the Famicom Detective Club series launching tomorrow.</p>
<p>Is Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club a page-turning revival of Nintendo’s cult series? Or is this particular Detective Club not worth joining? Time to investigate…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club once again casts players as a rookie investigator (you determine your name) working for the Utsugi Detective Agency, although this time around you also get to step into the shoes of sprightly fellow investigator Ayumi Tachibana for some sections. Your latest case is set in motion when a middle school boy is found strangled to death with a paper bag bearing a creepy scrawled-on smile placed over his head. This bears resemblance to a local urban legend, The Smiling Man, who’s said to strangle teenage girls he finds crying before fitting them for a grinning paper bag so they’ll have a “smile that will last forever.” This legend was bolstered by a spate of actual murders of high school girls 18 years ago that were never solved. Is this new murder a continuation of the earlier crimes? If so, why was a boy killed instead of a girl? Is it a copycat crime? Or is something altogether different happening? It’s up to you to find out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even though it arrives over 35 years after the last original entry in the series, Emio - The Smiling Man sticks closely to retro visual novel conventions, with most of the game consisting of lengthy dialogue exchanges with various witnesses and other NPCs. Players have standard menu options available to them like “ask” and “show,” as well as the ability to “think” to yourself in order to spark a new line of questioning. You’ll also occasionally have to search the area you’re in point-and-click style for clues.</p>
<p>Despite this old-school approach, squeezing responses out of witnesses is often fairly engaging. Thankfully, Emio - The Smiling Man has been given a significantly better localization than either The Missing Heir or The Girl Who Stands Behind, which were often clunky to the point of being hard to follow. There’s no such issue with Emio, and it feels like efforts have been made to have the game’s story-progressing choices follow a more rational path than in the past. One question leads to the next in a logical way, finding new clues in the environment will spark new conversations, etc.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This doesn’t happen all the time, mind you. There are still plenty of moments when progressing in Emio just means exhausting all other options before the game presents a new line of questioning or place to go. Most irritating, there are certain points where it feels like the game is intentionally wasting your time, forcing you to click everything in a scene or jump back and forth between locations multiple times before you’re randomly given a chance to progress. And yeah, this kind of stuff was always a part of old-school visual novels and the simplicity this game means you’ll never get lost for <em>too</em> long, but I would’ve appreciated a better balance between logical and trial-and-error solutions (the split is about 60-40 as is).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, a game like this lives and dies based on the quality of its story, and thankfully, Emio - The Smiling Man delivers on that front. Don’t go in expecting the kind of wild, fourth-wall-breaking decadence of more modern visual novel series like Danganronpa, but Emio does a good job of building a solid, absorbing mystery block by block. All this is brought to life via simple-yet-clean visuals that are a subtle yet notable step up over the Famicom Detective Club remakes. The game even offers up a handful of basic cutscenes that deliver a surprising amount of creepy atmosphere.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While Emio - The Smiling Man moves at a rather deliberate pace over its 10-hour story, it all builds to a mostly satisfying finale. No, the game’s ending isn’t going to blow your mind with a volley of wild twists and turns, but it delivers the proper tone and largely holds together. If this ending was <em>actually</em> the ending, I would have chalked up Emio as an entertaining, if slightly unremarkable, detective yarn, but Nintendo goes and does something kind of wild after the credits roll.</p>

<p>Without giving anything away, Emio - The Smiling Man expands upon and reframes much of the story you’ve just been through in a surprising, complex, and decidedly dark epilogue.&nbsp;<span>It’s rare that I’m legitimately shocked by a video game that I ask, “Where the hell did&nbsp;<em>this</em> come from?” aloud while playing, but Emio got me.</span>&nbsp;Granted, some of the shock was due to the fact this was coming from <em>Nintendo</em>, but even without that caveat, this is pretty bold storytelling. Days later, the final hours of Emio - The Smiling Man are still rattling around my head, and if this is the direction Nintendo and Sakamoto want to take the Famicom Detective Club franchise in, I very much hope this isn’t their last case.</p>

<p>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club really sneaks up on you. For much of its runtime the game is a likable, if somewhat by the book, throwback detective visual novel, but Nintendo swings big in terms of narrative in its final hours, ultimately delivering a story that’s much more daring, dark, and affecting than anything this franchise has delivered before. Whether you’re a visual novel nut or just in the mood for a good mystery with some teeth, Emio will leave you grinning.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blue-protocol-canceled-in-the-west-japanese-service-to-end-in-january.965814/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced that it's shutting down action RPG&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol</em>'s service in Japan this January, and as a result, the game will also no longer get a Western release.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/507" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>website, Bandai Namco says it's shutting down&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>on January 18th in Japan, and that the Western release of the game, which was planned to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-amazon-games-explains-changes-you-can-expect-in-west-compared-to-japan">handled by Amazon Games</a>, will no longer go ahead.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco goes on to say that both it and Amazon are "disappointed" they won't be able to release&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>globally, acknowledging that there has been "great anticipation" for the game since it was first revealed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-protocol-canceled-combat.jpg?itok=VbCsvoMf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-protocol-canceled-combat.jpg?itok=SVClLNUn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>isn't coming West anymore.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer goes on to say that its goal with&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>was to create an experience "that is like stepping into the world of anime", and one that allows players to become "the main character of the anime".</p>
<p>However, Bandai Namco says it has "come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you". The studio signs off by apologizing for its "sudden announcement".</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear why Bandai Namco has chosen to shut down&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol</em>, but if it's anything like a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down">other</a> live-service <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocket-arena-will-be-officially-shut-down-in-march-2024">games</a> that have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-will-shut-down-echoes-of-mana-mobile-game-year-after-release">shut down</a> in recent times, it's likely due to dwindling player numbers or a lack of profitability.</p>
<p><em>Blue Protocol</em>'s shutdown and cancellation could also be part of Bandai Namco's initiative to refocus its development efforts on quality.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-will-refocus-game-development-on-quality-following-declining-financial">February financial report</a>, a then-new online game released by the studio performed below expectations, and while&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>isn't named, it's likely that's the game to which Bandai Namco is referring.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason might be, unfortunately, if you've been hoping to play&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>in the West sometime this year, you may have to look elsewhere for your anime kicks. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Bandai Namco.</p>

            <p>
Konami has announced the Castlevania Dominus Collection, a re-release of classic games from the series that originally launched on Nintendo DS.
</p>
<p>
As revealed during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-in-todays-nintendo-direct-and-indie-world-showcases">yesterday's Nintendo Direct</a>, the collection features <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-dawn-sorrow">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-portrait-ruin">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-order-ecclesia">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</a>. In addition, two bonus games are included: Haunted Castle (the arcade version of Castlevania) and Haunted Castle Revisited (a reimagined version).
</p>
<p>
The collection is available now for Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam).

<p>
Dawn of Sorrow was the first of these to be released in 2005, its name a nod to the DS console. It continued the same metroidvania design established by Symphony of the Night and continued on Game Boy Advance with Circle of the Moon, Harmony of Dissonance, and Aria of Sorrow.
</p>
<p>
Portrait of Ruin followed in 2006, and then Order of Ecclesia in 2008.
</p>
<p>
The collection includes quality of life additions like rewind and quick save, plus buttons and layouts for the original dual screens are fully customisable.
</p>
<p>
A gallery mode and encyclopedia include previously unreleased artwork and an exhaustive compendium of information on each game, while a music player features tracks from each game.
</p>
<p>
This Dominus Collection also follows the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-anniversary-collection">Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a>, which includes classics from the series, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-advance-collection">Castlevania Advance Collection</a>, which includes the three Game Boy Advance games plus Dracula X.
</p>
<p>
Still, when will we get a Castlevania: Symphony of the Night re-release?
</p>
<p>
The series featured last year in the excellent indie roguelite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-expansion-gets-march-release-date">Dead Cells</a>. Further, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylights-castlevania-collaboration-adds-dracula-and-trevor-belmont-later-this-month">latest chapter of Dead by Daylight celebrates the Castlevania series</a>.
