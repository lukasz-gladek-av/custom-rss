            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-destiny-2-copyright-lawsuit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie has been hit with a copyright lawsuit by an author claiming that the ideas in the game's Red War campaign are stolen from one of his works.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-lawsuit-allegedly-copying-destiny-2-red-war/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first reported by TheGamePost</a>, author Kelsey Martineau is accusing Bungie of infringing work he created under the pen name of Caspar Cole back in 2013 and 2014, several years before the release of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit&nbsp;alleges that the characters involved in both&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s Red War and Martineau's works "display very similar attitudes, histories, and mindsets", and that "only through a very unique set of actions" is Earth invaded on both counts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-copyright-lawsuit-giant-mech.jpg?itok=o7t6hKJy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-copyright-lawsuit-giant-mech.jpg?itok=fSR8vIhj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>has been hit with a copyright lawsuit by an author alleging the Red War campaign infringes on his work.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the lawsuit, which appears to be referring to multiple Martineau works rather than any one single story, Martineau first published his stories on WordPress, which "allowed readers to easily search and explore content", including his published works.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges similarities like both stories involving "a young and ambitious alien" with the goal of "dividing and conquering Earth in order to gain strategic assets", as well as organizations named the Red Legion, both of which feature soldiers known as Legionnaires.</p>
<p>Both Red Legions are interested in "acquiring superweapons that can turn the tide" of the respective wars depicted in both works, according to the lawsuit, and both works "focus on concepts relating to consciousness transfer and the ethical dilemmas" arising from such technology.</p>
<p>Lest you think things aren't specific enough yet, don't worry; Martineau's lawsuit goes on to allege that a number of specific elements in his work were copied by Bungie for&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-copyright-lawsuit-shooting.jpg?itok=zjpDFS08 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-copyright-lawsuit-shooting.jpg?itok=Ww9gNDyo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2</em>'s Red Legion has come under fire in a copyright lawsuit.</figcaption></figure><p>Specific elements Martineau claims Bungie copied include the backstory of Red War villain Dominus Ghaul, who's apparently very similar to a villain Martineau created called Yinnerah. Both of them lead their respective Red Legions, and they're both from humble beginnings.</p>
<p>Other similarities include&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s war beasts, which are apparently copied from animals in Martineau's work called "miogas", as well as superweapons called the Atonizer (in Martineau's work) and the Almighty (in&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>).</p>
<p>The list of allegations is lengthy and involved, and you can <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/775926297/Bungie-Faces-Copyright-Lawsuit-For-Allegedly-Copying-Destiny-2-s-Red-War-Storyline#from_embed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read the full lawsuit right here</a> (thanks again, TheGamePost) if you wish. Martineau's demands include the cessation of "manufacturing, producing...[and]...selling...materials that are substantially similar to&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>", as well as damages.</p>
<p>If the case goes ahead, it doesn't come at the best time for Bungie; the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">let hundreds of employees go</a> back in July as part of a "new path", and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>is about to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-new-release-cadence">embark on a new release schedule</a> as well. We'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>

The genre has waned in popularity, and can often seem overshadowed by more standard live service titles, but <em>Throne and Liberty</em> aims to shake things up with creative class design, gorgeous visuals, and an engrossing progression experience. Here’s what you need to know about this new MMO on the block.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,195410,196299" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h160"><a id=""></a><strong>What is Throne and Liberty?</strong></h2><p><em>Throne and Liberty</em> is a Korean MMO developed by NCSOFT and published by Amazon Games. Set in the open world of Solisium, what was once intended to be a sequel to <em>Lineage</em> has now become a unique property, although maintains the fantasy setting.</p><p>It provides PVE fans with a sweeping tale that sees you leveling up, taking on dungeons, and working through a series of intense quests as you seek to face off against a potentially world-ending threat.</p><p>If the PVE adventure isn’t enough for you, however, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is also a very guild-focused MMO with a heavy emphasis on PVP. So if you want to see everything the game has to offer, you’ll be able to join a guild and work together to take on contracts and defeat other players in both massive and small-scale battles.</p><p><em>Throne and Liberty</em> offers a tab-targeting combat system and abides by the holy trinity of design: tank, healer, and DPS—roles that are required to overcome its most challenging dungeons and encounters. Despite sticking closely to that familiar formula, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> shakes things up a bit by offering a shocking amount of freedom in how you can approach classes.</p><h2 id="h161"><a id=""></a><strong>How does <em>Throne and Liberty</em> handle classes?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="b1a560b126aba3e1bd270c656ce38b77" data-recommend-id="image://b1a560b126aba3e1bd270c656ce38b77" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant lion/lizard beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A giant lion/lizard beast." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b1a560b126aba3e1bd270c656ce38b77" data-recommend-id="image://b1a560b126aba3e1bd270c656ce38b77" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant lion/lizard beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike the average MMO, this game allows you to mix and match two main weapons to create any combination of your choosing. Do you want to wield a greatsword and a staff to become a badass battlemage? Cool! Go nuts slamming foes with your sword between casting fire and ice spells. Do you want to be a ranged DPS that can also heal? Combine the wand and tome with a longbow and unleash a flurry of arrows between casting restorative spells on you and your teammates.<br></p><p>While there are certainly meta combinations that allow for the very best stats for high-end PVE and PVP content, you never have to feel as if your off-meta pick will leave you out of the best parts of the game, as every combination can be a powerhouse in the right hands. Just choose what is most fun to you and go wild.</p><h2 id="h162"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Throne and Liberty</em> free-to-play?</strong></h2><p>Like many modern MMOs, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> has adopted a free-to-play (F2P) model. This means you can download the game for free on your chosen platform and play it forever without paying any type of subscription.</p><p>However, the game’s F2P design means that NCSOFT has implemented battle passes that can be purchased with real money, as well as an in-game shop where players can buy cosmetics, like outfits and transformations, and leveling passes that drastically improve the leveling experience that would otherwise require you to grind.</p><p>With this in mind, some may consider the game pay-to-win (P2W), but it’s not quite as egregious as similar titles. All of the gear and items can be obtained in the game simply by playing, but players who wish to speed up gear acquisition can do so. It’s still possible to move through the process at a reasonable speed without feeling like the game is punishing you too severely for not breaking out a credit card.</p><h2 id="h163"><a id=""></a><strong>What platforms is Throne and Liberty on?</strong></h2><p><em>Throne and Liberty</em> is available on <strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC</strong>. Due to the fairly high system requirements of the game, it’s unlikely we’ll ever see it make an appearance on the Nintendo Switch.</p><h2 id="h164"><a id=""></a><strong>Does Throne and Liberty have cross-play?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="7b6a69c2735af7bf2e7f0cb0dabc4037" data-recommend-id="image://7b6a69c2735af7bf2e7f0cb0dabc4037" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Now THIS is some cross play." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Now THIS is some cross play." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b6a69c2735af7bf2e7f0cb0dabc4037" data-recommend-id="image://7b6a69c2735af7bf2e7f0cb0dabc4037" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Now THIS is some cross play." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> offers cross-play. This means you can absolutely play with friends across various platforms. For instance, if you’re on PS5 and have friends on PC, you’ll be able to link up with them in-game with no hiccups.</p><p>That being said, <strong>you’ll need to be on the same server to play together</strong>, so you’ll still want to sync up with your pals before you drop in to be certain you don’t end up having to payreal money on a server transfer.</p><h2 id="h165"><a id=""></a><strong>Will my PC run Throne and Liberty?</strong></h2><p><em>Throne and Liberty</em> is a gorgeous game that is no doubt graphically a step above the average MMO.

<p>A major change could be coming at Ubisoft sooner rather than later. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-consider-buyout-of-ubisoft?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, the founders of Ubisoft, the Guillemot family, are considering a buyout from Tencent.</p>



<p>The discussions come after what’s been the most tumultuous year in the company’s history. Ubisoft has seen its shares <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-11-year-low-after-assassins-creed-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fall to 11-year lows</a>, games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws have struggled to sell</a>, and its biggest franchise, Assassin’s Creed, has seen its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next game delayed</a> into 2025.</p>







<p>“The Chinese tech company and&nbsp;Guillemot Brothers Ltd.&nbsp;have been speaking with advisers to help explore ways to stabilize Ubisoft and bolster its value,” the Bloomberg report states. </p>



<p>It’s said that one of the options on the table would involve taking the company private. That said, talks are “at an early stage” with no certainty that an agreement will be reached. </p>



<p>“Tencent and the Guillemot family are also considering other alternatives,” sources told Bloomberg.</p>

<p>The idea of Ubisoft going private isn’t new. Recently, there’s been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a major push</a> from smaller investors to do just that. It’s even gotten support from at least <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investor-says-it-has-support-of-10-shareholders-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10% of the company’s shareholders</a>.</p>



<p>Tencent currently owns 10% of Ubisoft, the company founded by the Guillemot family in 1986. CEO Yves Guillemot has been in his position since 1988, but, as part of the aforementioned push for a sale by investors, has seen requests for his removal.</p>



<p>Neither Ubisoft nor Tencent have commented publicly on this report. </p>



<p>What do you think of the idea of Tencent buying out Ubisoft to take it private? Join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/738/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/solid-snake-actor-david-hayter-sparks-metal-gear-speculation-by-teasing-return-to-role<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>David Hayter, the veteran voice behind Metal Gear’s Solid Snake, has teased a return to the iconic role he last played over a decade ago.</p><p>Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima controversially replaced Hayter as Snake with 24 star Kiefer Sutherland for 2015’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain">Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</a>. Hayter last played Snake in 2010’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a>.</p><p>But could a return be on the cards? That certainly seems likely following a cryptic tweet from Hayter himself. “I was in the booth today,” he said. “Playing a role I’ve not played, since…” Hayter followed that tweet up with a gif of Snake in the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/s15E4YlW2u" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/s15E4YlW2u</a></p>— David Hayter (@DavidBHayter) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidBHayter/status/1842129046991417481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>At first glance it looks like Hayter is in the booth to record Snake voice lines for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the hotly anticipated remake of Metal Gear Solid 3. However, Konami has confirmed Delta uses the same dialogue audio as the original Snake Eater and thus all cinematics are frame-for-frame and line-for-line identical.</p><p>So, what’s Hayter teasing? Fans have all sorts of theories. It could be promotional work for Metal Gear Solid Delta, or extra content set to come with the game. Alternatively, it could be voice work for an upcoming Sonic fan film called Sonic Villains, which Hayter is meant to be voicing Solid Snake for as part of an unofficial cameo.</p><p>More exciting is the suggestion that Hayter is reprising his role as Snake for an unannounced Metal Gear Solid game. If that’s true, what could it be?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Metal Gear Review</h3></div></output><p>In June last year, fans spotted that inspecting the Metal Gear Solid timeline page on the official Metal Gear Solid website revealed placeholder buttons for Metal Gear Solid 4, Metal Gear Solid 5, and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker — <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-4-finally-freed-from-ps3-as-part-of-leaked-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2"><u>three games IGN understands will indeed form a part of the unannounced Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</u></a>. Perhaps Hayter is recording new voice work for one or all of these games. Or maybe Konami has a brand new Metal Gear game up its sleeve and Hayter has parachuted in to reprise the role.</p><p>It’s a mystery for now, but we can perhaps rule out a remake of the first Metal Gear Solid game. Konami recently said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-says-remaking-metal-gear-solid-1-would-be-harder-than-metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">remaking the groundbreaking original would be much more complicated than its incoming Metal Gear solid 3 remake</a> because it would require the creation of many brand new elements.</p><p>"Metal Gear Solid Delta seems more like a very shiny HD remaster than the elegant remake it could have been," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview"><u>IGN said in our </u>Metal Gear Solid Delta <u>preview</u></a>.

That isn't always a bad thing, though. Case in point: Silent Hill 2, a fantastic remake of a horror classic. It can, however, definitely be a bad thing. Just like the incredibly boring Joker: Folie à Deux. We have reviews of both this week, as well as thoughts of Hell Is Us, the Until Dawn remaster (remake?), and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.</p>Remember to send us your thoughts about all the new games, TV shows, and films you're enjoying or looking forward to: ign_ukfeedback@ign.com.<p><a href="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/FGADCC/traffic.megaphone.fm/SBP4473650064.mp3?updated=1728047652" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN UK Podcast 768: Pure Misery, Both Good and Bad</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://dcs-spotify.megaphone.fm/SBP3498672310.mp3?key=53417be550c84136dd973a08c552ec3f&amp;request_event_id=8d80cfb9-a6fd-4ecd-81dd-f9658ee05316&amp;timetoken=1727454637_283A8244874B3925845A8F8D2EDE1461" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN UK Podcast 767: Where's Tokyo Games Tho?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/FGADCC/traffic.megaphone.fm/SBP7509498677.mp3?updated=1726833643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN UK Podcast 766: PlayStation Series That Need to Come Back</a></li><li><a href="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/FGADCC/traffic.megaphone.fm/SBP7444805934.mp3?updated=1726234644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN UK Podcast 765: PS5 Pros and Biscuit Pockets</a></li><li><a href="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/FGADCC/traffic.megaphone.fm/SBP1983745814.mp3?updated=1725622738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN UK Podcast 764: Bots, Bolters, and Blood</a></li><li><a href="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/FGADCC/traffic.megaphone.fm/SBP1404703645.mp3?updated=1725011174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN UK Podcast 763: Star Wars Outlaws, MGS Delta, and Alien: Romulus</a></li></ul></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now Atari and IDW Publishing have joined forces to release a Yars Rising prequel comic.</p><p>With the preorder deadline for Yars Rising #1 happening on Monday, October 7, IGN can exclusively debut a new preview of the first issue. Check it out in the slideshow gallery below:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Yars Rising Prequel Comic: Exclusive Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p>Yars Rising #1 is a one-shot special written by WayForward's Adam Tierney and drawn by Ele Bruni, with cover art by Ashleigh Hetrick. As the preview shows, the comic retains the unusual anime-inspired aesthetic of the game. The comic is set before the events of the game, as hacker extraordinaire Emi Kimura and her friends deal with the consequences of a job gone bad.</p><p>"I'm thrilled to be working with Atari and IDW on the official Yars Rising one-shot comic book prequel," Tierney tells IGN. "While developing the Yars Rising video game, I loved writing dialog for our crazy hacker crew of Emi, Mal, Anthony, and Kyan. So it was a blast to revisit these characters in comic book format, and see how they work together in an earlier (but just as dangerous) adventure that takes place right at Emi's home. I couldn't think of a better publisher for this book than IDW or a more perfect artist than the amazing Ele Bruni. I hope everyone enjoys the Yars Rising video game, out now on PC and consoles, and very soon, the official comic book prequel, too!"</p><p>Yars Rising #1 is priced at $4.99 will be released on November 13, 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>For more upcoming comics, check out IGN's picks for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-new-comic-book-releases-of-october-2024">the biggest new comic book releases of October 2024</a> and see <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mrballen-presents-strange-dark-mysterious-graphic-novel-preview">an exclusive preview of MrBallen Presents: Strange, Dark &amp; Mysterious</a>.</p><p><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

            <p>The Case of the Golden Idol is getting a little bit of a makeover.</p>
<p>Developer Color Gray Games has detailed a new Redux version of its detective murder mystery game, and it's set for Steam and Switch.</p>
<p>This Redux version of Case of the Golden Idol will overhaul the game's UI and add a new hint system. It will also offer 13 new localisations, readability and save improvements, and "dozens more" quality-of-life changes. All of this will make for a "much more seamless and enjoyable experience", the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1677770/view/4677641741933164088">developer said</a>, particularly highlighting Steam Deck.</p>

</figure>
<p>"In the spirit of making sure every version of The Case of the Golden Idol is the definitive version to play," Color Gray Games wrote, "we will ship a free update that will provide all of these enhancements to the original Golden Idol experience on Steam".</p>
<p>It reiterated that everyone who already owns the game will receive these upgrades free of charge, when it goes live. As for when that will be, that's 10th October.</p>
<p>From that day, those on Steam will "receive a prompt when launching the game asking which version they wish to play". If players choose to go down the Redux release route, they will be able to transfer progress from the original to the Redux version of Case of the Golden Idol.</p>
<p>On the console side of things, the developer noted Xbox and PlayStation players won't notice any changes, as the game is already built on the Redux version for these platforms.</p>
<p>It's a bit different for Switch players, however. The studio said the original version of Case of the Golden Idol will be delisted from Nintendo's platform on 9th October, with the Redux version then taking its place.</p>
<p>"Anyone that owns or purchases the current version of Case on this platform before this date will retain the ability to play this version, and will be granted the Redux release of the Complete Edition free of charge," Color Gray Games said. Unlike with Steam, the Nintendo Switch does not support save transfers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-case-of-the-golden-idol-review-model-murder-mystery-mayhem">Eurogamer was rather fond of The Case of the Golden Idol</a> on its release in 2022, with Alexis Ong calling it an "excellent period murder-mystery".</p>
<p>"For me, Golden Idol's biggest triumph is the understated writing - this is a story with full-throated confidence in the player's deductive abilities, which elevates this from a basic murder-mystery game to a singular piece of narrative art," she wrote in her review.</p><p>As for the future, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-case-of-the-golden-idol-is-getting-a-70s-set-murder-mystery-sequel-next-year">sequel known as The Rise of the Golden Idol</a> is on the cards (you can check out a trailer for it above).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-4-night-mario-rabbids-director-new-studio<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Davide Soliani, an ex-Ubisoft developer best known for his work on the&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids&nbsp;</em>franchise, has announced a brand new studio by the name of Day 4 Night.</p>
<p>Soliani <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-rabbids-creator-davide-soliani-leaves-ubisoft">left Ubisoft after 25 years with the company</a> back in July, and it looks like this is what he was cooking up. He's joined at the helm of the studio by&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Shadow of Mordor&nbsp;</em>writer Christian Cantamessa.</p>
<p>Along with Soliani and Cantamessa, Day 4 Night's staffers include ex-Ubisoft Milan writer Cristiana Nava,&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids&nbsp;</em>producer Gian Marco Zanna, and Luca Breda, who's served as a combat director on the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids</em>. It's a real Ubisoft talent exodus.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-rabbids-day-4-night.jpg?itok=IbfGupf1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-rabbids-day-4-night.jpg?itok=aCy-6JwJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Day 4 Night's creative team has worked on franchises like&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Just Dance&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ghost Recon</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio may have just formed, but it's already secured its first round of funding, with&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher (as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton"><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>mobile studio</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion">current Tango Gameworks owner</a>) Krafton providing some of the cash.</p>
<p>Another company providing funding for Day 4 Night is 1Up Ventures, an investment outfit founded by entrepreneur and Xbox co-creator Ed Fries. As you can see, there are some pretty hefty names behind Day 4 Night already.</p>
<p>Cantamessa says that the new studio is "a return to...that unbridled creativity" he felt when first starting out in the gaming world, while Soliani says what Day 4 Night is working on is "a reflection of everything I've ever wanted to experience as a player".</p>
<p>Soliani, who's known for his emotional response to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-e3-2017-mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle">announcement of&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids&nbsp;</em>back at E3 2017</a>, went on to describe Day 4 Night's first project as "a lullaby for my soul and a serenade to our industry". Big words!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-day-4-night.jpg?itok=_aWETUB9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-day-4-night.jpg?itok=rAI2NJO1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will Day 4 Night's first game be similar to&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids</em>, or will it be something else entirely?</figcaption></figure><p>So, what exactly is Day 4 Night working on? About that, Soliani and his compatriots are tight-lipped.</p>
<p>The press release announcing the studio simply says its first game is "an entirely original new game", so it sounds like it won't be based on an existing IP. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 11 Essential Tips For Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</p>
      </div>
<p>A breath of fresh air when compared to several other high-profile games that posted disappointing sales results--like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-big-new-ps5-and-pc-game-concord-got-off-to-a-slow-start/1100-6526101/">Concord</a>--Saber Interactive chief creative officer Tim Willits attributed the game's success to the studio sticking to the core tenets of its Space Marine 2 plan and avoiding an "over-scope" situation.</p><p>"We have a core belief that what you do every second and what happens when you push these buttons and that core gameplay loop is so critical. So we focus on the moment-to-moment interaction in the gameplay and the feeling you have," Willits explained. "And then we adhere to our core pillars, like be the ultimate Space Marine, melee, ranged, swarms, that's it. And a lot of teams throughout development will over-scope games. They look at some other game that just came out and say, 'oh, we got to do that, let's add this, we got to do this.' And they lose focus on the core, what actually makes the game fun."</p><p>These comments come shortly after Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney spoke on the issues plaguing AAA games earlier this week. He mentioned the games industry is undergoing a "generational change" where big-budget games aren't selling as well as they're expected to. "What we're seeing is a real trend where players are gravitating toward the really big games where they can play with more of their friends," Sweeney said (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-games-industry-is-undergoing-a-generational-change-says-epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-a-lot-of-games-are-released-with-high-budgets-and-theyre-not-selling/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer</a>). There have been several recent exceptions to Sweeney's comments, like Elden Ring, Black Myth: Wukong, and of course, Space Marine 2. While some of these games do have co-op elements, they're still single-player games at their core.</p><p>In other Space Marine 2 news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-will-give-you-more-ways-to-customize-your-grimdark-soldiers-soon/1100-6526587/" data-ref-id="1100-6526587">more customization options are on the way</a> for the Emperor's finest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-goes-live-with-these-new-additions/1100-6526735/" data-ref-id="1100-6526735">and a recent patch introduced some major fixes</a> and new features to the game.</p>

Some of this inspiration is direct, from 1982's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gangbusters </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to 2K Games' Mafia series and Romero Games' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/604540/Empire_of_Sin/">Empire of Sin</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Others are more anachronistic in their influences, forming part of the backdrop for a fictional world or otherworldly event, such as the Bioshock series and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sinking City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But while its influence looms large, it's surprisingly rare to see the era featured as a setting in a video game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I previously worked at Royal Museums Greenwich on the historic tea clipper </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/cutty-sark">Cutty Sark</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and came across a snippet of the Prohibition story, thanks to the whisky named after it. It became an iconic brand during Prohibition as a symbol of quality and was highly sought after amongst droves of home-brewed horrors. The maritime perspective of this era is an especially underexplored part of Prohibition's story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While games set during Prohibition will naturally feature alcohol, there's a wealth of ideas left barely touched; from bootleggers to prohibitionists, and the overarching moral quandary about the positives and negatives of alcohol. Maybe these areas appear too 'dry' on the surface, or the more obviously action-packed nature of the mafia is simply more appealing.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/preserving-the-past-with-charles-cecil-game-developer-podcast-ep-46" target="_self">Preserving the Past With Charles Cecil: Game Developer Podcast Ep. 46</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For developers that have taken the plunge into the era, how did Prohibition inspire them? What challenges did they face along the way, and why is this a road less traveled?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The allure of the mafia">The allure of the mafia</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's much more exciting to think about the car chases and shootouts that could have happened to secure a shipment than the nuts and bolts of smuggling. But, more importantly, the fictional mobster archetype lends itself to endless stories and very rich drama," says Haden Blackman, Escape Velocity co-founder and CEO, former Hangar 13 president and chief creative officer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mafia: Definitive Edition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mafia 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The American Mafia, commonly referred to as 'the mob' is a network of Italian-American organized crime families and is intrinsically linked to the era. "Prohibition was a period of expansion and economic growth for the mob," explains Blackman. "The mob's willingness to flaunt the law, combined with its existing experience with other criminal enterprises [...] allowed the Mafia to capitalize on the demand for alcohol created by Prohibition."</span></p><p>Image via Hangar 13/2K.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This led to violent clashes—both with authorities and rival groups; and the influx of money allowed a lifestyle that has been glamorized and held up as aspirational on some level. All these factors combine to create the perfect mob fantasy—a world ripe for the taking through force—which is fertile ground for both gameplay and narrative."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/starstruck-hands-of-time-is-a-rhythm-game-that-lets-you-use-your-old-guitar-peripherals" target="_self">Starstruck: Hands of Time is a rhythm game that lets you use your old guitar peripherals</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even with its magnetism and saturation in popular culture, other games featuring Mafia organizations set in the era aren't as numerous as you'd think. Beyond this, far fewer games explore the role of bootleggers in Prohibition to a significant degree, so Junkfish Games' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2492410/Bootleg_Steamer/">Bootleg Steamer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> took me by surprise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bootleg Steamer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> creative director Michael Macleod explained how he was directly inspired by his interest in maritime history and from growing up as part of a shipping family in the North West Highlands. Alongside his father and grandfather's fishing boats, his great-uncles worked on ocean liners at the world famous shipbuilding hub on the Clyde—which is also where Cutty Sark was built.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Macleod's personal connection meant he was able to provide unique insight into this hitherto unexplored side of Prohibition during development. The light-hearted, strategy roguelike sidelines the mafia in favor of nautical hijinks; placing a bigger focus on economy, commerce, and the risk/reward aspects of smuggling.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Junkfish Games accepted that the inclusion of alcohol was unavoidable in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bootleg Steamer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and would naturally affect the PEGI rating. But, as an indie game releasing on Steam it's important to keep the potential audience as broad as possible.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/cairn-s-manual-climbing-system-is-like-a-vertical-death-stranding-" target="_self">Cairn's manual climbing system is like a 'vertical Death Stranding'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To avoid pushing the rating beyond 16, the team limited any other content that could bump up the rating. For example, the Mafia may be an optional interaction, but are still present as a potential business venture and dealing with them has consequences. "There were things like: 'would we have them shooting the ship and sinking it and outright killing the crew?'" Macleod explains. "That was the kind of thing we strayed away from. We're referring to violence in the game, but we don't really show it."</span></p><p>Image via Junkfish Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Macleod, Prohibition lends itself to a Robin Hood angle; working around a law that was considered unjust and providing a different view on a life of crime that we see presented in titles like Grand Theft Auto. To this day, historical figures such as Captain William "Bill" McCoy are heralded for their actions. His reputation for bringing only the finest liquor to America earned those spirits, including Cutty Sark whisky, the moniker: "the real McCoy".</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Junkfish also had to leave a significant portion of the bootlegging ecosystem on the cutting room floor due to technical constraints. Macleod said there's so much more to do in the setting, aspects like truck deliveries, brewing alcohol, and strategic opportunities in combining land and sea operations.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Weighing the global appeal of a distinctly American era">Weighing the global appeal of a distinctly American era</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Concerns around global appeal and market understanding also need to be considered and could be a factor in why games in this setting are limited. "Ultimately, an American audience [understands] Prohibition. The Singapore side of our studio had concerns that when the game was trying to move on the Asia side, the market over there might not be as aware of Prohibition and we'd have to spend some effort to explain what Prohibition was," Macleod explains.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, the bootlegging dream has made it to some players far from the rum-running capital of Chicago. "We took the game to Gamescom Asia and a lot of the players [...] got it straight away."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The available technology of the prohibition era can potentially constrain developers from giving players tools they're used to having. For instance, Blackman said the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mafia: Definitive Edition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team couldn't easily give players the classic sniper rifle, because it would have been "rare" for a mobster to have one in the 1930s. There were still solutions available. "We established that one of our characters is a weaponsmith, and he cobbled together a gun that functions much like a sniper rifle for a specific mission," Blackman said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Blackman adds that developers can feel "a lot of pressure to innovate on gameplay" so these technological and historical limitations can sometimes be off-putting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mafia: Definitive Edition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players navigate the harsh realities of mob life through the eyes of protagonist Tommy Angelo. Prohibition lends itself well to the modern lens as a period of great change and uncertainty, full of oppression, activism, and economic downturn—fostering stories that we can relate to today. "A relatable character has very human motivations and problems, so we establish Tommy struggling financially early on, which is something many of us can understand," explained Blackman.</span></p><p>Image via Junkfish Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bootleg Steamer's initial game jam pitch was originally more literal in its representation of bootlegging, but as the idea developed, the team moved away from getting granular with history and focused on a fun, frenetic gameplay approach—the kind of interpretation you'd see in a board game set in the era.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The clandestine nature of bootleggers provided Junkfish Games with an opening to create a more diverse cast of characters than you'd find in movies or TV shows set in the bootlegging era. "I think one of the things that was quite nice about working with Prohibition was the sense that [some of] the best Prohibition smugglers are the ones that never got caught, the ones you've never heard about. They made a fortune, retired, and history doesn't know about them," says Macleod. That raised the idea that players could take on the role of smugglers of different races or genders, since it would be ‘authentic' that they'd existed in the time period, but simply slipped through the cracks of history.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="There's plenty more inspiration to be found in Prohibition">There's plenty more inspiration to be found in Prohibition</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers wishing to dive into the era should know there's more nuance to be found in the ban on alcohol than pop culture tells us. Mark Schrad, PhD, Professor of Political Science at Villanova University explained to Game Developer that many stories you may know about Prohibition often misunderstand that the temperance movement was popular enough to get a constitutional amendment passed in the United States.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm always astounded at how far off modern, pop-culture depictions of temperance and prohibitionists are from the actual, historical reality," he says. "Temperance was a very progressive movement of liberation against the predatory capitalism of the 'liquor traffic,' which got people addicted for profit."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Now, when it comes to the Prohibition Era—the gangland shootouts, Al Capone, Elliot Ness and all that—I'm generally fine with those sorts of depictions. At the very least, they don't twist the motivations of the historical figures to match our contemporary understandings, which has been the case with depictions of temperance."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's clear why more titles cherry-pick from Prohibition to allow for greater freedom and scope. The gunplay is a great fit for video games, but the social dynamics of the era aren't as easy to depict.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Schrad is surprised to learn that games set in this period are somewhat limited. "One would think that this would be a very fertile context for developing video game storylines," Schrad explains. "I could imagine some Grand Theft Auto-type games set in the Prohibition Era of the 1920s, with petty bootleggers and rum-runners climbing the ranks of the underworld to build an illicit booze empire."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The thing about Prohibition is that there is automatically some degree of sympathy built-in for the villain. After all—from shyster to kingpin—the bad guy is simply trying to slake the thirst of the citizenry, which largely saw no harm in the occasional drink [...] one could more easily side with the criminal against what is largely seen as unjust laws," Schrad explains. "I'd think it'd be easy for [...] people to imagine themselves projected back in time to that historical context as the valorous criminal against bad-guy law enforcement."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>11 Bit Studios has confirmed that its survival strategy game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/12/the-alters-is-a-clone-filled-survival-strategy-game-by-the-makers-of-frostpunk/">The Alters</a> has been delayed to Q1 2025, as more time is needed to develop the game. The studio has taken a slightly novel approach to the announcement of The Alters delay, addressing the main character Jan Dolski directly as his employer Ally Corp. It can be read below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/au_ek16Bm-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>Dear Mr. Dolski,</em></p>
<p><em>We regret to inform you that, after thorough review, your upcoming mission in search of Rapidium has been postponed from to Q1 2025. While we understand this delay may not be the news you were expecting, rest assured that we are using this extended time to optimize all mission-critical systems and ensure that every aspect of your journey is as seamless as possible.</em></p>
<p><em>We would also like to recognize that Project Dolly, based on its initial Demo phase, has already exceeded expectations and the preliminary results demonstrated a high potential for a successful mission. However, at Ally Corp, “good” is never enough. This additional time will allow us to polish each phase of the project, delivering results that surpass our prior projections—an outcome that benefits both Ally Corp and, naturally, yourself.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you for your patience and ongoing commitment to Ally Corp’s mission. Your contribution to Project Dolly remains invaluable, and we look forward to your successful deployment in the near future.</em></p>
<p>Project Dolly refers to premise of The Alters story and gameplay.You play as Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant alien planet who simply wants to try and survive and find a way home on his weird ring ship filled with habitable shipping container type things. To do this, he has to create ‘Alters’ of himself. They’re not quite clones as is each able to have distinct character skills and traits. It’s from this that elements of psychological horror and an underlying mystery unfold. This is brought to the player through binary decisions, bringing up the fundamental question “what if?” as you head down deeper and darker paths.</p>

(This game has been out over a month, and it’s bewildering that something so important has taken so long, not least because Ubisoft gets this feature <em>so right</em> in its <em>AssCreed</em> series.) The patch notes say,<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Tweaked the overall stealth experience by adjusting AI detection, the number of NPCs and their positioning, patrol pathing, camera detection and highlighting environmental opportunities to reduce player friction</p></blockquote><p>If you’ve not played the game, you could easily interpret this as a difficulty nerf. But those who are more familiar with <em>Outlaws</em> will most likely release a breath they’ve held in since the end of August. Being spotted through walls, hills, and so on and then that impossible sighting causing an entire camp to telepathically spring into simultaneous laser-honed attacks is not so much a difficulty issue, as a fun issue. </p><p>The other big change is that the speeder will fling you off less often, like perhaps not when you drive within eyesight of a pebble. The unwieldy bikes have been too fast to control in busy areas, while too slow to be a satisfying means of long-distance travel, and buck you off like a furious bull every time you go anywhere. So this getting addressed is quite the relief.</p><p>Also among the “notable changes” listed in the notes are two game-breaking bugs that absolutely fucked me over. One is getting stuck in the hyperjump to Kijimi—Kay would start talking, cut herself off, and then it would enter a silent infinite hyperjump sequence. The second is fixing an issue where you couldn’t take off from the planet after finishing a mission called The Wreck.  This was especially infuriating, as the story mission arc also prevented any fast-travel off-planet, and I had to reload a save from two sodding hours earlier. So, at least new players won’t experience that.</p><figure id="" data-id="05c9086200bf7c9ddd03e44731be2746" data-recommend-id="image://05c9086200bf7c9ddd03e44731be2746" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nix remains perfect, as he always has been." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nix remains perfect, as he always has been." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="05c9086200bf7c9ddd03e44731be2746" data-recommend-id="image://05c9086200bf7c9ddd03e44731be2746" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nix remains perfect, as he always has been." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Which is all to rather make the point that so much of what’s being addressed 35 days since release has already long put me off persisting with a game I’d almost finished. In fact, I found <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla </em>on Game Pass, and having missed it when it was released, starting playing that instead—and it turns out to be the <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> I was looking for, only with Saxons instead of Stormtroopers, and the sea instead of the stars.<br></p><p>This patch is tempting me to return, not least because it finally adds a button for throwing grenades, rather than requiring you to juggle through UI prompts in the heat of battle. But then, I’m loving <em>Valhalla </em>so much, I’m not sure I’ve got the willpower for <em>Outlaws </em>any more. It’s wonderful that Ubisoft is working hard to make it into the game it deserves to be, but I fear a lot of damage has already been done.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-delists-original-horizon-zero-dawn-on-pc-forces-psn-requirement-for-remaster<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Sony’s controversial PlayStation Network requirement for its PC games is once again in the spotlight after the company delisted the original Horizon Zero Dawn on Steam and the Epic Games Store and added the PSN requirement to the upcoming single-player remaster.</p><p>Sony’s PSN account requirement for its PC games was thrust into the limelight with the release of Arrowhead’s explosive PC and PS5 co-op shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> earlier this year. Helldivers 2 suffered a review bomb campaign on Steam after Sony made PSN accounts mandatory for PC gamers on Valve’s platform (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-psn-review-bomb-cape-mia-as-arrowhead-awaits-clarity-on-game-being-sold-in-more-countries"><u>Arrowhead subsequently decided to turn the Steam user review history graph into a cape, which is ready for launch but has yet to release</u></a>).</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reverses-course-on-helldivers-2-psn-account-requirement"><u>Sony eventually backed down and reversed Helldivers 2’s PSN account requirement</u></a>, but the game remains unavailable to buy in the many countries that lack PSN. And indeed all Sony’s games on PC, even purely single-player ones, now suffer from this problem, which means <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnark-launches-to-mixed-steam-user-reviews-with-most-complaining-about-the-playstation-network-account-requirement">the recently released God of War Ragnarök</a> and now Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered are unavailable on Steam in over 100 countries.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered Screenshots - State of Play September 2024</h3></div></output><p>This week, fans noticed the original Horizon Zero Dawn, previously available to buy in all countries where Steam is accessible, was delisted from the Epic Games Store and then from Steam itself. The Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition Steam page remains live, but the game itself is unavailable for purchase. In its place is the option to pre-purchase <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-officially-announced-at-sony-state-of-play">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a> or buy its sequel, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Forbidden West</a>.</p><p>The Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered Steam page signals the PSN account requirement in the small print of the game’s features. Again, the original game did not have this requirement on PC.</p><p>Already negative user reviews are mentioning Sony’s actions here. “Delisted the original game just to add the remaster with PSN account forced into the game,” reads one recent Steam review for the Complete Edition of Zero Dawn. “Now countries unsupported by PSN can't buy this game anymore whether it's the non remastered version (which doesn't require PSN) or remastered version.”</p><p>It seems likely, then, that Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will suffer from review bombing when it goes on sale on Steam on October 31. It seems <em>unlikely</em> that Sony will reverse course here, having suffered a backlash from PC gamers to pretty much all its Steam releases since Helldivers 2 went on sale.</p><p>It has so far failed to comment on its PC PSN policy, although during the Helldivers 2 backlash it offered reasoning that was widely ridiculed by Steam gamers. "We’re still learning what is best for PC players and your feedback has been invaluable," Sony said at the time. Unlike Helldivers 2, Horizon Zero Dawn is a purely single-player only game.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition is still available on GOG. There it is DRM-free, with no activation or online connection required to play.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fromsoftware-raises-base-salaries</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-studio-fromsoftware-raises-base-employee-salaries-by-12.1000554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fromsoftware-raises-base-salaries<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Armored Core 6&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware has announced it's raising employees' base salaries by around 12% starting from April next year, and there's good news for graduate workers as well.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/jp/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20241004_wageincrease" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release on its official Japanese website</a> (for which we're using machine translation, since the release is, as you'd probably expect, in Japanese), FromSoftware says the decision is driven by wanting to create "a stable income and rewarding work environment" for employees.</p>
<p>The studio says its 12% employee raise, which kicks in from April 2025, is part of creating "an environment where each employee can focus on content development", presumably rather than worrying about whether they'll be able to pay rent.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/armored-core-6-from-software.jpg?itok=aNmxUiSu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/armored-core-6-from-software.jpg?itok=bQF1KXLE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>FromSoftware makes the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series, but it's also responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Armored Core 6</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>FromSoftware also says it's raising graduate salaries from 260,000 yen per month to 300,000, so if you're a Japanese graduate just starting out with the <em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>developer, it's a good time to kickstart your career, it seems.</p>
<p>Since FromSoftware doesn't have offices outside Japan, this is, of course, just for those who work in Japan. Still, it's a good sign that FromSoftware is doing alright, which is more than can be said for a lot of studios right now, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Hidetaka Miyazaki's studio is far from the only Japanese company to raise salaries for its employees in recent months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Others include Konami, which raised its employees' base salaries <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-salary-increase">for the third year in a row back in April</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-salary-increases"><i>Resident Evil&nbsp;</i>studio Capcom</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atlus-salary-increase"><em>Persona&nbsp;</em>developer Atlus</a>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor-refantazio-atlus-salary-increase.jpg?itok=jQFYPAmH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor-refantazio-atlus-salary-increase.jpg?itok=0IpydsV1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other studios to raise Japanese salaries include&nbsp;<em>Persona</em> and&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;developer Atlus.</figcaption></figure><p>FromSoftware's announcement comes at a time of increasing uncertainty for the gaming industry, with thousands upon thousands of studio employees <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">losing their jobs this year</a>.</p>
<p>By and large, the Japanese contingent of the industry appears to be a little more stable than studios in the West are, although companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-profits-down">Square Enix</a>&nbsp;have found themselves in a little trouble this year as well.</p>
<p>As for what lies in FromSoftware's future, we're not sure yet. The company is likely still basking in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales">hugely successful launch</a> of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC, but I'm betting work on their next project is already well underway. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Pocket Pair’s action-adventure title, Palworld, has finally been released for PS5s in Japan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pocket Pair Shadow released its popular 2024 title for PS5 in 68 countries and regions last month, but Japan was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-ps5-version-delayed-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excluded</a>. Many players speculated that Nintendo’s lawsuit against the developers could have caused the delay. However, the official Palworld Japan account on X has <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_JP/status/1842113232779243881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced today</a> that the game is now available on PS5 nationwide.</p>



<p>In the same thread, the Palworld Japan account added that the developers will “continue to provide exciting and large-scale updates to the PS5 version so that everyone can enjoy the game even more”. They have also apologised for the delay in release and look forward to continued community support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, PS5 isn’t the only new platform that Pocket Pair is targeting. An announcement on October 2 revealed that Pocket Pair is partnering up with Krafton to bring Palworld to mobile. Check out Insider Gaming’s full report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-mobile-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pocket Pair has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-lawsuit-reponse-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already responded to Nintendo’s lawsuit</a>, stating that it is “unaware” of the specific patents it has been accused of infringing.</p>

Not all of the locations from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-5-ps4-xbox-one-pc-review/1900-6415959/" data-ref-id="1900-6415959">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> have been readily available, but Rockstar Games has revealed plans to reopen a fan-requested area as part of an upcoming zombie mode.</p><p>Rockstar made the announcement in this week's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1fuovop/weekly_discounts_and_bonuses_october_3rd_to/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> that North Yankton will be featured in "a Community Challenge to dispatch marching tides of undead in a new limited-time mode." This snowy location was featured in GTA 5's prologue as two of the main characters, Michael and Trevor, ran into some serious problems during their attempt to rob a bank and get away clean. GTA Online players have previously only been able to get back there by using glitches and exploits.</p><p>While Rockstar hasn't yet shared the full details about GTA Online's zombie mode, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-zombies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> notes that data miners have "found evidence of a wave-based survival mode," which suggests that it will be a horde-style event. However, there's no word about whether the zombie action will be limited to North Yankton or if it will spill out into the larger areas of San Andreas and Los Santos. Additionally, Rockstar has announced <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/9kkk2k11148825/gta-members-are-treated-to-special-gifts-this-halloween-season" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of Halloween-related items</a> for GTA+ members, including the fearsome-looking HVY Nightshark SUV and demon biker gear. </p><p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-references-and-teases/2900-4973/" data-ref-id="2900-4973">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> on the horizon for a 2025 release, it seems likely that GTA Online as we know it may be due for a significant overhaul in the future. But Rockstar has successfully kept the world of this game fresh for a long time, and players aren't ready to let go of it just yet.</p>

            <p>Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii has asked people not to "arbitrarily extract parts of comments for the purpose of reinforcing the legitimacy of your own opinion" after he was accused of blaming Western ratings board for having to put more modest clothing on characters in Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake.</p>
<p>Initially, it was reported that Horii was irritated at the missive to make the outfits less revealing, allegedly saying in a TGS interview that he blamed America's "religious" and "narrow-minded" approach for the changes, adding: "Doing business with such a ridiculous country is really frustrating. Because of that, Japan also gets negatively influenced" (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/10/dragon-quest-vets-claim-comments-on-censorship-were-mistranslated">Time Extension</a>).</p>

<p>The changes received significant attention, not least because X/Twitter owner Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1840620975248785486">shared</a> mistranslated information to his millions of followers with the misleading caption: "Japanese Game Developers are frustrated at the forced ridiculous UN driven Globalist agenda compliance they have to include in their game".</p>
<p>Since then, however, Horii and podcast host and former Shonen Jump Editor-in-Chief Kazuhiko Torishima have <a href="https://x.com/KosoKoso_hoso/status/1841681747786006615">confirmed</a> the comments were not only mistranslated, but taken out of context, too.</p>
<p>Saying the word "puritan" had been mistranslated as "sex education", the pair then said they were "very sorry" that their words had been used out of context "outside of [Japan]".</p> <div>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the TGS interview was swiftly deleted.</p>
<p>The HD-2D Remake of Dragon Quest 3 features updated character designs that formed the basis of the original discussion, not least of all the female Warrior character (pictured above) who now wears additional underclothes instead of just a bikini.</p>
