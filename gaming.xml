		<p>Heart Machine certainly know how to make an artistically satisfying game. The first game in the Hyper Light series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/08/hyper-light-drifter-special-edition-review/">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, blended neon colours, gorgeous pixel art and tight action gameplay to create something that immediately stood out from the rest of the indie pack.&nbsp;They followed that up with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/07/solar-ash-review-ps5-ps4-pc/">Solar Ash</a>, taking their penchant for awe-inspiring, idiosyncratic visuals and moving them to 3D. Once again, this showcased the strength of their world-building and action-heavy gameplay.</p>
<p>Hyper Light Breaker then, bears the heavy weight of expectation. As it launches into Early Access, fans of the series will no doubt delight in the world that’s been built here, but there’s a number of things that fundamentally need to change before it reaches full release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyper Light Breaker | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClJaGZI-P78?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hyper Light Breaker is an open-world, procedurally generated Roguelite. As the genre dictates, that means there’s slow, incremental progress, starting off with next to nothing, making multiple runs into the game’s open world, and building up your character’s arsenal and abilities so that the next run will go just that little bit smoother. Hopefully, you’ll make it just that little bit farther.</p>
<p>There’s a reason that this is the gameplay style of choice right now: it’s rewarding, it’s challenging, and it can create longevity without needing an extensive narrative to drive it. Hyper Light Breaker takes the basic form of a Roguelite, but then layers its own quirks and design decisions on top, some of which work, and some of which don’t.</p>


<p>The first design decision is that Hyper Light Breaker is hard. Some of the difficulty seems to be because the team at Heart Machine expect, or perhaps hope, that you’re going to play in co-op with your friends. Damage and armour don’t scale here, and you can split enemies’ attention, so, when you factor in a couple of extra pairs of hands, it becomes wholly more approachable.</p>
<p>Co-op definitely lifts the whole experience – doesn’t it always? – but it also serves to highlight that the beautiful world that’s been built here feels a little lifeless. There’s no Indigenous wildlife that doesn’t want to kill you, no sounds of nature, and for all of the visual splendour it’s not carried by the life within it. Even the excellent synthwave soundtrack drops out too much, leaving you to drift far too often in an aurally and visually frozen piece of artwork.</p>
<p>So Hyper Light Breaker is populated by vicious and utterly lethal things. The enemies here, slimes, clawed demi-humans or giant ogres, are all, without fail, tough as nails, and, when you’re starting out at least, they offer more than just a challenge, they offer a sense of unfairness.&nbsp;I spawned into one map in a zone that always had enemies in it and time and time again they caught me out, whittling a third of my health away before I’d even really begun. A big part of that is that the visibility of incoming enemies can be difficult to parse at times, and the enemy units can be so fast they’re practically a blur.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that the combat isn’t good. On a fundamental level, the swift dodging, attacking and parrying feels really good, and can look visually spectacular when you factor in the different skills that open up for you. However, when you’re losing health from a bad guy you’ve barely even had time to see, it robs the game of both balance and fun. That’s compounded by some weaponry lacking impact, and a woeful lack of ammo for your ranged weapons.</p>
<p>Things do progress, and they do improve, but in Early Access you currently have to wade through some seriously testing moments before you get to them.</p>

<p>All of the game’s combat action takes place out in The Overgrowth. Each run sees you collecting Prisms, equipment and upgrades before attempting to take down three Crowns – three challenging area bosses – and then going after the Abyss King. The character designs are a massive highlight, especially for the boss creatures, and I really just wanted the chance to look at them, rather than immediately having my body crushed into a million tiny bits.</p>
<p>Some of your upgrades are permanent, and some of the items you collect will stay with you from run to run, though Heart Machine have added in weapon durability that sees many of your items disappear after a couple of runs. What that means is that progress is glacial in comparison to other Roguelites out there.</p>
<p>Your central hub, The Cursed Outpost, stands as a place of rest and respite, as well as playing host to your upgrade trees and different merchants whose wares might help you last a little longer. These need unlocking and coaxing into giving you the best stuff, and you upgrade them with the same consumables you use to upgrade your character. It creates a dissonance between the two, and further feels as though the game is unnecessarily trying to extend your time with it.</p>

<p>Despite all of this, Hyper Light Breaker is still rather moreish. A sick fascination with dying might be required for entry right now, but the world is incredible, the action sharp and varied, and it really comes alive in co-op. I hope that Heart Machine have the time and commitment to pour into it, as a few tweaks to the formula could utterly change the way it feels, and remove some of the current frustrations it seems so ready to dole out.</p>

			<p>Phantom Blade Zero, the exceedingly promising Soulslike game in development at Chinese studio S-GAME, has been shown again today with a gorgeous new gameplay trailer dedicated to the Year of the Snake celebration. The footage, which demonstrates the visual improvements that have been made since the last build, shows a new boss fight against the so-called Seven Judgements.</p>
<p>According to S-GAME, these foes will fight in a sword formation, with one of them coordinating the entire formation. The Seven Judgements were once righteous warriors who used this formation to slay countless powerful enemies but have since become puppets corrupted due to the bloodlust caused by the Transcension process. Six of them wear white robes with a dark hollow in the place of their faces, while their leader, Decree, wears blue with a similar hollow face, faintly glowing.</p>
<p>Players will have to deal with multiple enemies simultaneously while looking for opportunities to attack Decree, the heart of the formation, to complete the first stage of this Phantom Blade Zero boss fight. However, things are rather complicated due to several mechanics. For example, whenever Decree takes damage, the others sacrifice their own health to heal him. Moreover, if there are less than three disciples left, Decree will use his health to revive them. The collective health pool of all these enemies remains the same, meaning that the player must reduce them in one way or another. S-GAME says these Disciples are controlled by a group AI and can launch multi-directional attacks.</p>
<p>After the first phase, three Disciples climb onto platforms and use red strings to manipulate a puppet called Tyrannical Decree to attack the player. In this phase, enemies have a wide range of movement and swing across the arena with pendulum-like movements guided by the red strings.&nbsp; Their attack patterns are completely different from the previous phase and will require precise timing for counterattacks. Chasing them recklessly is not advised, as it can disrupt your rhythm and result in ineffective attacks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Blade Zero - Year of the Snake Gameplay Trailer 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ogm8X8SSyxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this new Phantom Blade Zero gameplay trailer, S-GAME also introduced new snake-themed weapons. White Python and Red Viper are a pair of swords of different lengths shown in the first phase. The White Python is a long sword with wide, sweeping attacks, while the Red Viper is a short sword designed for precision strikes. The two swords can also be used in combination, such as the long sword propelling the short sword to attack. The Venomous Softblade, shown in the second phase, is a flexible sword that excels at countering and deflecting attacks.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero is currently in development for PC and PlayStation 5. For our impressions on the previous build, check out Francesco's <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamescom 2024 hands-on preview</a>.</p>

            <p>"Your grace, the act of assigning blame is often as satisfying as resolving the issue itself," opens brilliant little browser <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://sheepolution.itch.io/vox-regis">Vox Regis</a> by Sheepolution. From your tower, you gaze down at four factions, each with their own members and complaints. If any one faction gets too large, they'll rebel against you. Luckily, you're very good at speeches, which you can use to blame all the realm's ills on other people. "It was the lion faction! They raised taxes!" you shout and point with one hand, holding a big bag emblazoned "taxes I done stole from the people" with the other. It worked! Now, the members from the other factions that are personally annoyed about taxes will come cull the lion faction down to a more manageable size. Bloody love a bit of politics, me!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The goal is Survive for five years (minutes) using as few speeches as possible, while stopping any faction growing to 30 members, at which point they'll give you the ol' rusty-pitchy-forky-bowelly, a famously terrible fate worth avoiding. As you watch from above, you'll see neutrals bumble through the town gates and eventually join factions. It's actually very fun just to watch them, but obviously you'll get forked up if you don't act.</p>
<p>I notice the frog faction getting too populous first, so I blame them for bandit attacks. Soon, their surplus members are but red stains, as tiny and insignificant as a speckled fart from the death throes of a ketchup bottle. It's actually quite intensive, too. I keep switching tabs to write notes and end up dying each time. The limited speech goal makes it, I think: you're always flittering around between the factions, doing little bits of math to work out where your rabble-rousing proclamations will be most effectively target. Also, just a brilliantly clever use of the first person - as noted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/molleindustria.org">‪Paolo Pedercini</a>‬, who brought this one to my attention. Enjoy!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Each year, the Game Developers Conference (GDC) release the results of their State Of The Game Industry Survey, which collects responses from over 3000 developers. The 13th annual survey - which you can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/pel5295n7j0on8zscomjh/AJPBdLSZVQYicWY6GHf1EyY?dl=0&amp;e=1&amp;preview=2025+GDC+State+of+the+Game+Industry+report.pdf&amp;rlkey=tr7vkhg7o0gqrib3odacggjpy&amp;st=5h2e5e2l">find in full here</a> - queries respondents on topics including layoffs, generative AI, the live service boom, and funding. As is the nature of our times, it's a big grim salad with a few bright crouton sprinklings. From the report's introduction, which does not mention croutons even once:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>It feels like the last 12 months have seen their share of fortune and heartbreak. Industry layoffs have continued, to the point where one in 10 developers say they’ve lost their jobs in the past year. More studios adopt Generative AI, even though it’s increasingly unpopular among developers. Working hours are going up, investment opportunities are shrinking, and recent severe weather events… are drawing attention to the growing impact of climate disasters.</p>
<p>But the game industry is resilient, as are its developers. PC development has skyrocketed, more studios are prioritizing game accessibility, unionization support holds steady, and Hollywood continues to see the value in adapting games for the big (and small) screen.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's rare to see a week pass where we don't hear about job losses in some form, but even so, that one in ten figure hits especially hard. Narrative roles were hit worst at 19%, compared to 6% working in business and finance. The most common reasons given were restructuring, declining revenue, and market shifts/industry trends. In last year's survey, 53% of respondents had not been impacted by layoffs, either personally or at the company they worked for.</p>
<p>19% of developers told GDC that they were given "no reason" for layoffs at their company. "If you lost your job, have you been able to find a new one?" asked the survey for an 'in your words" section, which collects direct quotes from respondents. "The games industry is killing me," was one developer's reply. Otherwise, the survey doesn't contexualise these layoffs against figures of new hires in the same period, although there's possibly a throughline here between the 56% of developers that say they’ve invested money into their own games versus the 28% who have "publishing deals and project-based funding". </p><p>This climate of layoff fatigue is paired with a growing apathy towards generative AI tools, often touted as the industry's future. "Game development is supposed to be art and an expression of one’s imagination, not an AI-generated concept with no real thought process," reads the quote from a respondent that leads the section on Generative AI tools. A majority of developers (52%) surveyed said they worked at a company that uses such tools. 16% of respondents said their company has a policy against using generative AI tools, compared to 9% where their use was mandated.</p>
<p>Almost a third of respondents felt Gen AI was having a negative effect on the industry: 30%, up from 20% last year. 13% felt the impact was positive, down from 21%. "When asked to cite their specific concerns, developers pointed to intellectual property theft, energy consumption, the quality of AI-generated content, potential biases, and regulatory issues," reads the survey.</p>
<p>"When asked what applications they saw for the use of Generative AI in the game industry, developers pointed to tasks like coding assistance, concept art and 3D model generation, and automation of repetitive tasks (developers made similar suggestions in our 2024 survey)," reads the report. "But the word used most frequently in their responses was 'none'."</p>
<p>I should acknowledge that the rhetorical device they've used at the end there - paired with the above opening quote - is obviously very skewed on one side of the argument. Then again, it's also the side of the argument I'm on, and is therefore good. Objectivity is for little weenies.</p><p>There are a few positives thankfully, as the report highlights up top. "71% of developers think their company’s DEI and accessibility efforts have been at least slightly successful, while 51% feel the same way about their company’s sustainability efforts". Additionally, union support has remained consistent from last year, with 58% of respondents in favour - a figure that may go up, given that this was the first year since the survey began that the number of developers working 40 hours or less per week decreased.</p>
<p>PC development is also looking healthy, with 80% of developers surveyed currently making games for our lovely thinking tellies, up from 66% last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As promised, S-Game has released a new gameplay trailer for Phantom Blade Zero. The studio had said it would release an trailer today to celebrate the Year of the Snake. In case you didn’t know, 2025 is the Year of the Snake in the Chinese and Japanese calendars.</p>



<p>Watch the video below:</p>

<iframe title="Phantom Blade Zero - Year of the Snake Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZX1k0z2pPY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Made in Unreal Engine 5, the visual quality of the game is impressive. The lighting and combat animations have definitely been given a hefty boost since the last trailer for the game.</p>



<p>Players are increasingly looking forward to Phantom Blade Zero. The game ended up being sponsored by PlayStation, which certainly helps to raise expectations for it. Phantom Blade Zero is a spiritual successor to Rainblood: Town of Death, a game created in RPG Maker.</p>



<p>Over the years, Rainblood became an IP called Phantom Blade, which has sold more than 20 million units. Now, S-Game is seeking its place in the AAA gaming ecosystem with this new venture.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-story-of-phantom-blade-zero">The story of Phantom Blade Zero</h2>



<p>Phantom Blade Zero will have a semi-open world and the story has already been revealed. Check out the synopsis below:</p>



<p><em>In Phantom Blade Zero, you are Soul, an elite assassin who serves an elusive but powerful organization known simply as “The Order”. He was framed for the murder of The Order’s patriarch and seriously injured in the ensuing hunt. A mystical healer managed to save him from death, but the impromptu cure only lasts 66 days. He must discover the mastermind behind it all before his time runs out, facing powerful enemies and inhuman monstrosities.</em></p>



<p>Kenji Tanigaki, the action director of the Samurai X films, acts as action director for Phantom Blade Zero. This alone explains how the moves are so acrobatic and realistic.</p>

Humanity creates forbidden biological weapons: Gears. Those Gears eventually stand against humanity in a rebellion. Although they manage to overcome in the struggle for <a title="Genres > Survival [370 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> known as the Crusades, humanity’s losses are so great that even after several decades pass, their emotional wounds remain unable to fully heal. Sin Kiske, the child of a human and a Gear, heads to his father Ky and mother Dizzy’s wedding ceremony. Their wedding breaks the ultimate taboo: a union between a human and a Gear. Even with the world at peace, it took many years for such a ceremony to come to fruition. Despite the complex array of emotions surrounding it, the wedding ceremony is met with blessings. When suddenly, a mysterious girl appears… The fated child inheriting Gear blood–and the mysterious girl who despises Gears. Their meeting would shake the world.</p><!-- AD: content -->

<p>There’s still a future for Mortal Kombat 1. In a <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1881825221369528644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">multi-post thread</a> on Twitter on Tuesday evening, Mortal Kombat created Ed Boon talked about the state of the game while quickly mentioning future DLC plans for Mortal Kombat 1.</p>



<p>First thing’s first, Boon announced that Mortal Kombat 1 has sold more than 5 million copies since its September 2023 launch. On top of that, the game continues to remain in the top 15 games on PlayStation 5 in terms of weekly active users.</p>



<p>Boon also mentioned the release of the game’s Conan the Barbarian DLC that launched on January 21 as the game’s 11th DLC fighter. A 12th fighter, the T-1000 Terminator, will be the next addition to the game’s roster.</p>



<p>As far as future fighters go, there has been a lot of rumors surrounding DLC wrapping up for the game after the lackluster sales of Kombat Pack 2 and the Khaos Reigns expansion. While Boon didn’t mention another Kombat Pack or story expansion specifically, he did say that there was more to come for players.</p>



<p>“With Conan getting into player’s hands, we are excited to keep trucking forward with future DLC,” he posted. </p>



<p>The end of Mortal Kombat 1 DLC began thanks to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known franchise leaker</a>. According to their claims, says that plans for Kombat Pack 3 and a second story was cancelled at NetherRealm studios. He did say, however, that it was possible for “a kameo or two” to be added to the game after Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 due to the work that had already been done. </p>



<p>NetherRealm hasn’t fully addressed those claims.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> has announced another wave of price hikes across its various membership tiers - including a Premium subscription bump to $25 a month, among other things - but, for the time being at least, most European countries won't be affected by the charges.
</p>
<p>
The news comes as Netflix <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">celebrates its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a>, with 19m new customers having joined the streaming service in its most recent fourth quarter - something it attributes to a combination of live sports and original programming, including the second season of Squid Game, which has already amassed more than 165.7m views.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, Netflix says it's expecting to generate higher than forecast revenue in 2025 - and that will, in part, be fuelled by a fresh round of price increases. These are specifically targeting the US, Canada, Portugal, and Argentina, coming into effect today.
</p>

<p>
"As we continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members," the streaming service wrote in its message to shareholders, "we will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can re-invest to further improve Netflix."
</p><p>
To that end, prices are rising across "most" plans. Netflix's ad-supported tier is increasing from $6.99 USD to $7.99 a month, while its standard ad-free subscription is getting a bump from $15.49 to $17.99 per month. And as for the streaming service's premium tier - currently the only way to watch its content in 4K - that'll rise from $22.99 to $24.99 a month.
</p>
<p>
For now, there's no word of price increases beyond the four currently announced countries, but - based on Netflix's previous behaviour - there's a fair chance it won't be too long before they come into effect across additional territories too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/rip-eas-origin-launcher-we-knew-ye-all-too-well-unfortunately/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>After 14 years, EA will retire its controversial Origin game distribution app for Windows, the company<a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/"> announced</a>. Origin will stop working on April 17, 2025. Folks still using it will be directed to install the newer EA app, which launched in 2022.</p>
<p>The launch of Origin in 2011 was a flashpoint of controversy among gamers, as EA—already not a beloved company by this point—began pulling titles like<em> Crysis 2</em> from the popular Steam platform to drive players to its own launcher.</p>
<p>Frankly, it all made sense from EA's point of view. For a publisher that size, Valve had relatively little to offer in terms of services or tools, yet it was taking a big chunk of games' revenue. Why wouldn't EA want to get that money back?</p>
<p>The transition was a rough one, though, because it didn't make as much sense from the consumer's point of view. Players distrusted EA and had a lot of goodwill for Valve and Steam. Origin lacked features players liked on Steam, and old habits and social connections die hard. Plus, EA's use of Origin—a long-dead brand name tied to classic RPGs and other games of the '80s and '90s—for something like this felt to some like a slap in the face.</p>

                <p>Late last year, Microsoft signaled its plans to make Edge the preferred browser for PC gamers with the first look at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-edge-to-be-your-gaming-browser-with-edge-game-assist/1100-6528001/" data-ref-id="1100-6528001">Microsoft Edge Game Assist</a>. It's a version of Edge that was specifically made for gaming, with browsers and windows that appear on top of games so players can access strategy guides and tips as needed. Now, Microsoft Edge Game Assist is out of the initial testing phase and available for all to use.</p><p>Game Assist appears to have been modeled on Steam's overlay browser. It can also detect when a handful of supported games are being played and offer relevant info on a side panel. The games that are currently supported include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. However, those aren't the only titles that can be played. Any game can be used in this mode, but only the supported games will have automatic guides readily available. The video below demonstrates how the Game Assist is supposed to work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZadyqM7Gxs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NZadyqM7Gxs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players can access this feature by going to Microsoft Edge and opening up the Settings and more to find the Game Assist widget. Once installed, the Game Assist feature will be available in the Game Bar. Because the Game Assist shares date with Edge's browser data, players' favorites, browsing history, and cookies will all remain the same. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348858/microsoft-edge-game-assist-game-bar-browser" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Game Assist is still technically in a preview state and support for more titles will be added in the future. It's another facet of Microsoft's ongoing gaming ambitions, which include plans to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-app-just-added-400-pc-games-and-microsoft-wants-more/1100-6528393/" data-ref-id="1100-6528393">all PC games with Xbox features into the Xbox app</a>. Late last year, Microsoft also launched a test pilot program for Game Pass Ultimate members <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-adds-a-nice-new-feature-but-only-for-testers-right-now/1100-6528390/" data-ref-id="1100-6528390">to stream some games they own</a> on Xbox consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span>Enfin levé</span><span>|</span><span><p>A photo from an Enfin levé release</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>As someone who has spent an embarrassing amount of money on clothes over the years, and as a result delved fairly deeply into some weird online communities surrounding them, I would like to use this website to mount a spirited defence of a fashion style I have long been very into, but which has lately fallen on some hard times. It's known as techwear.</p><p>Thanks to dropshippers, their social media ads, algorithms and just the outright misappropriation of the label over the years, many of you who have heard the word "techwear" as a passer-by probably associate it with a type of clothing that can best be described as landing somewhere on the design spectrum between Mall Ninja and a Tetsuya Nomura Character. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/8nmha7/is_anyone_else_into_techwear_fashion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Something like this Reddit thread</a>:</p><figure><figcaption>This ain't it</figcaption></figure><p>Think cargo pants with 17 pointless straps hanging off them, sci-fi face masks that look physically impossible to wear, jackets covered in big kanji characters. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=0b79686cda84ea15&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU1030AU1030&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIKT_mcy481Uule0HTkclsK_8dBHQg:1737093511795&amp;q=techwear&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J03RPjGV0MznOJ6Likin94pT_oR1DTSof42bOBxoTNxGMwEeUq17XDDUMegSIEO3KFroRcVZLfatAKBzHB2GC9DT8lE2xPXAjr-j38xxSTkMPHMlB-oQCnrLCflDrY1so-WFd_yuZCQztuM9KT0nCzigcsiQkoxVYxZIkz1iLkRqpOfohQ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi699jNifyKAxW4zjgGHac9JpoQtKgLegQIEhAB&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1271&amp;dpr=1.5#vhid=iy68AYf5F_ymKM&amp;vssid=mosaic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google "techwear" right now and the image results will give you page after page</a> of bad <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> cosplay, loads of kids dressing like they've been conscripted into a war against the machines.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="HOW TO DRESS #TECHWEAR" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g58kCABKy_I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But that's not techwear. Or at least it's not techwear as it was originally pioneered and intended. Techwear is, at its core, something much simpler. The most common definition--it doesn't have a wikipedia <em>or </em>dictionary entry!--tends to be something like<a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Techwear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> this Aesthetics Wiki post</a>, which says the trend "mostly grew out of a shared obsession with the craft and innovation of functional, durable, all-weather clothing".</p><p>Think clothes that look good, but are also packed with technology and innovative design expressed everywhere from materials to fabrics, which are often waterproof and/or windproof. Techwear normally also has design features like multiple pockets and cuts (like gusseted crotches) that allow for comfortable movement. In practical terms, techwear is supposed to be clothing that you can wear <em>anywhere</em>, in almost any conditions, from a rainy walk in the countryside to a train platform in the middle of winter to an office to a party.</p><p>Sounds great, right, or at least useful? That's how I got into it! Well, that's not strictly true: I first got into techwear when, having been a streetwear guy for most of my adult life,<a href="https://www.designboom.com/design/the-2014-nikelab-acg-collection-17-12-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in 2014 I saw the announcement for a new line called Nikelab ACG</a>, which blended Nikelab (Nike's premium fashion clothing) with ACG (the company's traditional label for rugged, outdoor gear). I was instantly in love with the whole thing. The futuristic look, the practicality, all of it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Nikelab ACG's 2014 debut brought techwear into the mainstream, and debuted pieces like this 2-in-1 system jacket that is still sought after today</span><span></span><span>Nike</span></figcaption></figure><p>I quickly learned why it was so good: it was a collaboration between Nike and Errolson Hugh, the co-founder of techwear pioneers Acronym, a label as famous for its cutting-edge fashion (and iconic pieces like<a href="https://www.grailed.com/drycleanonly/acronym-j1a-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the J1A jacket</a> and<a href="https://acrnm.com/P10-E_FW2122#a-image_12622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> P-10 pants</a>) as its exorbitant prices, which routinely run over $1000 for a single item. This Nikelab ACG stuff promised to be (relatively) more affordable, and over the next decade--with Acronym and other pricier techwear stuff out of reach--I collected as many pieces from the collection as I could. And while the aesthetics may have got me in the door, the practicality of having jackets with such useful pockets and trousers that had the pragmatism of cargo pants without the stigma kept me around.</p><p>Acronym isn't alone in the techwear space in charging lofty prices; other notable labels like<a href="https://enfinleve.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Enfin Leve</a>,<a href="https://arcteryx.com.au/collections/veilance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Veilance</a> and<a href="https://www.adidas.com.au/y_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Y3</a> are similarly priced, making them inaccessible to most people. That's why I went after the Nikelab ACG stuff so hard, and is also why I've spent much of the last decade lurking around online communities finding cheaper (and sometimes <em>much </em>cheaper) alternatives.</p><figure><figcaption><span>I picked up this ridiculously versatile Nikelab ACG trench around six years ago now, and I think it looks as good today as it did back in 2018</span><span></span><span>Nike</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of which there are loads. The scene might be somewhat famous for being expensive--all that tech and workmanship and, let's be real, exclusivity comes at a price--but you don't need to spend $1200 on a pair of cargo pants to get in on the action. There's plenty of technical crossover with other brands that will let you make use of loads of features and look good at a fraction of the price. Uniqlo has a ton of stuff that is surprisingly technical, for instance--<a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/au/en/products/E464024-000?colorCode=COL09&amp;sizeCode=SMA002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Blocktech Parka is almost a techwear cliche</a>, as is anything with the company's AIRism tech, up to and including the essential oversized tee.</p><p>A particular lower-priced favourite of some of us at Aftermath is<a href="https://www.orbitgear.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Indonesian label Orbitgear</a>, who are making stuff by hand from their studio in Jakarta and offering loads of amazing gear at much more affordable prices. Both myself and Chris Person have Orbitgear bags, and I just bought a <em>very </em>nice pair of shorts for $100 where a similar pair made by Acronym (albeit with slightly nicer fabric, of course) would have run me well over $600.</p><p>Making techwear even more versatile (and sometimes more affordable) is the way you can break it down into subgenres, or examine associated trends that sit pretty close to it on the venn diagram of fashion.<a href="https://www.grailed.com/drycleanonly/what-is-gorpcore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Gorpcore, a relatively current streetwear trend of dressing like you're about to go climb a mountain even though you're at the mall</a>, cuts very close to techwear because it often shares many of the same priorities, like space-age fabrics and climate versatility. Flagship gorpcore brands like Nike ACG, Salomon and Arcteryx are popular in the techwear scene.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Veilance is one of the few brands in the space with specific women's collections</span><span></span><span>Veilance</span></figcaption></figure><p>See also 'Grayman", a techwear subgenre that is particularly focused on visual simplicity and formality. Recognising that general techwear stuff like Acronym and Enfin Leve can sometimes go a little too hard on pockets and the tactical look, Grayman emphasises a cleaner look. <a href="https://www.tchwr.com/2019/11/22/low-key-high-tech-perfecting-the-grayman-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can find some examples here</a>, and while labels like Veilance feature heavily, once again you can find a lot of much cheaper alternatives at Uniqlo (basically any office clothing with "stretch" in the name).</p><p>Even activewear can take part. Lululemon stock a ton of technical clothing, especially their menswear section, which features stuff like<a href="https://www.lululemon.com.au/en-au/c/men/bottoms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> stretch pants for the office</a> and business shirts that feel and move more like soccer jerseys. I've also become a big fan of Australian cycling apparel brand MAAP, not because I'm a serious cyclist,<a href="https://maap.cc/collections/off-bike-man" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> but because their off-bike stuff has a great technical slant</a>, with lots of nice cuts, materials and practical benefits.</p><p>Techwear's appeal and versatility even goes beyond the real world. Errolson Hugh designed Adam Jensen's jacket in <em>Deus Ex</em>, for example,<a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/death-stranding-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> while also doing so much work on Kojima Productions' <em>Death Stranding</em> that he makes an appearance in the game</a> (and is reprising all this for the upcoming sequel). Ukrainian techwear label Riot Division worked on jacket design for <em>Ghostwire Tokyo</em>, and if you're a fan of <em>Mirror's Edge</em> and its sequel they're leaning <em>very </em>hard on the style.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...when we did clothing for Deus Ex and Death Stranding, we actually ended up designing the clothes as if they were real. We used the exact same process as we would for something we would actually manufacture. It just translates super easily.</p><cite>Errolson Hugh, <a href="https://bdgastore.com/blogs/blogdega/in-conversation-with-errolson-hugh">Bodega</a></cite></blockquote></figure><p>I love these clothes. I love the knowledge that I can put something on in the morning and know I'll be able to wear it wherever I go that day and whatever the weather. I love the fact that so many of the most famous brands and their pieces are almost timeless, meaning I can buy something in 2015 and it still looks incredible in 2025 (which is especially useful when you spend $400 on pants, you want to get some use out of them!).</p><p>I think it sucks that the term “techwear” has gotten so lost in the wash; not only does most of the stuff being labelled or known colloquially as "techwear" these days actually<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-is-warcore-streetwear-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> belong to a style known as "warcore"</a>, but because most of it is fast fashion junk that has no technical benefit whatsoever, as it's missing everything from waterproofing to breathable fabrics. The whole point of the word is that it's supposed to be technical!</p><p>Things have gotten so bad that I'm almost embarrassed to say I'm into techwear when I'm among people who don't know what it actually is. An example: we had a Kotaku meeting a few years back where I said I liked it out loud, and people <em>laughed at me</em> because they were picturing me, a man in my 40s, wearing a pair of pants with straps hanging between the crotch and waving a lightsaber around.

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages’ release date has been leaked and will launch on May 15, 2025.</p>



<p>That’s according to an article released by Gamekult (article since removed), who’s seemingly released embargoed information ahead of the Xbox developer Direct.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that select media will be seeing previews of DOOM: The Dark Ages ahead of the official presentation.</p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct is scheduled to place on January 23rd, making the 23rd a somewhat hectic day in the world of gaming as Assassin’s Creed Shadows previews will also drop on the game day.</p>



<p>As already revealed by Xbox, three games; DOOM: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, and Expedition 33 are set to have “in-depth” showcases, while Xbox has also teased a fourth game, which we released the scuttlebutt of what the game is in the latest Insider Gaming Newsletter (sign up below).</p>



<p>As well as the four game announcements, a few other surprises will be announced during the event or in the coming days, Insider Gaming understands.</p>



<p>“You are the DOOM Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior and the super weapon in this never-before-seen dark and sinister medieval war against Hell,” the official DOOM: The Dark Ages description reads.</p>



<p>What do you think of DOOM: The Dark Ages releasing in May? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/our-thoughts-and-theories-on-severances-second-season<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new season of <em>Severance</em> is finally upon us! Gita, Chris and Riley sat down to talk through the season premiere, which is enigmatic as ever.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Chris! Riley! Last week, after a three year wait, the second season of the Apple TV show <em>Severance </em>finally premiered. I had been trying to keep my expectations low given the long, long wait, but I'm pretty excited about how this episode turned out, and the twist and turns it sets up for the next season. Let's talk about it today!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Sure! I had a good time.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Same! I didn't realize quite how long it had been since Season 1 ended; it actually coincided with the end of my free Apple TV subscription, but I was like "Oh, I'll just keep it going for more <em>Severance</em>." Whoops!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Hahaha—that's how they get you, huh?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> With this and <em>Squid Game</em> I had to look up what happened previously because it had been so long.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, with both I had to keep pausing to Google what was going on lol.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I didn't have that hard of a time but as I was watching the premiere, I did start to realize that there were a lot of events I had simply forgotten about. The season finale from three years ago ended on such an intense cliffhanger that I was chomping at the bit for resolution this whole time. But there's actually a lot about the Lumon corporation and the severed workers there that we don't know about yet, and that cliffhanger didn't get resolved at all.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah I just forgot big details of the show, that doesn’t take away from it but I forgot the specifics of what had happened and it’s compounded by the ambiguity of what they’re being told happened.</p><p>I think in the case of both this show and <em>Squid Game</em> there was an understandable desire to get it right but if you don’t have that already in the chamber the break is rough.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I appreciated the mystery that opens the season in light of all that-- it would have been an easy choice to give us (and the characters) answers and move on into "what now?" but instead we still have the "what happened?" to untangle.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Severance — Season 2 Official Trailer | Apple TV+" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UXKlYvLGJY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Gita:</strong> In the world of Severance, some employees at the Lumon corporation undergo a surgery that bifurcates their memories so they basically don't remember what went on at work. This entire episode delved into the lives of the "innies," people who only exist on the company floor. It was honestly kind of disorienting, because we really have no idea what information to trust or not. The bosses hold all the cards.</p><p>It's basically like a science fiction version of Marx's theory of alienation.</p><p>In an effort to untangle the "what happened?" I have to ask. The innies have been told it's been five months since the previous season. Do you believe that? I definitely do not.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I don't think I do either.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well what they’re being told is that they enacted meaningful change and they had a big parade for them and now everything is fixed because there are more snacks.</p><p>It’s done in a very fun way multiple times in the episode, but the entire time you’re supposed to doubt it.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah, for instance, if you look at the (very cool) claymation video they're shown about their actions after last season, they're told they have "new perks" as a result of their actions. One of them is a hall pass—but if there's a hall pass, then that means the bosses are taking more control over their movements in the building.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I love when they get to flex their production chops like that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> That video ruled to me, a guy watching the show, but also seemed so ridiculous— did Lumon think the innies would really be swayed by it?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I think the new character, Ms. Huang, is the key to understanding that, Riley. Their new manager is a literal child.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think I know who she is supposed to be but it would be a spoiler if I’m right.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>What is the deal with her omg?!?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Big child.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I also think I know who she is..... let's talk theories in a minute.</p><p>What's so enjoyable about this show is that it gives you that <em>Lost</em>-juice. It is very easy to theorize about shit on this show because everything is really esoteric.</p><p>They have a good balance between revealing new information and having that information leading to new mysteries to uncover.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Haha, the creators have literally reassured fans that <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/severance-recap-season-2-episode-1-why-helly-lies-1236276867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will not go the way of Lost</a>.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I like that they initially try to get Mark into a new team before he freaks out. Bob Balaban was there! Love that guy.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> And Alia Shawkat!!!!! I was so happy to see her.</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The show is really good at utilizing character actors which is the way to my heart. Loved seeing Zach Cherry and John Turturro again</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> When I saw Zach Cherry I wanted to cry. I missed him. But seeing John Turturro.......... he's a real actor, man. I'm still so heartbroken about Burt.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I think there's still hope! You never know!</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Holding a candle for the elder yaoi…. Did you hear that Christopher Walken gets DVDs of the series mailed to him because he doesn't stream?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> King shit.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Given the nature of the show, it's really hard to talk about all its mysteries and unanswered questions without spoiling things. If you don't want to be spoiled on the specifics of the episode, please stop reading and don't @ us about it.</p><p><strong>SPOILERS</strong></p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Okay, I am pretty sure that macrodata refinement is about taming the four tempers of the mind to create perfect workers, and Mark's wife is their test subject.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Interesting.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>The very last shot of the episode is seen through Mark S.'s computer, showing Ms. Casey. All this time, they've been sorting numbers based on feelings. Last season, Ms. Casey was sent back to the "testing floor." That's all gotta be related somehow.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think Miss Huang is their kid.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah I think you're right too!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That would also explain her being big. Like she’s a refinement of that experiment.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Hhhm, I hadn't thought about that, I could see it.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That or none of this is strictly the real world. But a dream sequence feels a little cheap.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Part of me doesn't want some kind of answers or reveal; I think that messy space full of questions is the most compelling. It's like in <em>The Leftovers</em>—obviously you want to know why the Sudden Departure happened, but it's so much cooler to watch people live with it and never have that answered. I don't want some, like, final showdown with the Eagans or something where all our questions are answered.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>I too hope that we don't get too many answers—there's a jazz-like looseness with this show's connection to reality that I enjoy. Plus, I think bringing it too close to reality or truth would make the show's obvious references to the alienating aspects of labor less... good.</p><p>Like this season opens up with an acknowledgement that even critiques of capital reinforce capital, Mark Fisher style. But the closer this show gets to making its points more specifically the more uncomfortable I am with it literally being an Apple TV+ show, you know what I mean?</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah I had the same feeling. That’s always going to be the limit of a tv show and the show is internally acknowledging it about itself but about capitalism writ large. The company is able to use the narrative of their rebellion to strengthen itself and Apple is able to use the success of a prestige show about alienation to cement Apple TV+.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Seeing balloons with Mark S.'s face on it on the Apple homepage gave me the ick.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I don’t think it’s impossible to say something in that space but the closest you get is like <em>Sorry To Bother You</em>.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah, it's very hard! I think this show is threading the needle in a way that's different from how, say, <em>Andor</em>, did. It's more... lyrical. Its approach is more French New Wave. And the sheer joy of watching such incredible filmmaking just puts me in a mood to be moved, emotionally, to allow this show to change me.</p><p>The opening sequence where Mark is running through the hallways of the Lumon severed floor made me like, mad at how bad a lot of television looks these days. A lot of the time, they don't even move the damn camera!</p><p>Chris: I didn’t love the compositing in that but I loved them trying. It’s a really hard shot to get right.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> They overused the "whoosh" sound effect when the camera made those big swings. But it was a swing, a bold way to open the show.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah! It sets the tone very well.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, it's a really good-looking show, I'll give it that.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Before we finish up this conversation I wanted to talk about the other main appeal of this show: old man yaoi. Last season, Irv fell in love on the severed floor with another severed worker, Burt, played by Christopher Walken. We last left the character banging on Burt's door, calling out his name. When we see him again for the first time this season, he's banging on the elevator door crying out for Burt, still. Our boy Irv is not doing well!</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I was really rooting for them! Now I'm torn between, I still want them to get together, but also if Burt is happy out in the real world, who is Irv (or us, the audience) to mess with that?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Is there a way for their innies and their outies to get what they want?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Is Burt married to a woman or a man?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> A man, IIRC.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Ah ok, I thought it was ambiguous and enjoyed the concept of your innie being gay but you being straight.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to meet his partner or maybe I don’t. Maybe I just gotta let it go.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Most of the innies have this competing tension between what they want and what their outies want. Helly R., for instance, is actually an executive at the Lumon Corporation. As Helly, she has a burgeoning romance with Mark S., but Mark's outtie is still devastated over the loss of his wife.</p><p>It feels like the innies and outies are distinct people from each other, but they're also the same person. So who wins, in that scenario? Who's desires take precedence?</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I guess what happens if you merge those people?</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Helly lying to everyone—I assume!---is such a good twist. Like, did Lumon get to her? Is she worried the other innies will be mad when they find out who she really is?</p><p>Maybe that phrasing is wrong—who is she really haha?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> My personal take is that it's Helena posing as Helly. She's a corporate spy trying to sow division!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Oh that’s nasty</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It's what corporate would do, though!</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I also had this thought!</p><p>Like I said above, it's hard to know how capable corporate thinks the innies are. A spy would definitely make more sense than taking corporate's current actions at face value.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I hope what everyone can take away from this show is that you should never trust your bosses, ever.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The innies need a union.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition"><h3>In Defense Of Techwear</h3></a><p>It's where form meets function</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review"><h3>Grand Theft Hamlet Is A Funny, Touching Take On Shakespeare</h3></a><p>‘We’re putting on a play inside a game, but the game is a kind of play, because we’re playing’</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We already knew roughly when it was coming, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-film-sequel-on-the-way">Paramount's announcement at the end of last year</a>, but the Sonic the Hedgehog 4 movie now has a proper release date. It is, however, still a fair way out - with Sonic's next big screen undertaking not due until March 2027.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is - as <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-4-release-date-march-2027-1236280697/">reported by Variety</a> - currently expected to hit cinemas on 19th March, 2027. No further specifics have been revealed, but we do, of course, have a pretty good idea of who'll be joining the Sonic crew in instalment four.
</p>
<p>
Over the course of its three previous entries, the Sonic movie series has established a tradition of including a big character reveal during its credits. Sonic 1 suggested Tails would be along for the second Sonic movie, while Shadow the Hedgehog emerged from his slumber in a mid-credits sequence for Sonic 2. And as for the recently released Sonic 3, that made it pretty clear <strong>[SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS]</strong> Amy Rose will be entering the fray - oversized hammer in hand - for Sonic the Hedgehog 4 <strong>[END OF SPOILERS]</strong>.

<p>
Regardless of where the story heads next, it seems unlikely Sega and Paramount will be ready to wrap up the series when Sonic the Hedgehog 4 arrives in 2027. As noted by Variety, Sonic 3 proved to be a huge success when it released in December, generating $422m at the box office globally so far - a figure officially making it the movie series' highest grossing entry so far.
</p><p>
Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale was also won over by last year's movie, calling it an "authentic Sonic romp with added Keanu cool" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">four star review</a>. "Sonic 3 is a resounding success and fitting finale to the Year of Shadow," he wrote. "It's quippy and self-aware... while its flashy action thrills alongside an unbridled sense of cool that's only enhanced by Reeves as Shadow."

Not only does this hold true when you compare the games’ general structures and several hero kits, but now it’s also very obvious in <em>Rivals</em>’ new seasonal events. The Spring Festival starts on Thursday, January 23, and is basically an amalgamation of <em>Overwatch</em>’s Lunar New Year and Lucioball events.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The Spring Festival includes three skins—one each for Star-Lord, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-iron-fist-counter-balance-changes-patch-1851723268&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-iron-fist-counter-balance-changes-patch-1851723268">Iron Fist</a></span>, and Black Widow—as well as a new mode called Clash of Dancing Lions that looks like 3v3 soccer, similar to Lucioball. Each of the skins includes nods to traditional Chinese attire, and the event incorporates iconography befitting a celebration of the Chinese New Year which, this year, lands on January 29. NetEase is a Chinese company so it makes sense that the holiday would be celebrated in-game, but given the constant heat <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is getting for being derivative of <em>Overwatch</em>, I’m surprised that celebration looks so similar to what <em>Overwatch </em>has been doing since 2017.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dice-throne-announces-industry-veteran-as-ceo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A tabletop industry veteran has just been announced as CEO of development studio, Dice Throne. The company has a consistent track record of well-received titles, and with a new head at the helm, that quality has the potential to grow.</p>

<h2>The New Dice Throne CEO Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a press release, Dice Throne has announced Casey Sershon as their CEO. Sershon has over a decade of experience in the tabletop industry. He served as Senior Director of Business and Development at The Op, playing an active role in every part of the business, including helping the development team make <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-dice-throne-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Marvel Dice Throne</em></a> and <em>X-Men Dice Throne</em>.</p>

It is a competitive board game where players roll dice and play cards to manipulate those dice results to beat their opponents. It debuted in 2018 and has remained consistently popular, spawning waves of supplements and several successful Kickstarter projects. Its most recent, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dicethrone/dice-throne-outcasts" rel="nofollow"><em>Outcasts</em></a>, raised more than $1.6 million.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;"Joining Dice Throne is an honor. This team and the community around it are something special, and their passion for these games is unrivaled. I plan to preserve and build upon what Nate has had such a pivotal role in creating so fans can trust that what they love about Dice Throne is here to stay,” explains Casey Sershon, CEO of Dice Throne. “My top priority will be expanding on the incredible community we’ve fostered and continuing the company’s growth. I’m excited to leverage my game industry experience to help the brand reach new heights and fans. The surface of Dice Throne’s potential has barely been scratched.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sershon's new role of CEO begins at the cusp of a tumultuous time for the tabletop industry. As the United States has sworn in convicted felon and President Donald Trump for a second term, his proposed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deep-regrets-developer-voices-potential-impact-of-imposing-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a> may have an adverse effect on tabletop prices across the entire industry. Offsetting such production costs will be a challenge for all involved.</p>
