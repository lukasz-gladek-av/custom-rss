                <p>The Order: 1886 developer Ready at Dawn pitched a sequel to Sony but was ultimately rejected. While the reason was unclear, the developer thought that had the game's critical reception been higher, there would've been a better chance.</p><p>"We really thought that with The Order, we had set up such a unique and appealing baseline that people were going to forgive some of its shortcomings," Ready at Dawn co-founder Andrea Pessino said in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFmUHo_pJJ0&amp;t=2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with MinnMax</a>. "It would've been an incredible sequel, I can tell you for a fact."</p><p>Despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-order-1886-review/1900-6416033/" data-ref-id="1900-6416033">The Order 1886's lukewarm critical reception</a>, sitting at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-order-1886/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63 on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic</a>, Ready at Dawn pitched a sequel. Pessino explained that it was actually better that Sony passed on the sequel because the budget would've been small and the studio didn't have any leverage to negotiate a better contract. However, Pessino said that the team would've taken the opportunity anyway in order to redeem The Order: 1886.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFmUHo_pJJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rFmUHo_pJJ0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Pessnio didn't divulge any details about where the sequel would take place, as the IP belongs to Sony and not Ready at Dawn. One of the problems during the development of The Order: 1886 was the pressure to ship so content was cut--interactive elements became cutscenes and movies. "We were desperate, you know, we had to ship," he said. "We need at least one more year and we didn't get it."</p><p>Pessino didn't reveal how much The Order: 1886 sold, but thought Sony's rejection was based on critical reception rather than sales numbers. Interestingly, he said that internal mock reviews placed the game's score at around the 70s range, yet when the game was released, the critical reception ended up being lower. Had it actually scored somewhere in the 70s, then Pessino was convinced there could've been a sequel.</p><p>A sequel to The Order 1886 isn't the only one that Sony passed on. Last week, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resistance-4-was-pitched-but-didnt-work-out-says-former-boss/1100-6529337/" data-ref-id="1100-6529337">Sony passed on Resistance 4</a> when it was pitched as well. Ready at Dawn was acquired by Meta in 2020, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-and-lone-echo-developer-shuts-down/1100-6525619/" data-ref-id="1100-6525619">was shut down last August</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-sets-february-release-date-for-the-thing-and-human-torch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals"><u>Marvel Rivals</u></a> will round out The Fantastic Four team when The Thing and Human Torch launch as playable characters on February 21, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release date for the new heroes in Marvel and NetEase Games’ popular hero shooter was announced today, revealing that they'll arrive alongside an update for the second half of Season 1. Although the team has yet to spill the beans on what exactly this Season 1.5 update has in store, <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a Dev Talk blog post</u></a> on the Marvel Rivals website teased “major balance adjustments.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for The Thing and Human Torch, we have yet to see exactly how the two classic heroes will light up the roster with their new moves and abilities. Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman were introduced as the first post-launch Marvel Rivals heroes when Season 1 launched last month. Both characters brought along unique tools to shift the multiplayer game’s meta in a new direction, with Reed Richards able to take stretchy (and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-are-stretching-mister-fantastics-meme-potential-to-its-limit"><u>goofy</u></a>) swings at enemies thanks to his elastic powers while Sue Storm introduced invisibility mechanics to the battlefield. Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm will surely do the same when they launch in a few weeks, but let’s hope NetEase reveals some gameplay before then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcoming Marvel Rivals Season 1 update will also see Ranked players hit with a rank reset. Come February 21, expect to see your Rank drop four divisions, meaning if you’re a Diamond I player on February 20, you’ll be brought down to Platinum II the following day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase explained how this process will carry on in the future, saying that brand-new seasons will hit players with a six-division drop, while half-season updates will bring a four-division drop. As Marvel Rivals continues to tweak its Ranked offerings to players’ desires, NetEase said it will “tune this as necessary.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all doom and gloom, though, as competitive Marvel fans in the Gold rank can look forward to new costume rewards with the launch of the second half of Season 1. NetEase will also be introducing new Crests of Honor to “recognize players at Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All (the top 500).”</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Superhero fans had been not-so-patiently waiting to hear more about how Marvel Rivals will continue its post-launch plans, and The Fantastic Four is just the beginning. Last month, creative director Guangyun Chen drummed up excitement by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-promises-a-new-hero-every-month-and-a-half"><u>promising to release a new playable character every half-season</u></a>. That means a fresh Marvel face will join the fight roughly every six weeks, giving fans plenty to keep coming back for as seasonal updates progress. There’s quite a bit of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-blade-first-look-image-and-in-game-lore-leak-suggests-season-2-release"><u>evidence to suggest the vampire-hunting Daywalker Blade</u></a> is next on the list, though outside of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-fear-netease-is-planting-fake-hero-leaks-to-throw-off-dataminers-but-whats-really-going-on"><u>some rumors and leaks that have had players arguing for the last few weeks</u></a>, Marvel Rivals’ future remains a mystery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-characters"><u>our current Marvel Rivals Season 1 tier list to find out the best characters</u></a> while you wait for the mid-season update to shake things up.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission has confirmed that Roblox is "part of an active and ongoing investigation."</p><p><a href="https://hntrbrk.com/roblox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hunterberg Media</a> originally reported last fall that Roblox was under investigation by the SEC over charges that it "inflated key metrics" for investors on Wall Street and for its lax safety measures regarding potential child predators on the platform. The SEC did not confirm that Roblox's parent company, The Roblox Corporation, is under investigation. However, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/sec-confirms-game-service-roblox-part-of-active-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> has confirmed that the SEC refused to provide details of its investigation because it may "harm... the ongoing enforcement proceeding."</p><p>In November 2024, The Roblox Corporation laid out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-putting-restrictions-on-kids-in-social-hangouts/1100-6527648/" data-ref-id="1100-6527648">new safety guidelines for children</a> on the platform. Children under the age of 13 are no longer allowed access to unrated experiences created within Roblox, and only children 13 and older will be allowed to utilize the social hangouts and free-form user-creation experiences. That move came after a previous <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> story which noted that The Roblox Company reported over 13,000 instances of child exploitation to authorities in 2023. Moreover, two dozen people were arrested for abusing children after making contact with them through the platform.</p><p>The Roblox Corporation <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/07/driving-civility-and-safety-for-all-users" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to that report</a> by touting its cooperation with law enforcement to combat illegal activity on the platform. It also suggested that Bloomberg's report didn't contextualize the scale of the child exploitation problem with Roblox's large user base.</p><p>During last year's Roblox Developers Conference, The Roblox Corporation reiterated its plans to reach <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-corp-eyeing-1-billion-daily-players/1100-6516723/" data-ref-id="1100-6516723">1 billion daily active users</a>. If it's proven that The Roblox inflated its current estimate of daily Roblox users to investors, that could potentially lead to severe penalties from the SEC.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a> will receive its mid-Season 1 update on February 21, bringing new heroes, big changes to the game's meta, and a rank reset for competitive mode enjoyers, developer NetEase has announced.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, NetEase said competitive players will have their ranks drop four divisions following the mid-season update. The mid-season rank drop is happening due to "major balance changes" that are expected to "shake-up the battlefield" for the remainder of the game's first competitive season.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals | The Spring Festival Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">There are a few additional changes coming to competitive as well, with a new Gold rank and above costume for players to earn and Crests of Honor cosmetics for players at Grandmaster rank and above that will have a unique design each season. NetEase said players will need to complete 10 matches in competitive mode in order to claim the rewards for any given season.</p><p dir="ltr">What balance changes are in store for Marvel Rivals is still under wraps, but NetEase did confirm that the Human Torch and The Thing will be making their debut alongside the mid-season update. The Thing will be a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-vanguard-tank-heroes/2900-6103/" data-ref-id="2900-6103">Vanguard character</a>. Meanwhile, Human Torch will be added to the game's increasingly large <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-duelist-dps-heroes/2900-6105/" data-ref-id="2900-6105">Duelist</a> lineup. With the additions of the two heroes, the entire Fantastic Four will be playable in Marvel Rivals, with NetEase having added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-invisible-woman-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-unseen-force/2300-6465576/" data-ref-id="2300-6465576">Invisible Woman</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-mister-fantastic-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-stretching-into-action/2300-6465572/" data-ref-id="2300-6465572">Mr. Fantastic</a> at the beginning of Season 1.</p><p dir="ltr">NetEase has already said players can expect new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-marvel-rivals-characters-will-release-much-more-often-than-you-might-expect/1100-6528797/" data-ref-id="1100-6528797">two new playable characters every season</a>--one at the beginning and another at the season's mid-point, with each Marvel Rivals seasons lasting three months.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-balance-update-is-full-of-buffs-and-nerfs-for-each-role-full-patch-notes/1100-6528702/" data-ref-id="1100-6528702">first major balance changes for Marvel Rivals as part of Season 1</a> nerfed some of its most popular damage-dealing Duelist characters while buffing many of the game's powerful Strategist (aka support) heroes. Given how dominate Strategists and their game-halting healing ultimate abilities currently are, it's likely nerfs are incoming for characters like Cloak &amp; Dagger and Luna Snow. However, players will have to wait for the official patch notes to see what's in store for Marvel Rivals mid-Season 1 update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/609367/roblox-discord-openai-google-roost-online-safety-tools<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Google, OpenAI, Roblox, and Discord have formed a new non-profit organization to help improve child safety online. The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/leading-technology-companies-and-foundations-back-new-initiative-to-provide-free-open-source-tools-for-a-safer-internet-in-the-ai-era-302371243.html">Robust Open Online Safety Tools (ROOST</a>) initiative aims to make core safety technologies more accessible for companies and provide free, open-source AI tools for identifying, reviewing, and reporting child sexual abuse material.</p><p>The initiative was partially motivated by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138356/ai-companies-csam-thorn-training-data">changes that generative AI advancements</a> have made to online environments and aims to address “a critical need to accelerate innovation in online child safety,” according to founding ROOST partner and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Details about the CSAM detection tools are slim beyond that they will utilize large language AI models and “unify” existing options for dealing with the content.</p><p>“Starting with a platform focused on child protection, ROOST’s collaborative, open-source approach will foster innovation and make essential infrastructure more transparent, accessible, and inclusive, with the goal of creating a safer internet for everyone,” said Schmidt.</p><div><p>The <a href="https://roost.tools/">ROOST</a> announcement comes amid a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24205393/kids-online-safety-act-minors-age-verification-kosa">huge regulatory battle regarding child safety</a> on social media and online platforms, with companies seeking to appease lawmakers with self-regulation methods.</p></div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/cybertiplinedata">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a> (NCMEC) reports that suspected child exploitation increased by 12 percent between 2022 and 2023. As of 2020, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333431/roblox-over-half-of-us-kids-playing-virtual-parties-fortnite">over half of US children were on Roblox</a>, and the company has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262033/roblox-the-bear-cave-child-abuse">repeatedly criticized</a> for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">failing to tackle child sexual exploitation</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24296652/new-york-childrens-online-safety-act-gounardes-privacy">exposure to inappropriate content</a> on its platform. Roblox and Discord were also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23390796/roblox-discord-facebook-snapchat-social-media-lawsuits-addiction-child-abuse">singled out in a social media lawsuit filed in 2022</a> that alleged the platforms failed to stop adults from messaging children without supervision.</p></div><p>Founding members of ROOST are variously providing funding and offering their tools or expertise to the project. ROOST says it’s partnering with leading AI foundation model developers to build a “community of practice” for content safeguards, which will include providing vetted AI training datasets and identifying gaps in safety.</p><p>The initiative says it will be making “tools that already exist” more accessible, effectively combining various detection and reporting tech from its member organizations into a unified solution that’s easier for other companies to implement. Naren Koneru, Roblox’s vice president of engineering, trust, and safety, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91275256/roblox-joins-27-million-industry-nonprofit-to-support-online-safety">told <em>Fast Company</em></a> that ROOST may host AI moderation systems that companies can integrate through API calls. There’s some ambiguity about what ROOST’s AI moderation tools will include, however.</p><p>For example, Discord says its contributions will build on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23950604/lantern-program-csam-child-exploitation-google-meta-discord-privacy">Lantern cross-platform information-sharing project</a> it joined in 2023 alongside Meta and Google. It could also include <a href="https://github.com/Roblox/voice-safety-classifier">an updated version of Roblox’s AI model</a> for detecting profanity, racism, bullying, sexting, and other inappropriate content in audio clips, which the company is planning to open-source this year. It’s unclear precisely how the tools will intersect with existing first-line CSAM detection systems like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna">Microsoft’s PhotoDNA image analysis tool</a>.</p><p>Alongside <a href="https://discord.com/safety/safer-internet-day-2025">its participation in ROOST</a>, Discord has released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609310/discord-ignore-mute-users-feature-block">a new “Ignore” feature</a> that allows users to hide messages and notifications they receive without notifying the people they have muted. “At Discord, we believe that safety is a common good,” Discord’s Chief Legal Officer Clint Smith said in the ROOST announcement. “We’re committed to making the entire internet - not just Discord - a better and safer place, especially for young people.” </p><p>ROOST has raised more than $27 million to support its first four years of operations, backed by philanthropic organizations including the McGovern Foundation, Future of Online Trust and Safety Fund, Knight Foundation, and the AI Collaborative. The ROOST organization will also be supported by experts in child safety, artificial intelligence, open-source technology, and “countering violent extremism” according to the press release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last March, Sega <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sells-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-and-lays-off-more-staff-at-creative-assembly-and-hardlight">sold off Company Of Heroes and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War developers Relic Entertainment</a> in the course of wider "restructuring", "realigning" and lay-offening at the house of Sonic. Relic's new corporate partners are a holding company established by the UK investment firm Emona Capital LLP - an arrangement that apparently lets them operate like an independent studio, though I'm fuzzy on the moving parts. </p>
<p>I was happy to hear that Relic had escaped outright closure. I'm even happier to hear that they're making more strategy games - a mixture of revival projects, big new games, and smaller productions with a faster turnaround.</p>
<p>All that's from a brief chat with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/company-of-heroes-developer-relic-to-build-for-the-future-with-smaller-titles-and-classic-revivals">Game Developer</a>, in which CEO Justin Dowdeswell lays on the talk of sunlit uplands. Relic will continue to support their existing games, like 2023's Company Of Heroes 3. They'll also work on projects of similar scale and complexity, perhaps including remasters or re-releases for older Relic games. There's the dangled carrot of remakes that "capture the spirit of the originals" but, by implication, take a few liberties with the fundamentals. Picking which older Relic games to revive will, as you'd expect, be a "multifactored process" of haggling it out with external partners.</p>
<p>And then there's the prospect of smaller Relic projects that, in Game Developer's paraphrase, will allow the developers to "explore new genres and experiences". Relic's hope is to develop and ship these in under two years. </p>
<p>"We're looking to operate with smaller teams on shorter timeframes, which means likely getting a game in market roughly in the 1-2 year range," Dowdeswell explained. "Budget costs will vary depending on scope, but these titles will have a notably smaller budget than the big Relic RTS games we will continue to work on." </p><p>Relic <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/relic-hit-with-layoffs-following-sale-from-sega">cut back on staff</a> following the Sega sale, but Dowdeswell insists the company are on a "much better footing" these days. Fingers crossed that it all pans out, I guess. While they're a different team nowadays, I still venerate Relic as the creators of the original Homeworld, to say nothing of Dawn Of War, and their recent stuff has been pretty good: Katharine (RPS in peace) called Company Of Heroes 3 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/company-of-heroes-3-review">"a glorious comeback"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s right, Lamar put a direct reference to PlayStation in his performance.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wired</em></a></span> has a deep dive into the making of Lamar’s show, including interviews with the performance’s art director Shelley Rodgers and creative director Mike Carson, who explained that the premise of the show’s staging was to portray Lamar’s life “as a video game.” This included spaces on stage that were made to look like the face buttons of a PlayStation controller; a triangle, circle, X, and square. </p><p>“I think the [video game theme] was symbolic, his way to reach young people,” Rodgers told <em>Wired</em>. “A lot of it is showing his journey, traveling through the American dream.”</p><p>The performance itself wasn’t too overt with the video game motif, with Carson saying the team wanted to stay “clean and minimal.”</p><p>“We went with a monochromatic concrete look and allowed the video game motif to come alive through dialogue, lighting, choreography, and music,” Carson said.</p><p><em>Wired’</em>s story has a lot more behind-the-scenes information, including some photos of the stage being built.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/handful-of-users-claim-new-nvidia-gpus-are-melting-power-cables-again/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The 12VHPWR and 12V-2x6 connectors are both designed to solve a real problem: delivering hundreds of watts of power to high-end GPUs over a single cable rather than trying to fit multiple 8-pin power connectors onto these GPUs. In theory, swapping two to four 8-pin connectors for a single 12V-2x6 or 12VHPWR connector cuts down on the amount of board space OEMs must reserve for these connectors in their designs and the number of cables that users have to snake through the inside of their gaming PCs.</p>
<p>But while Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Arm, and other companies are all PCI-SIG members and all had a hand in the design of the new standards, Nvidia is the only GPU company to use the 12VHPWR and 12V-2x6 connectors in most of its GPUs. AMD and Intel have continued to use the 8-pin power connector, and even some of Nvidia's partners have stuck with 8-pin connectors for lower-end, lower-power cards like the RTX 4060 and 4070 series.</p>
<p>Both of the reported 5090 incidents involved third-party cables, one from custom PC part manufacturer <a href="https://www.moddiy.com/products/ATX-3.0-PCIe-5.0-600W-12VHPWR-16-Pin-to-16-Pin-PCIE-Gen-5-Power-Cable.html">MODDIY</a> and one included with an FSP power supply, rather than the first-party 8-pin adapter that Nvidia supplies with GeForce GPUs. It's much too early to say whether these cables (or Nvidia, or the design of the connector, or the affected users) caused the problem or whether this was just a coincidence.</p>
<p>We've contacted Nvidia to see whether it's aware of and investigating the reports and will update this piece if we receive a response.</p>

<p>While writing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/">a wide-ranging history of Windows <em>Minesweeper</em></a> for Boss Fight Books in 2023, I ended up playing many variations of Microsoft's beloved original game. Those include <a href="https://illarn.itch.io/hexasweeper">versions with hexagonal tiles</a>, <a href="https://stingby12.itch.io/my-very-epic-custom-minesweeper-variants">versions with weird board shapes</a>, and versions that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/787980/4D_Minesweeper/">extend <em>Minesweeper</em> into four dimensions</a> or <a href="http://gravitation3d.com/xezlec/">more</a>, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Almost all these variants messed a little too much with the careful balance of simplicity, readability, reasoning, and luck that made the original <em>Minesweeper</em> so addictive. None of them became games I return to day after day.</p>
<p>But then I stumbled onto <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/dragonsweeper"><em>Dragonsweeper</em></a>, a free browser-based game that <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/">indie developer Daniel Benmergui</a> released unceremoniously on itch.io last month. In the weeks since I discovered it, the game has become my latest puzzle obsession, filling in a worrying proportion of my spare moments with its addictive, simple RPG-tinged take on the <em>Minesweeper</em> formula.</p>
<h2>Exploresweeper</h2>
<p>Like <em>Minesweeper</em> before it, <em>Dragonsweeper</em> is a game about deducing hidden information based on the limited information you can already see on the grid. But the numbers you reveal in <em>Dragonsweeper</em> don't simply tell you the <em>number</em> of threats on adjacent squares. Instead, the "numbers are sum of monster power," as the game's cryptic "Monsternomicon" explains. So a revealed square with a "14" could suggest two 7-power devils nearby or two 5-power slimes and a 4-power ogre, or even seven 2-power bats in a particularly weird randomized arrangement.</p>
<p>Destroying those monsters means eating into your avatar Jorge's health total, which is prominently displayed in the bottom-left corner. Jorge's health can safely go down to zero hearts without dying—which feels a bit counter-intuitive at first—and can be restored by using discovered health potions or by leveling up with gold accumulated from downed monsters and items. If you can level up enough without dying, you'll have the health necessary to defeat the titular dragon sitting in the middle of the board and win the game.</p>

<p>The first few times I played <em>Dragonsweeper</em>, it seemed impossible to make significant progress. I'd defeat a few of the low-ranking monsters revealed at the beginning of the game, use all the level-ups and health potions I could, and then be stuck with no health in a situation where it seemed like I had to guess to continue. The balance between logic and luck seemed completely out of whack.</p>
<p>The game didn't really click for me until I read a comment suggesting that I think of Jorge's hearts as a sort of "exploration budget" to probe the frontiers of unrevealed tiles. Instead of clicking on the monsters you can already see (or deduce directly), it's usually much smarter to click on multiple tiles <em>if and when</em> you can be sure those tiles won't kill Jorge.</p>
<p>So if I see a revealed "14" tile with 10 points of known adjacent monsters, I know I can click the other adjacent tiles and take just four points of damage. In exchange for that health, I gain more board information and more gold and items to continue the cycle of healing and exploration. After literal decades of <em>Minesweeper</em>-honed instincts to never click a potentially dangerous box, <em>Dragonsweeper</em> had to train me that it was OK to trade "danger" for information in this way.</p>

<p>While most <em>Dragonsweeper</em> monsters end up acting as simple damage sponges, a few have some hidden abilities or patterns that only become apparent after a bit of guess-and-check gameplay. It pays to follow the Monsternomicon's directive to "Observe Monster Patterns When Dead," looking at the fully revealed board to figure out the kinds of locations where certain monsters congregate and exploit that knowledge as you plan your strategy.</p>

<h2>Just one more dragon</h2>
<p>Variants like <a href="https://hojamaka.com/game/mamono_sweeper_h2/html5/en.html"><em>Mamono Sweeper</em></a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cimu.runestonekeeper"><em>Runestone Keeper</em></a> have similarly tried adding RPG systems to the basic <em>Minesweeper</em> formula in the past, but they ended up feeling a little too complex and difficult to parse for my tastes. <em>Dragonsweeper</em> adds just enough randomized monster battling and item collecting to stay interesting without becoming unwieldy under the weight of intricate systems.</p>
<p>After a few hours of somewhat obsessive play, I got pretty good at consistently killing the dragon on the original version of <em>Dragonsweeper</em>. Then, late last week, Benmergui <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/dragonsweeper/devlog/882560/new-dragonsweeper-version">posted an update</a> that greatly improved the user interface, modified some monster behaviors, and "adjust[ed] the challenge." The new version requires a little more care and deduction to make early progress, even though the vast majority of boards still seem solvable with careful play.</p>

      </figure>

<p>Even after you've notched your first <em>Dragonsweeper</em> "win," there's still reason to keep coming back. The game's background scoring system encourages you to defeat not just the dragon but every single monster on the board, a feat that requires careful planning and a bit of luck in finding early gold piles. The latest update also adds an in-game timer (which is only revealed when you win), encouraging the kind of record-chasing speedruns <a href="https://minesweepergame.com/world-records.php">that high-level <em>Minesweeper</em> is known for</a> (my best <em>Dragonsweeper</em> run so far is just under four minutes, but I'm sure that can be improved).</p>
<p>Even with a number of grand, bid-budget gaming epics in my backlog (and my review plate), <em>Dragonsweeper</em> has become the game I'm eager to return to with practically every spare moment I can find lately. It's a perfect "coffee break" game that requires just enough logic and strategy to focus my higher brain functions while offering enough luck to not be rote. As it happens, that's exactly what I'm looking for from a gaming distraction these days.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wool-clay-and-elbow-grease-bringing-stop-motion-games-to-life.1105170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/607154/stop-motion-video-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the biggest lessons of working on stop-motion video games? Rolling up your sleeves — literally.</p><p>“It’s such a nightmare,” Talha &amp; Jack Co developer Jack King-Spooner told me over a video call. “You spend maybe half an hour doing one of the cutscenes. The cutscenes are the most precarious things because you have to have everything in the scene exactly the same. And then your sleeve catches something and you’re like <em>ah, Jesus, and I have to do everything again</em>.”</p><p>King-Spooner worked with Talha Kaya on 2024’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1960900%2FJudero%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Judero</em></a>, an action-adventure game based on the folklore of the Scottish Borders. Now, the creative duo is running a Kickstarter campaign for its new project, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637042083/mashina"><em>Mashina</em></a>, centered around a cute robot who has to drill. It’s a stop-motion game again, but this time, the team is facing the laborious process with some hard-learned lessons.</p><p>The seemingly innocuous gesture of rolling up your sleeves is one of many considerations that studios need to keep in mind when experimenting with handmade characters, objects, and scenes for their games. Stop-motion games aren’t new — the likes of <em>The Neverhood</em>, <em>The Dark Eye</em>, and <em>Skullmonkeys</em> have been toying with this physical-meets-digital marriage since the ’90s. But there’s been a resurgence in recent years due to projects with prominent Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns, such as <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/esbenkongorange/vokabulantis"><em>Vokabulantis</em></a>, and smaller teams keeping the momentum going, resulting in a sparse but steady presence thanks to games like <em>Hylics</em> and its sequel to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/14/7217199/the-dream-machine"><em>The Dream Machine</em></a>.</p><p>To Talha &amp; Jack Co, there are a few reasons behind the popularity of this art style. Aside from the clear promotional aspect of standing out in an ever-increasing crowd, the team is fond of the playful and physical nostalgia of action figures. When I spoke to them, they’d occasionally open drawers to grab figures and individual pieces, from small feet to mountains made of clay, proudly showing them to the webcam and fiddling with them while they spoke.</p><p>“Gaming has been for a long time just an extremely digital thing that you do only by sitting at your computer and changing pixels or programming,” Kaya said. “Now we are in this age where anything can go into a video game, and when you put a lot of literally and metaphorically interesting textures, it just becomes a more interesting work. Stop-motion is a great way to do that.”</p><p>For the team behind the point-and-click adventure <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24131922/harold-halibut-review-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>Harold Halibut</em></a>, the reason was more simple: it’s what they knew. The developers didn’t have experience with 3D or drawing, but they knew how to build physical things. That philosophy was the foundation of a development period that spanned over a decade. When it came to animating these handcrafted creations, however, they decided on a different approach.</p><p>Initially, <em>Harold Halibut</em> was supposed to be animated in traditional stop-motion. The proof is in Slow Bros. cofounder and CEO Onat Hekimoglu’s shelf behind him, the namesake character standing inside a display case with his arms pointing down. Hekimoglu tells me that you can actually move his arms and legs, as opposed to the other characters alongside him, which are T-posing.</p><div><p>“When you put a lot of literally and metaphorically interesting textures, it just becomes a more interesting work”</p></div><p>“In the beginning, we were using actual stop-motion animation, but it all felt too static, and also too much like a Photoshop collage, and we wanted to have a modern-looking feel that fits the time we are in, right?” Hekimoglu said. “Dynamic lighting, dynamic camera work, and all that stuff.”</p><p>Eventually, the developer diverged from the original idea to embrace “the best of both worlds,” according to Hekimoglu, taking handcrafted assets and scanning them in a process called photogrammetry. Instead of photographing every animation from different angles, the process involved taking pictures of objects and characters to create digital 3D models.</p><p>“I think actual stop-motion is not very suitable for games,” he adds. “When you are working on a film, everything that happens is inside that one image, that’s why everything feels consistent. You can never have that situation in a video game unless you do a full-motion video game.”</p><p>Hekimoglu’s point of view resonates with some obstacles that studio Wooly Games is encountering. Development for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3159860%2FFeltopia%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Feltopia</em></a> started in the summer of 2023, and the four-person team has been experimenting with an array of handcrafted felt objects in stop-motion fashion since. <em>Feltopia</em> is a shoot-’em-up, traditionally a fast-paced genre, which clashes with the slower nature of stop-motion.</p><p>“I animate at 12 frames a second, and when you have your game going at 60 frames a second, there’s sort of a little bit of mixing and matching that goes along there,” creative director Andrea Love tells me. “So we are exploring some slower types of gameplay, more like 2D platformers, and we’ll see how that goes.”</p><p>Love has been working on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andreaanimates/">stop-motion animation</a> for over a decade, but doing so for a video game is “very different.” Usually, she would build the puppets and sets and put them all together for a composed scene. For <em>Feltopia</em>, everything has to be an isolated sprite or piece of scenery, so she photographs and animates objects as individual assets. “It’s like taking all these different little things and making a felted interactive collage,” Love says.</p><p>Stop-motion requires patience. A little blob that undulates in <em>Feltopia</em> takes around 15 to 20 minutes to make. The animation cycles of the Skyrider, the main hooded character who flies on a pegasus, took around a day, while a boss fight scene unfolded between two to three days. Love also has to create the puppets using wire armatures to rig them up and then remove the wires in postproduction.</p><p>But things get easier with experience. During the first animation tests of <em>Judero</em>, it would take King-Spooner around 10 hours to do one animation. As he became faster and more practical in his workflow, the team was able to increase the scope of the game, adding cutscenes and more elaborate characters. Still, considering that each frame involved at least eight photographs, the total count was in the hundreds.</p><p>“When you’ve taken 200 photos and then you sit back and press play and all of a sudden it’s actually animated, and then it’s even got an extra step when I throw it over to Talha and we get it in the game, and not only is it moving, we’re controlling it, it’s so fun,” King-Spooner said. “It’s kind of magic.”</p><p>Upcoming games like Compulsion Games’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350382/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-doom-ninja-gaiden-trailers"><em>South of Midnight</em></a> and MoonHood’s <em>The Midnight Walk</em> are taking cues from games like <em>Harold Halibut.</em> They blur the line between stop-motion and the technical or visual expectations of modern games, keeping traditional art style without restricting movement or animations. But for those who are sticking with the craft of stop-motion — whether it’s trying to adjust the lighting of a scene due to different weather affecting photographs across multiple days or figuring out the exact density of felt so puppets don’t fall apart — they’re finding joy in the process, while embracing the work involved.</p><p>“That’s usually people’s first reaction,” Wooly Games project manager Michelle Hagewood says. “Why in the world are you doing this to yourself?”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He’ll stretch his arms out to hit enemies in close and medium range and it will be your go-to for dealing “filler” damage when Spore Bomb is on cooldown.</p><p><strong>Strangling Prison:</strong> This Ultimate grabs nearby enemies and pulls them together to wherever you aim the ability, dealing steady damage for a while. It’s a great opportunity to group enemies up so they can be taken out by Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, and many other Ultimate abilities.</p><p><strong>Thornlash Wall:</strong> This ability places a small wall at the target location. You have several charges of this one, so multiple walls can be placed. It can be angled several different ways and will Awaken when Groot is nearby, causing it to attack nearby enemies. Use it to block off locations and, ideally, separate healers from the rest of their team. Divide and conquer, baby. If a Duelist gets too greedy and runs ahead of the pack, place a wall behind them to make them easy to knockout.</p><p><strong>Ironwood Wall:</strong> This ability places a larger Ironwood Wall at the target location. You can only place one of these at a time, so think strategically. It can also be angled, and when Groot is nearby, the Ironwood wall will awaken to grant Groot and his nearby allies bonus health based on the damage they deal. While the Thornlash Wall is good to keep nearby, you definitely want to keep Ironwood near points you are guarding.</p><p><strong>Furious Flora:</strong> This is Groot’s melee attack. Hold this down and Groot will perform a three-hit melee combo. The last hit launches into the air, but there isn’t really a reason to use this instead of Vine Strike.</p><p><strong>Spore Bomb:</strong> - This is a grenade-like projectile that explodes, dealing AOE (area-of-effect) damage. Three smaller explosives spread out and detonate again, making this a great tool to throw into groups of enemies. With a short, 6-second cooldown, you should use this basically every time it’s available.</p><p><strong>Flora Colossus (Passive):</strong> This passive awakens spawned walls near Groot, activating their secondary abilities.</p><p><strong>Friendly Shoulder (Team-Up Ability: Passive):</strong> If Jeff the Land Shark or Rocket Raccoon are on your team, they can ride on Groot’s shoulders, taking less damage than they otherwise would. It’s also incredibly cute, which is a bonus all by itself.</p><h2 id="h681145"><a id="play"></a>How should you play Groot?</h2><p>Groot is one of the best Tanks in the game if played correctly. He can solo Tank with steady healers and has lots of versatility due to his ability to create walls. The most potent part of his kit, and the one which takes the most practice, is creating line-of-sight obstructions to cause problems for healers on the opposing team. </p><figure id="" data-id="b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-recommend-id="image://b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-recommend-id="image://b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Use walls to defend key points, forcing enemies to waste time attacking your wooden constructs to make it through narrow hallways.

It definitely happened. However, it was still a fairly rare occurrence and most big-name actors were careful about appearing in too many. For example, Tommy Lee Jones and other Hollywood stars would <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LE21qQHlOLQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LE21qQHlOLQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fly over to Japan and other countries to do commercials</a></span> so nobody over here in the States would see them. There was still a fear that if you sold out <em>too </em>much and <em>too </em>often you’d look desperate and signal that your career was ending. And this was the case for decades. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7D6B263E852D5FA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7D6B263E852D5FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then Super Bowl commercials became bigger and bigger in the 2000s</a></span> and companies spent more and more to create a viral, popular ad. And as this was happening, the lines between TV, movies, and internet content started to blur, while streaming services and YouTube grew in popularity. Hustle culture—the belief that as long as you were getting paid it was worth it—also grew during this time.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/WytGsPMPs24?list=PLCeYpRAW8Efo9ZormvxTt70EhGHCoQlHN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/WytGsPMPs24?list=PLCeYpRAW8Efo9ZormvxTt70EhGHCoQlHN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> I remember people in 2015 cheering Kim Kardashian</a></span> for appearing in a big Super Bowl ad and celebrating that she “got paid!”</p><p>That has led us to 2025 and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly every damn Super Bowl ad</a></span> including famous people to help sell soda or crackers. And it’s all so sad. Watching Harrison Ford, an actor whom I really like and who has turned in some incredible performances, try to connect being a hero to owning a Jeep made me want to throw my TV out the window. Being assaulted with 20 different variations on “Actors and celebs behaving wacky while holding branded products” made me want to throw my phone out the window. </p><p>I think what really drives me nuts about these ads is how transparently greedy it all is. A lot of the people appearing in these commercials don’t need the money and yet, they likely got paid quite a bit to appear. And they just don’t care anymore about even pretending to look like artists or creators with backbones and morals.</p><p> They know that most people don’t care anymore. Everything we watch appears on the same tiny phone screen. The delineation between movies and TV and random viral videos is gone. It’s been gone for awhile. And that means there isn’t anything stopping someone like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LC5V4aIoWes?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LC5V4aIoWes?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Keoghan appearing in an ad for Square Space</a></span>. It won’t ruin his career or cost him fans or make him less of an artist anymore. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/RIXB-7RHjBY?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/RIXB-7RHjBY?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Actors can freely dig up past roles and characters</a></span>, skin them, and prance about for 30 seconds recreating some moment you might remember, and get paid a lot to do it while suffering no negative consequences.</p><p>You might wonder “Who does this hurt?” or “What’s the harm of celebs getting paid to do commercials?” And to be clear, none of this is really hurting anybody. There are certainly bigger problems in the world right now. But that doesn’t change that it sucks shit—it hurts <em>art</em>. Hawking products for cash makes you a salesperson, not an artist.</p><p>So my suggestion is simple: Let’s start making fun of celebs for selling out and reminding them that its gross. It’s going to take a few years to build up momentum and change anything, but if we pull this off and we go back to making actors and artists feel shame again, we all might be able to avoid shit like Seal appearing as a seal in a fucking soda ad. </p><p>Doesn’t that sounds like a future you want to live in? <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-detail-season-and-half-season-ranks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With the first half of Season 1 drawing to a close, Marvel Rivals developer NetEase has published a new update regarding ranks. This update helps players understand what to expect at the end of the half and in the second half of the inaugural season and beyond.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, the studio said that the first half of the season will end on February 21. At that time, all rankings will be locked and players ranked Gold and higher will get a costume reward. Those Grandmaster and higher as well as the Top 500 will receive the “Crest of Honor”.</p>



<p>“In the second half of the season, we will be rolling out new costume rewards for Gold rank players, along with brand new Crests of Honor,” NetEase said. “These Crests will recognize players at Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All (the top 500), each with its own unique design to celebrate your skill!”</p>



<p>After the first-half ranks are settled, they will all be reason when the second half of Season 1 starts that day. When it starts, NetEase says  that players will see their rank drop by four divisions. In future seasons, that drop will be six divisions at the beginning and then a drop of four at the start of the second half of each season.</p>



<p>Lastly, the studio says that in order to make sure only players who actually play during the current season can earn rewards, players will need to play at least 10 matches in competitive mode along with meeting required ranking conditions.</p>



<p>What do you think of how Marvel Rivals is handling in-season ranks? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <p>
Relic Entertainment, the studio behind the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/company-of-heroes">Company of Heroes</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-war">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</a>, has outlined its future plans as an independent studio - including a greater focus on smaller titles and older games - following its separation from Sega last year.
</p>
<p>
Relic was founded in 1997, becoming known for its work in the real-time strategy genre as the years went on. In 2013, the studio was acquired by Sega - but the companies last year announced they would be parting ways, with Relic becoming independent once more.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Relic has undergone a period of downsizing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-sega-studio-relic-hit-by-fresh-layoffs-following-sale">laying off 41 staff</a> last year (a move that followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-lays-off-121-employees-at-company-of-heroes-studio-relic-entertainment">major round of redundancies</a> in 2023), but now the studio has reemerged to discuss its future plans, announcing a "bold" vision that'll see it focusing on three key areas.

<p>
Part of the studio's new strategy will see it 'actively pursuing' the development of "smaller-scope, in-house games" alongside the larger, more complex strategy titles it's known for - all in order to "explore new genres and gameplay experiences".
</p>
<p>
It also intends to 're-imagine classics', through the likes of re-releases, remasters, and "brand-new franchise experiences that capture the spirit of the originals while appealing to a new generation of players." That's alongside Relic's third focus: a "deepening commitment" to and "robust support" for its existing titles, starting with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/company-of-heroes-3">Company of Heroes 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
The studio has already announced a new update and new DLC for Company of Heroes 3, both launching this month. Fire &amp; Steel, as the DLC is known, promises four new Battlegroups for multiplayer and co-op/skirmish vs. AI. There's the Heavy Weapons Battlegroup (US Forces), Terror Battlegroup (Wehrmacht), Canadian Shock Battlegroup (British Forces), and Panzerjäger Kommand Battlegroup (Afrikakorps), with more details to be revealed closer to release.
