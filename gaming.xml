		<p>Anyone else have a flurry of snow this morning? It disappeared quickly, but it’s been right chilly this week, so I’ve had an extra layer to keep me cosy while playing games. And this week I’ve been juggling a bunch of games. There’s been more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> to eventually wrap up our review, there was an impromptu run-through of the still excellent Metroid Prime Remastered ahead of the new sequel, I had a preview of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/nioh-3-preview-bakumatsu-kyoto-ninja-gameplay/">Nioh 3</a> to deliver for today, and I reviewed the rather enjoyable bullet heaven, tower defence mash-up of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/20/monsters-are-coming-rock-and-road-review/">Monsters Are Coming! Rock and Road</a>.</p>

<p>Turning to the rest of us, <strong>Aran</strong> wrapped up his review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/17/umami-review/">Umami</a>, the intriguing 3D food puzzle game, and then made a start on Xenopurge for review, and Wuchang Fallen Feathers for pleasure. He’s already beaten the first non-optional boss and is feeling like he’s making some good progress at hitting things with a big sword.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> was lucky enough to get Ghost of Yotei for his birthday –&nbsp;happy birthday! – so he’s been playing that. “It’s very good!” he says. “At the moment, a few hours in, I slightly prefer it to the original.</p>


<p>Making it two ghosts in Yotei is <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s played that alongside Metal Gear Solid Delta’s Fox Hunt multiplayer and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. “Despite its limited offering, I’m having great fun with Fox Hunt, which crams the thrills of a battle royale/extraction shooter in a short-fire rounds, though Konami’s silence regarding future content is concerning in an age where publishers are quick to slap roadmaps all over their live service titles. Meanwhile, Black Ops 7 has been a mixed bag. It certainly lives up to Activision’s marketing as being the biggest COD to date, though I’m yet to gel with any of the game modes despite the gunplay being top tier.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> had Sweet Surrender in for review, now that he’s returned home, and has two massive open world games on the go in the form of Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin’s Creed Shadows, as well as some of the poker roguelite Balatro.</p>

<p><strong>Tuff</strong> is close to wrapping up our review of the breakout extraction shooter hit ARC Raiders, and <strong>Miguel’s</strong> been playing a bit of that too, but he’s mainly been playing lots of Wuthering Waves, “because their latest update added a new explorable cyberpunk city with a capybara mascot which is all very targeted at me specifically.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Dom</strong>, who’s been a busy bee with real life, but snuck in a bit of throwback gaming to a decade ago by playing Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on Switch 2. It’s still good!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox Partner Preview event</a>, we got new looks at 16 games. Some of them <a href="https://wccftech.com/godfall-developer-counterplay-games-debuts-armatus-xbox-partner-preview/">were new announcements and reveals</a>, others were first looks at gameplay. The trailer we saw for The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu falls in the latter camp, with our first real look at gameplay for the upcoming four-player online co-op game from ACE Team and Nacon.</p>



<p>First announced <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/nacon-and-ace-team-announce-co-op-horror-game-the-mound-omen-of-cthulhu-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc">back in March 2025</a>, it was initially set to arrive sometime before the end of this year. Then, in August, <a href="https://x.com/PlayTheMound/status/1956353464801321128">Nacon and ACE Team delayed its launch to 2026</a>. Now, have a more defined release window, with the studios announcing that it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S at some point in Summer 2026.</p>



<p>The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu puts you into the shoes of one of four players, all stuck on an island, trying to survive a cursed jungle that will warp their reality, making it difficult to tell the difference between allies and enemies.</p>

<p>Not only are you dealing with mind-bending phenomena, you're dealing with an older class of weapons that cause their own anxieties simply due to the fact that if you miss your first shot, you might not get the chance to reload a second with these old-school rifles.</p>



<p>This trailer, short as it is, was our first proper look at gameplay, while still emphasizing the dark atmosphere and tone the game is going for. It'll be interesting to see how ACE Team and Nacon lean into its 16th-century setting and its Lovecraftian inspirations. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-2-will-be-a-multiplatform-release-launching-on-various-consoles-developer-confirms.1360852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Development of Stellar Blade 2 is ramping up, and new details on the second entry in the series have been revealed today by a new job listing.</p>



<p>As spotted by Genki on X, a new job listing found on developer <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://shiftup.co.kr/news/news.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=318&amp;page=1&amp;code=news">Shift Up's official website</a> confirms that their upcoming game will be a multiplatform game, aiming to release on various consoles and PC. This represents a significant change from the original Stellar Blade, as the game is currently available only on PlayStation 5 and PC, although Shift Up confirmed earlier this year that <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-switch-2/">it was exploring a release on other platforms, including the Nintendo Switch 2.</a></p>



<p>Unfortunately, the job listing provides little additional information about Stellar Blade 2. According to the job listing, the game will <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"inherit the stylish action and narrative-driven world of its predecessor, while delivering an evolved action gameplay experience,"</em> which is exactly what Shift Up said back in September when it confirmed that <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-sequel-development/">the game entered active development.</a></p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Shift Up announced the start of large scale recruitment for the development of the Stellar Blade sequel!</p><p>New job listings suggest console and PC multiplatform development using Unreal Engine 5!</p><p>“The next installment of ‘Stella Blade’, currently under development at Shift Up, is… <a href="https://t.co/fcQZedfvKx">pic.twitter.com/fcQZedfvKx</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1991891947116798013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Stellar Blade 2 entering active development a little over a year after the series debuted on PlayStation 5 is hardly surprising. Although the game was the first console and PC game developed by the Korean game development studio, it immediately captured the attention of players worldwide with its recognizable main character, solid action-gameplay and great soundtrack, so much so that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-fastest-selling-korean-game-steam/">became the fastest selling Korean game on Steam</a>, driving nearly 60% of Shift Up's revenue in the second quarter of the current fiscal year.</p>



<p>Though an excellent action game, Stellar Blade is not without issues, as the narrative elements, while acceptable for an action game, weren't particularly remarkable, and never explored in depth the game's universe. Hopefully, Shift Up will tighten them up for the sequel to deliver an even more memorable experience.</p>

            <p>Krafton have revealed PUBG spin-off Black Budget, just in time for alpha testing of the extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> to kick off next month. As you might expect given the genre, this latest work from PUBG Studios is all about getting out of the bad vibe zone in good time, after shooting some baddies in said zone. Oh, sorry, <strong>tactically</strong> shooting some baddies in the bad vibe zone.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"You are a Contractor, a hardened veteran hired for a classified operation on an island at the edge of the world," reads the Steam synopsis. "Your mission is to recover top-secret technology from an abandoned research facility. But there’s a catch: the island is trapped in a time loop, consumed by a supernatural phenomenon known as the Anomaly. Extract artifacts, research your findings, and uncover the truth behind the black-budget initiative, SAPIENS."</p>
<p>Damn, don't you just hate it when you, a jobbing tradesperson with a gun, get sent on a super secret tech-nabbing mission and the lab turns out to be on time warp island. Plus, you might get eaten by a thing that couldn't be bothered to flip beyond page one of the big book of sci-fi thing names when picking its moniker. In all seriousness, the Steam page's shots of fighting among swirling purple evilness look pretty fun.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Krafton promise that the world "grows more unpredictable with every loop", with each trip out lasting about 30 minutes, with the Anomaly gradually shrinking the map much like classic PUBG's battle royales. Between trips to Anomalyville, you'll do the usual extraction shooter thing of huddling in an upgradeable base and tinkering with your gear so the purple stuff won't get you next time.</p><p>You'll be able to get a taste of all of that in PC-only closed alpha tests which are set to run between December 12th and 14th, then December 19th to 21st. Both session will be open to folks in North America, Europe, and Asia. You can request access to take part on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4077740/PUBG_Black_Budget/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>If you do, tell the Anomaly I said hello and that it's picked a nice shade of violet. Maybe it'll pause in confusion long enough to buy you the few more seconds you need to hop back into the safety of your ammo-filled digs.</p>

              <p>As “pedophile hellscape”&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> finally adds <a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/roblox-introduces-age-based-chat-to-enhance-user-safety-gaming-parent-controls-robloxs-facial-checks-adult-minor-teen-chatting-chatbox-safe">a rudimentary measure</a> to try to prevent children from being exploited via its network of games and chatrooms used by 151 million people, the company’s CEO <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html">spoke to the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em></a> podcast Hard Fork about child safety. And it didn’t go great. It&nbsp;<em>really</em> didn’t go great.</p> <p><em>Roblox</em> is coming under increasing scrutiny after decades of failing to implement even the most basic of protective measures to keep its pre-teen players away from the networks of pedophiles who use the game to find victims. Described last year as <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">“a pedophile hellscape for kids”</a> by Hindenburg Research<a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">,</a> the game quickly introduced a <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">new assortment of measures</a>&nbsp;last October that did next to nothing, leading this year to a great deal of legal interest. Three months back, <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-brainrot-grow-a-garden-hellscape-2000618002">the state of Louisiana announced its intentions to sue&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em></a> for the dangers it was allowing, joined since by Kentucky and Texas. These actions come alongside <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/roblox-announces-new-safety-measure-amid-spate-lawsuits/story?id=127626071">35 other ongoing lawsuits</a>, including one from only yesterday <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/investigations/cuyahoga-county-family-sues-roblox-says-online-gaming-app-led-to-sexual-exploitation-of-13-year-old-boy">by a family in Cuyaho County</a> following <i>Roblox</i>‘s alleged use in the tragic and too common abuse of their 13-year-old son.</p>

 <p>On Wednesday of this week, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat"><em>Roblox</em> announced</a> it was beginning to roll out a new method of checking player ages before they could access chat, this time using facial recognition to try to restrict players to only talking to others in their age range. Such facial ID checks have become commonplace in the UK following the disastrously poor UK Online Safety Act, by which porn sites and other age-restricted outlets are required to verify users’ ages. This has led to sites like X, Bluesky and Discord also requiring British users to prove their age, usually by showing their face on camera in a measure that entirely thwarts all seven people who haven’t heard of a VPN.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646197" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646197"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646197">© Roblox</figcaption></figure> <p>Regarding this rollout, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html">the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>‘ Casey Newton spoke to&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> co-founder and CEO David Baszucki about the new plans</a>, and whether they can really help. It doesn’t begin well. When asked about the “scope of the problem” of predators in the application, Baszucki came in shoulders first saying, “We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well.” Ah, the good ol’ opportunities available when your company’s product is rife with pedophilia. He continued, outlining how wonderful it is that young people can build and communicate together, how they have “150 million daily actives, 11 billion hours a month, like what is the best way to keep pushing this forward.” It is the most astonishingly tone-deaf response.</p>

 <p>Newton attempts to get some sensible answers from Baszucki about how the ID checks will work, and why they won’t be <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/">as easily evaded as so many others</a>, and amidst Baszucki’s corporate waffle he’s told that <em>Roblox</em> is apparently always looking out for “weird signals” and will ask for further age verification should these appear, although he didn’t explain what those signals might be, nor what these further checks would be. But then Newton goes on to ask the painfully necessary question: why has it taken 19 years to even <em>try</em> to stop adults from being able to speak to children?</p>

 <p>Baszucki responds by talking about the evolution of <em>Roblox</em>‘s text filtering tech for inappropriate language and personally identifying information over the last two decades, and how it’s always improving, which is great but clearly not relevant to the question. Newton is having none of it, responding, “Yeah, I mean, I don’t know. When I read these lawsuits and these investigations into the company, it does not seem like predators are having that hard of a time getting around your filters…So I’m curious what’s made you so confident that things are working?” Baszucki’s response is incoherent.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“I don’t want to comment on it. We do see the chat logs of those. And we can see interesting and, many times, ways of people trying to—I’d say, many times people who are fairly sophisticated, and I’m not going to say all of them, many times kids who are over 13, who actually in any other app are not running in a filtered situation, unfortunately, figuring out how to jump to some other platform where they can communicate unfiltered, where they can share images, all of it. It’s one of the primary things we’re doing is trying to keep people on our platform. It’s an interesting industry situation. I would say, we’re not waiting for the rest of the industry. We’re like, we’re always trying to stay ahead of it. On the California age-appropriate design code, for example, we’re like, we are already doing all of that stuff. And the same thing with age estimation: We’re not doing this because of any laws that are coming, we think it’s the right thing to do.”</p></blockquote> <p>Newton very impressively keeps his cool, and rather than pointing out that this answer had nothing to do with the situation, nor indeed how unbelievable it is that the CEO of the company would say “I don’t want to comment on it” when asked why he’s confident in age tech that clearly doesn’t work, he instead points out that the lawsuits are demonstrating that “<em>Roblox</em> is kind of, you know, where predators go to find kids.”</p>

 <p>Things become increasingly tense, as Baszucki tries to claim this is a misrepresentation, and when pressed on whether he truly doesn’t believe&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> has a predator problem replies, “I think we’re doing an incredible job at innovating relative to the number of people on our platform and the hours, in really leaning in to the future of how this is going to work.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000646198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646198"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646198">© Roblox</figcaption></figure> <p>What becomes so grimly apparent is that even now, even after a year of extraordinary scrutiny and legal pressure, Baszucki still doesn’t have a grip on the situation at all. To be so ill-prepared for such obvious questions, to have no coherent responses for why the new tech will be effective, and to go so out of his way to appear so uninterested in the subject, is astonishing. As he’s pressed further on the ease with which predators can suggest children speak to them on another platform, Baszucki eventually unravels into literal gibberish:</p> <blockquote><p>“I would actually say that is a very simple red flag. Like, that sounds like text filter many prior generations. So I would say the techniques are much more sophisticated than that. We’re constantly getting better than that and sometimes it’s adversarial. Like, we’re getting into, you know, if we cryptographically were going to try to have an exchange of how to share your Snap handle or whatever handle. We see some of that starting, like things we’ll have to essentially prevent in the future.”</p></blockquote> <p>The CEO seems to believe that the scale of&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> is somehow an excuse to justify its problems, repeatedly coming back to its 150 million users and 11 billion hours a month, as if this explains it all away. But more problematically, as Newton points out that the company wants those numbers to grow, Baszucki immediately switches back to talking about what an amazing financial opportunity this is. Given&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/roblox-150-million-users-into-ad-dollars/"><em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>is really struggling to turn those users into money</a>, it reads like he’s only speaking to investors and analysts who are increasingly concerned about&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>‘s lack of profits. So many responses begin with an infuriatingly irrelevant attempt to avoid the question, and then end with words like “And you could imagine&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> at 20-X this scale, having 50 percent of the gaming market space all in a single place.” It’s so crass!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646195" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646195"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646195">© The New York Times / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But not nearly as crass as Baszucki’s response to a question over <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">the Hindenburg Research report into the scale of the issue with pedophiles</a>. Hindenburg was an activist short-selling research firm that would investigate companies for fraud, malfeasance and indeed rampant use by predators, until <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/gratitude/">its creator chose to disband the group in January this year</a>. At the time of the report, Baszucki said that it was wrong to claim that&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> had reduced its spend on trust and safety, so Newton asked for specifics.</p> <p>“Fun,” says Baszucki, a man who appears pathologically incapable of reading the room. “Let’s keep going down this. And so, first off, Hindenburg is not longer in existence, correct? So, you should report on that. They went out of business for some reason…” He then demanded to know if Newton had researched the answer for himself, before saying that it’s because they’ve moved so much of the safety regulation onto AI, all while sounding absolutely furious that he was being asked. He then demands that Newton agree that if AI is more effective, it’s better to use it, and when Newton does, Baszucki starts to behave incredibly immaturely. “Good, so you’re aligning with what we did. High-five.” Then when Newton tries to ask a question, he interrupts to say, “Thank you for supporting our <em>Roblox</em> decision matrix<em>.”&nbsp;</em>Then interrupts yet again to say, “I’m so glad you guys are aligned with the way we run&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>. High-five.” Think he’s done? Nope. Yet again he interrupts the question with, “Is this a stealth interview where actually you love everything we’re doing and you’re here to stealthily support it?”</p>

 <p>And he doesn’t stop. When co-host Kevin Roose tried to get things back on the rails, Baszucki kept going with the same pathetic line. Challenged on how AI has proved very ineffective for social media companies, he just carries on saying it. The only thing that stopped this tantrum was allowing the CEO to talk about Polymarket, a cryptoscam-based prediction market, letting people place bets on things as ridiculous as awards ceremonies and future weather patterns. Some believe it’s becoming a useful way to predict markets, and that group includes Baszucki who is…and I cannot believe I’m typing this…looking to put it into <em>Roblox</em> so children can gamble.</p> <p>He wants to find a way to do this that’s “legal” and “educational,” at which point the podcast hosts begin openly mocking the stupidity. And then, thank god, they run out of time.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="719">In recent years, handheld gaming PCs have become increasingly popular, with devices like the Steam Deck leading the charge. Following its success, models such as the Lenovo Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally have also gained attention. These portable systems offer the ability to play PC games on the go without the bulk of a laptop. However, despite their appeal, handheld gaming PCs remain focused primarily on gaming, and lacking the versatility needed for everyday tasks. If you’re after a device that can handle both gaming and traditional computer tasks, a gaming laptop is still a better option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">Right now, Amazon is offering a great deal on the Alienware 16 Aurora gaming laptop, dropping its price from $1,250 to $900, a savings of $350.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="719">Optimized for Gaming</h2>
<p data-start="721" data-end="1309">The Alienware 16 Aurora is a solid gaming laptop at this discounted price point. It features a 16-inch display with a 16:10 aspect ratio, delivering QHD resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels. Its 300 nits of brightness and anti-glare coating make it usable even in harsh lighting conditions, like if the sun is peaking through into the room midday. The screen’s refresh rate peaks at 120Hz, which is great for fast-paced or competitive games. Additionally, the laptop supports. The slim bezels around the display offer more screen space while keeping the overall laptop size manageable.</p>
<p data-start="1311" data-end="1573">As for the keyboard, the Alienware 16 Aurora comes with a full-size layout, including a number pad, which is becoming less common in modern laptops.</p>
<p data-start="1575" data-end="1963">Inside, the Alienware 16 Aurora is powered by an Intel Core 7 240H processor and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 laptop GPU, paired with 16GB of RAM and a 1TBGB PCIe Gen4 SSD. It has two upgradable PCIe Gen 4 SSD slots and two upgradable DDR SO-DIMM memory slots if you want to push the current memory and storage even further. While it might not run every AAA game on ultra settings, it’s a strong performer for the price. Indie titles will run effortlessly, and most larger games should perform well at medium settings, balancing quality and performance.</p>


<p data-start="1965" data-end="2197">Looking along the side of the laptop, we have an array of useful ports. It contains two USB-C ports capable of data transfer, device charging, and can be used to display onto an additional monitor. On that same note, an HDMI 2.1 port is found on the backside as well. There’s also two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports as well as a global headset jack so you can connect a microphone, headphones, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p data-start="2199" data-end="2434" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">At just $900, the Alienware 16 Aurora offers a solid mix of gaming performance and everyday usability. It provides more flexibility than a handheld gaming device, all while maintaining a price that’s hard to beat ahead of Black Friday weekend.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/"> If you want to push your graphical capability even further, a model is offered with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 for a $300 discount. T</a>hat one normally goes for for $1,400, but has come down to just $1,100 in this early Black Friday deal.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders allows you to customize special skins and sell them for in-game currency. One skin has taken it too far, and the already-infamous bikini skin has been rendered unavailable on the Kirby Air Riders Machine Market.</p>



<p>Sometimes you need to take a step back and realise what you’re saying and typing. But it’s all true: A controversial customizable bikini skin is no longer obtainable in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-1-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a>. The humorous but risqué&nbsp;outfit can no longer be bought, and it’s probably a warning to all players that you need to tread carefully with any sus designs.</p>







<h2 id="h-kirby-air-riders-bikini-skin-is-now-unavailable">Kirby Air Riders Bikini Skin Is Now Unavailable</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Family-friendly entertainment, right? Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within 24 hours of the game coming out, users were making eye-opening skins and selling them on the game’s Machine Market. Everything is bought and traded using the game’s currency.</p>



<p>One particular skin went viral very quickly: A design showing Chef Kawasaki wearing a micro-bikini. If you didn’t know, Chef Kawasaki is a regular character in the Kirby universe, and their default getup is usually just some kind of cooking apron.</p>







<p>According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasaki-micro-bikini-ride-deleted-from-kirby-air-riders-machine-market-immediately-replaced-by-succubus-chef-kawasaki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>: “Chef Kawasaki&nbsp;wearing a micro&nbsp;bikini has been a running&nbsp;joke&nbsp;among&nbsp;a&nbsp;portion&nbsp;of&nbsp;Japanese Kirby fans for quite a few years.&nbsp;The&nbsp;headcanon&nbsp;seems to have resulted from fans looking at Chef Kawasaki’s standard attire –&nbsp;naked&nbsp;save for a single&nbsp;apron&nbsp;– and thinking, ‘Isn’t that kind of lewd?'”</p>



<p>So, once you give players the appropriate tools, they are sure to create inappropriate outfits. Kirby Air Riders’ technology finally allowed the Chef Kawasaki&nbsp;bikini look to happen.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Have you rinsed your eyes yet? Well, it only took hours for the design to be removed.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It was fun while it lasted, but this dual-wields as both an action and a warning to Kirby Air Riders players: Think twice before putting Chef Kawasaki—or anyone, for that matter—in a micro-bikini and selling it on the Machine Market.</p>



<p>Have you seen any other bizarre or hilarious outfits in the Kirby Air Riders Machine Market? Feel free to share them through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-disneyland-wrote-the-video-game-rule-book.1360831/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The name “Disney” has been showing up in quite a lot of gaming-related headlines as of late. As part of its arms race with Netflix, the conglomerate <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-plus-exploring-game-like-features-1236616248/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced plans</a> to add AI-powered user-generated content and “game-like features” to Disney+. Last year, it acquired a $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games, adding yet another cash cow to its portfolio. That deal paved the way for Disneyland Game Rush, a Fortnite island released earlier this month to celebrate the theme park’s 70th birthday that features <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-disneyland-game-rush-is-an-incredibly-authentic-first-step-into-fortnite-for-disney-parks">well-received minigames</a> based on Space Mountain, Haunted Mansion, and other iconic rides.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These developments are more than a little surprising, not least because it’s been close to a decade since Disney pulled the plug on its own, in-house gaming initiatives. Disney Interactive Studios, lovingly remembered for its work with Square on Kingdom Hearts and that 1989 NES DuckTales platformer that inspired the bounce mechanic in Shovel Knight, closed down in 2016 following the cancellation of its flagship project, Disney Infinity. Asked why, Bob Iger – who was then nearing the end of his first stint as CEO – <a href="https://www.inverse.com/input/gaming/how-disney-conquered-the-game-industry-by-giving-up-on-video-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told shareholders</a> that while the company was great at making movies and building theme parks, they weren’t nearly as skilled at designing games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others would beg to differ. While it’s true that Disney has never managed to compete with Nintendo, Ubisoft, or Electronic Arts, its influence on games as a medium might well be greater than all of these three companies combined. To understand how the company was able to leave a mark on the one part of the entertainment industry it couldn’t conquer, you need to go where Fortnite has gone: to Disneyland.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/disneyland-game-rush-screenshot-1763557173743.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Disneyland Game Rush replicates elements of the famous theme park in Fortnite.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When Don Carson quit his job as a senior designer at Walt Disney Imagineering – the research and development group in charge of creating new rides for Disney’s theme parks – he filled up some of his spare time playing video games. To his surprise, his new hobby heavily reminded him of his old job, so heavily that he felt compelled to write a long and – in due time – widely-read <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/environmental-storytelling-creating-immersive-3d-worlds-using-lessons-learned-from-the-theme-park-industry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article for Game Developer</a> (formerly Gamasutra) about what people working in one industry could learn from those working in the other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Carson’s article was originally published in 2000, when 3D games like Wolfenstein, Doom, and Quake III Arena were all the rage and the industry found itself on the cusp of a revolution. “The ability to create virtual worlds is relatively new to us,” reads one particularly nostalgic line. “With the growing popularity of multiplayer games and the promise of higher band widths, I relish the day I can meet friends and explore these worlds together.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its age, the article’s central argument – that gaming and themed entertainment “are not that far apart” – still rings true today, perhaps even more so than it did 25 years ago. Sure enough, the two have more in common than you’d think. Both can be described as immersive experiences where people move through a carefully constructed space that responds to their presence. More importantly, both are born from the same design philosophy – one Carson boils down to the following question: “How do I draw my audience into my imagined world and make them want to stay?” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How do I draw my audience into my imagined world and make them want to stay?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All too often, the answers point to the original Disneyland. Prior to its opening in 1955, most theme parks were disappointingly light on theming. As one the world’s leading providers of escapism, Walt Disney did not merely want to distract guests with thrills and frights – he wanted to transport them to a different reality. To sell this fantasy, Disneyland turned its ride vehicles into boats, spaceships, and teacups, covered up tracks and scaffolding, and made sure that each of its major attractions told a story that incorporated the rider. When you get on the Cyclone at Coney Island, you are you, riding the Cyclone at Coney Island. Not so in Disneyland. On the Jungle Cruise, you’re a tourist exploring the tropics. On Peter Pan’s Flight, you’re placed in the shoes of its titular character, soaring over London and Neverland. The list goes on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games have traveled down a similar road, enhancing raw experience with increasingly immersive theming. While some of the first-ever arcade games – think Pong and Pacman – took place in geometric voids, subsequent titles mapped their gameplay loops onto more clearly defined locations and situations, from Donkey Kong’s construction site to the roads and rivers of Frogger. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This transition repeated itself when gaming veered into the third dimension. While large parts of Super Mario 64 played out in liminal spaces, levels in Super Mario Sunshine – released 6 years later, in 2002 – are all part of a single, interconnected, fully realized setting: Delfino Island. Echoing Disneyland’s ride design (Tokyo Disneyland, featuring many of the same attractions found in LA, opened in 1983,) Sunshine not only fleshes out the environments, but also serves up a more ambitious narrative. No more saving Princess Peach from Bowser because game. This time, Mario is going vacation, is framed for a crime, and has to clear his name to earn back his freedom.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/er-1716302309226.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Elden Ring's Erdtree acts as a "weenie," a sort of architectural lure concepted by Walt Disney for his parks.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Disneyland’s influence on games is most evident when it comes to level design. To help guests find their way around the park – and encourage exploration on their own terms – Walt Disney envisioned a hub-and-spoke layout, with various lands connected to a central vocal point: Sleeping Beauty’s Castle. As mentioned in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0mKCWboi6Q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Developers Conference (GDC) talk</a> from 2022 – which covers the same ground as Carson’s article – Uncle Walt famously referred to the castle and other tall structures scattered throughout the park as “weenies,” because they lured guests from one area to another in the same way that he himself used hot dog wieners to lure his poodle around the house.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re familiar with Mark Brown’s popular YouTube channel Game Maker’s Toolkit, you may know that weenies have <a href="https://gmtk.substack.com/p/the-world-design-of-banjo-kazooie" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked their way into the language of video game design</a> as well. They’re especially common in the open-world genre, where they help players orient themselves and guide them towards worthwhile content scattered throughout the sprawling sandbox environment. In this sense, structures like the Erdtree and Minor Erdtrees in Elden Ring function as the digital equivalent of Mount Kilimanjaro in Animal Kingdom or Spaceship Earth in EPCOT. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are filled with various types of weenies, from shrines and Sheikah Towers to the Divine Beasts and – of course – Hyrule Castle itself. One game that particularly resembles Disneyland in outline is 2018’s God of War, where Midgard’s centrally located <a href="https://mapgenie.io/god-of-war-2018/maps/midgard" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lake of Nine</a> (complete with a Jörmungandr-weenie) opens up into several branching paths, some leading to other realms.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Walt Disney envisioned a hub-and-spoke layout, with various lands connected to a central vocal point. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These similarities do not imply that developing a game is functionally identical to designing a ride or an entire theme park. On the contrary, each industry works under unique constraints and pressures. Ideas for new attractions have to consider things like safety and carrying capacity. Short ride times, large vehicles, and efficient loading areas keep wait times low and guest experience positive. Another important distinction concerns user experience. While games can be enjoyed in isolation, theme park rides are made for large groups. Unlike with games, where no two play-throughs are exactly alike, most attractions offer a near-identical experience to every rider, every time they ride. Customization and personalization, standard features in games, are largely unattainable in attractions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, while some of the details are different, the big picture is anything but. Whether you work at Universal Studios or Sony Santa Monica, your day-to-day job will see you navigating the same challenge: meeting economic and logistical demands without compromising the immersive quality of the final product. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rarely does this balancing act succeed without something breaking. When Disneyland opened, it quickly became clear that the quaint, narrow streets of its opening area – a traditional American town loosely based on Walt Disney’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SDSYoEgkN0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">birthplace</a> of Marceline, Missouri – had to be widened in order to accommodate the large summertime crowds: an imperative that completely went against Disney’s original vision. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Likewise, Carson – who after his Imagineering days ended up going into game development himself – recalls a time when he’d sunk weeks into programming realistic-looking flames for an Indiana Jones-style game, only for his colleagues to ramp up their flickering animations to unrealistic speeds. “When I complained,” he writes, “the programmer proudly argued (…) that ‘gamers’ should appreciate the visual effect of a high frame rate over the realism of my environments.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/godofwarloadingscreen-1763557674611.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The use of sliding through gaps to disguise loading screens echoes the efforts made by Disney to camouflage the mechanisms that lift and move its magical rides.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the video game industry’s indebtedness to Disneyland’s theme park design was already evident during the arcade era, this relationship has only deepened over time. Already in the late ‘90s, Carson observed that “we can visit and explore worlds on our computer screens that are increasingly dramatic and realistic” – so dramatic and realistic that he had on more than one occasion “been blown to bits because I dared hesitate to admire a beautiful piece of virtual architecture.” Just as Disneyland made it all but necessary for theme parks to conceal the machinery of their own attractions behind mock-up space stations and plywood mountains, so too did the gaming industry arrive at a point where we expect developers to cover up the artificiality of their games by means of organic level design, invisible walls, and hidden loading screens. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games also bear a closer resemblance to theme park rides in that playing them has become an increasingly social experience. That moment Carson dreamt about, when you could meet friends and explore digital worlds as you would the real one, didn’t take long to arrive. Within just a few years, online play – from browser games like Habbo Hotel to multi-player shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield – had become the backbone of the industry, paving the way for our current live service era. At present, even purely single-player experiences are plugged into <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/elden-ring-fromsoftware-youtube-community.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">globe-spanning networks</a> thanks to vibrant fan communities on Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, after decades of theme parks influencing games, the relationship appears to be reversing. While the gaming industry continues to boom, the world of themed entertainment is <a href="https://licensinginternational.org/news/theme-parks-focus-on-brands-as-attendance-spending-declines/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently struggling</a> due to mounting costs and decreased attendance. To stay with the times, ride designers are increasingly working with and learning from game developers. From Los Angeles and Florida to Paris and Tokyo, more and more theme parks are adding digital, interactive, AI-assisted elements to their attractions, blending the distinction between rides and games.

Then there’s the various Mario Kart attractions at Super Nintendo World, where riders wear augmented reality headgear that project virtual elements onto the physical ride itself, or Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure at Disney California Adventure, which uses motion tracking technology to allow riders to shoot their own webs. Before long, we might just see Fortnite show up inside Disneyland, rather than the other way around. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tim Brinkhof is a freelance writer specializing in art and history.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players got their first glimpse at something never seen in the game before: nipples. Specifically, Homer Simpsons' nipples. And big ones too, at that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, an upcoming Fortnite model will feature a giant-sized version of Homer wearing just his underpants, with everything else (including his nipples) on show. Why is this such a big deal to Fortnite's faithful? Well, it's because the game has refused to depict any kind of areola previously.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While never publicly stated, Fortnite developer Epic Games has seemingly mandated that its battle royale should be nipple-less. The apparent rule was first <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/g7l286/what_happened_to_his_nipples/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed</a> among fans all the way back in 2019, when the game's high-profile Travis Scott concert (and his purchasable in-game skin) both showed the rapper with a smooth, nip-free chest.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/21/g6hmwfrxiaasi2z-1763730828221.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Homer Simpsons' nipples.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, numerous Fortnite-original characters and a whole parade of other famous figures have appeared in the game shirtless, but also nipple-less. A non-exhaustive list includes God of War's Kratos, Avatar: The Last Airbender's Aang, WWE's John Cena, Dragonball Z's Goku, and Marvel superheroes such as Drax and The Hulk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has often asked Epic Games if it would like to comment on the lack of nipples in Fortnite, but has never received an official, on-the-record response. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, we've noted that Fortnite's nipple-free decree also extends to Fortnite's third-party modes. Earlier this year, Philips launched Body Royale, a promotional mode designed to highlight its latest OneBlade shaver. On Philips' website, photos for the product depict its use across all types of body hair, by male models who definitely have nipples in real life. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But within Fortnite, in Body Royale, the action plays out against the backdrop of an in-game model who is distinctly nipple-less. Did Philips have to remove the nipples at Epic Games' request, in order to get this experience in the game? (Philips has also not responded to IGN's requests for comment.)</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/21/image-1763730876933.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Philips OneBlade's promotional Fortnite mode, Body Royale.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Homer Simpson looks set to change all of that. But why? Is there something about Homer's design that allows his nipples — nothing more than a pair of black dots — on his animated body? It seems unlikely — other cel-shaded characters have still been nipple-less before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does The Simpsons come with its own set of brand rules that require nipples and supercede Epic Games' own? Or perhaps there's something specific here about the fact that nearly-naked Homer's in-game appearance has to match up with the same design shown in The Simpsons' accompanying Fortnite crossover Disney+ shorts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alternatively, fans say, this could all point to something of a wider policy change within Epic Games. As Fortnite shifts to its new Chapter Seven era and collaborates with Quentin Tarantino, perhaps now is the time to ease this particular restriction. After nipples, what's next? If Epic Games ever acknowledges this, we'll let you know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> Studios has announced a closed alpha test for its forthcoming extraction shooter PUBG: Black Budget.</p>
<p>The game promises to redefine the genre, with a focus on exploration and discovery as opposed to survival and combat. It's set on a mysterious island trapped in a time loop by a supernatural phenomenon.</p>
<p>It faces stiff competition, however, as the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and Escape from Tarkov have recently released, not to mention the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-duckov-is-not-what-i-was-expecting-at-all-and-its-another-startling-reminder-that-perhaps-were-going-about-this-whole-making-games-business-all-wrong">parody Escape from Duckov</a>, as well as the recent Battlefield and Call of Duty releases.</p>
<p>Perhaps, though, PUBG Studios is looking to capitalise on those successes to bolster interest in Black Budget.</p>
<p>The test will take place on Steam for players across North America, Europe, and Asia in two sessions. The first will be 12th - 14th December; the second from 19th - 21st December. That's across two weekends.</p>
<p>Players can sign up for access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4077740/PUBG_Black_Budget/">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Project Black Budget, as it was initially known, was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-people-behind-pubg-plan-to-take-on-escape-from-tarkov-and-dmz-with-an-extraction-shooter-of-their-own"> first spotted in a Krafton financial report back in 2023</a>, described as including "an ever-changing PvPvE open-world and satisfying gunplay that deliver unpredictable and exciting experiences". It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-studios-project-black-budget-will-release-sooner-than-expected-says-publisher-krafton">appeared to be aiming for a 2024 release</a>, but its release date remains TBA.</p>
<p>Still, next month's test will provide a first hands-on opportunity, suggesting a full launch could finally be on the horizon.</p>

My takeaway is that $420 is way too much money for an ergonomic keyboard that doesn’t do the ergonomic part as well as some cheaper models.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Day jobs are a reality for many pursuing their dreams. Artists, actors, musicians, and yes, even esports players often need to rely on income from elsewhere to fund their truest of passions. And one pro women’s Counter-Strike player recently went viral for sharing what she does to make ends meet: Making sandwiches.</p> <p>Tilde Byström, known as 7liciousCSGO in pro Counter-Strike spaces and with a reputation as both a highly accomplished player and commentator, shared a photo of her day job as a way to highlight the reality of what it means to not just play professional esports, but to do so as a woman (h/t Dexerto). This year, ESL Impact, a women’s pro CS2 circuit, ended after a three-year run citing an unsustainable economic model.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">After 10 years in esports, I’m officially a sandwich maker 👍 <a href="https://t.co/G1TykLX6JS">pic.twitter.com/G1TykLX6JS</a></p> <p>— Tilde Byström (@7liciousCSGO) <a href="https://twitter.com/7liciousCSGO/status/1991072670943785252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Speaking to Dexerto, 7licious said that working a day job is nothing new, however. Referencing the fact that she has been told countless times by men that she should “go back to the kitchen” to make someone a sandwich,“ she said, “I work by literally making sandwiches from 5-10 AM most mornings.” The post is “a combination of a joke,” she said, “but at the same time, to be able to survive and pay rent and still play CS2, especially in the current state of the scene for women’s CS, I have to also work a normal job, and pretty much always had to have side jobs while pursuing my dream!”</p>

 <p>And that dream includes a hope that the situation for women in esports improves, and that the barriers between men’s and women’s esports crumble. “The dream for me,” Byström said, “is that women’s CS can evolve so much that we can, in the future, have mixed teams!”</p> <p>The reality of having to essentially live two lives, one dedicated to a day job, the other to one’s true passions, isn’t easy to sustain. It’s bittersweet to see someone embrace the struggle of this lifestyle in stride while also recognizing the unfortunate economic and social realities that often prevent us from pursuing what matters most to us, especially for women.</p>

            <p>Actor Doug Cockle, who is known to many as the gravelly voiced Geralt of Rivia in CD Projekt Red's The Witcher games, has again said he was "sad" to see Henry Cavill step away from the same role in Netflix's series. However, he believes Liam Hemsworth "holds up pretty well" in the show's fourth season.</p>

<p>Hemsworth was first announced to be joining the cast of Netflix's The Witcher adaptation in 2022, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-4-henry-cavill-replaced-as-geralt">Cavill said he would be "laying down [his] medallion and [his] swords"</a> when the third season wrapped. Many were upset by this decision, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-sad-about-henry-cavill-leaving-the-witcher-netflix-show">even Cockle himself said he was disappointed to see Cavill go</a>.</p>
<p>But now, reflecting on the Geralt cast change once more, Cockle has said that while Cavill was certainly "a fantastic Witcher", having seen the latest season of Netflix's series, he also thinks Hemsworth is pretty good too.</p>
<p>"I think Liam holds up pretty well," Cockle told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/geralts-game-actor-says-he-was-sad-to-see-henry-cavill-go-but-that-liam-hemsworth-holds-up-pretty-well-in-the-witcher-season-4-hes-made-it-his-own-character/?s=31">GamesRadar+</a>. "He's different. He's made it his own character, and that's what he should have done as an actor, and I think he's done a fantastic job." Cockle added he is looking forward to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">fifth and final season of Netflix's Witcher adaptation</a>, and "seeing where it goes".</p><p>Back in April last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witchers-video-game-voice-star-weighs-in-on-netflix-adaptation">Cockle admitted there were some choices made by Netflix during the adaptation's run so far he didn't understand</a>. However, he also appreciated the need "to give different mediums their space". The show's "gotta have room to be its own thing", Cockle said at the time.</p>

<p>Cockle is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">reprise his role of Geralt in The Witcher 4</a>, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">feature Ciri as its lead</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-hockey-team-recreated-the-evangelion-intro-for-a-stadium-full-of-fans.1360774/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>As the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, the American Hockey League affiliate of the Philadelphia Flyers, prepared to take the ice, Yoko Takahashi's voice filled the PPL Center in Allentown, Pennsylvania. As phone lights synced to the music, the <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion </em>introduction—what could be the most iconic anime intro of all time—began on a screen above the ice. Standing in for Shiji Ikari, though, is Phantoms right winger Alexis Gendron. And instead of Evangelions themselves, it's Melvin, the fuzzy yellow Phantoms mascot with a puck for a nose.</p><p>The video, which debuted on the Phantoms' PhanCon night (a homage to ComicCon) on Sunday, quickly went viral on social media. It's got well over 2 million views and thousands of comments <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cubecosplay/video/7573379968713903415?ref=aftermath.site"><u>on TikTok</u></a> from both anime and hockey fans who are delighted and baffled by the unlikely crossover. Clearly, there are some anime fans on the Phantoms staff—specifically, the creative team that makes graphics, videos, and content for social media and home games. Doug Chrin, a senior video editor and producer for the Phantoms, first brought the idea to Paul Dampier, the senior manager of game presentation, because he's a huge fan of the show.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d2XUcKZrtGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="LEHIGH VALLEY EVANGELION"></iframe></figure><p>"I've seen plenty of YouTube recreations [of the <em>Evangelion</em> intro] in the past, and some of them are good, but not quite the best," Chrin told Aftermath. "I wanted to be the one to create something that's the best rendition. We went all in as a sports team to be the best at something we're not primarily focused on."</p><p><em>Evangelion, </em>Dampier said, is within that next tier of anime after iconic shows like <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> and <em>Pokémon</em>—it's hugely popular, but not necessarily a household name. "It's been around for 30 years at this point, and there have been waves of fans, and it's had this lasting staying power on the internet," he said. "There's a ton of great anime intros, but there's something about 'A Cruel Angel's Thesis' and that intro that is so iconic."</p><p>Chrin brought the idea up to Dampier and the creative team just days before the team's media day in October, which is when the team shoots most of its player content for the year. They quickly started brainstorming what they needed to film to make the shot-by-shot recreation happen. First, they needed a Shinji. They chose a few players from the lineup and ran them through the motions during the media day.</p><p>"Realistically, I don't know if any of them know the show," Dampier said. "I would guess there's one or two closet anime fans, but they definitely didn't know what we are doing with them. We just directed them through the motions or stances we needed them to be in."</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Lehigh Valley Phantoms</span></figcaption></figure><p>It required a lot of trust that things would come together.</p><p>"We've worked together for a few years now," Dampier said. "We've gotten to know the players, so I think we can tell them, 'Hey guys, this is going to be weird, but I promise it's going to turn out great in the end.’ My team is incredibly talented, and I think we've done a lot of cool things over the past few years, and the players are just like, 'Sure, whatever you need.'"</p><p>After the team "auditioned" a few players, they unanimously agreed that Gendron nailed it. Several other players and staff show up throughout the video, down to Chrin playing Gendo Ikari, as well as the people who clean off the ice with shovels during TV timeouts. [Disclosure: Nicole shovels ice for her local AHL team.] The creative team, which includes Dampier, Chrin, senior motion graphics designer Isa Abdul-Rahman, senior graphic designer Tyler Harka (who did the <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>-style Lehigh Valley Phantoms title screen), graphic design intern Molly Yatchysyn, and video production intern Chelsea Birkel, held on to the footage until the start of November, when they started pulling together the video in earnest.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://aftermath.site/content/media/2025/11/Phan-Con-Intermission_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

Yatchysyn attended the game as a fan and recorded the footage. "It was a range of emotion," Yatchysyn said. "I almost cried again. I cried of laughter watching it in production, but it was great to finally see it on the big screen, looking around, watching people cheer, laugh."</p><p>The players are typically still in the locker room or in the tunnel to the ice while the introduction videos are playing, so the creative team hasn't heard how they feel about it. "I would be surprised if it hasn't made the rounds in the locker room at this point," Dampier said.</p><figure><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@cubecosplay/video/7573379968713903415" data-video-id="7573379968713903415" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@cubecosplay" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cubecosplay?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@cubecosplay</a> <p>Anime and Hockey, one of the most interesting combinations I have seen in a long time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It’s easy to throw around the word ‘classic’ when talking about games, but 2013’s Tomb Raider stakes a solid claim to the label. This is the game that reinvented Lara Croft for a new generation,&nbsp;setting in motion a great trilogy of action games, while also inspiring a new cinematic outing for the British heroine.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRs-bshD4oo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Some 12 years later, that original title has finally raided its way onto Nintendo’s consoles for the first time, for both the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> and the original Switch. Returning to the game in 2025 reveals just what made it so special, though you may want to experience it on the Switch 2, rather than its older sibling.</p>


<p>With the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 release, Aspyr has ported across the Definitive Edition of the game with all of its original DLC, scrubbing the game up and enhancing it with a few Nintendo-specific bells and whistles. In 2025, it is definitely showing its PS3 and Xbox 360 origins, but that doesn’t diminish its status as one of the best action-adventure games of all time.</p>
<p>To be honest, just the fact that Lara is listening to wired earbuds in the opening cutscene is enough to date Tomb Raider, but her shipwreck and subsequent kidnap have lost none of their initial impact as she’s separated from her friends amidst some truly terrifying iconography.</p>


<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of the Definitive Edition is certainly crisp and sleek looking, and while the textures are showing their age, it’s still an eye-catching game, all these years later. It’s also running at a locked 60fps, making it feel as smooth and responsive as you could hope for a 12-year-old game. The original Nintendo Switch version sticks to 30fps and a lower resolution, but it’s otherwise the exact same game, just losing some of that sense of immediacy.</p>
<p>I’d forgotten just how brutal Tomb Raider 2013 was. Lara is impaled within the first five minutes of the game, she spends most of her time screaming, grunting, or dying, while she’s surrounded on all sides by dead bodies, walls covered in bloody smears and flickering candles.</p>
<p>Admittedly, most of the dead bodies here are of Lara’s making, and as a Lara Croft murder-simulator, Tomb Raider Definitive Edition is visceral, painful and without mercy. She is, of course, fending for her own life, and those of her friends, while trying to escape from a cursed island full of cultist soldiers, but at least once or twice you’ll likely wince with the impact of a few of the blows.</p>

<p>So much of what we think of in terms of the modern action-adventure was in place for Lara’s 2013 outing, and while some of the gameplay elements are definitely of their time – hello split-second QTEs with instant death for failure – there are other aspects, like the life-like climbing and clambering, dual-path skill tree, stealth kills and kinetic bow and arrow action, that remain as of-the-moment as anything else released this year.</p>
<p>The Rihanna Pratchett-penned tale also ekes out plenty of drama from the proceedings, and manages to make Lara feel both vulnerable and terrifyingly strong and single-minded. It’s been long enough since my last playthrough that I’d forgotten many of the story beats, and I was easily wrapped back up in the island of Yamatai.</p>
<p>Aspyr have opted to include some features that are exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game, but… well, they’re not especially useful, or impactful. First up are motion controls. ‘Great! That’ll work really well for lining up those head shots or hunting a deer’ I hear you say, but wait! These motion controls are only for spinning around artifacts that you’ve discovered, which isn’t particularly useful.</p>
<p>There’s also mouse controls, which is great when a lot of developers seem to have forgotten that they exist. Unfortunately, they’re so sensitive as to be completely unusable in their current form, which makes you wonder how much testing Aspyr put into them before launching the game. Perhaps the shadow launch was also a surprise to the development team?</p>

<p>Sarcasm aside, both of these things can be easily fixed with a patch or two, which I hope Aspyr will be willing to put the time into, and neither is integral to the experience. With the game sitting pretty in second place on the Switch charts right now, I’d hope it’s worth their while to finish things off.</p>
<p>A big part of that draw will be the budget pricing, with it retailing for a very reasonable £16.39, plus a 10% launch discount to knock it down to £14.75 on both Switch 1 and Switch 2. While the Switch 2-specific features offer literally nothing as it stands, it’s a great game to return to once more, and it still holds up visually, particularly on the smaller screen.</p>
<p>Impressively, Aspyr have even fired up the multiplayer servers, and while many players won’t even remember that Tomb Raider had a multiplayer mode, it’s here in its entirety, letting you sneak around, finishing off other players with abandon. Thanks to the game’s popularity right now, there’s also plenty of players to face off against, so if you fancy a spot of 2013-centric Lara Croft multiplayer, you can.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider Definitive Edition may offer returning fans a nostalgic run through one of Lara Croft’s best adventures, but in 2025 it’s still a remarkably solid experience, especially on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-black-budget-announcement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pubg-black-budget-is-another-extraction-shooter-gunning-for-tarkovs-crown.1360762/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Black Budget</em>, a brand new extraction shooter that can add its name to the growing list of titles that want to knock&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>'s crown off a head increasingly plastered with bullseyes.</p>

<p>The publisher says that&nbsp;<em>Black Budget&nbsp;</em>is "designed as an FPP-first experience" (i.e. first-person perspective), so if you're used to playing&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>in third person, there may be some adjustment required to get used to this one.</p>

<p>You'll play as a Contractor who's sent to an island "trapped in a time loop" and "consumed by a supernatural phenomenon known as the Anomaly", so&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Black Budget&nbsp;</em>has a decidedly supernatural bent to it, it seems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-black-budget-gameplay.jpg?itok=KqJjxsBU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-black-budget-gameplay.jpg?itok=c0yKAqDn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PUBG: Black Budget&nbsp;</em>is a supernatural extraction shooter where things get real weird.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Black Budget</em>'s core gameplay loop involves searching the island for artifacts to extract, all while contending with both hostile threats in your environment and other players determined to extract the same artifacts as you.</p>

<p>Sessions will last "up to 30 minutes", according to Krafton, and will feature "level- and squad-based matchmaking for up to 3-player squads and 45 players per session", so it sounds as though duos may be supported on launch. Take note,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-cosmetics-duos" rel="nofollow"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>.</p>

<p>Since it's a&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>game, you probably won't be surprised to learn that&nbsp;<em>Black Budget</em>'s map will gradually shrink as play progresses, which Krafton says will help to create "tense and unpredictable scenarios every loop".</p>

<p>While you're not searching the island for artifacts, you'll expand your base, craft equipment for yourself, and improve "skills and proficiencies". The difficulty of the game will also scale depending on your level and the time you've spent inside each loop.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for the next major&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update, and it's set to bring a new Archon Quest, new characters, and more early next month.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-ii" rel="nofollow">last month's Version Luna II</a>, the aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna III, otherwise known as "A Nocturne of the Far North", will see the region of Nod-Krai preparing for its Moon-Prayer Night festival.</p>

<p>During the course of said event, you'll meet with some unexpected guests and team up with some old allies to investigate the appearance of strange new phantoms that are threatening to tear Nod-Krai's borders asunder.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-iii-archon-quest.jpg?itok=dbcn-GMe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-iii-archon-quest.jpg?itok=sUucz6hV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna III is coming in December.</figcaption></figure><p>As usual, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update without new characters to play as, and so you can expect two in Version Luna III.</p>

<p>The first is Durin, a 5-star Pyro sword user who can either play the role of a support or a damage dealer. As a support, he can lower the elemental resistance of enemies and deal AoE damage, while as a damage dealer, he's a single-target monster.</p>

<p>A new 4-star bow user by the name of Jahoda is also joining the roster for this latest update, and she can heal her team while also absorbing elemental attacks to deal corresponding damage to enemies. This cycle's reruns are Venti, Varesa, and Xilonen.</p>

<p>Version Luna III will also introduce a new Hexerei mechanic, whereby some characters will be enhanced with new abilities and Constellation effects through becoming Hexerei versions of themselves. Having multiple Hexerei characters in your party allows you to boost your party's battle prowess as well.</p>




<p>As ever, a new&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>also brings with it brand new bonuses for you, and here are this update cycle's goodies. Remember, you've got until November 24th to redeem them!</p>

<ul><li>1203Kuunrukous - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>Dragon1203Durin - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>GOGOCraftspeople - 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna III will be available on December 3rd. You can check the game out for free right now on PC, PlayStation (although it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">losing PS4 support next year</a>), and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft%E2%80%99s-mysterious-delay-explained-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-black-flag-ai-and-debt-accounting.1360747/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There were always three big possibilities for why <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-far-cry-stock-announcement-delayed-2000644091">Ubisoft had cryptically delayed</a> its latest earnings report just minutes after it was already supposed to go live. The first was a big injection of new cash, say from a sovereign wealth fund like Saudi Arabia’s. The second was an outright sale of a major portion of the company, maybe to its current backstop investor Tencent. The third was much more mundane: an accounting error. After a week of speculation, the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> publisher confirmed that was indeed the reason for the delay.</p> <p>Ubisoft explained on its conference call before markets opened in France this morning that the accounting issue had to do with new auditors brought in earlier this year to review the company’s books. They determined money from various business partnerships (one last year and one this year) needed to be recognized differently in the company’s accounting. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/ubisofts-quarterly-bookings-beat-guidance-tencent-deal-helps-cut-debt-2025-11-21/">As <em>Reuters</em> reports</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-delayed-results"><em>Game File</em></a>), this mattered because the new math put the publisher in breach of its “leverage covenant ratio” for various loans, i.e. too much debt and not enough money coming in.</p>

 <p>In its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/52w2Cas6xfQjegpCgP1SZC/b38c338a1bf6f365849a50d2f182d061/Ubisoft_FY26_H1_Earnings_PR_EN_vF.pdf">earnings press release</a>, the company says it will use the recent $1.35 billion bailout from Tencent to pay off some of this debt and get more generous financing terms in order to “support its strategic ambitions, in line with the broader transformation currently underway.” Ubisoft doesn’t say what the business deals that led to the accounting snafu were for, but does claim that it out-performed estimates last quarter in part due to “stronger-than-expected partnerships.” It could be anything from TV and licensing deals to Game Pass revenue (Microsoft paid to add a bunch of the company’s old games to the service for its recent price hike). TL;DR: Ubisoft didn’t get sold, at least not yet.</p>

 <h2>The <em>Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag</em> remake could be coming in March</h2> <p>Reports of the <em>Rabbids</em>‘ maker’s demise would seem greatly exaggerated. Ubisoft won’t provide actual sales figures for this year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> but said the release was “overperforming.” It also pointed to <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>The Division 2</em>, and a bunch of older games for why it beat revenue estimates by over $50 million, with bookings up 39 percent year-on-year.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft has always been the <a href="https://kotaku.com/lord-rings-moneyball-memes-streaming-1851127017"><em>Moneyball</em> of the video game publishing world</a>. It has no single mega hit like <em>EA Sports FC</em> or <em>Call of Duty</em> that can print mountains of cash on demand every year, but it does try to recreate those effects in the aggregate with a sprawling library of massive games—<em>Far Cry 6</em>, <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, over a dozen <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games in almost as many years—that regularly go on sale for up to 90 percent off.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft also teased its upcoming slate of releases which include the <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em> remake, <em>Rainbow Six Mobile</em>, <em>The Division Resurgence</em>, and an “unannounced title” coming out before April 2026. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a> the mystery release is the<em> Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag</em> remake we <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">first reported on back in 2023</a>. It will reportedly included some overhauled game systems and more of the open-world RPG feel of recent entries in the franchise. The company is probably looking at the recent monster success of<em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> and hoping for even a fraction of the same nostalgic hype.</p>

 <p>But all of this is only filling a hole left by the fact that Ubisoft still can’t seem to get some of its biggest sequels out the door. That includes <em>Far Cry 7</em>, the new <em>Ghost Recon</em>, and the more-than-a-decade-in-the-making <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em></a>. Solving this development pipeline issue is seemingly at the heart of an operational overhaul Ubisoft promises to announce early next year. Long a spider-web of interoperable co-development studios scattered all over the world, the company is pledging to concentrate decision making in franchise-based “creative houses” for “stronger creative vision, greater focus, efficiency, autonomy and accountability.” Is that real change, or just a line from ChatGPT that some intern at McKinsey consulting thought sounded good?</p>

 <h2>Ubisoft embraces gen AI as gaming’s next ‘3D revolution’</h2> <p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wants investors to know he’s completely onboard <a href="https://kotaku.com/where-winds-meet-game-reddit-steam-reviews-2000645900">with AI</a>. Here’s what he said on today’s call <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-delayed-results">per <em>Game File</em></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>We are making great strides in applying Gen AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams…It’s as big as a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D. And we have everything to lead on this front.</p></blockquote> <p>He says the company is running full-tilt into the future of the controversial tech from two directions: “groundbreaking player-facing generative AI applications” like <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-writing-scriptwriting-ghostwriter-machine-1850250316">neo NPCs</a> that fill bespoke game worlds with LLM chatbots and, on the development side, with teams “in our studios and offices embracing this new technology and constantly exploring new use cases in programming, art and overall game quality.<em>”</em></p> <p>There are also two ways to interpret these commitments. The first is that Ubisoft has traditionally lagged behind competitors in market-leading breakthroughs and doesn’t want to be once again playing catch-up if, say, AI-made and operated MMORPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399">slop-fests</a> are the future. The other is that the company is still very vulnerable; its stock price, while better after today’s news, is still in the toilet, and it needs to stick to the shareholder-approved script, unlike certain companies whose <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html">CEOs&nbsp;may have more of a license to speak their minds</a> with a <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>-sized trump card sitting in their pocket.</p> <p>Either way, the AI stuff could all still be a dead end. Remember Scalar? It’s Ubisoft’s ambitious, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-scalar-cloud-assassins-creed-far-cry-open-world-1848680977">cloud-based development technology</a> meant to make game engines function like the internet. It <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-scalar-cloud-assassins-creed-far-cry-open-world-1848680977">threatened fans</a> with even more massive game maps filled with even more quest icons. It has yet to materialize into anything big outside of the company, and one of the major projects utilizing it within Ubisoft has been continually rebooted. Some of the big names espousing Scalar’s virtues years ago? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeropage?originalSubdomain=se">No longer with the company</a>.</p> <p>We’ll see if <em>Assassin’s ChatGPT</em> ends up having the same half-life.</p>

The design originates from a </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasakis-cursed-micro-bikini-look-from-banned-kirby-fangame-gets-revival-in-air-riders-custom-machine-market/"><span>banned fan game</span></a><span> and went on to become a meme in the Japanese </span><i><span>Kirby </span></i><span>community, so it’s entirely possible this is just an extension of Nintendo and </span><i><span>Kirby </span></i><span>developer HAL Laboratory trying to wipe the scantily clad chef from existence.

                <p>In February 2023, Wizards of the Coast closed an internal game development studio, and with it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/" data-ref-id="1100-6510284">cancelled multiple unannounced titles</a>, one of them being Whimpact!, a "Pokemon meets Fall Guys" online multiplayer game.

The more they're cared for, the stronger those powers will be. Up to eight players will be able to join together in co-op arena-style gameplay as they collect Whims, gather mystical energy called Starcane, and navigate obstacles while fighting hordes of robotic invaders trying to steal the energy for themselves.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NWrbMVN84E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4NWrbMVN84E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608412-affixedattack.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608413-chaosmountain.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608414-exponpc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608415-marketplace.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608416-whimtile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608412,1300-4608413,1300-4608414,1300-4608415,1300-4608416" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608412-affixedattack.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608413-chaosmountain.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608414-exponpc.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608415-marketplace.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608416-whimtile.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608412-affixedattack.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608413-chaosmountain.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608414-exponpc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608415-marketplace.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608416-whimtile.jpg"></figure><p>There are seven different types of Whims to collect, each with six different color variants.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Brass Rain is an upcoming free-to-play WWII first-person shooter from Yarnhub Studios, a developer made up of veterans from EA, Remedy, Sony, and Jagex. It's also a studio that's known more as an animation studio, making animated videos shared on YouTube, that is now entering the video game industry with Brass Rain as its debut title.</p>



<p>It's able to fund the title thanks to $2.9 million of crowdfunding from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Yarnhub">the community it built with its YouTube channel</a>, which currently has over 2.7 million subscribers. While it's been known as an animation studio, making a game has been a long time coming, and something that the studio's community has been asking the company to try for a long time.</p>



<p>"<em>Our audience has been asking for us to make a game for years,</em>" said David Webb, chief executive officer at Yarnhub, in a press release. "<em>They've told us exactly what they want: a game with heart, historical authenticity, global campaigns, and multiplayer combat that lets them fight as infantry, tank crews, bomber gunners, and naval teams. Brass Rain is our answer to that call, built from the ground up with the community in mind</em>."</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Brass Rain isn't just a game, it's a living historical experience shaped by the millions who watch our films every month</em>," continued Cyril Barrow, head of games at Yarnhub Studios. "<em>Our community challenged us to go beyond what games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/edenspark-war-thunder-devs-gaijin-entertainment-open-source-ai-assisted-game-making/">War Thunder</a> and World of Tanks offer, by adding the one thing they've always wanted: boots-on-the-ground infantry. We're delivering a fully crew-based combat experience that lets players fight together across land, sea, and air, and experience history as they go</em>."</p>



<p>According to the press release, Yarnhub is moving forward with a free-to-play model because of its success on YouTube and the crowdfunding it has accomplished so far. There will be "<em>some of the lowest-cost cosmetic microtransactions in gaming</em>" included in its free-to-play model, according to the studio. We'll have to get price matches on that claim to see if it holds water, but for now, it's nice to see Yarnhub at least trying to approach free-to-play in a way that won't try to gauge players.</p>



<p>Brass Rain will launch in early access on Steam sometime in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbook-pro-m4-pro-chip-512gb-hits-new-record-low-apple-clears-stock-as-m5-chip-arrives-2000646132</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/macbook-pro-m4-pro-chip-512gb-hits-new-record-low-apple-clears-stock-as-m5-chip-arrives.1360717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just announced its M5 chip a few weeks ago but this <strong>MacBook Pro with M4 Pro remains an incredibly powerful machine</strong> that handles almost all professional workflows with ease. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5787/">record low pricing at $1,749 on Amazon for the 24GB/512GB model, down from $1,999</a>, makes it more compelling than most MacBooks currently available.</p>
<p>The model sits as the <strong>#1 best-seller among MacBook Pros on Amazon</strong> and the reason becomes clear when you consider the specs at this price point. Apple never runs discounts directly on its website or in its retail stores, so hitting up retailers like Amazon during Black Friday is the only way to score legitimate discounts on current-generation MacBooks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop-Class Performance</h2>
<p>The 12-core CPU splits down into <strong>eight performance cores and four efficiency cores</strong> and makes quick work of everything from video editing to the compilation of software. The architecture executes the resource-intensive tasks much faster compared to the previous M3 Pro, drawing less power in the process, which puts more runtime on your battery when doing intensive work. Real-world performance reveals stutter-free 4K video timeline scrubbing, instant photo filter application across hundreds of images, and code compilation that completes before you finish your coffee.</p>
<p>The <strong>16-core GPU</strong> provides graphics performance that’s competitive with discrete graphics in much pricier Windows laptops. You can edit multi-layer 8K video projects, work with intricate 3D models, or run demanding creative apps like Cinema 4D without thermal throttling. Gaming performance is above expectations for a Mac, with AAA titles running at high settings and maintaining smooth frame rates. A u<strong>nified memory architecture sees the GPU tapping into the same 24GB pool as the CPU</strong>&nbsp;which diminishes bottlenecks normally associated with traditional discrete graphics arrangements.</p>



<p>The 24GB of unified memory handles professional workloads that choke systems with less RAM. You can have dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple creative applications at the same time, and switch between projects without any hint of slowdowns. The unified architecture means this 24GB functions more efficiently than traditional RAM since both CPU and GPU access it directly.</p>
<p>The display on the <strong>14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR is capable of 1000 nits of sustained brightness and peaks at 1600 nits for HDR content</strong>. Mini-LED backlighting enables true blacks with excellent contrast that makes on-screen content pop. Color accuracy meets professional levels right out of the box, thanks to P3 wide color gamut coverage that will satisfy even photographers and video editors. The <strong>screen refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> courtesy of <em>ProMotion</em> makes scrolling feel butter-smooth and helps alleviate eye strain during extended work sessions.</p>



<p>That’s also <strong>18 hours of video playback or about 12 hours of actual work</strong> mixing web browsing, document editing, and creative applications. You can work through a full day without hunting for outlets, and that transforms the way you approach mobile productivity. The <em>MagSafe</em> charging connection means that accidental cable yanks won’t send your laptop flying, and you still have both Thunderbolt ports free for peripherals.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence integration brings <strong>AI features right to the operating system</strong>, from advanced text editing suggestions all the way to picture generation tools within native apps. All of these AI-related tasks are processed locally by the M4 Pro’s Neural Engine for data privacy and speed. These features keep evolving through new software updates, adding value during the life of the laptop.</p>
<p>You’re getting here a professional-grade laptop with M4 Pro performance for $250 less than Apple’s direct pricing, at $1,749. Similar Windows laptops are $2,500 or more and lack the efficiency and battery life that Apple Silicon delivers.</p>
