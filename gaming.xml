            <p>Another day, another Nintendo <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leak - this time pertaining to images that purport to be of a Joy-Con for Nintendo's Switch successor.</p>
<p>As Tom reported a little while back, we've had a fair idea what Switch 2 will look like for a while - at least since a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">prototype console shell and internal components surfaced online in late September</a>. But recent weeks have seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">further images posted</a>, this time by accessory companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">now taking orders for Switch 2 add-ons</a>, which show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">close estimations for Nintendo's next console</a> in greater detail.</p>

<p>Now we have brand-new images of what's reported to be the new generation of Joy-Con controllers with magnetic Joy-Con attachments and an additional button below Home on the right Joy-Con.</p>
<p>Reportedly originating from China, the Joy-Con shows off its new magnetic attachment as well as revised colour palette which differs from existing Joy-Cons.</p> <div>

<p>If the images are authentic - and right now, there is no proof - it looks like we can also expect enlarged SL and SR buttons, too, and maybe even a mouse-like optical sensor. You can check the photos out yourself in the X post above or in the subreddit thread embedded below:</p>

            <p>As Amazon's phenomenal TV adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> begins filming its second series, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has opened up on why he thinks violence sells when it comes to AAA games, particularly RPGs.</p>
<p>Over the New Year, Cain posted a video to YouTube about "why so many AAA RPGs expect and often require the player to do combat" and discussed "whether or not games treat [violence] as the default".</p>

<p>Acknowledging he's had "pushback on similar answers in the past", Cain then summarised his thoughts with: "The TL;DR of it is, companies make games - and, in general, products - that people will buy. That's it".</p>
<p>"It means games that sell the most - and I'm not even talking about review the best, just sell the most - will dictate future games.</p>
<p>"This is <em>obvious</em>. If you have a company and it's trying to make money and there's one game type that sells millions of copies and another one that sells a hundred thousand, which one are you going to do if they both take <em>just</em> as much time and money to develop? This is why I tell people to vote with their dollars," he added.</p>
<p>And people who do choose to vote with their wallets won't just be a "drop in the bucket", Cain insisted. If enough people did the same, "those drops become a storm and companies will listen".</p>
<p>"Action genres tend to sell very well, and by that I mean, action RPGs kinda outsell classic RPGs, even though both of them are violent," he added. "It's also easier to market those sorts of games. When you watch a trailer and you see people actually doing things - jumping, climbing, shooting, punching - it looks like: 'Whoa! Look at all the things you can do in that game' [...] It's hard to show the other things.</p><p>"How do we show that this game has a really good story? How do we show that it has fantastic dialogue? How do you do that in a trailer that may only be 15 or 30 seconds long?" Cain said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-co-creator-tim-cain-says-violence-will-be-the-default-in-aaa-rpgs-as-long-as-we-keep-buying-it-companies-dont-make-them-because-they-feel-like-it-they-make-them-because-they-sell/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"You have to reduce this wonderful narrative, that's super creative and nuanced that has a huge arc, down to a soundbite. And guess what? It's because most people won't watch more than a few seconds of something!"</p>
<p>As for that aforementioned Amazon Fallout show? Last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-starts-filming-with-walton-goggins-back-in-character">Walton Goggins slipped back into his Ghoulish guise</a> to start filming the second season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Runners up were Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers - described as a "beautifully synergistic and strategic deckbuilder", LocalThunk said "people mistakenly wrote this off as a Balatro clone, but this was announced before my game ever was" - Arco, Nova Drift, Ballionaire, and Wrong Organ's exceptional Mouthwashing.</p><p>"I didn't even know this was a horror game when I started playing it at 11pm one fateful night," the developer <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1875284685150142820">said</a>.

			<p>New alleged pictures of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con controller surfaced online today, providing a new look at the new version of the controller launching together with the system.</p>
<p>The new pictures, which were shared on the Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwordfishAgile3472/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SwordfishAgile3472</a>, showcase the controller's side and back, providing a new look at the simple color scheme and at some of the changes from the current controller, such as bigger shoulder buttons and more. While there is no way to know if the pictures showcase the real controller, it looks legit with its attention to detail and the presence of a serial number, which could put the leaker in some serious trouble with Nintendo.</p>

<p>2025 has barely begun, but we still managed to learn plenty of new things regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, even without an official announcement. A few days ago, pictures showcasing the system's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motherboard</a> surfaced online, which were <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">heavily scrutinized</a> in the attempt to determine the process node used for the T239 chip that powers the console. A patent filed by Nintendo earlier this week also seems to confirm the system will indeed support NVIDIA DLSS upscaling, as has been rumored for a good while.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-game-director-thought-remedy-should-aim-to-be-europes-naughty-dog/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alan Wake 2 Game Director Kyle Rowley was recently featured in an hour-long video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw0RByccsO4&amp;list=PLZeoUzft8lM_EjUOKaU4GvZDRGoWzfjgI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> on the Behind The Voice YouTube channel.</p>
<p>During the lengthy conversation, the industry veteran (Rowley started as a Q&amp;A tester on Black and White 2 twenty years ago, then worked as a designer on The Outsider, Homefront: The Revolution, and RuneScape before joining Remedy) revealed that he thought the Finnish studio should aim to be the European version of Naughty Dog.</p>
<p><em>When I came to Quantum Break, I was just excited about working on something that had... you know, one of my favorite games at the time was Uncharted, and I knew that we were going to do something that... I remember having a discussion with our lead animator at the time, and I was like, I think that we should be aiming to kind of be like the European version of Naughty Dog. Like, that would be cool if we could kind of get that same level of feel, and that was the type of game that I like to play, and so I was excited about working on it.</em></p>
<p>It's not at all a farfetched comparison. Both studios make action/adventure games with a highly cinematic flair. Of course, while both studios are highly acclaimed, Naughty Dog's games tend to sell a lot more - though to be fair, they also cost a lot more. For comparison, Naughty Dog's most recent game (The Last of Us Part II, which will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch on PC</a> in its remastered version) cost $220 million, while Alan Wake 2 cost €70 million, according to Finnish analysts. However, Remedy is also used to make even cheaper games. Control famously only cost €30 million, and the initial budget for the upcoming sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was set at €50 million</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Naughty Dog is stepping a bit into Remedy's comfort zone with its new sci-fi IP, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which was just&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2024. On the other hand, Remedy appears to be following in Naughty Dog's footsteps when it comes to adapting its game IPs to live-action film/TV. Naughty Dog successfully did it (thanks to Sony, of course) with Uncharted and The Last of Us, while Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with Annapurna</a> to adapt Alan Wake 2 and Control.</p>
<p>Do you feel that Remedy is on the right path to be a European Naughty Dog? Vote in the poll below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/05/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-35-to-31/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Today, we’re rounding off the first 20 games in our Most Wanted of 2025 series, counting down from 35 to 31. There is a good mix of games in the list below from psychological horrors and the fate of some giant robots, to a fresh take on a belove musou franchise. Let’s dig in, shall we?</p>
<h2>35 – The Alters</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Q1 2025</em></p>
<p>What would it be like to live with yourself? It is a question you may have pondered? Would your copy be exactly like you, or look like you but have a different view of things. Enter The Alters, 11 Bit Studios new psychological survival horror in which that question is answered, though in a very stressful environment that will push anyone to their limits.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLXizxVIu6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You are Jan and Jan and Jan and Jan and, well you get the idea. Jan is a space builder trapped on an alien planet. He wants to get home but to do that he has to survive and restore his ship. It is a job he cannot do alone, but he can create Alters of himself. They are clones but with their own personalities, wants, needs, and stress points. If you don’t manage each individual’s needs or meet their expectations things will get tense, and the Jans will turn on each other. Probably not wise to say something like “Sure, Jan” sarcastically.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/the-alters-demo-pc-xbox-ps5/">The Alters demo</a> is available now.</p>
<h2>34 – Sleight of Hand</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC, Game Pass – TBC</em></p>
<p>Sleight of Hand has one of the best descriptions going for it, with developer RiffRaff Games calling it a third-person card-slinging occult noir stealth sim. What more could you want? You are Lady Luck, an occult detective and former witch, who is taking on one last job. A job that has her meeting her past head on as she is tasked with going to Steeple City and bringing down her former coven.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sleight of Hand Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBHg3xKnYTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The card slinging element comes from one of the core game mechanics, which are Lady Luck’s cards. She has cards imbued with magical abilities that can be used for all sorts, like creating a smokescreen, use smoke based attacks, and set traps. There will be different cards to use, allowing you to customise your deck which in turn determines your playstyle? Will you favour stealth cards or more attack based cards. Sleight of Hand is coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S, and will be on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<h2>33 – Slay The Spire 2</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Slay The Spire 2 has a lot of expectation behind it after the original was received so well. This is a sequel removing itself from any narrative connection to the first game by being set 1000 years later, introducing a new cast of slayers that are equipped with their own cards, as well as new archetypes to master.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Slay the Spire 2 - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttVtllHkb4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Slay The Spire 2 will change on every run, and you will have to deal with the foes and challenges that are thrown in front of you with the cards you have. You will need to build and rebuild your decks until you have a set that can master some of the tougher challenges ahead. Slay The Spire 2 is planned for Steam Early Access early this year.</p>
<h2>32 – Transformers: Reactivate</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – TBC</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/09/transformers-reactivate-pc-ps5-xbox/">Transformers: Reactivate was announced for consoles and PC</a>, at the tail end of 2022 during The Game Awards. The game is a 1-4 player action game. It was revealed through a cinematic trailer showing no Transformers in action, but from the point of view of what we assume are fallen Autobots, who have met their match against an enemy called The Legion. This is not about protecting Earth from an invasion, because it has fallen to The Legion already. Instead, it seems this is about resistance.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TRANSFORMERS: REACTIVATE Official Announce Trailer | The Game Awards" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edBK2ZpYY_0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since the announcement of Transfomers Reactivate there have been precisely zero major updates. First the closed beta for 2023 did not take place, and the game is now being developed in Unreal Engine 5. Maybe, we’ll hear more in 2025 and get a surprise release?</p>
<h2>31 – Dynasty Warriors: Origins</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 17th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a major refresh for the Dynasty Warriors series, taking it right back to its roots. Players are a nameless warrior that has lost his memories, and is thrust right into China’s Three Kingdom’s period. It is a time of war and strife with the events of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Battle of Chibi taking place.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C25kV-6Qrs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is not just about taking out thousands of enemies in a matter of minutes using loads of different combos and skills. There is also an RPG side to it. As you complete missions and tasks you will earn XP, which in turn translates to your character rising up the military ranks and earning new skills. You will also build bonds with other characters. There are a lot of new things that even veteran fans of the series will discover, and Dom wrote about them after spending four hours with Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>
<p>We went hands on with the game recently, ahead of the demo release, saying that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/dynasty-warriors-origins-takes-the-series-back-to-its-roots-to-find-its-future/">Dynasty Warriors Origins takes the series back to its roots to find its future</a>.</p>
<p><em>Another batch done, we’ll see you tomorrow for five more!</em></p>

<p>The esports industry continues to expand at an alarming pace, getting bigger each year with more games being added to the competitive collection. For a game to be considered ‘an esports game’, it simply needs to foster a competitive multiplayer environment – which means <strong>many </strong>games fit the bill.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’re looking at every esports game coming out in 2025. Which are you most excited about?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-esports-games-coming-out-in-2025">All Esports Games Coming Out in 2025</h2>



<p>This list represents every esports game either confirmed to be or <strong>expected </strong>to be launching in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-deadlock">Deadlock</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Valve’s Deadlock is one of the most anticipated esports games out there. It was kept on the DL by Valve for the longest time until it could be contained no more. In 2024, it stormed the charts on Steam, presenting users with a fresh and exciting hero shooter environment that’ll be set to rival Overwatch and Marvel Rivals if it’s one of the esports games coming out in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gears of War once fostered a solid esports ecosystem, but times changed. There are high expectations that E-Day, an all-new adventure set in the Gears of War universe and a prequel of sorts, will bring back Gears esports once and for all. We don’t know what that’ll look like, but it’ll be good to see if it has a competitive environment if it’s released in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fortnite-ballistic">Fortnite: Ballistic</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fortnite Ballistic is a first-person competitive shooter built in the heart of the Fortnite platform. It’s everything you know and love from Fortnite intertwined with traditional multiplayer elements from the likes of Counter-Strike and VALORANT. It’s everything you’d expect from an esports game, and it’s expected to release in full, graduating from early access, later in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fragpunk">FragPunk</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>FragPunk is a brand-new IP from Bad Guitar Studio. It’s a gaudy, colourful five-vs-five hero-based FPS with plenty to offer, and it has impressed users in beta testing. It’s set to be released on March 6, 2025, making it one of the first new esport games releasing in 2025. It has a unique ‘powerup card’ mechanic that keeps gameplay as fresh as possible, which is well-needed in today’s world.</p>



<h3 id="h-virtua-fighter-6">Virtua Fighter 6</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>At The Game Awards 2024, Sega unveiled ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’, which many have dubbed Virtua Fighter 6. It’s the first new game in the series in almost twenty years, and it’ll be a nice addition to the stacked FGC roster. It <strong>could </strong>launch in 2025, but it’s not at all guaranteed. Instead, keep an eye open for Virtua Fighter 5 REVO, a remaster of sorts of the last game, released in 2006.</p>



<h3 id="h-splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Splitgate 2 is expected to be one of the fastest-paced shooters on the market when it drops in 2025. It’s a high-octane, energetic shooter that uses portals to empower players to traverse the map in genius ways, but under the hood, it’s a typical multiplayer title with oodles of esports potential. </p>

<p>Fallout’s first season was released on Prime Video in April 2024 to an overwhelmingly positive reception. It single-handedly brought about a resurgence of the post-apocalyptic franchise, bringing millions of players into the series and flying high on the charts for weeks. It went on to win a slew of awards, but just as soon as it arrived, fans were hungry for a second season.</p>



<p>Will there be a season 2 of Fallout, and when will it be released? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fallout-season-two-release-date">Fallout Season Two Release Date</h2>



<p>Shortly after the first season’s debut, it was announced that Fallout season two was greenlit. That means that it’s almost guaranteed to arrive, and not long after that announcement, the cast and crew started teasing that the second season was in production.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to today, and Fallout season two is well and truly being pieced together. The most recent leaks have revealed some set pieces being stood up to reflect locations in Fallout: New Vegas, a setting teased at the end of the first season.</p>



<p>There isn’t an official release date for Fallout season two yet, but we know it’s ahead of schedule. Fans are expecting it to return in October 2025 – or October 2026 if things are substantially delayed for some reason. This is because October is an important month in the Fallout universe and it makes sense that Bethesda and Amazon would pay tribute and show some fan service.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-fallout-season-two-be-about">What Will Fallout Season Two Be About?</h2>



<p>Warning – spoilers ahead.</p>



<p>At the end of the first season of Fallout, our trio of hero characters were all alive and well, with their paths into the second season of the show being mapped out ahead of them.</p>



<p>Lucy (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) are sticking together going into the second season, but Maximus (Aaron Moten) has returned to the Brotherhood of Steel after being crowned a victor. It’s believed by the Brotherhood that he killed Lee Moldaver, one of the show’s antagonists. That’s not true, but the belief will work wonders for Maximus.</p>



<p>We also saw Lucy’s father, Hank MacLean (Kyle MacLachlan), jet off in a suit of power armour to New Vegas after being revealed as the ‘big baddie’ of the Fallout TV universe.</p>



<p>There are several smaller storylines yet to be wrapped up or explored, such as the goings-on inside Vault 31, 32, and 33, and the activities of some of the more well-known factions across the Fallout world. We may also have look-back episodes that offer more insights into the early lore of the games, much like we had in the first season.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov is the most popular extraction shooter in the world, pitting players against each other and a slew of AI-based enemies across a series of maps under gruelling conditions. It has been on the market for almost a decade, but that doesn’t mean it’s not susceptible to a few glitches here and there – including network stability issues.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’re answering one key question: ‘Is Escape from Tarkov down?’ Use this guide to find out about the Tarkov server status and whether Tarkov is offline right now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-tarkov-down-answered">Is Tarkov Down? Answered</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is almost always online only, which means if the Tarkov servers are down, you’ll be presented with error messages and the inability to load into a game. It can be pretty irritating, as Escape from Tarkov is a game that requires time, effort, and dedication – none of which can be applied if the Tarkov server status is in the red.</p>



<p>That said, this guide will help you figure out the answer to your question: ‘Are Tarkov servers down?’</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-check-tarkov-servers-status">How to Check Tarkov Servers Status</h3>



<p>The best way to find out about the state of Tarkov’s server status is to use the official status page, <a href="https://status.escapefromtarkov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which can be found here</a>.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can follow Battlestate Games on Twitter (X) using one of the following profiles for all the latest updates:</p>

</ul>



<p>There are also third-party tools that you can use to check on Tarkov’s servers:</p>

<li><a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/escape-from-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Down Detector</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re stuck with Tarkov matching forever, don’t fret – just use one of these resources to see what’s up with the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-tarkov-servers-offline-now">Are Tarkov Servers Offline Now?</h2>



<p>I’ll keep this article updated as much as possible to help you out – I’m also a keen Escape from Tarkov player, so I’ll be tuned in to the latest disruptions as much as you will.</p>



<p><strong>From January 4 to January 5, Escape from Tarkov experienced server issues that took the game offline for players worldwide. The issue prevented players from loading into raids either as a PMC or a Scav, but Escape from Tarkov Arena remained unimpacted.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-spiritual-sequel-teased-by-markus-%E2%80%98notch%E2%80%99-persson.1074024/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/minecraft-spiritual-sequel-teased-by-markus-notch-persson/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, a spiritual sequel to the best-selling game ever, Minecraft, was <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> by creator Markus 'Notch' Persson. As you might recall, Persson left Mojang after selling the studio he created to Microsoft for $2.5 billion in September 2014. The following year, he founded another game development studio called Rubberbrain, which, however, never released a game.</p>
<p>Persson relaunched it in 2024 under the new name Bitshift Entertainment. On January 1, the game designer <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> openly about Bitshift's current project (a traditional roguelike mixed with a tile-based first-person dungeon crawler) but also polled his fans to see if they'd rather him make a Minecraft spiritual successor. Which they did (78% voted for this option). Two days later, Persson shared the mindset behind this announcement:</p>
<p><em>I basically announced Minecraft 2. </em><em>I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.</em></p>
<p><em>I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it.</em></p>
<p><em>My intentions are to be clear and honest about it, saying that spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic. The things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for. </em><em>I intend for the money to be spent for good, but my god have I learned I fail a lot. Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, and I also very much value being a man of my word, so I also intend to do this in a way that in no way tried to sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about. </em><em>And I respect them for doing that. It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me.</em></p>
<p>When a fellow X user asked him if he'd really make Minecraft 2, he replied:</p>
<p><em>No, I'd make a similar game based on what I think the audience that says they want that game might enjoy. Probably do early access to make sure we're on track. </em><em>But I mean I still sort of think I'm just a clown getting lucky in a sea of actual talents, so I have no idea if it actually will be good. But I'll try.</em></p>
<p>Based on his track record, it would be no exaggeration to call him a one-trick pony, as Minecraft is his only real claim to fame in the game industry. Even if he does end up releasing such a game, it would inevitably be compared to his previous creation, which Mojang continuously updates for the legions of fans who still play it regularly.</p>
<p>The last content patch, The Garden Awakens, dropped in early December and added a new biome and a new mob. There are also plenty of spin-off games for those looking for different experiences, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/minecraft-dungeons-the-shallowest-depths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Dungeons</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-legends-will-release-on-consoles-and-pc-on-april-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Legends</a>. And A Minecraft Movie airs in theaters on April 4, 2025.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> fans think they've spotted a clue that the series' signature morality system may be making a comeback in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst developer BioWare has confirmed nothing either way - which means we can only take this with a healthy bucket of salt for now - fans like X user Kalaelizabeth believe they've spotted a sneaky nod to Mass Effect's Paragon/Renegade system hiding in plain sight.</p>

<p>Take the post embedded below, which includes an <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1722012172166025591">official promotional image</a> of the next Mass Effect game that, at first glance, may not be telling us very much at all.</p>
<p>Look a little closer, though, and you can see why fans are drawing the conclusions they are. Regardless of whether or not you believe the image is sneakily acknowledging the morality system is making a return, it's a curious image for BioWare to have shared, especially when super-imposed by the iconic Paragon symbol:</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The flames of speculation have been further fanned by the post Kalaelizabeth was quoting.  BioWare project director and executive producer Michael Gamble recently commented on the series' long-held morality mechanic, acknowledging that although more players opted to be a Paragon - that is, a "good" Shepard - in the original trilogy, how you play is "meaningless" unless the ability to be "bad" also exists.</p>
<p>"Regarding Renegade and Paragon - yes, it’s true that more people played Paragon. But, it would have been meaningless if Renegade had not existed. The ability to choose is stronger than the number of people playing any option, IMO," Gamble tweeted (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mass-effect-5-paragon-renegade-options-return-not-confirmed/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>Does all of this mean Paragon/Renegade is "absolutely returning" for Mass Effect 5? Absolutely not. But it's arguably one of the best interpretations we've had yet as to why BioWare teased such an interesting image...</p>
<p>As for the eagerly-anticipated Mass Effect TV show? An adaptation was first touted back in 2021, when former BioWare lead writer Mac Walters explained various factors had contributed to the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-explains-why-the-mass-effect-movie-fell-by-the-wayside">shifting its initial vision of a movie adaptation toward something for the smaller screen</a>. Later that same year, reports surfaced claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-nearing-a-deal-for-mass-effect-tv-series">Amazon was "nearing a deal" for a Mass Effect TV series</a>, as part of its ongoing push into sci-fi and fantasy storytelling.</p><p>And now those reports have been confirmed. Variety revealed on the most recent N7 day - 7th November 2024 - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">a Mass Effect TV series is now officially in development at Amazon</a>, with 10 Cloverfield Lane and Fast &amp; Furious 9 (AKA F9: The Fast Saga) scribe Daniel Casey on writing and executive producer duties.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Remake and remaster culture continue to thrive. Countless other retro relics desperately need to be dug up and restored for a new generation, but our handpicked 2025 remakes are extra special, and would cause a big stir if announced—we can dream!</p>



<p>We’re in an era where wishes and dreams are closer to reality than ever. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-wants-last-final-fantasy-7-remake-to-be-out-within-3-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7</a> was a remake people clamored after for years, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/glen-schofield-dead-space-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Space</a> is the horror title of our generation, making its remake more special, and Link’s Awakening brought an age-old <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zelda</a> classic into the limelight. Each year we’re seeing a plethora of remakes and remasters, and more continue to be revealed.</p>



<p>Our fondest and deepest desires are happening. Games we used to love are becoming titles to love all over again. 2025 is shaping up to be another huge year in the annals of gaming, and certain remakes could etch it in history.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-remakes-we-want-to-see-in-2025">Best Remakes we Want to See in 2025</h2>



<p>These remakes can either be a sudden shadow drop, an announcement, or an end-of-year launch. As long as we get something relating to a release or announcement, this is a big W in our books. Please devs, make our dreams come true.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-simpsons-hit-amp-run">The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The one we all want. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Simpsons had every other type of game by 2003, so why not a GTA clone? Unlike the majority of Simpsons games, Hit &amp; Run was really good, dare I say exceptional. It did what few (if any) predecessors did and gave us a chance to explore Springfield in detail. Trademarks, catchphrases, collectibles, spying bee cameras, and pure comic violence synergized to create the perfect, coherent open-world Simpsons game. The world is crying out for a remake, so for crying out loud, if we can’t have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-didnt-we-get-the-simpsons-hit-run-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hit &amp; Run 2</a>, someone put down their Duff and do it!</p>



<h3 id="h-burnout-revenge">Burnout Revenge</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Nasty. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Criterion Games was scorching hot in the mid-2000s with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/burnout-revival-possibly-coming-from-stellar-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burnout</a> franchise. This is peak arcade racing—more so than NFS: Underground 2—and we didn’t know what we had until it was gone. Burnout 3: Takedown was the turning point for the series, but after finding its niche, Burnout Revenge injected the franchise with a more potent, high-octane dose of super speedy, car-crunching action. Revenge’s introduction of Traffic Checking was revolutionary, and everything is better here.</p>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Chris never stops. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Resident Evil 5 feels like the awkward middle child between the genre-defining excellence of Resident Evil 4, and the ambitious and awkward nature of Resident Evil 6. It’s lost in the shuffle, and it’s a shame because Resi 5 is low-key excellent. The African setting did well and truly mark the full-blown departure from the series’ roots, and this rubbed some fans the wrong way. But the overt killing of infected enemies, spectacular action, and evolved Resi gameplay carry on Resi 4’s good work. The best detail is, you can play the campaign in co-op with Chris and Sheva. The earlier games have gotten a new gloss of bloody paint, so it’s only right a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-resident-evil-5-getting-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 5 remake</a> is next.</p>



<h3 id="h-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-amp-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 &amp; 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I feel like a teenager all over again. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>2020’s Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 was a nostalgia ride as emotional as any. Kickflipping gaps, finding secret tapes, and seeing if it’s possible to break bones with the hardest bailouts imaginable—just me? Goldfinger’s Superman alone is enough to bring a tear to your eye, and I want this feeling again with a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake. I spent hours trying to beat my high score in Pro Skater’s 3 Airport level, and don’t get me started on Zoo. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk is teasing future Pro Skater games</a>, but it remains to be seen if they’re remakes for 2025, even later, or not at all.</p>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war">God of War</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What an intro. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Before Kratos calmed down (ish), grew a beard, and refused to give his son a name for a while, he was a vengeful, powerful Spartan with his own army. A last-second plea to Ares changes Kratos’ life forever, and 2005’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-series-redone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> explores the Ghost of Sparta’s haunting past. There are no third-person cameras or jumping bans here, this is the pinnacle of fully-fledged hack ‘n’ slash gameplay. After playing it recently, I can assure you it holds up; the use of puzzles and special abilities makes the OG GOW a well-rounded, must-play title—and it would look stunning if remade.</p>



<h3 id="h-bioshock">Bioshock</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Creepy. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Over 15 years on, and I still have nightmares of being served up as a Splicer’s side platter. Bioshock was a groundbreaking exercise in storytelling, horror, FPS innovation, and world-building. It ignores the conventions of generic, linear-pathed shooters and creates a whole universe to become immersed in—Rapture. Big Daddys, Little Sisters, an underwater city, shocking plot twists: It’s the brainchild of someone thinking seriously outside the box. That someone is Ken Levine, and his upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/judas-gameplay-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Judas</a> is a spiritual successor to Bioshock. Maybe it’s time to infuse ourselves with one final Plasmid.</p>

Unfortunately, 2025 isn’t shaping up to be the franchise’s biggest year. With no new movies on the docket and only one live-action series confirmed for release, the pickings are looking a little slim. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not to say there’s nothing exciting on the horizon. The release of Andor Season 2 alone is reason for Star Wars fans to celebrate like the Rebels dancing on Endor. Let’s take a closer look at what is coming in 2025, and the many Star Wars projects we hope to learn more about in the next 12 months.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Upcoming Star Wars Movie and TV Show</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Andor Returns for Season 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the big one. The Star Wars slate may be a little sparse in 2025, but it’s hard to complain too much when we’re getting a sequel to what is widely regarded as the best Star Wars project Disney has released so far. That’s right, Andor Season 2 is finally dropping in April 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 2 chronicles the second half of this deep, introspective origin story for Diego Luna’s Cassian Andor. If Season 1 was the story of how a young Cassian became radicalized and joined the fledgling Rebel Alliance, then Season 2 will show us the dangerous missions he undertook leading up to the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fittingly, with the series moving closer to the time period of Rogue One, we’ll see more familiar faces from that movie pop up in Season 2. Most notably, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-2025-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-k-2so-in-star-wars-andor-season-2-and-the-alien-earth-tv-show"><u>Alan Tudyk will reprise the role of K-2SO</u></a>, as we learn how Cassian first met this eccentric Imperial assassin droid. We’re also looking forward to seeing Ben Mendelsohn don his cape once more as Death Star project manager Director Orson Krennic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans can expect Season 2 to cover a lot of ground, with multiple time jumps unfolding over the course of the season and the final batch of episodes <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/tv/news/andor-season-2-final-three-episodes-cover-three-days-before-rogue-one-exclusive/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>set in the days leading up to Rogue One</u></a>. In other words, don’t expect a Season 3. But do expect a Star Wars story that continues to explore the ordinary men and women who lit the spark of rebellion in a time of great darkness. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">More Star Wars: Visions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">More Andor is great, but what about the animated side of things? With The Bad Batch wrapping up in 2024, the one Star Wars animated series confirmed to return in 2025 is Star Wars: Visions. Once again, fans will be treated to an anthology of animated shorts featuring various animation studios interpreting the mythology of Star Wars through their own, unique lens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 3 is said to bring Visions back to its roots as an anime anthology, whereas Season 2 took more of a global approach. The studios involved in Season 3 include Cyberpunk Edgerunners’ Studio Trigger and Attack on Titan’s WIT Studio, along with David Production, Kamikaze Douga, ANIMA, Kinema Citrus Co., Polygon Pictures, Production I.G, and Project Studio Q.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Will There Be More Star Wars TV?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">However much we’re looking forward to more of Star Wars: Andor and Star Wars: Visions, there’s no getting around the fact that 2025 is looking pretty thin on the Star Wars TV front compared to previous years. In 2024 alone we got two live-action shows in The Acolyte and Skeleton Crew and two animated series in The Bad Batch: Season 3 and Tales of the Empire. But in 2025, we only have one confirmed live-action series and one animated series, plus the final two episodes of Skeleton Crew.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is there a chance Disney has more shows planned we don’t know about? Possibly, at least on the animated front. Don’t forget that we only learned about the existence of Tales of the Empire a month before it dropped on Disney+ in May 2024. It’s entirely possible that they could pull the same trick again in 2025, announcing another “Tales of” anthology series to follow up Tales of the Empire and Tales of the Jedi.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the question of whether Disney has any long-form Star Wars animated projects in development right now. With The Bad Batch wrapping up last year, we have to imagine that Dave Filoni and others have been hard at work crafting the next great Star Wars animated saga. We probably won’t see that series release in 2025, but it’s possible we’ll at least get an announcement and maybe even see some early footage. That could be one of the big announcements at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-celebration-2025-will-take-place-in-japan"><u>Star Wars Celebration Japan in April</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But on the live-action front, don’t expect any big surprises in 2025. The Acolyte was officially canceled, and with The Mandalorian saga continuing on the big screen, we don’t even know if The Mandalorian: Season 4 is ever happening. That just leaves Ahsoka: Season 2, and that series isn’t returning until 2026 at least. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The End of the High Republic</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If things are looking a little barren on the live-action Star Wars front right now, the same certainly can’t be said for the publishing side of things. Fans of the Star Wars books and comics will be eating very well in 2025, particularly those following Lucasfilm Publishing’s High Republic saga. For the past several years, these books and comics have been exploring the triumphs and tribulations of the Jedi hundreds of years before the Star Wars movies, and it all comes to an end soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look for several major High Republic novels to be released in 2025, including Charles Soule’s The High Republic: Trials of the Jedi, Claudia Gray’s The High Republic: Into the Light, and Justina Ireland’s The High Republic: A Valiant Vow. Of these, Trials of the Jedi is the one most worth keeping an eye on, as it serves as the climax of the entire High Republic initiative. This novel will chronicle the final battle between the Jedi and the Nihil and the Nameless. Look for Trials of the Jedi to be released on June 17.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/20/star-wars-the-high-republic-phase-three-trials-of-the-jedi-v0-zp0zo36nupsa1-1734720411627.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Not to be outdone, Marvel Comics has quite an ambitious Star Wars lineup planned for 2025. In 2024, most of Marvel’s ongoing Star Wars comics were exploring the period between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Now that those books have ended, Marvel is casting a wider net and branching out to multiple Star Wars eras in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kicking things off, look for Marvel to wrap up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-star-wars-comics-battle-of-jakku-return-of-the-jedi"><u>the limited series Star Wars: The Battle of Jakku</u></a> in January. This series has been busy fleshing out the final major battle between the dying Empire and the New Republic two years after Return of the Jedi, and we’ll see the climax unfold in writer Alex Segura and artist Jethro Morales and Leonard Kirk’s The Battle of Jakku: Last Stand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From there, Marvel is veering in two wildly different directions with its newest ongoing Star Wars comics. First, writer Marc Guggenheim and artist Madibek Musabekov are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-comics-star-wars-jedi-knights-series-phantom-menace-nycc-2024"><u>heading to the Prequel era in Star Wars: Jedi Knights</u></a>. Set before the events of The Phantom Menace, the series will follow numerous members of the Jedi Order, including Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Mace Windu, and Shaak Ti. The series even focuses on Count Dooku before his defection from the Jedi Order.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Star Wars: Legacy of Vader - Preview Art Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Marvel is venturing deep into the era of the Sequel Trilogy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-reveals-star-wars-legacy-of-vader-series-starring-kylo-ren"><u>Charles Soule and Luke Ross’ Star Wars: Legacy of Vader</u></a>. Set in between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, the series explores Kylo Ren’s struggle as the newly crowned Supreme Leader of the First Order and his quest to recommit himself to the Dark Side following his battles with Rey and Luke Skywalker. Soule previously fleshed out Ben Solo’s Dark Side origins in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-true-origin-of-kylo-ren-and-his-crossgaurd-lightsaber-revealed">2020’s Star Wars: The Rise of Kylo Ren</a>, so consider this a sequel of sorts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have to assume these aren’t the only new Star Wars comics Marvel will be launching in 2025, as the publisher has tended to publish four or five ongoing titles at any given time. Will Doctor Aphra get another solo series? Will we see other books fleshing out the blank canvas that is the post-Return of the Jedi era? Only time will tell on that front. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Future of Star Wars Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If 2025 is shaping up to be a relatively quiet year on the movie and TV front, it’s not looking any better in terms of video game releases. In fact, there are no Star Wars games confirmed for release in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">About all fans have to look forward to at the moment is new DLC for Star Wars Outlaws. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-season-pass-roadmap-revealed-along-with-two-story-packs"><u>According to Ubisoft’s DLC roadmap</u></a>, fans can expect a new story campaign called “A Pirate’s Fortune” to release in Spring 2025. This campaign focuses on fan-favorite pirate villain (or perhaps he’s more of an anti-hero) Hondo Ohnaka as he bumps into Kay Vess.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has yet to reveal what, if any, new Outlaws content is planned beyond “A Pirate’s Fortune.” Are there even more adventures planned for Kay and her motley crew, or do the lukewarm sales numbers spell doom for Outlaws’ ongoing future? We’ll have to wait for future announcements to learn more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, all we can do is hope that 2025 brings with it news about other upcoming Star Wars games. We know EA is developing a third game in the Star Wars Jedi series. But with there being four years between the release of 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and 2023’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, it’s probably too much to hope the new game will actually release in 2025. At best, we might see early footage of the game and get a better idea of when in the Star Wars timeline it takes place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re also crossing our fingers for news on the oft-delayed remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch confirmed in 2024 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well"><u>the game is still in active development</u></a>, despite rumors to the contrary. But what state is the game in right now, and when will we see footage of the remake in action? Hopefully, 2025 brings with it some good news on the KOTOR front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s not forget Quantic Dream’s Star Wars: Eclipse, another title that was announced and then seemingly vanished off the face of the Earth. Will 2025 be the year Eclipse finally rears its head again, or will it go the way of so many other canceled Star Wars projects?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What About the Star Wars Movies? </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 won’t deliver any new Star Wars theatrical releases, which at this point is nothing new. On the theatrical side, the franchise has been dormant since the release of The Rise of Skywalker back in 2019. But that’s not to say Lucasfilm hasn’t announced plenty of new Star Wars movies in recent years. It’s worth looking at what’s currently in the pipeline and how likely we are to get an update in 2025.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">First, there’s the lone Star Wars movie that’s actually in production right now, The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. This big-screen spinoff of The Mandalorian continues the shared story of the two heroes after the events of The Mandalorian: Season 3. Co-creator Jon Favreau is directing the film, which is currently slated for release on May 22, 2026. With any luck, we should see a teaser trailer for the film at some point in 2025, possibly as early as Star Wars Celebration Japan.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dave Filoni’s Mando-Verse Movie</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Not to be outdone, Favreau’s partner Dave Filoni is directing his own live-action movie, one expected to tie together characters and threads from The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, and other projects from that era. Don’t expect much news on this movie in the foreseeable future, however, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ahsoka-season-2-is-officially-in-development">Filoni has to focus on Ahsoka: Season 2 first</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">James Mangold’s Star Wars Movie</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Logan director James Mangold is helming a movie set in the distant past of the Star Wars universe, revealing the origins of the Jedi Order and reportedly featuring a “Biblical” scope. Lucasfilm may announce a writer for the movie in 2025, but don’t expect more updates than that. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy's New Jedi Order Movie</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Daisy Ridley is reprising the role of Rey Skywalker in a new movie set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker. Ms. Marvel’s Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is directing. Hopefully, we’ll see some updates about the film in 2025, but it’s unclear where in the pipeline it currently falls.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Simon Kinberg’s Star Wars Trilogy</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">X-Men producer Simon Kinberg has been tapped to oversee a new trilogy of Star Wars movies. Despite early rumors the trilogy will directly continue the Skywalker Saga, IGN was able to confirm <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-star-wars-trilogy-in-the-works-from-x-men-producer-simon-kinberg"><u>it’s instead meant to focus on a new storyline</u></a>. It’s still early days on this project, so we’re not expecting to hear much about Kinberg’s trilogy in 2025.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Taika Waititi’s Star Wars Movie</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Thor: Ragnarok’s Taika Waititi is apparently still set to venture into the Star Wars universe, though it’s been years since we’ve gotten any substantive updates on this mysterious project. Will that finally change in 2025? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s what you can expect from the Star Wars franchise in 2025. It’s a relatively quiet year, but there are still some very cool projects for fans to look forward to in the new year. What Star Wars story are you most excited to experience in 2025?

            <p>Markus "Notch" Persson has "basically announced" Minecraft 2.</p>
<p>In an X exchange over the New Year, Persson invited his millions of followers to indicate which project they'd like him to focus on in 2025 - a traditional roguelike mixed with a "tile-based first-person dungeon crawler" or a "spiritual successor" to Minecraft.</p>

<p>In the post asking for "honest and legitimate [...] feedback for once", Persson explained briefly what his dungeon crawler would entail, but then admitted, "but then I gots to thinking that maybe there are people who like my work but might not share my taste in retro nostalgia and would prefer for me to make a spiritual successor thing to Minecraft, and I mean sure, I'd take that cash".</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Honest and legitimate request for feedback for once:</p><p>The new game I'm passionately working on is currently set to be a traditional roguelike (i.e. ADOM, nethack, etc) mixed with a tile based first person dungeon crawler (ie Legend of Grimrock (esp 2), Eye of the Beholder)</p><p>But…</p></div>— notch (@notch) <a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>At the time of writing, almost a quarter of a million of his followers have left a vote, 78 percent of which have, perhaps unsurprisingly, been in favour of a new Minecraft game, even though he'd asked people to "[please] vote potion. You can do this Zoomers, it's actually super cosy.</p>
<p>"Kinda feels like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, but more diagonal door kicking," Notch added.</p> <div>

<p>A few days later, responding to commenters who missed his original posting, Persson summarised what had happened, saying: "I basically announced Minecraft 2. I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.</p>
<p>"I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it.</p><p>"My intentions are to be clear and honest about it, saying that spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic," he added. "The things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for.</p>
<p>"I intend for the money to the [sic] spent for good, but my God, have I learned I fail a lot. Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed."</p>
<p>Persson <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874532193227473093">added</a> that he had no non-compete clause in the sale of Minecraft to Microsoft - "there was a one-year period where I couldn't make a game with modifiable terrain or something like that, but I was off in the Maldives during all that, didn't affect any creative decisions" - but did acknowledge that using the Minecraft name "would be super illegal".</p>
<p>"Instead, I'd make a new original game of the same type as Minecraft and call it something else," he <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874523772734390380">said</a>. "These are traditionally sometimes referred to as 'spiritual successors', but usually kinda mostly feel a bit flat.</p>
<p>"But, like, if that's actually what people want, I would LOVE to make that game. It'd be my Gremlins 2."</p>
<p>Persson also said that as "a man of [his] word", he intended "to do this in a way that in no way tried to sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about".</p>
<p>"And I respect them for doing that. It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me," he added.</p>
<p>It's been a busy time for Minecraft. At the end of last year, the game finally received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-years-after-ps5s-launch-minecraft-finally-gets-a-native-version">PlayStation 5 native version</a>, announced it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ditching-psvr-support-minecraft-is-officially-abandoning-vr-on-pc-from-next-year">ditch PC VR support</a>, and confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-attractions-set-to-open-in-uk-and-us-as-85m-deal-with-alton-towers-owner-signed">plans to launch Minecraft theme park areas in the US and UK</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The first few days of a year are always a bit sleepy in the game’s industry. It takes a little while for those press releases to start rolling in, for the announcements and trailers to drop, and developers and publishers alike are wary of launching too soon after everyone’s Christmas spending. So, it’s a quiet week for this round-up, but here’s what’s happened.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>Naturally, there hasn’t been all that much news in the past few weeks, so here’s the sum total of our reporting:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Game of the Year 2024</h2>
<p>We ran our Game of the Year awards around Christmas, as we always do, building up to our GOTY reveal on New Years Eve. Astro Bot and Metaphor: ReFantazio were both very heavily featured, but which took home the overall award?</p>

<p>So… that’s just about it for this weekend. Things will no doubt pick up next week, not least because of CES bringing some GPU announcements from Nvidia and AMD. We’ll see you then!</p>

But slow news hardly means no news, and we kicked off the new year with a look at the games to keep an eye out for this month. Also, the chief creative officer at Arrowhead, the studio behind <em>Helldivers 2</em>, chimed in on “DEI” in games in an online exchange, the devs of <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>hinted at why last year’s blockbuster has yet to arrive on Xbox, and the folks behind a stunning fan remake of <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </em>using the <em>Skyrim </em>engine announced that we can expect that massive project to release this year. Read on for these and more stories. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9001c1b94dfd9716f187596c1cb4a1ea" data-recommend-id="image://9001c1b94dfd9716f187596c1cb4a1ea" data-format="png" data-width="1261" data-height="710" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Donkey Kong, a cyborg, and a mystical warrior pre-order some games.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> co-founder Andrew Gavin has opened up about why the studio was acquired by Sony back in 2001.</p>
<p>In a lengthy post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-gavin-441765_why-did-we-sell-naughty-dog-its-a-question-activity-7277011334121058305-JZKz/">LinkedIn</a>, Gavin cited the spiralling costs of game development as one of the reasons the studio was sold, saying "a systemic issue in the AAA space" wherein developers "almost never have the resources to fund their own games [...] gives publishers enormous leverage".</p>

<p>"Why did we sell Naughty Dog? It's a question I've been asked countless times. The answer is simple: budgets were skyrocketing," Gavin - who worked at Naughty Dog for almost 20 years before leaving in 2004 - said (via <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/522635/article/naughty-dog-co-founder-reveals-why-they-were-acquired-by-sony/">Gameranx</a>).</p><p>"When we started Naughty Dog in the 1980s, game development expenses were manageable. We bootstrapped everything, pouring profits from one game into the next. Our early 80s games cost less than $50,000 each to make. Rings of Power ('88-91), saw budgets rise to about $100,000, but yielded slightly more than that in after tax profits in 1992.</p>
<p>"In 1993, we rolled that $100k from Rings into a self-funded Way of the Warrior. But Crash Bandicoot ('94-96) cost $1.6 million to make. By the time we got to Jak and Daxter ('99-01), the budget busted the $15 million mark.</p>
<p>"By 2004, the cost of AAA games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jak-3">Jak 3</a> had soared to $45-50 million - and they have been rising ever since," Gavin added. "But back in 2000, we were still self-funding every project, and the stress of financing these ballooning budgets independently was enormous.</p>
<p>"It wasn't just us. This was (and still is) a systemic issue in the AAA space. Developers almost never have the resources to fund their own games, which gives publishers enormous leverage. Selling to Sony wasn't just about securing a financial future for Naughty Dog. It was about giving the studio the resources to keep making the best games possible, without being crushed by the weight of skyrocketing costs and the paralysing fear that one slip would ruin it all.</p>
<p>"Looking back, it was the right call."</p>
<p>Gavin ended by admitting that "AAA games have only gotten more expensive since then", citing costs for today's big-budget games "easily" top "$300, $400, or even $500 million".</p>
<p>"Would we have been able to keep up? Maybe. But selling - to the right party - gave Naughty Dog the stability it needed to thrive and to continue making the kinds of games we'd always dreamed of!"</p>
<p>Several months after studio lead Neil Druckmann confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog had a number of games in the works</a>, the team has lifted the lid on its next, all-new title: Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for PS5.</p>
<p>"Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," teases the blurb.</p>
<p>"Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit," reads the game's official blurb."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
