			<p>Publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-preview-and-qa-11-bit-studios-adds-branching-narrative-layers-to-base-building-survival-genre/">11 Bit Studios</a> and developer Digital Sun have announced that a sequel to Moonlight will be released next year. The sequel is called Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault and will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2350790/Moonlighter_2_The_Endless_Vault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>. Moonlighter was an incredibly successful indie game with tons of replayability. In this game, you'll get to step back into the shoes of merchant Will, in this roguelike action title, where you get to see adventure and shopkeeping combine to make a fun adventure. Just like in Moonlighter, you have to go on a long and arduous journey that takes you through vibrant landscapes as you try to uncover mysterious relics. Of course, there will be tons of enemies along the way, traps, and challenges that are set to make your journey more challenging than it already is. Luckily, you'll have an arsenal of weapons, including your iconic backpack from the first game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0v6DAShxqIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When you make it back from your journey, you'll be back at your cozy shop, which also serves as your home and hub, allowing you to turn the goodies you discovered into profit. You can haggle for the best prices, assist customers and make sure to keep your store looking spic and span while adding decorations and perks and dealing with the mess. Of course, you will also be able to utilize your profit to upgrade your gear, as well as upgrade your store to get the most benefits from it.</p>
<p>"The original Moonlighter was a pivotal moment for us, marking the growth of Digital sun as a team. Five years on, Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault showcases everything we've learned along the way. We're channeling all our craftsmanship into creating a game that's not just better, but brimming with even more charm in every detail," says Digital Sun CEO Javier Gimenez.</p>
<p>If this game sounds like something you're looking forward to, make sure to check out the trailer above. It showcases some of the reminiscent details from the original game while setting the scene of Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault.</p>
<p>There are many great features to look forward to in the upcoming release of Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, including a brilliant soundtrack made by Chris Larkin, who also made the iconic soundtrack for Hollow Knight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-publishing-partnership-for-cinematic-ttrpg-outgunned<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The award-winning TTRPG <em>Outgunned</em> will be getting a retail release. The successfully crowdfunded cinematic RPG's developer Two Little Mice and Free League Publishing have officially announced a publishing partnership, bringing the game to store shelves worldwide.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>Outgunned</em> will be published under Free League Workshop. This is the sub-label for games not internally developed by Free League.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outgunned-plane-escape-artwork.jpg?itok=jB9NA5qn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outgunned-plane-escape-artwork.jpg?itok=jZKpzRTi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This publication will include the <em>Outgunned</em> core rulebook, its two expansions <em>Action Flicks </em>and <em>World of Killers</em>, the mini-campaign Project Medusa, and the game's Director Screen.</p>

<p>It features a unique RPG system called Director's Cut. It revolves around players using small pools of six-sided dice to determine the outcome of their players' actions. But instead of rolling high or rolling low, the goal is to roll doubles, triples, or even quadruples.</p>

<p>This simple gameplay is to facilitate <em>Outgunned's</em> cinematic action movie gameplay. The TTRPG is inspired by classic action and heist movies like <em>Die Hard</em> or <em>Mission Impossible</em>. The players are the Heroes struggling against the machinations of a Villain to save the day. But, as the title implies, the Heroes are outnumbered and outgunned.</p>

It was fully funded within five minutes of going live and ended with its stretch goals fulfilled. It went on to win two silver ENNIEs in 2024's "Best Game" and "Product of the Year" categories.</p>

<p>This puts <em>Outgunned</em> alongside other award-winning projects by Two Little Mice such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-games-announces-household-ttrpg-coming-to-west" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Household</em></a> and <em>Broken Compass</em>.</p>

<p>Free League's body of work contains similarly acclaimed work. Alongside the meticulously authentic Middle-earth TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/one-ring-rpg-second-edition-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The One Ring</em></a>, they have released the Swedish fantasy TTRPG <em>Dragonbane</em> and an RPG adaptation of the sci-fi book, <em>The Electric State</em>.</p>

<p><em>Outgunned</em> and its associated expansions and products are available for purchase now on Free League's webstore. If you are attending PAX Unplugged this year, the TTRPG will be featured at Free League's booth.</p>

            <p>Ah, it feels just like yesterday when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-2-still-has-around-a-year-of-development-left-likely-coming-in-2025">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a> had<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-2-still-has-around-a-year-of-development-left-likely-coming-in-2025"> around a year of development time left</a>. Actually, I’d say it feels like it precisely around February 2nd of this year. Well, would you look at that. It seems making excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s isn’t Jump Over The Age’s only skill. They’ve also predicted the exact release of their game to within a 3 day margin of error: the actual release date is the 31st of January, 2025.</p>

<p>As just revealed at the Percy Coswald Gamer show, the sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> will be here next January, narrowed down from its previous ‘2025’ release date. There’s been a fair few sleeper-heads here at RPS, including Katharine (RPS in Peace), who couldn’t contain her excitement on learning <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-2-is-real-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">the sequel was real</a>.</p>
<p>Brendan spoke to Jump Over The Age’s Gareth Damian Martin recently, too, about a variety of subjects including the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-you-guess-which-australian-tv-sci-fi-of-the-early-2000s-inspired-citizen-sleeper-2">early 2000’s Australian TV sci-fi show that inspired it</a>. There’s also some fun crunchy design talk in there.</p>
<blockquote><p>"When you make games you have to accept that you are inherently quantifying absolutely everything," says Martin, "because a game is just a load of numbers. And so even if the player can't see those numbers, they definitely exist.</p>
<p>"It's fun to push and pull at that, and have the player... maybe sometimes feel uncomfortable, if they're telling their favourite character what to do. I love the idea of that kind of narrative gameplay infecting the mechanical gameplay."</p></blockquote>
<p>You can currently grab the first Citizen Sleeper with a bunch of other games as part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-grab-shadows-of-doubt-citizen-sleeper-and-more-in-jingle-jams-2024-bundle-and-support-eight-worthy-causes">Jingle Jam 2024</a> bundle.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>And here's a little blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Explore the vast expanses of space in a custom-built starship. Gather vital resources from diverse planets throughout the universe to craft housing, production, communication, and other essential structures. Join forces with other players to form powerful trade organizations to take on challenging missions and shape a constantly evolving economy."</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read more on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276050/SpaceCraft/">Steam page</a>, which digs a little into the detail of mechanics like faster-than-light travel, automation and fleet combat. The game's coming to early access in 2025.</p>
<p>Shiro are best known for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/northgard-review">"superb RTS"</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/northgard">Northgard</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-spice-wars-review">"compulsive 4X"</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-spice-wars">Dune: Spice Wars</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wartales-review">"grimy medieval fantasy RPG</a>" Wartales, all games I would hesitantly summarise as "teetering on the edge of serious greatness". Breaking into MMO territory feels like a real gamble for them, but then again, when is making an MMO not a gamble?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tactical Mutant Ninja Turtles? Turn-based Mutant Ninja Tactics? I'm undecided, but its actual name is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, so maybe I should just call it that. It's just been announced and it's coming to PC next year.

<p>I'm extremely onboard with this for two reasons. One, it's a turn-based tactics game, and I always have a baseline of interest in them. Two, its battles apparently take just minutes to complete. It all looks a little bit Hoplite, at least in my head, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-hoplite">that was a truly wonderful turn-based roguelike</a> with similarly bite-sized skirmishes. In Tactical Takedown, the missions are strung together in mini-campaigns, each one focused on a different Turtle with their own unique abilities.
</p>
<p>I suppose the third reason I'm intrigued is that I was mad into Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles, as the cartoon was called in the UK, when I was a kid. I had the figurines where their half-shells could open up and you could store their ninja stars (hero stars?) inside. Also that animated film last year, Mutant Mayhem, was pretty great.
</p><p>There have been a bunch of Turtles games recently, including the revival of the beat 'em ups with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</a>, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate, a sorta action RPG roguelike that came out last month, which I have installed but not yet played.
</p>
<p>Here's a fourth and final reason you might be interested in Tactical Takedown: it's being developed by Strange Scaffold, the folks behind recent indine hits <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/i-am-your-beast">I Am Your Beast</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clickolding">Clickolding</a>. It's an unexpected matchup, and for now there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/">more screenshots on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At first-glance it might feel indistinguishable from miHoYo’s <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> and the recent influx of other anime-styled, big-budget gacha RPGs, but even if it looks like just “another one of those,” it looks like a damn good one. </p><p>In-between running down <em>X-Files</em>-like supernatural occurrences and fighting monsters, there’s aerial platforming, street races, and tons of mini-games. The game’s developers at NetEase and Naked Rain are promising a combination of kung-fu movie action and everyday city socializing. Today’s trailer also kicks off <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.anantagame.com/501/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.anantagame.com/501/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-registration</a></span> for the game, which I’m guessing will have a couple of closed and open betas between now and release. <br></p><p>Ultimately, however, it won’t matter how good <em>Ananta</em> looks and feels if its neat world and cool designs are in service of an all-consuming gacha grind, which seems to be the way of all big free-to-play blockbuster RPGs at the moment. <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, which seems very similar in a lot of ways, is a good game as long as you don’t mind constantly auto-battling through hordes of enemies to fill up all the meters you need in order to actually engage with its progression. </p><p>We’ll find out where in the grind vs. microtransaction RNG spectrum <em>Ananta</em> falls when it finally arrives, which hopefully will be fairly soon. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players already got a chance to take the tank for a spin last month during a trial period, but this season will properly add the spike-wielding hero to the roster.

The customizable mythic skin this season will be Reinhardt’s, and it’s a reference to Thor, the Norse god of thunder.

            <p>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap now has a release date across PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>The new entry in the popular orc battling tower defence series will launch on 23rd January 2025 across Steam, Epic Games Store, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap brings a rogue-lite progression system and new heroes with unique abilities and traps with which to beat waves of enemies.</p>
<p>Players can utilise randomised buffs, the environment, and the weather too, fighting orcs, skeletons and more either solo or with up to four players in co-op.</p>
<p>The Orcs Must Die! series has proven particularly popular since the release of the first game back in 2011.</p>
<p>Since then it's spawned a number of sequels, resulting in Deathtrap bringing four-player co-op for the first time.</p>
<p>"With Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, we embraced the challenge of innovating within a thirteen-year-old franchise by listening closely to our fans and their requests," said Patrick Hudson, co-founder and CEO of developer Robot Entertainment.</p>
<p>"We've stayed true to the classic chaotic action and light-hearted tone, while introducing four-player co-op, new and versatile heroes with deeply unique abilities, expanded level variety, and new roguelite progression choices."</p>

<p>The first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>, released in 2022, won multiple awards and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-the-bafta-nominated-citizen-sleeper-is-a-game-about-now">nominated for four BAFTAs</a> including British Game and Game for Impact. It's a phenomenal tabletop-inspired game, exploring political themes with evocative writing and a beautiful electronic score.</p>
<p>The sequel, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-officially-unveiled">announced in June 2023</a>, will stick to a similar template to the first as it follows a new Sleeper android protagonist out in the stars and uses the same dice-throwing mechanics.</p>
<p>Creator Gareth Damian Martin stated the central theme was "crisis", with the pandemic and invasion of Ukraine being influential.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Katharine Castle went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-goes-even-harder-on-its-rpg-roots-with-its-bold-new-twists-on-its-tabletop-dice-rolls">hands-on with Citizen Sleeper 2</a> earlier this year. "There may be a different set of machines powering this ambitious RPG, but deep down, it still has the same gooey, human heart we know and love," she wrote.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dealing with perpetually unsatisfied, stunningly entitled hordes of chittering monsters and the occasional visit from a lumbering oaf of a boss can be tough work. But enough about working in retail - dungeon crawling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> sell’em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> is getting a sequel! <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> 2: The Endless Vault looks to be just what you want from a follow-up. Created once again by Digital Sun, whose recent works include the excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cataclismo">Cataclismo</a>, it’s prettier and vaster, with expanded merchanting and deeper dungeoneering. It's out sometime in 2025.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This time around, white-haired hero Will and his companions are “stranded in a mysterious dimension in the village of Tresna”. Will simply cannot wait to get back to more retail work, and soon discovers “a tantalizing opportunity to return home, thanks to a curious relic collector”. If horror stories of antiquity have taught me anything, it’s to immediately purchase any curious relics you find. Bonus points if its mysterious power only grows in tandem with your own hubris. Sounds fun! Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Revive Tresna’s Splendor:</strong> Invest in the village’s development by supporting local businesses, upgrading gear, and unlocking new opportunities. As Tresna flourishes, so will your shop’s fortunes.</p>
<p><strong>Loot Like a Legend:</strong> Prepare your gear, restrain your nerves, and delve into treacherous vaults filled with unimaginable treasures. But beware: the deeper you go, the higher the stakes—and the greater the risks.</p>
<p><strong>Master the Art of Shopkeeping:</strong> Transform your hard-earned loot into profits by charming customers and haggling like a pro. Customize your shop with dazzling decorations to draw even more eager buyers.</p></blockquote>
<p>“It definitely needs more variety earlier on, but when Moonlighter gets going, it's tremendously compelling,” is wot John (RPS in peace) thunk <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/moonlighter-review">of the original back</a> in 2018. “It's very charming, very beautiful, and both its comprising halves are enjoyable in their own ways.”</p>
